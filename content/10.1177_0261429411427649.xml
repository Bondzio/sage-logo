<body>
<p>One spring, seven years ago, I enrolled in my district’s Leaders in Technology Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261429411427649">St. John et al., 2004</xref>). The course content was compelling; I read ‘Digital natives, digital immigrants’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261429411427649">Prensky, 2001</xref>); and we examined digital citizenship, media literacy, and the digital divide. I was introduced to the earlier version of the International Society for Technology in Education’s <italic>National Educational Technology Standards</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261429411427649">ISTE, 2010</xref>) and I learned about the challenges of implementing new technologies to improve student learning. My vision of teaching shifted, and I have since been immersed in finding ways to be a twenty-first century teacher for twenty-first century students.</p>
<p>Presently, my students are sixth graders in a self-contained elementary school program for highly gifted students. I have discovered that documentary production engages and motivates my students to learn content and to develop twenty-first-century skills. Documentary production, a non-fiction form of multimedia storytelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429411427649">Bernard, 2007</xref>), has been an ideal classroom project experience. Historical documentaries work well within a busy classroom because students can conduct their research and create their documentary using excellent online and local library resources to gather archival images and media.</p>
<p>In their book <italic>Reinventing Project-based Learning</italic>: <italic>your Field Guide to Real-world Projects in the Digital Age,</italic> Suzie Boss and Jane Krauss state, ‘technology is not the project, but how the project gets done’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261429411427649">Boss and Krauss, 2007</xref>). This is true for documentary production. In the process I describe, students learn the technology as they need it for their academic purpose. Historical inquiry and solid research writing are still the most important part of the documentary production.</p>
<p>To design the learning experience and provide structure for my students, I use the ‘backwards design’ process described in Wiggins and McTighe’s <italic>Understanding by Design</italic> (2006); this process helps students develop ‘enduring understandings’ by finding answers to ‘essential questions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261429411427649">Wiggins and McTighe, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This year, my students’ documentaries are guided by the 2011 National History Day theme: <italic>Diplomacy and Debate in History: Successes, Failures, and Consequences</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261429411427649">NHD, 2010</xref>). The documentary project is designed to have students develop the enduring understanding of ‘diplomacy and debate can sway the course of human history’ and students will also answer the essential question of ‘What are the historical consequences of diplomacy and debate?’</p>
<p>Designing the historical documentary project around a central essential understanding and essential question has helped me support and direct student learning. Each documentary team is also assigned ‘content questions’ (Wiggins and McTighe, 2006) that will guide the documentary production and provide the framework for historical inquiry and non-fiction story telling. The final documentary project will be assessed on the documentary’s success with using an engaging story to help audiences become interested in and learn more about the topic.</p>
<p>The documentary project is unique because it requires students to learn and teach others while using technological tools. The Partnership for 21st Century Skills ‘Framework for 21st Century Learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261429411427649">Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2010</xref>) and the 2007 National Educational Technology Standards for Students, NETS*S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261429411427649">ISTE, 2010</xref>) describe in detail the competencies our students need to develop to be literate in their global and technological world. These competencies can be embedded when teaching students to produce documentaries. Collaboration, communication, critical thinking, and craftsmanship are developed during documentary production.</p>
<p>Establishing team collaboration, face to face and online, is the first priority. The documentary project is too large for one person to accomplish, so there is an authentic need for students to find ways to achieve their goals together. I allow time for students to complete the bulk of their project during class time. Students first search for personal interests within the documentary theme; then, teachers help students find peers with similar interests and compatible work habits. I prefer having students work in groups of three. I teach students about Bruce Tuckman’s team stages: forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261429411427649">MindTools.com, 2010</xref>). My students see themselves in these stages, and understanding that ‘storming’ is normal helps the project progress.</p>
<p>Once teams are formed, they set up a team paperwork management system (a tub for papers and books) and they establish online collaboration using Google Docs (Google, n.d.). Google Docs allow teams of students to simultaneously or asynchronously edit a single document. This works well for research, citing sources, and script writing. Most importantly, student online documents are shared with me. I can comment on, edit, and monitor student work. I make comments about website credibility and monitor and teach digital citizenship. Students learn the difference between academic online collaboration and personal social networking.</p>
<p>Communication skills such as writing, speaking, and presenting have increased stakes for students creating a documentary. Students become motivated to communicate precisely when they know their writing is being read by multiple peers. They strive for a best product because their work will be shown to audiences outside of the classroom. During the time teams work together, there are rich discussions and debates about each detail of the production, and students initiate revisions spontaneously.</p>
<p>Documentary production hones critical thinking skills. Students must analyze a variety of documentaries to understand the various components. They apply their analysis by writing a script that has a length defined by words spoken per minute (approximately 180). Next, students then use their script as an outline for an image and video storyboard. Students think critically to evaluate whether a research resource is credible, primary, secondary, or tertiary; and they think critically and collaboratively when they discuss the merits of possible images to include in their documentary. Students develop an enhanced sense of digital citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261429411427649">ISTE, 2010</xref>) as they engage in purposeful discussions about media copyright (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261429411427649">Creative Commons, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>After completing the process of researching their topic, writing a script, and recording the audio, and creating the first draft of their documentary, students engage in a critique and revision process. Students show their documentary to an audience that includes peers and knowledgeable adults and receive feedback to help guide them in their final revisions. My students use the critique guidelines described by Ron Berger in <italic>An Ethic of Excellence: Building a Culture of Craftsmanship with Students</italic> (2003).</p>
<p>My students complete most of their research and writing at school. Motivated students often do a lot of extra research and writing from home. They use their collaborative Google Docs to access their information from different locations. The documentary production, the actual construction of their media project, is done completely at school. I have been able to do this with a 3:1 student to computer ratio. The key, at least in the elementary classroom setting, is to always have specific computers dedicated to specific teams. The computers should be permanently located in the classroom to allow for flexibility in production times. This year, our school has purchased a one-to-one laptop lab. The lab must be shared with other classes. I do not recommend this as it makes the workflow less efficient and substantially reduces flexibility. My students also use 8 GB USB storage devices to make their media portable as needed.</p>
<p>Software choices for documentary production vary by operating system. Our school district uses Mac OS X and our computers are loaded with iLife 09, an integrated software suite that includes iMovie, iPhoto, iTunes, and GarageBand. Fortunately, my students have access to Apple’s older movie-making software, iMovie HD; the iMovie HD software allows students to record their entire script into a GarageBand podcast. Students can then import the entire audio to iMovie HD. This allows for a script-driven documentary. I do not recommend iMovie 09 because images must be imported first in order for the audio to appear at full length. Creating a script-driven documentary showcases the importance of the research, writing, and storytelling process. I suggest finding software that allows audio to be added first.</p>
<p>Producing documentaries is a technology integration project that is best learned through experience. Both teachers and students will need assistance as they encounter technology glitches and other production challenges. Facilitating documentary production requires teachers to help each team with their unique issues. This is an opportunity for teachers to model technological problem-solving skills and patience. For my highly gifted students, documentary production provides a challenging learning experience that creates a need for them to ask questions and get help from others. The instructional cycle in my class includes some whole-group instruction with the majority of my instruction done assisting individual students or teams.</p>
<p>When the documentaries are complete, classes can set up their own film festival, and there are ever-increasing venues for online multimedia contests. Students in my class create documentaries that meet the National History Day contest documentary guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261429411427649">
<italic>Making History</italic>, 2006</xref>); however, I downplay the competition. Emphasizing a high-stakes competition can reduce sharing and collaboration, which are two of my main instructional objectives for this project. The National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC)’s position statement on cooperative learning echoes the collaboration called for in the twenty-first century. NAGC supports<disp-quote>
<p>group interdependence built around common goals, a focus on social skills or group dynamics, and individual accountability for material learned. Cooperative learning experiences can provide valuable opportunities to share ideas, practice critical thinking, and gain social skills.</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261429411427649">NAGC, 1996</xref>)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>When you get started with documentaries in any classroom, emphasize the collaboration and minimize the competition; you will have an entire class of winners.</p>
