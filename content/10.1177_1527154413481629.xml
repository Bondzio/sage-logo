<abstract>
<p>The director of nursing (DON) is an essential member of the top management team in nursing homes and in a key position to improve the quality and value of care. This article describes and examines the roles and responsibilities of DONs as perceived by a convenience sample of current/previous DONs and nursing home administrators (<italic>n</italic> = 29). Data were collected through in-depth semistructured interviews and analyzed using content analysis and thematic analysis. The findings reveal a broad scope and wide variation in the DON position across settings, with inextricable linkages between clinical care and other aspects of care delivery, such as managing fiscal and human resources (HR). As RN licensure is the only Federal requirement for the DON position, suggesting a clinical focus, the findings highlight a policy-practice gap. Research is needed to address this gap, focusing on the requisite preparation DONs need to effectively and cost-efficiently lead initiatives for quality improvement.</p>

<p>Approximately 1.45 million persons 65 years and older live in nursing homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1527154413481629">Spillman &amp; Black, 2006</xref>), and nursing home use is projected to reach anywhere from 1.9 to 3 million by 2030 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1527154413481629">Redfoot &amp; Pandya, 2002</xref>). Reports of substandard quality are ongoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1527154413481629">Office of Inspector General, 2008</xref>), and gaps persist in the most basic nursing services, such as skin care, pain management, and nutrition/hydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527154413481629">Decker, Culp, &amp; Cacchione, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527154413481629">Gruneir, 2008</xref> &amp; Mor; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527154413481629">Kayser-Jones, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1527154413481629">Simmons et al, 2008</xref>). Workforce stability is a recurrent challenge, with national job turnover rates averaging 39% across nursing positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527154413481629">American Health Care Association, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The director of nursing (DON) is an essential member of the top management team in nursing homes and in a key position to improve the quality and value of care delivery practices. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has repeatedly emphasized the critical role of the DON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1527154413481629">Wunderlich &amp; Kohler, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1527154413481629">Wunderlich, Sloan, &amp; Davis, 1996</xref>), with one report stating “. . .strong leadership from the [DON] is a prerequisite for provision of high-quality and cost-effective care” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1527154413481629">Wunderlich et al., 1996</xref>, p. 159). Notwithstanding recognition of the DON’s critical role, there has been little focused attention to this position across research and policy arenas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1527154413481629">Siegel, Mueller, Anderson, &amp; Dellefield, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1527154413481629">
<title>Regulatory and Professional Guidelines for the DON Role</title>
<p>Federal standards for the DON position are minimal: registered nurse (RN) licensure is the only requirement for this position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527154413481629">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2011a</xref>) and membership on the quality assessment and assurance committee is the only explicit DON responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527154413481629">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2011b</xref>). State regulations for DON qualifications vary. Representatives from the nursing home industry and professional organizations have outlined nursing administration and DON positions, reflecting complex scopes of practice spanning clinical, administrative, management, and leadership domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527154413481629">American Association of Long-term Care Nursing, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527154413481629">American Health Care Association, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527154413481629">American Nurses Association, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527154413481629">American Nurses Credentialing Center, n.d</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1527154413481629">Lodge, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1527154413481629">Long Term Care Professional Leadership Council, 2009</xref>). A small portfolio of research provides further foundations for the DON position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527154413481629">Abedzadeh &amp; Heine, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527154413481629">Arojan, Patsdaughter, &amp; Wyszynski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527154413481629">Krichbaum, Johnson, &amp; Ryden, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1527154413481629">Lodge, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1527154413481629">Mueller, 1998</xref>). However, there is limited consensus across these summaries, position statements and study findings, and a lack of comprehensive research to support any one given focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1527154413481629">Siegel et al., 2010</xref>). A number of studies substantiate uncertainties, inconsistencies, or conflict regarding the DON role or job dissatisfaction among DONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527154413481629">Arojan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527154413481629">Ballard, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527154413481629">Fleming &amp; Kayser-Jones 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1527154413481629">Mueller, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1527154413481629">Tellis-Nayak &amp; Duss, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>DON Preparation</title>
<p>The majority of DONs received their RN preparation in associate’s degree or diploma programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527154413481629">Forbes-Thompson, Gajewski, Scott-Cawiezell, &amp; Dunton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1527154413481629">Mueller, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1527154413481629">Olson &amp; Zwygart-Stauffacher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1527154413481629">Tellis-Nayak &amp; Duss, 2005</xref>), where the general emphasis is on clinical tasks. This level of education is consistent with Federal minimum standards that require only RN licensure for the DON position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527154413481629">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2011a</xref>), without mention of minimum educational program requirements. There is a well-recognized need for DONs to gain education and training that foundationally supports the management role, beyond clinical expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527154413481629">Arojan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527154413481629">Ballard, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527154413481629">Forbes-Thompson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527154413481629">Krichbaum et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1527154413481629">Mueller, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1527154413481629">Olson &amp; Zwygart-Stauffacher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1527154413481629">Siegel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1527154413481629">Tellis-Nayak, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1527154413481629">Tellis-Nayak &amp; Duss, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1527154413481629">Vaughan-Wrobel &amp; Tygart, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1527154413481629">Wunderlich &amp; Kohler, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>DON job demands have grown substantially in scope and complexity in recent years, given public policy/funding and regulatory environments, increases in subacute services and other specialty services (i.e., dedicated dementia units), the culture change movement, and demographic trends of older residents with more complex needs and higher levels of acuity. It is essential to reexamine and explicate the specific roles and responsibilities for the DON position, as a basis for determining the requisite preparation DONs need to effectively and efficiently lead initiatives for quality improvement. This article describes and examines the roles and responsibilities of DONs as perceived by current/previous DONs and nursing home administrators (NHAs). The data are from a parent study that explored multiple aspects of the DON position, overall.</p>

<title>Design and Sample</title>
<p>This study used a descriptive, cross-sectional approach to collect qualitative data. We recruited a convenience sample of 29 participants from across the United States. The goal of recruitment was to capture a wide range of perspectives regarding the DON position, including persons currently working as DONs and other nursing home leaders with knowledge and expertise about the DON position. Networking strategies were used to identify prospective participants. Human subjects’ approvals were obtained from the Institutional Review Boards at Oregon Health &amp; Sciences University and University of California, Davis.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<sec id="section7-1527154413481629">
<title>Phase 1: Interview Guide Development</title>
<p>The interview guide included questions related to: primary roles and responsibilities of the DON; factors that contribute to the DON’s success in carrying out these roles and responsibilities; redesigning the DON position; and the knowledge, skills, and competencies, as well as education and training, needed to perform well in the DON position. The interview guide was pilot tested for clarity and appropriateness with a focus group of seven attendees at an annual conference of the American College of Health Care Administrators (ACHCA), including two DONs and five NHAs. ACHCA is nonprofit professional membership association focused on long-term care leaders’ educational programming, professional certification, and career development opportunities. With their feedback, the semistructured interview guide was revised to reflect a more explicit focus on the administration and management of nursing services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1527154413481629">
<title>Phase 2: Semistructured Interviews</title>
<p>Interviews were conducted by phone, audiotaped, and lasted up to 1 hr, following established guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527154413481629">Lincoln &amp; Denzin, 2005</xref>). All interviews were conducted by the primary investigator, EOS, and began with broad, descriptive, open-ended questions, such as <italic>“Tell me about the administrative and managerial aspects of the DON position.”</italic> Descriptive questions are the most general questions, offering the interviewer an indication of the type of language used by the participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1527154413481629">Spradley, 1979</xref>). Follow-up questions were structured and specific, based upon responses to previous questions, and used to clarify and confirm a participant’s response or intended meaning. For example, if a participant mentioned “budgeting” as one of the DON’s primary roles and responsibilities, follow-up questions may have included, <italic>“Please elaborate—what kinds of things does the DON do regarding budgeting?”</italic> or, more specifically, as applicable, <italic>“Tell me the DON’s specific involvement in developing the budget?”</italic> If a participant did not reference budgeting or HR management practices in their initial account of the DON’s roles and responsibilities, the interviewer followed with a direct question such as, <italic>“Tell me about the DON’s role in . . .</italic> (i.e., budgeting, performance appraisals, etc). As needed to further clarify the DON’s involvement in budgeting, the interviewer offered different perspectives on the topic and asked for the participants thoughts, such as: “<italic>I’ve heard some DONs say they really want to be involved and see that it’s part of their role. Others say, ‘you know, my focus is clinical and I want to leave the financials things to somebody else’—what are your thoughts about these different perspectives?”</italic> An ongoing process of summarization and feedback occurred throughout the interviews, offering participants the opportunity to confirm and/or expand their remarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1527154413481629">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>). Following completion of the interview, participants were sent a US$25 gift card from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link>.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section9-1527154413481629">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The digitally taped interview files were transcribed verbatim, and the transcripts were verified and transferred to NVivo 9 (QSR International), a qualitative data management program. We used content analysis and thematic analysis to analyze the data from the interview transcripts. Content analysis was used to identify and code text (i.e., phrases, words, or sentences) by specific roles and responsibilities. Coding for specific roles and responsibilities included text that: (a) explicitly referenced a specific job category (i.e., HR, finance/budgeting) as a role or responsibility of the DON; (b) explicitly referenced DONs’ accountability for a specific job category; and (c) indicated DON involvement (i.e., a recount of what the DON is doing) in relationship to a job category, based on statements such as <italic>“I do this. . .”</italic> or <italic>“We do this. . . .”</italic> Coding for roles and responsibilities did not include text-reflecting approaches to DON’s work (i.e., collaboration, communication). Within each job category, text was subcoded for different work components. For example, under the job category “Human resources,” text was coded for the work components “interviewing,” “performance evaluations,” and “employee law.” The second phase of data analysis used thematic analysis to inductively identify patterns or themes from the text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1527154413481629">Morse &amp; Field, 1995</xref>) relating to specific job categories or the DON position, overall.</p>
<p>Decision rules and reasoning for coding and classifying data were documented to provide a detailed audit trail of the analysis process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1527154413481629">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>). The research team continuously reviewed samples of raw data and code listings, categories, definitions, and strategies to confirm suitability of coding decisions. Coding discrepancies were discussed and documented, with appropriate changes to the coding scheme, as needed.</p>

<sec id="section13-1527154413481629">
<title>Finance</title>
<p>DON roles and responsibilities associated with the financial aspects of nursing services include: needs assessments for staffing and other expenditures; and budget input, planning, development, and variance monitoring, justifications, and revisions. While DON involvement in the budget process has increased over the years, wide variations were identified. Some participants reported the DON’s full engagement in budgeting, as highlighted by this DON’s experience:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>. . .because I’m sitting at the table saying, “look, this is going to require more education and training—we need to budget for this” or “our current software system isn’t going to meet the changes—we need to go ahead and put that money into the budget.” It’s more of a collegial dialog of “You’re the expert of skilled nursing, tell us what you need to do your job” versus “Here’s the budget.” So, it’s nice to work in this type of environment where I can sit down with the CFO and say “Look, this is what I need to do my job.”</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, other participants reported the DON’s limited or no direct involvement with budgeting, as recounted by a consultant:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>I see a great deal of organizations where the Directors of Nursing aren‘t even given responsibility for managing their budget . . . the administrator holds primary responsibility for the budget, or even a regional team from your corporate office. The larger the organization, the budgets are designed farther away from the Director of Nursing with little to no input from them.”</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1527154413481629">
<title>Human Resources (HR)</title>
<p>DONs spanned all aspects of HR management, from the day-to-day activities relating to hiring new employees (i.e., advertising, background checks), to issues involving employment law, to analyses of market wages and overall assessment, planning, and evaluation of HR practices. Some participants related the extent and type of DON involvement in HR activities to the size of an organization and the availability of HR resources (i.e., corporate HR support, HR manager, HR department) or nursing personnel that could be delegated HR activities (i.e., assistant DON, nurse managers, staff development person). Greater DON involvement in the various HR components was attributed to smaller, independent facilities with fewer support personnel. A DON stated:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>. . . one of the main administrative roles that I end up taking on is an HR manager. . .me and the administrator kind of share that role in managing those kinds of things: hiring, firing, personnel files, unemployment hearings. . . all the different things that can impact the employees’ ability to perform their job, whether it’s a CNA or an LPN or an RN. . .</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to facility size and resources, other organization-level factors were associated with the DON’s involvement with HR, including state-level employment law issues if the location of the corporate office is out of state and the use of self-managed work teams and culture change models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1527154413481629">
<title>Clinical</title>
<p>The DON’s roles and responsibilities associated with clinical activities include: direct and indirect clinical management, guidance, direction, and oversight; clinical programming to support admissions (e.g., total parenteral nutrition/TPN); interface/liaison to the Medical Director; and oversight and involvement with preparation and transmission of required reports (e.g., minimum data set). Some participants suggested variations based on the availability of other nursing managers (i.e., assistant director of nursing) or dedicated positions such as infection control nurse or resident care coordinators. A NHA from a <italic>“very, very large”</italic> facility described his DON’s limited role in clinical activities:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>She does a lot of managerial and leadership—her main role is to provide leadership to the nursing department and she does a lot of guiding and teaching and mentoring nurse managers and assistant director of nurses etc.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, a DON with 10 years of experience reported the need for direct clinical involvement in a 150+ bed facility, due to staff nurses’ limited educational preparation:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Now a days, we do clinical, it is so intense because the follow-up is so poor that you basically over seeing everything at a personal level. . .I think the workforce coming out of school today are not self-directed at all. . .I think most nurses. . . think their primary role is to pass meds for 8 hours and they don’t wish to do anything else. That’s pretty sad because they totally ignore the symptoms, the labs, so on and so forth. So a good director is compelled to do clinical in that fashion, so the residents receive good care.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1527154413481629">
<title>Staff education/professional development</title>
<p>The DON’s role in staff education/professional development ranged from ongoing informal interactions with all members of the nursing staff and mentoring nurse managers, to filling in for activities generally handled by a Staff Development Coordinator, to taking on a more formal role, concurrently, as Director of Staff Development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1527154413481629">
<title>Regulatory compliance</title>
<p>Participants reported varying emphasis on regulatory compliance. A NHA linked regulatory compliance with systems design and leadership, emphasizing the important role of DONs in establishing internal systems that support compliance with regulations. A DON with 10 years tenure suggests moving away from a focus on regulations:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>I really try not to focus on doing things properly to meet state regs. . . if you do the very best you can and you do it right, and you do it for the right reasons for the residents and for what your job qualifications require your responsibilities to be, then you‘re not going to have to worry about the state regs because you‘re going to meet them.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, a DON with over 4 years of tenure emphasized a heavy focus on the regulations:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>You know, your main responsibility. . .it‘s just terrible because you‘re responsible for running the building every single day whether you are in survey or not. . . making sure that we keep our noses clean with the state basically is 75% of my job.</italic></p>

<sec id="section18-1527154413481629">
<title>Expanded DON Scope: Up, Down, and Across the Organizational Chart</title>
<p>In addition to DON-specific job categories, participants reported that some DONs cover for other positions within the nursing home. One DON reported she/he is <italic>“unofficially, the second in command,”</italic> when the NHA is out of the building. In nursing homes with limited staff, some DONs reported covering as <italic>“the [nursing] staff’s resource,”</italic> filling staffing gaps related to unplanned absences and ensuring the facility’s compliance with the requirement for at least one RN at all times. One participant, currently a consultant, recounted: <italic>“. . . if somebody called in sick, I was expected to go cover that shift, plus do all my other work and quite frankly that hasn’t really changed.”</italic> Participants commonly reported essential DON linkages across the organizational chart, to other departments such as dietary, speech therapy, recreation, business, maintenance, social work, and so forth. A NHA with 15 years of experience described the interdepartmental nature of the DON position:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>. . . if we’re having issues in dietary department, whether it be food consistencies or food textures, not only does she get involved from the dietary manager’s perspective, but also speech language pathologist perspective . . . If we have equipment problems . . . she’s communicating with the maintenance department. If we have residents who need to be seen by a social worker, she will talk to the social worker. So I would expect that she would be in communication on a daily basis with whatever department. She may need to be in order to make sure that things run smoothly within the nursing department.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Beyond interdepartmental communication, a DON with 8 years of experience in a total of three facilities described the DON’s role filling in across departments:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Whenever something goes wrong in the kitchen, it’s the Director of Nursing they are calling. Whenever something goes wrong in laundry, there you are. I learned how to use commercial washers for God‘s sake because one day our entire laundry department called off. So me and the Administrator, we learned how to run the machines because you‘ve got to get laundry.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1527154413481629">
<title>The DON Position, Overall</title>
<p>General variations regarding the overarching DON position were also identified, with linkages to industry-, organization-, and individual-level factors. At an industry level, one participant referred to the absence of a defined role for the DON:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>It‘s a very diverse role and everybody who does the job, does it a little bit differently. . . and I think just trying to understand what people actually do is probably [difficult]– because we haven‘t come up with a defined role. There isn‘t like, okay “you‘re a director and this is what you do.” It all depends on your facility, which makes it even harder.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fundamental differences in administrator/executive expectations for the DON—placing a heavy focus on clinical—were noted by a NHA:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>. . .most places hire the DON because of the clinical side. . . . a lot of Administrators, or Executive Directors or Presidents of hospitals, they don’t see the Director of Nursing. . . as the person who truly manages and leads the department. They still see them as the nurse who’s doing all the clinical stuff.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At an organizational level, variations in the DON’s scope of involvement in different job categories were commonly discussed in terms of facility size (i.e., # of beds) or an expanded organizational chart (i.e., presence of other nurse managers such as an assistant DON) and greater support staff. For example:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>. . .the smaller the facility, the broader the responsibilities. . .there just aren’t as many people in the organization to delegate responsibilities to—so, as a result, the role[s] and responsibility[ies] are broader and incorporate having to manage additional or other disciplines because the organization isn’t large enough to support directors within those departments.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Variations in DONs’ roles and responsibilities were also discussed in terms of individual DON differences. A NHA who has worked with 12 DONs over more than 20 years reported tailoring the DON’s roles and responsibilities to their abilities and other organizational resources:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>I have never worked with two DONs who share the same abilities. They are all so different. You have to compensate either with yourself or with other staff or with outside consultants . . . some are really great on the floor and you want them out there more observing the clinical aspects. Some are better as instructors so you kind of pull them back from some other functions. . . So it really does depend on . . . what other support staff that you have available as well as their strengths and weaknesses.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Linkages between individual DON differences and variations in roles and responsibilities were highlighted in discussions of the DON’s involvement in the financial aspects of nursing services. For example, a DON with 30 years of experience described her dissatisfaction with not being involved in the budgeting process and her strategies to change that situation:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>I worked for . . . an organization . . .[where] you were handed your budget. . .I would sit down to review the budget. . .[and]. . . I was in total shock. Well, when I went to meet with Senior Management and questioned the budget. . . at first, [I] wasn’t very successful with the arguments that I presented, so I kept doing it [until I was finally successful]. . .my argument was “I can’t stay within the budgetary guidelines, because first of all you’ve not staffed me appropriately, nor have you taken into consideration different aspects. . .”</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, a DON with over 4 years of experience reported a preference for limited involvement in the budget process:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>I’m a nurse. I know I’m in management, but I’m a nurse, so literally, when people starting talking about money, my head shuts down a little bit. I know it’s weird, because, to me, I need what I need to take care of the residents. I need the staff . . . and I just want somebody else to figure out the money end of it. So, I don’t mind budgeting being set for me as long as my staffing budget is what I need it to be. . .</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall time demands for the DON position varied as well. At one end of the continuum, a baccalaureate-prepared DON with 6 years of experience working at an organization that incorporates nurse supervisors or other support personnel suggests that the DON position involves minimal time demands beyond the normal work day: “ <italic>I ran a 180 [bed] building. I start work at 9 and leave at 4:30 and I rare[ly]. . . get phone calls on the weekends. . .”</italic> At the other end of the time demand continuum, a DON with 8 years of experience reflects on the 24/7 nature of the DON position, with linkages to an organization’s flat organizational structure:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>It is hard to believe, because you’re it. So even when you’re gone, you are usually getting calls and paged and you pray to God the State doesn‘t show up, because you are leaving the conference you’re at to come back to the facility. So you don’t relax the whole time you’re away because you can‘t, because you never know what’s going to happen at the facility. It’s not like there is another Director in another role.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other factors linked to the 24/7 nature of the DON position included: inadequately prepared staff nurses, DON time management or delegation, and nursing as the only department in the building around the clock. A new DON described time demands in this manner:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>I’m a brand new DON, I‘m just killing myself, I‘m spending 14 hours a day, 6, 7 days a week in this building trying to make it a good building. . .</italic></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study provides insights regarding the roles and responsibilities of DONs in nursing homes. The findings reveal a broad scope and wide variation in the DON position across settings. Rather than a core set of functions necessary for management of clinical operations and quality assurance, the DON’s roles and responsibilities were defined by a variety of factors including characteristics of the facility and preferences of the DON and NHA. The findings suggest an emphasis on DONs doing whatever was necessary to keep daily operations going, with less attention to long-term issues and planning. Some smaller facilities incorporated additional task-focused responsibilities for the DON, such as staff scheduling, “filling in” for RN coverage, and/or a full array of human resource management responsibilities. While this design may support an organization’s immediate needs/profit margin, this approach could undermine effective engagement in leadership and management activities that promote quality of care. The broad scope described by the participants, in general, is consistent with earlier reports and statements regarding the DON position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527154413481629">American Association of Long-term Care Nursing, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527154413481629">American Health Care Association, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527154413481629">American Nurses Association, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527154413481629">American Nurses Credentialing Center, n.d</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1527154413481629">Lodge, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1527154413481629">Long Term Care Professional Leadership Council, 2009</xref>). The current study raises questions regarding the optimal job design and preparation for the DON. Given the demands of the position, should there be standards for the position description that could lay the foundation for comprehensive preparation for the role, maximizing the likelihood of success across different organizational contexts? This study highlights a critical policy-practice gap between the Federal minimum requirements for the DON position and the broad scope of this position. RN licensure, as the Federal minimum requirement, suggests a clinical scope of practice; yet, this study suggests a broader scope of responsibility for the DON, with inextricable linkages between clinical care and the nonclinical aspects of care delivery, including managing fiscal and HR. Earlier reports of discrepancies in DON perspectives regarding their roles and responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527154413481629">Arojan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527154413481629">Ballard, 1995</xref>), conflicting role expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527154413481629">Fleming, 2008</xref>), and DONs’ dissatisfaction with spending time on the administrative and managerial aspects of nursing services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1527154413481629">Tellis-Nayak &amp; Duss, 2005</xref>), and DON annual job turnover rates averaging 31% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527154413481629">Castle &amp; Lin, 2010</xref>), suggest the need for role clarity regarding essential elements of the DON position. Research is needed to better understand specifically how DON roles and responsibilities contribute to safe, cost-effective, and high-quality care delivery practices so that training and education programs can support DON preparation for this comprehensive role.</p>
<p>From the perspective of Donabedian’s <italic>structure-process-outcomes</italic> framework (1980), specific responsibilities could be evaluated for linkages to quality outcomes. The DON’s responsibilities in management of HR are of great interest, given the high rates of job turnover across the organizational chart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527154413481629">American Health Care Association, 2011</xref>). The costly and revolving nature of the nursing home workforce creates unique management challenges for DONs, in terms of creating high-functioning work teams in the absence of employee stability. Yet, DONs report a lack of formal preparation in this aspect of their roles and responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527154413481629">Ballard, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1527154413481629">Tellis-Nayak &amp; Duss, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As the management member closest to clinical care, DON involvement in budgeting could contribute to appropriate resource allocation and management for effective operations. Yet, this study identified vast differences in DON involvement in the financial aspects of nursing services, consistent with Mueller’s report that more than one third of DON’s had limited or no involvement in planning for the resources needed for the nursing department (1998). This may be particularly salient in for-profit nursing homes with lower indicators of quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527154413481629">Grabowski, Stewart, Broderick, &amp; Coots, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527154413481629">Harrington, Woolhandler, Mullan, Carrillo, &amp; Himmelstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527154413481629">Mor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1527154413481629">O’Neill, Harrington, Kitchener, &amp; Saliba, 2003</xref>; and lower nurse staffing levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527154413481629">Harrington et al, 2001</xref>). While these findings suggest that the short-term financial goals set for a nursing home may challenge the DON’s capacity to effectively lead and manage nursing services, other studies suggest that higher quality care does not necessarily cost more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1527154413481629">Rantz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1527154413481629">Weech-Maldonado, Neff, &amp; Mor, 2003</xref>). In tandem with efforts to attain additional resources for nursing homes, research is needed to better understand the DON’s role in effective and efficient financial management and administration of the resources that support nursing services. Additionally, research is needed to better understand the influence of organizational characteristics—such as profit status, size, affiliation, geographic location—on DON role enactment.</p>
<p>The study findings affirm the call for DON-specific training/education to support the full scope of this position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527154413481629">Arojan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527154413481629">Ballard, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527154413481629">Forbes-Thompson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527154413481629">Krichbaum et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1527154413481629">Mueller, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1527154413481629">Olson &amp; Zwygart-Stauffacher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1527154413481629">Siegel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1527154413481629">Tellis-Nayak, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1527154413481629">Tellis-Nayak &amp; Duss, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1527154413481629">Vaughan-Wrobel &amp; Tygart, 1993</xref>). A 2001 IOM report highlighted the gap in DON training and education, suggesting, “Nursing facilities should place greater emphasis on educational preparation in the employment of new DONs and licensed professionals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1527154413481629">Wunderlich &amp; Kohler, 2001</xref>, p. 197), and a number of independent organizations have responded to this need (American Association of Long Term Care Nursing; Arkansas Health Care Foundation; National Association of Directors of Nursing in Long-term Care; Quality Healthcare Foundation; University of Washington—School of Nursing Continuing Nursing Education). Notwithstanding the value of these individual programs, policy-level questions arise regarding whether or not this training/education should be left to the discretion of DON-candidates and/or nursing facilities. Furthermore, there is limited evidence to support best practices in adequately preparing RNs for the DON position and varied scopes of roles and responsibilities across various organizational structures. Research is needed to establish evidence for (a) the specific training and education needs for the DON position and (b) the development of policy and professional standards for DON training/education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1527154413481629">Wunderlich &amp; Kohler, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The data from this study could contribute to development of a highly detailed, evidence-based job description for the DON position, following industrial/organizational psychology principles for conducting a Job Analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527154413481629">1</xref></sup> Such an effort could yield a basis for designing appropriate educational preparation and assuring competence in the DON position. Defining the structural elements (i.e., specific aspects of the DON job description and expectations) that contribute to quality would allow testing of the Donabedian model as it relates to quality processes and outcomes. Such research is a matter of public health and safety, as the quality of care in nursing homes in the United States remains suboptimal, and the costs of such care continue to rise disproportionately to the desired outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section21-1527154413481629">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The generalizability of the findings from this study is limited, due to convenience sampling, and the small size of this sample. In addition, the education levels of the majority participants currently working as DONs exceeds that of the national averages for DONs, further limiting the representativeness of this sample. However, this exploratory study reflects a range of DON characteristics and perspectives of people who currently or previously have held a DON position or have worked with DONs and provides data required to design a Job Analysis questionnaire for use in an expanded and more generalizable sample. Another limitation relates to our lack of information about the quality of the facilities where the participants have been or are currently affiliated.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Federal and state support for nursing home services is substantial, reaching US$78.1 billion in 2006, and amounts are only expected to rise with the aging population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527154413481629">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2007</xref>). The enormous federal and state resource investment in nursing homes carries responsibility to ensure the most effective and efficient use of these resources. Solutions are complex and do not rest solely on increased regulatory guidelines and/or increased funding or staffing. An urgent need exists to maximize the benefits of public resources and improve the quality of nursing home care, by enhancing the capacity of DONs to effectively and cost-efficiently lead, manage, and administer nursing services. This study provides important data for future research in (a) DON job designs and potential restructuring of management teams to optimize the capacity of the DON position; (b) directions for future research to support policy review of DON entry-level requirements; (c) education, training, and experience interventions; and (d) industry standards for developing customized DON job descriptions that reflect the unique needs of organizations.</p>

<p>Job analysis is an essential foundation for all aspects of human resource management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1527154413481629">Guion, 1998</xref>) and reflects “the systematic process of discovery of the nature of a job by dividing it into smaller units, where the process results in one or more written products with the goal of describing what is done in the job or what capabilities are needed to effectively perform the job” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527154413481629">Brannick, Levine, &amp; Morgeson, 2007</xref>, p. 8), and considers the work environment and context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1527154413481629">Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology, 2003</xref>).</p></fn>
