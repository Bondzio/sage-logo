<p>In the article <bold>An exploration into self concept: A comparative analysis between the adolescents who are sighted and blind in India by Santoshi Halder and Poulomee Datta</bold> (pp. 31-41), the following corrections should apply.</p>
<p><bold>Explanation from the author</bold>: There was an error that somehow occurred during multiple drafting of the paper. We highly regret the inconvenience caused to the readers.</p>
<list id="list1-0264619612445514" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>1. The Results section (pp. 35-36) should read:</bold></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The results illustrated the relative comparison of the self concept scores (high, moderate and low) of the sighted adolescents in Table 1. It is evident from the result that overall only 13% of the adolescents had high self concept and about 87% adolescents ranged from moderate to low self concept. Moreover, a greater proportion of boys appeared to have a higher self concept than girls.</p>
<p>The relative comparison of the self concept scores (high, moderate and low) of the adolescents who are blind are shown in Table 2. It is evident from the result that overall only 5% of the adolescents who are blind had high self concept and about 94% adolescents who are blind ranged from moderate to low self concept.</p>
<p>The mean, standard deviation (SD) and t test scores of sighted male and female adolescents are shown in Table 3. Sighted males scored significantly higher than the sighted females in two of the dimensions of self-concept namely intellectual and school status and physical appearance and attributes. It was only on the ‘behaviour’ subscale in which sighted females had a significantly higher self concept than sighted males. There were no significant differences among the sighted males and females in the Anxiety, Popularity and Happiness and Satisfaction domains of self-concept and thus the overall self-concept as well.</p>
<p>The mean, standard deviation (SD) and t test scores of blind male and female adolescents are shown in Table 4. It was only on the ‘behaviour’ subscale that significant differences were found between male and female adolescents who are blind. Males were found to have a higher behaviour self concept than females (the reverse of the finding for the sighted groups).</p>
<p>The mean, standard deviation (SD) and t test scores of sighted and blind adolescents are shown in Table 5. Finally, when we compared the sighted adolescents with the blind group irrespective of gender, significant differences were found in which the sighted group had a higher self concept than the blind group in physical appearance and attributes, popularity, and happiness and satisfaction (as well as overall self concept). The blind group was not found to have a significantly higher self concept than the sighted group on any of the subscales.</p>

<list-item><p><bold>2. In Discussion, p. 36, lines 1-9 (‘In terms of … aspects of self concept’) should read:</bold></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In terms of the first aim and hypothesis, the results illustrated that there were no significant differences in the total self concept of the sighted male adolescents when compared to the sighted female adolescents. These results confirmed the findings of other studies that found no significant sex differences in the self concept of adolescents (Garaigordobil &amp; Bernarás, 2009). However, they contradicted the findings of López-Justicia and Pichardo, 2003; Jackson, Hodge and Ingram, 1994; and Mboya, 1994 which found significant differences between the overall self concept scores of male and female adolescents.</p>

<list-item><p>3. In Discussion, p. 38, after Table-5, lines 13-16 (‘However, results … blind group’) should be deleted.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>4. In Table 3, <italic>t</italic>-value for 6. Happiness and satisfaction should read 0.38 NS <italic>not</italic> 4.00; and for Total, 0.89 <italic>not</italic> 4.93.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>5. In Table 5, N for Sighted should read 60 <italic>not</italic> 100.</p></list-item>
