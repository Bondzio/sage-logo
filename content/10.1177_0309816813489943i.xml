<p>For the US$75 billion chocolate and cocoa-based products market, West Africa is a key region. If the region produces about two-thirds of the world production of cocoa beans, Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana contribute over 50 per cent to the world supply. As the former Reuters correspondent in Uganda and Ghana and actual <italic>Financial Times</italic> journalist Órla Ryan demonstrates, our favourite sweet is produced thanks to the mass poverty of millions of farmers. Divided into ten chapters, including an Introduction and an Epilogue, Ryan argues in this short, journalistic book that politically fragmented small producers need political leadership, negotiating muscle, education, scientific support and land reform, while chocolate companies need more transparency.</p>
<p>Since their independence in 1957 and 1960, both Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire have used their respective national marketing board as financial instruments for developmental projects, buying from the producers at a fixed price and selling at higher prices on international markets. Mismanagement and corruption in Ghana led to a dramatic decline in production during the 1960s and 1970s, a trend that was only reversed by the government setting higher farm-gate prices under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, in order to increase production. With elections in 1992, the government became increasingly dependent on the country’s 720,000 cocoa producers, and thereby rising producers’ prices became an essential aspect of electoral life, although poverty remains the norm for cocoa farmers.</p>
<p>Chapters 2 to 4 survey the transformation of Côte d’Ivoire’s miracle into a nightmare. Ryan argues that in ‘these two decisions [welcoming immigrants with open arms and making land freely available] lie the secrets of the success of the Ivorian cocoa industry and the roots of its downfall’ (p. 26). Plummeting international prices in the 1980s destroyed the previous two decades of rapid economic growth. Defaulting on its debt in 1987, structural adjustment forced the government to balance its books on the back of coffee and cocoa farmers by cutting their payments by half, while causing widespread economic hardship. As people from the cities tried to go back to the land, disputes around citizenship and land ownership emerged. Simmering throughout the 1990s, tensions degenerated into civil war in 2002, effectively dividing the country in two. Meanwhile, under pressure from the World Bank, the government abolished the Cocoa Board in 1999, only to create five new bodies to regulate the cocoa trade in the following years. Between 1999 and 2003, levies on exports increased ninefold, and cocoa taxes almost tripled. Exporters downloaded these extra costs onto smallholders, who were no longer protected by a minimum price. Amidst widespread poverty, producers became increasingly dependent on family labour, including child labour, and instances of child slavery and trafficked children on cocoa plantations have surfaced.</p>
<p>Chapters 5 and 6 address the difficulties in transferring value-added manufacturing processes to the continent and the myths and reality of Fairtrade solutions to West African poverty. With only 7 per cent of the price of a chocolate bar spent on cocoa ingredients, most profits come from manufacturing (43 per cent). Yet chocolate companies have shown little or no interest in moving production of finished products to the continent, with the importation of key ingredients such as milk and the providing of refrigerated means of transportation for the perishable treat deemed too costly. On the other hand, Ryan maintains that market and democratic forces, rather than Fairtrade, explain producers’ rising share of world prices in Ghana. In recent years, the price of cocoa has risen above the Fairtrade floor, and the minimum price received by farmers frequently matches or exceeds the latter. For Ryan, while Fairtrade would protect farmers from a future drop in international prices, so would greater productivity and crop diversification.</p>
<p>With Cadbury, Kraft, Ferrero, Nestlé and Masterfoods controlling 57 percent of the European chocolate retail market, and Cargill, Barry Callebaut and ADM controlling 41 percent of the global processing business, Chapter 7 shows that parallel to market concentration and the consolidation of power by international companies runs the gradual fragmentation of producers’ power. As the author argues in the following chapter, education and scientific support are keys to a sustainable future based on intensive rather than expansive production. And while recognising that the lack of both is largely the result ‘of sector reforms [read structural adjustments] in the 1990s’ (p. 153), Ryan praises industry-led initiatives as potentially transformative.</p>
<p>Contrary to what the subtitle of this book suggests, the book is not about West Africa per se, but about Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire – other regional producers such as Nigeria in West Africa or Cameroon in Central Africa are ignored. The book also contains very little, if any, comparative data to assess the evolution of people’s standards of living since independence. More importantly, however, <italic>Chocolate Nations</italic> at best offers a partial explanation of the reasons behind farmer poverty. While Ryan is certainly right to criticise at length ‘decades of political mismanagement, theft and waste’ (p. 62) by Ghanaian and Ivorian authorities, the absence of any sustained discussion on decades of economic mismanagement, theft and waste by structural adjustment policies (SAPs) is a painful omission that not only seriously undermines the explanatory capacity of the book, but also creates important historical, analytical and logical difficulties. The net effect is a subtle narrative that reproduces the sanitised developmental discourse of the IMF and the World Bank, as Ryan remains largely silent on the widespread poverty and misery created in both countries by these institutions.</p>
<p>Ryan’s critique of Fairtrade is interesting but weak. She undermines her own argument that international markets can also be ‘fair’ by noting ‘that, in real terms, prices in 2000-2005 were a quarter of what they were in the 1970s’ (p. 128). And while the journalistic tone of the book makes it accessible, the content of the book’s two-page bibliography is a strong reminder of its analytical limits and shortcomings, which make it a useful, yet one-sided introduction to cocoa production in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. With these caveats in mind, Ryan’s book is to be praised for presenting this important issue to a wider audience.</p>
