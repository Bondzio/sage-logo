<title>Objective</title>
<p>To determine which anthropometric measure best correlates with change in fat mass (FM) over time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922812440838">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The authors performed a retrospective cohort study of 76 obese patients (mean body mass index [BMI] 38 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and mean age 13 years) presenting to an obesity clinic between 2005 and 2010. For each patient, during 2 visits, FM was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis and the following measures obtained: BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, and neck circumference. Correlation coefficients and linear regression analyses were calculated to examine the relationship between each measure and FM.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Change in BMI correlated better with change in FM than any other measure and had the strongest effect on change in FM (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .887).

<title>Background</title>
<p>Pediatric obesity has become a worldwide epidemic and is a leading cause of morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812440838">1</xref></sup> Body mass index (BMI) is often used to quantify weight status in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812440838">2</xref></sup> However, the US Preventative Studies Task Force has found inconclusive evidence to support the use of BMI as a screening tool.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812440838">3</xref></sup> One of the greatest limitations in the use of BMI is its inability to distinguish between body fat mass (FM) and lean body mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812440838">4</xref></sup> This is important as it is well established that increased FM is associated with increased cardiometabolic risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812440838">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812440838"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812440838">7</xref></sup> More definitive modalities of assessing FM, such as dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and imaging such as abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are impractical for everyday use and in the outpatient clinic setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812440838">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several pediatric cross-sectional studies have compared BIA, DEXA, and CT assessments of FM with various anthropometric indices. Many have found significant and similar correlations between FM and all anthropometric measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812440838">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812440838"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812440838"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812440838"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812440838"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812440838">13</xref></sup> Others, however, suggest that measures of central adiposity, such as waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) correlate better with FM than measures of general adiposity such as BMI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812440838">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812440838"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812440838"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812440838">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>If measures of central adiposity are superior predictors of FM, it may be useful to evaluate these measures instead of or in addition to BMI with every office visit in order to more accurately assess a child’s change in body composition over time and with treatment. Despite the numerous studies that have looked at anthropometric measurements and their correlation with FM at a single time point, we were unable to find any studies in the literature that describe how change in FM over time is reflected by change in anthropometric measures. In this study, our objective was to examine the correlation between changes in multiple anthropometric measures over time and changes in FM as measured by BIA. In examining these relationships, we will offer evidence for which tool is best used longitudinally in assessing change in body composition.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-0009922812440838">
<title>Design</title>
<p>A retrospective cohort study was undertaken through a chart review of patients’ electronic medical records (EMRs).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0009922812440838">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Patients were included in the study if they were seen by the same provider and had a BIA assessment performed at 2 visits more than 3 months apart in the Weight Management Clinic at AI duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Delaware, between the years 2005 and 2010. A single provider was chosen to eliminate interrater error with regard to measurements. Patients were excluded from the study if they were known to have a secondary cause of obesity or syndrome associated with short stature (including Cushing syndrome, Prader–Willi syndrome, Down syndrome, hypothyroidism, Turner syndrome, Noonan syndrome, and achondroplasia). Demographic variables, such as age, gender, and race, were obtained from the EMR. The study was approved by the Nemours Institutional Review Board.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0009922812440838">
<title>Measurements</title>
<p>Weight and height measurements were measured by a Weight Management Clinic medical assistant trained and experienced in the measurement of obese children. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a digital platform scale. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a wall stadiometer. Data were entered into the EMR by the same Weight Management Clinic medical assistant. BMI was automatically calculated by the EMR with the equation: BMI = mass (kg)/height (m)<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>All anthropometric measurements were performed by a single physician who specializes in pediatric obesity. All measurements were measured to the nearest 1.0 cm using a standard cloth tape measure. Neck circumference (NC) was measured at the level of the cricoid cartilage. WC was measured at the level of the superior borders of the iliac crests. Hip circumference (HC) was measured at the widest circumference between the waist and knees. Data were entered into the EMR by the physician. WHtR was calculated by the equation: WHtR = WC (cm)/height (cm). Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was calculated by the equation: WHR = WC (cm)/HC (cm).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0009922812440838">
<title>Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis</title>
<p>Whole-body resistance and reactance values were measured using a bioelectrical impedance analyzer (the RJL Systems Quantum X, Clinton Township, MI), and FM was derived using validated equations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812440838">18</xref></sup> Before each test, the unit was calibrated using the resistor provided by the manufacturer. All testing was performed with the same machine by a clinical staff member trained in the use of the BIA machine during the patient’s visit to the Weight Management Clinic. Subjects were tested in the supine position after lying on the examination table for 5 minutes. The right shoe and sock were removed and contact areas were cleansed before electrode placement. Four electrodes were placed as specified by the manufacturer on the right wrist and right ankle. Resistance and reactance were recorded to the nearest ohm. FM data were entered into the EMR by the clinical staff who performed the BIA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0009922812440838">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Variables were checked for outliers, and outliers were excluded from analyses. Mean, standard deviation, median, and ranges were calculated for all measurements to describe the population. To standardize units of measure, the percentage change in each measurement per month was calculated. To assess the relationship between the percentage change in anthropometric measure per month and the percentage change in FM per month, Pearson’s simple and partial correlation coefficients were calculated for the overall sample population, as well as for subgroups of the population by race and gender. The relationship between FM and each anthropometric measure was assessed at each individual visit as well to serve as single-point comparisons.</p>
<p>Assumptions for correlation and regression analyses such as linearity of relationship and homogeneity of error variance for regressions were checked. In addition, multiple regressions were checked for multicolinearity of predictors. Linear regression analyses were performed to determine the effect of each anthropometric measure on FM and to assess which model best predicts FM, with dependent variable of percentage change in FM and predictor variables of percentage change in BMI, WC, HC, NC, race, gender, age, and duration between measurements. WHtR and WHR were not used as variables in regression analyses because they were found to negate the effect of WC and HC, respectively.</p>
<p>All analyses were performed at the level of significance of .05. The statistical software SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used to perform statistical analyses.</p>

<p>Adjusting for age, race, gender, and duration between measurements in months, we performed several more linear regression analyses. A model including only BMI had the highest adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value of .891. Adding WC to the model lowered the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> slightly to .890. Models that did not include BMI had a significantly lower adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value of .521, though in this model both WC and HC showed a significant, though weaker, effect on change in FM with standardized coefficients of 0.47 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) and 0.34 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many prior studies have examined the relationship between FM and different anthropometric measures at a single time point, with many suggesting that measures of central adiposity may be superior to BMI in the assessment of FM. Our study also found that changes in measures of central adiposity correlate just as well with change in FM as BMI at single time points. However, our findings longitudinally are distinctly different. In this population of obese children, change in BMI over time correlated strongly with change in FM as measured by BIA. Other anthropometric measurements, including WC and WHtR, did not add to this assessment in our study.</p>
<p>Our study suggests that measuring BMI over time is a sufficient method to assess change in FM in obese children. This is promising as most pediatricians assess BMI at clinic visits but rarely assess other anthropometric measures. As general pediatric offices represent the primary medical home for children with obesity, it is important that they use techniques that will accurately assess gain or loss of FM—not just weight—in their patients over time and with interventions. Our findings support the continuation of BMI measurements at pediatric office visits at routine well child visits and especially at weight follow-ups.</p>
<p>When accounting for race, age, and gender, BMI remained the superior method of assessing change in FM. Since obesity affects a diverse group of patients, it is important to use a form of measurement to assess body composition that is accurate in different subgroups. Interestingly, there was one anthropometric measure—NC—whose relationship with FM was significantly different among non-whites and whites. We found no studies in the literature to support the relationship between race and NC. Our population of non-whites was small, and thus larger studies are likely needed to elucidate this relationship.</p>
<p>There were several limitations to our study. Although sample size was sufficient to obtain significant results, the study population was relatively small. As data were pulled retrospectively from clinical encounters, and not collected specifically for research purposes, the number of patients who met the study criteria was relatively small, which speaks of the difficulty of incorporating gold standard measurements of FM into a clinic visit. Additionally, we were only able to include 2 time points in our study, which again demonstrates the difficulty of regularly incorporating these measurements into clinic visits. Future studies might improve on this by trending the relationships we looked at through multiple visits, as findings may be different over a longer period of time or with larger changes in body composition. For example, if a patient develops increased lean body mass over a prolonged period of time, it may affect the utility of BMI.</p>
<p>Another possible limitation to our study was the use of BIA as our gold standard of FM. Using more superior techniques such as DEXA, CT or magnetic resonance imaging, or air displacement plethysmography would have been impractical in our clinical setting and are certainly less practical in the general pediatric clinic setting. In addition, many studies have shown that BIA measurements strongly correlate with these other standards of measuring FM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812440838">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812440838">20</xref></sup> Also, both BIA and BMI use weight and height in their calculation, which might account for their strong correlation. However, regression analysis demonstrates that change in height does not have a significant effect on change in FM in our study population, mitigating this limitation.</p>
<p>Last, the generalizability of our results is limited. For one, we included only obese patients. BMI may not reflect change in FM for patients with a greater percentage of lean body mass; however, it is in the obese population that the general pediatrician will most want to track changes in FM. In addition, 60% of our study population was Caucasian, which does not reflect America’s obese population. As suggested by differences in correlation between NC and FM for whites and non-whites, the utility of specific anthropometric measures may vary by race, and this may be an area for further research.</p>
<p>Further research is needed to determine which anthropometric measure best reflects cardiometabolic risk longitudinally. Although some cross-sectional studies in children have shown that measures of general adiposity, such as BMI, and measures of central adiposity, such as WC and WHtR, all correlate similarly with increased risk of cardiometabolic disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812440838">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812440838">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812440838"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812440838">23</xref></sup> others suggest that WC and WHtR are more predictive of cardiometabolic risk than BMI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812440838">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922812440838"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922812440838">26</xref></sup> However, all these studies looked at associations at single time points, and it would be important to also investigate which measures best reflect changes in cardiometabolic risk over time and with treatment.</p>

<sec id="section18-0009922812440838" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Change in BMI over time accurately reflects change in FM over time in obese children, regardless of age, gender, or race. Other anthropometric measurements do not appear to add to this assessment. This is promising as BMI is a practical and already widely used tool in both weight management and primary care clinics.</p>
