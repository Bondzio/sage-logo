<p>Employee perceptions of HR practices are often assumed to play an important mediating role in the relationship between HR systems and HR outcomes. In a multisource, multilevel study of 2,063 employees and 449 managers in 119 branches of a single large firm, the authors tested how managers’ perceptions of the HR practices implemented in the unit relate to employee perceptions of these HR practices. The authors’ main aim is to explore managers’ communication quality as a moderator of the relationship between manager-rated and employee-rated HR practices. They also tested whether perceived human resource management (HRM) perceptions in turn relate to perceived unit performance and satisfaction. Multilevel structural equation modeling analyses showed that HRM perceptions mediated the relationship between implemented HRM and both satisfaction and unit performance and that communication moderated the relationship between manager-rated and employee-rated HRM. These findings contribute to scholars’ understanding of how HRM affects employee-related outcomes.</p>

<body>
<p>Over the past few decades, a substantial body of strategic human resource management (SHRM) research has investigated the relationship between HRM and firm performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206312440118">Arthur, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206312440118">Batt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206312440118">Becker &amp; Gerhart, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206312440118">Chadwick &amp; Dabu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206312440118">Guthrie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206312440118">Huselid, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206312440118">Liao, Toya, Lepak, &amp; Hong, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206312440118">Sun, Aryee, &amp; Law, 2007</xref>). Combined, this research suggests that “high involvement” or “high performance” HR practices positively affect organizational performance outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206312440118">Huselid, 1995</xref>), yet how HR affects outcomes is not yet fully clear. One important proposed mechanism suggests that this impact runs via individual employees. For example, Wright and others stress the crucial role of employee attitudes and behaviors in translating HR practices into performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206312440118">Nishii &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206312440118">Ramsay, Scholarios, &amp; Harley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206312440118">Wright &amp; Boswell, 2002</xref>). High performance HR practices are assumed to enhance employee motivation and performance, and, in turn, these more motivated and better performing employees improve firm performance. In line with this more central role of employees, authors emphasize the need to include employee perceptions in HR studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206312440118">Bowen &amp; Ostroff, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206312440118">Guest, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206312440118">Kehoe &amp; Wright, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206312440118">Nishii &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The organization’s designed HR system ideally reflects its strategy and context, and as organizations make choices about how to manage their employees, such systems also convey information about the organization to employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206312440118">Bretz &amp; Judge, 1994</xref>). However, having a well-designed HR system on paper may not suffice to positively affect employees as rhetoric about the desired HR system and the reality of what is implemented may differ from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206312440118">Legge, 2005</xref>). Line managers play an important role in implementing the designed systems, and differences in implementation might occur at this level (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206312440118">Den Hartog, Boselie, &amp; Paauwe, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206312440118">Nishii and Wright (2008)</xref> point out that besides the <italic>intended</italic> or designed HR system that firms develop on paper, we need to distinguish the HR system as <italic>implemented</italic> (i.e., what managers put into practice) as well as the <italic>perceived</italic> HR system (i.e., how employees interpret practices). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206312440118">Nishii, Lepak, and Schneider (2008</xref>: 528) note that “there is likely to be a disconnect between intended HR practices as reported by managers and the effect of actual HR practices that is at least partially explained by differential meanings imposed on those practices by employees.” This disconnect is problematic if the performance effects of HR practices are argued to (in part) come about via the perceptions of individual employees. The limited empirical evidence available suggests that this disconnect may indeed exist, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206312440118">Liao et al. (2009)</xref> find only a moderate relationship between perceptions of HR practices of managers and employees in the same units. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206312440118">Nishii et al. (2008)</xref> call for research on the differences between managerial and employee reports of HR and the implications of such differences.</p>
<p>The key purpose of our study is to contribute to current understanding of the effects of HR practices in two ways. First, we offer another test of how line manager reports on the availability of HR practices relate to employee perceptions of these HR practices and, in turn, to HR outcomes. Specifically, we include job satisfaction and perceived unit performance. We explicitly take both within- and between-group differences into account. At the between-group level, we expect that in units in which the managers offer more HRM, unit employees will also perceive more HR practices, and in turn, in such units, satisfaction and perceived performance are likely to be higher. In addition, within every group, employees who perceive more HRM are likely to be more satisfied and perceive higher performance. Thus, we also expect relationships at the within-group level, and we use multilevel structural equations modeling, which allows for testing both within- and between-groups effects simultaneously. Our second and main aim is to contribute to the understanding of the relationship between manager and employee reports of HRM by examining the quality of managers’ communication as a moderator of this relationship. We argue that when the quality of managers’ communication is high, managers’ intentions and organizational policies are clearer to employees, resulting in a stronger relationship between manager and employee reports of HRM. This proposed moderating role of communication has not yet been tested.</p>
<p>We report the results of a multisource, multilevel study among employees and managers of over 100 branches of a restaurant chain. Using data from a single firm keeps the intended HR system or paper policy constant and makes it possible to examine variance in manager-rated HR practices and employee-rated HR practices. To lay the groundwork for testing our main hypotheses, we argue that unit-level manager-rated HRM relates to HR outcomes (satisfaction and employees’ unit performance perceptions) and test whether employee-rated HRM mediates these relationships. In addition, our main aim is to test the moderating role of the quality of managers’ communication. The conceptual model for this study is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206312440118">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Manager-Rated HRM, Perceived Unit Performance, and Satisfaction</title>
<p>SHRM research mostly takes a systems approach to study the impact of bundles of HR practices on performance. Several theoretical perspectives contribute to the understanding of the HRM–performance link (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206312440118">Wright &amp; McMahan, 1992</xref>). For example, the behavioral perspective focuses on how HR elicits and reinforces the unique set of employee attitudes and role behaviors required for the successful implementation of a firm’s strategic objectives (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206312440118">Schuler &amp; Jackson, 1987</xref>). In line with this, recent work stresses the importance of integrated sets of ability, motivation, and opportunity enhancing HR practices in relation to employee- and, in turn, firm-level outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206312440118">Delery &amp; Shaw, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206312440118">Gardner, Wright, &amp; Moynihan, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study builds on the notion that HR practices can affect performance through building a motivated and knowledgeable workforce and through creating opportunities for this workforce to contribute to achieving strategic objectives (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206312440118">Wright &amp; Snell, 1998</xref>). In this vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206312440118">Boxall (1996)</xref> distinguishes between “human capital advantage” and “human process advantage.” Human capital advantage results from employing and retaining people with competitively valuable knowledge, skills, and abilities. Human process advantage results from difficult-to-imitate, highly evolved processes within the firm. Such processes create motivating working conditions and opportunities for employees to flourish, show the desired strategically important behaviors, and use their talents. HR practices thus enhance performance through building a better human capital pool and creating better processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206312440118">Wright &amp; Snell, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Authors have proposed different synergistic combinations of practices (High Performance or Involvement Work Systems) that positively affect outcomes through creating human capital and process advantages (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206312440118">Delaney &amp; Huselid, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206312440118">Delery, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206312440118">Wright &amp; McMahan, 1992</xref>). These work systems form coherent combinations of (sets of) practices that are argued to collectively enhance organizational performance through creating better human capital and processes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206312440118">Becker and Huselid (1998</xref>: 63) observe that the SHRM literature demonstrates a preference “for a unitary index that contains a set (though not always the same set) of theoretically appropriate HRM practices derived from prior work.” They hold that such coherent systems of HR practices constitute the appropriate level of analysis rather than single or isolated practices as it is the system as a whole that forms the strategic asset. Studies generally find positive associations of these varying but integrated systems with outcomes such as productivity, turnover, financial and service performance, commitment, and satisfaction (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206312440118">Batt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206312440118">Becker &amp; Gerhart, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206312440118">Delaney &amp; Huselid, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206312440118">Guest, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206312440118">Guthrie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206312440118">Huselid, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206312440118">MacDuffie, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206312440118">Verburg, Den Hartog, &amp; Koopman, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In operationalizing a High Performance Work System (HPWS) we build on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206312440118">Bamberger and Meshoulam (2000)</xref>, who hold that SHRM studies tend to feature either a resource-based perspective or a control-based view to High Performance HR practices. The resource-based approach focuses on HR practices aimed at employee development (training, careers) and the control-based one on managing employee performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206312440118">Snell, 1992</xref>). Bamberger and Meshoulam combined these into one overall set of High Performance HR practices (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206312440118">Sun et al., 2007</xref>) that reflects three main HR subsystems: (1) people flow, including staffing, employee mobility, and training, (2) appraisal and reward, including performance appraisal, compensation, and benefits, and (3) employment relation, including job design and participation. These subsystems include skills-, motivation-, and empowerment-enhancing practices, and in combination this work system should enhance employees’ skills, motivation, and discretionary effort, ultimately leading to higher performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206312440118">Appelbaum, Bailey, Berg, &amp; Kalleberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206312440118">Gardner et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study includes the people flow practices of training, development, and promotion opportunities, the appraisals and reward practice of performance management, and the employment relation practices of teamwork, autonomy, and job design in a High Performance Work System, and we expect this system as a whole to relate positively to HR outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206312440118">Dyer and Reeves (1995)</xref> distinguish four types of HR outcomes (employee, unit/organizational, financial, and market). Employee outcomes can be affective (e.g., satisfaction) or behavioral (e.g., citizenship). Several authors have stressed that HR can contribute both to “happy” and “productive” workplaces (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206312440118">Cropanzano &amp; Wright, 2001</xref>). In that light, both well-being and performance-oriented HR outcomes are of interest, and we include job satisfaction and perceived unit performance. We expect the High Performance Work System that is implemented by managers to be positively related to employee perceptions of unit performance (employee ratings of the quality of products, customer service, cleanliness, and performance as an employer). As indicated, High Performance HR practices are expected to enhance employees’ knowledge, skills, and abilities as well as increase employee motivation and participation in decision making (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206312440118">Huselid, 1995</xref>), which is likely to create human capital and process advantages. Such advantages are expected to be associated with higher unit performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206312440118">Delaney &amp; Huselid, 1996</xref>). Therefore, we expect that between-unit differences occur as perceived unit performance will be higher in units in which the managers rate HRM higher.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1a</italic>: Manager-rated HRM relates positively to perceived unit performance.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Second, job satisfaction is a well-being-related variable that relates to individual behavioral outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206312440118">Judge, Thoresen, Bono, &amp; Patton, 2001</xref>) and unit-level performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206312440118">Harter, Schmidt, &amp; Hayes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206312440118">Ostroff, 1992</xref>). We expect that having a High Performance HR system implemented by managers will relate positively to employee satisfaction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206312440118">Appelbaum et al. (2000)</xref> argue that the opportunity to participate in decision making that forms part of this system leads to (1) trust between employees and supervisors and (2) workers experiencing their jobs as challenging and intrinsically rewarding. Trust and intrinsic rewards are in turn positively related to satisfaction. Research supports this. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206312440118">Guest (2002)</xref> found that direct participation schemes were related to satisfaction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206312440118">Boselie, Dietz, &amp; Boon, 2005</xref>, for a review of research on HR systems and satisfaction).</p>
<p>In addition, specific HR practices are also likely to relate to more specific facets of satisfaction such as satisfaction with pay, coworkers, or tasks. For example, participation affects workers’ ability to derive a sense of meaning from work and to achieve satisfaction with work itself (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206312440118">Cartwright &amp; Holmes, 2006</xref>). Practices such as teamwork and participation provide workers with greater autonomy and opportunities to contribute to decisions that can enhance satisfaction with influence. Rewards-related HR practices may enhance more extrinsic aspects, such as pay satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206312440118">Brown, Forde, Spencer, &amp; Charlwood, 2008</xref>). Satisfaction with specific facets is likely to enhance overall job satisfaction. In sum, we propose that the High Performance HR system relates positively to employees’ job satisfaction and that thus at the between-group level, satisfaction is higher in units in which manager-rated HRM is higher. We hypothesize,</p>

<title>Employee Perceptions of HR</title>
<p>As noted, individual-level mechanisms are seen as potentially important in the HR–performance relationship. Individual-level mediators that have been proposed include perceptions of climate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206312440118">Gelade &amp; Ivery, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206312440118">Rogg, Schmidt, Shull, &amp; Schmitt, 2001</xref>), commitment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206312440118">Ahmad &amp; Schroeder, 2003</xref>), and skills, attitudes, and motivation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206312440118">Park, Mitsuhashi, Fey, &amp; Bjorkman, 2003</xref>). Thus, one way in which HR systems are assumed to affect firm performance is through their impact on employees as the degree to which employees are motivated to behave in line with organizational goals is seen as vital for firm performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206312440118">Gottschalg &amp; Zollo, 2007</xref>). In line with this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206312440118">Nishii and Wright (2008)</xref> propose that intended and implemented HR practices affect outcomes via employee perceptions of these HR practices.</p>
<p>HR practices can be seen as signals of the organization’s intentions toward employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206312440118">Bowen &amp; Ostroff, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206312440118">Guzzo &amp; Noonan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206312440118">Tsui, Pearce, Porter, &amp; Tripoli, 1997</xref>). However, “HR practices communicate messages constantly and in unintended ways, and messages can be understood idiosyncratically, whereby two employees interpret the same practices differently” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206312440118">Bowen &amp; Ostroff, 2004</xref>: 206). Differences in personal experiences and idiosyncratic preferences may lead employees to react differently to practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206312440118">Bowen &amp; Ostroff, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206312440118">Den Hartog et al., 2004</xref>). Differences in implementation and communication may also lead to variation in HR perceptions of individual employees (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206312440118">Nishii et al., 2008</xref>). As a result, inconsistency can occur between <italic>espoused</italic> and <italic>inferred</italic> values and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206312440118">Martin &amp; Siehl, 1983</xref>). Thus, managers’ and employees’ reports of HR are likely to be related because managers’ interpretations of HR provide the context within which employee perceptions of HR practices are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206312440118">Liao et al., 2009</xref>); however, they are not necessarily the same.</p>
<p>If people perceive reality differently, then it is likely that not all employees will interpret HR systems similarly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206312440118">Nishii et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, a misalignment or disconnect can exist between manager- and employee-rated HR practices, which can affect HR outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206312440118">Liao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206312440118">Nishii et al., 2008</xref>). Because misalignment implies that employees do not have an accurate perception of HR policies and practices, the impact of these practices on employee outcomes is likely to be attenuated. HR practices are most likely to lead to desired outcomes when these are consistently perceived by employees in intended ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206312440118">Bowen &amp; Ostroff, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Methodologically, differences between manager and employee views also raise problems. In SHRM research, (HR) managers often act as organizational representatives and rate the HR practices offered by the organization. Their answers reflect either the intended or implemented HR practices, but neither is necessarily also a measure of how employees perceive HR practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206312440118">Liao et al., 2009</xref>). For firm-level HR research focusing on the HR system as designed rather than perceived this may be appropriate, yet for research on individual-level effects this has a drawback. There, employee perceptions of HR practices might “matter more” than manager perceptions as they are more closely linked to employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206312440118">Gerhart, Wright, &amp; McMahan, 2000</xref>). Using manager ratings may lead to an underestimation of the role of HR in employee outcomes. At the same time, focusing only on employee HR perceptions may lead to an overestimation of HRM for employee-rated outcomes, for example, due to single source bias. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206312440118">Nishii et al. (2008)</xref> thus call for research that explores both manager and employee reports of HR. Employee perceptions of HR may differ depending both on organizational and individual variables. In line with this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206312440118">Liao et al. (2009)</xref> find a moderate correlation between manager- and employee-rated HPWS (.39).</p>
<p>The available knowledge in this area is limited. We aim to contribute by relating manager and employee ratings of HR and testing whether managers affect employee outcomes through affecting employees’ HR perceptions. We also explore communication as a potential moderator of the relationship between manager- and employee-rated HRM. We expect that in units where managers implement more HRM (and thus manager-rated HRM is higher), employees will also perceive more HRM. Thus, a between-unit difference should occur. In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206312440118">Liao et al. (2009)</xref>, manager- and employee-rated HR are expected to be positively (but moderately) related:</p>

<title>Communication</title>
<p>Line managers are often primarily responsible for communication with employees about their work and on organizational information such as decisions, procedures, and policies. They are also typically involved in delivering and implementing the organization’s HR practices. If line managers differ in how they implement HR practices this is likely to translate into differences in employee perceptions of HR practices (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206312440118">Nishii &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>). Thus, misalignment between manager and employee perceptions of HR practices can occur when line managers are not sufficiently willing or able to perform these HR implementation tasks well, for example, due to a lack of (communication) skills or a lack of time due to other priorities. Here we focus on the quality of managers’ communication to employees as an important skill-related variable that may affect the relationship between manager and employee HRM perceptions.</p>
<p>We propose that the translation of what the firm intends to what employees see in terms of HR is likely to be affected by the quality of managers’ communication about the work and the organization. When managers are able to provide employees with accurate and useful task and organizational information, this aids employees’ sense making and reduces uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206312440118">Kernan &amp; Hanges, 2002</xref>). Such high quality communication helps employees understand their task and what is expected of them, to see what is offered by the organization (e.g., policies, practices), and to understand reasons behind organizational decisions and enacted procedures. We conceptualize the quality of managers’ organizational communication in terms of whether managers provide a sufficient amount of information about the work and organization to employees, whether employees understand the information they receive from their managers, and whether employees find the information communicated by managers useful. When the messages managers send to employees are clear, sufficient, and consistent, employees are likely to have more accurate insight in organizational policies, including those related to HR. Likely it is thus also clearer to them what HR practices the firm implements. When managers are inconsistent and confusing in their messages, there is less clarity and more uncertainty about organizational issues. Employees may then be more likely to rely on their own subjective perceptions when interpreting HR practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206312440118">Nishii et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, employees’ perceptions of the offered HR practices are likely to be more shared and relate more to what HR practices the line managers indicate they implement when communication is clear, sufficient, and consistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206312440118">Nishii &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This suggested importance of the quality of managers’ communication is in line with the work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206312440118">Bowen and Ostroff (2004</xref>: 208), who state that “in order to function effectively in a social context and make accurate attributions about a situation, an employee must have adequate and unambiguous information.” They argue that proper communication is needed in order to create a strong situation in which the HR system has the desired effect on employees. Message-based persuasion literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206312440118">Chaiken, Wood, &amp; Eagly, 1996</xref>) states that effective communication entails not only the content of the message but also the comprehension of the content and the acceptance of the message. Thus, the quality of managers’ communication relates to the “<italic>process</italic> by which a consistent message about HRM <italic>content</italic> can be sent to employees” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206312440118">Bowen &amp; Ostroff, 2004</xref>: 207). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206312440118">Nishii and Wright (2008)</xref> suggest that communication can influence the relationship between implemented HR practices and employee perceptions of those practices.</p>
<p>Although quality of manager communication has not yet been explicitly studied in HRM, related work suggests such quality varies and that both the style and content of communication affect employees. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206312440118">Kernan and Hanges (2002)</xref> found that quality of managers’ communication relates positively to employees’ justice perceptions and trust in managers. Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206312440118">Sharbrough, Simmons, and Cantrill (2006)</xref> found that the use of motivational language by managers relates positively with perceived manager effectiveness and employee satisfaction, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206312440118">Madlock (2008)</xref> shows that managers’ communication competence relates to satisfaction. If the quality of managers’ organizational communication is high, employees are likely to better comprehend what is intended in terms of HR and to develop a more accurate picture of available practices. This should reduce the gap between what is intended by managers and what is perceived by employees. In turn, this increased alignment and clarity about HR is likely to enhance their satisfaction and perceptions of unit performance (see below). We thus propose that communication acts as a moderator in the relationship between manager- and employee-rated HRM and expect that there is a better alignment between manager and employee views when the quality of communication is high than when it is low. We expect,</p>

Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206312440118">Takeuchi, Chen, and Lepak (2009)</xref> argue that shared climate perceptions in work units develop in part due to the social and structural stimuli all members of the same unit are exposed to (e.g., organizational or unit norms, leadership, and HR practices). As mentioned, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206312440118">Nishii and Wright (2008</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206312440118">Nishii et al., 2008</xref>) argue that in order for HR practices to achieve the desired effect on employee attitudes and behaviors, they first have to be perceived and interpreted subjectively by employees in ways that will engender attitudinal and behavioral reactions. Thus, at the between-group level, we expect besides the direct relationship between manager-rated HRM and perceived unit performance (Hypothesis 1a) that manager-rated HRM also relates to perceived performance through employee-rated HRM. In units in which managers provide more HRM, employees are likely to perceive more HRM and, in turn, perceive higher unit performance. Thus, we expect that employee-rated HRM acts as a mediator. However, in addition, manager-rated HRM may also affect unit-level performance through other means, for example, through building a superior human capital pool. Thus, we expect this mediation to be partial rather than full. We hypothesize,</p>

<p>Similarly, in units in which managers provide more HRM, employees are likely to perceive more HRM, and in turn satisfaction of employees in the unit is likely to be enhanced.

The causality of the relationship between employee-rated HRM and satisfaction might even run two ways in that better practices enhance satisfaction, but also more satisfied employees rate the quality of HRM as higher. However, our cross-sectional design does not enable us to test the direction of causality. We hypothesize,</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0149206312440118">
<title>Sample and Procedure</title>
<p>Employees and line managers of 119 branches of a restaurant chain in the Netherlands were asked to take part in a survey. The studied organization is characterized by a uniform managerial structure, and the HR policy developed at headquarters is intended to be used at all locations. Thus, local management has limited freedom in what they implement as many issues are standardized. The organization does not differentiate between employee groups in terms of HRM policies offered. Using many different units (branches) of one large firm helps keeping the designed or intended HR policy constant, while the emphasis placed by managers in the different units in what they try to implement and subsequently what shop-floor employees perceive may still differ across the units. Both employees and managers work in shifts supervised by the managers and thus employees interact with and report to multiple managers within the unit.</p>
<p>All invited employees and managers received a questionnaire and return envelope at their home address. An accompanying letter explained that participation was voluntary and the study was anonymous. They did not receive anything in return for participation. The scales for this study were included at the front end of a larger company questionnaire. The company items evaluated several practical issues (such as how employees rated the music played in the establishment and the room they had breaks in, whether they had lockers, and satisfaction with work uniforms). In total, 2,063 employees and 449 managers sent back questionnaires (approximately 54% response overall, varying from 40% to 65% per unit), with an average of 20 employees and 5 managers per branch.</p>
<p>Of the respondents 50% were men. Their average age is relatively low, which reflects the population of workers in this firm: 38.0% of the respondents were between 16 and 19 years old, 54.5% were between 20 and 30, and only 7.5% were over 30 years old. Average tenure was relatively short as 42% had worked for the organization for less than 18 months, 28% between 18 months and 3 years, and 30% for over 3 years. Finally, the firm has many part-time employees. Only employees with employment contracts of at least 8 hours (1 day) a week were included in the study. The small group of often-changing part-timers working only half a day a week was not invited as both their tenure and knowledge of the firm are likely to be very limited. Of the respondents, 51% work half-time or less and 49% work more than half-time (over 20 hours a week).</p>

<title>Measures: Employee Rated</title>
<p>To measure <italic>employee-rated HRM</italic>, employees filled out 10 items focusing on HR practices offered to the individual. People flow items covered training, development, and promotion, appraisal and reward items covered performance management, and employment relation items covered teamwork, autonomy, and job design. An example is, “Training (at different stations) is provided to me regularly” (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0149206312440118">appendix</xref> for the full set of items). A 7-point response scale was used (1 = <italic>not at all</italic> through 7 = <italic>very extensively</italic>). We did not include selection in the HR measure. In the studied firm selection is highly standardized and centrally organized (even first-line managers have little input). Jobs do not require extensive professional qualifications, and the firm focuses more on other people flow practices (such as training and socialization) than on differentiation through selection. As shop-floor employees are not involved in selection at all, they are not likely to have an accurate perception of the process.</p>
<p>To ensure construct validity, we performed a series of confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs). First, we tested the proposed three-factor structure. Analyses showed acceptable fit for the three-factor structure, χ<sup>2</sup>(32) = 645.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, Tucker–Lewis index (TLI) = .94, comparative fit index (CFI) = .96, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .07. However, correlations between the three factors were high (between .62 and .76), which corresponds with the results of other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206312440118">Takeuchi, Lepak, Wang, &amp; Takeuchi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206312440118">Wu &amp; Chaturvedi, 2009</xref>). Therefore, we performed another CFA, testing a model including one second-order factor representing the whole HR system. This model was found to fit the data significantly better than the three-factor model, χ<sup>2</sup>(28) = 329.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; TLI = .95, CFI = .97, RMSEA = .07, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>diff</sub>(4) = 315.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. This model also fitted better than a one-factor model, χ<sup>2</sup>(35) = 957.66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; TLI = .82, CFI = .86, RMSEA = .11, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>diff</sub>(7) = 627.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Therefore, we combined the full set of HRM items into three subsystems scores and then combined these in one aggregate HR system measure. Cronbach’s alpha of this measure was .85. ICC(1) was .10.</p>
<p><italic>Communication</italic> was measured with three items filled out by employees. The measure of communication quality is similar to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206312440118">Kernan and Hanges (2002)</xref>, and the items asked employees to rate whether their managers provide them sufficient work- and organization-related information, whether they understand the communicated information, and whether it is useful to them. Employees reported to all managers in the branch. As everyone works in shifts, employees report to the managers on duty. Thus, they rated the communication of their managers overall and not of a specific supervisor. The items read, “To what extent do you agree with the following statements on the managers’ communication and the information they provide about your work and the organization? ‘My managers provide a sufficient amount of information to me,’ ‘The information provided by my managers is useful,’ and ‘I understand the information communicated by my managers.’” We used a 7-point scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). Items were adapted from the Communicator Competence Questionnaire developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206312440118">Monge, Bachman, Dillard, and Eisenberg (1982)</xref>. In addition to the items we selected that focus on whether managers provide sufficient amounts of useful information that employees understand (to correspond with the conceptualization quality of manager communication), the full instrument also addresses whether managers share and respond to information in a timely manner, actively listen to other viewpoints, and utilize different communication channels. Due to space limitations, we used only the aforementioned three items. Cronbach’s alpha was .79. ICC(1) was .06. Some authors assess HR-focused communication by the organization as part of the HR system (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206312440118">Guthrie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206312440118">Huselid, 1995</xref>). Here, however, we focused specifically on the overall quality of managers’ general organization- and work-related communication. This can include but is not limited to HR issues. The measure did not include content of communication or other ways in which the firm can communicate (HR) issues to employees. Thus, we expect this to be different from HR practices (below we report CFAs to test the measurement model).</p>
<p><italic>Satisfaction</italic> was measured with a single item: “Overall, how satisfied are you with your job?” Previous research has proven the reliability of a one-item measure for job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206312440118">Scarpello &amp; Campbell, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206312440118">Wanous, Reichers, &amp; Hudy, 1997</xref>). A 7-point response scale (1 = <italic>very dissatisfied</italic> through 7 = <italic>very satisfied</italic>) was used. ICC(1) was .06.</p>
<p><italic>Perceived unit performance</italic> was measured with four items measuring overall unit performance. The scale was developed specifically for the organization of our study and is based on existing measures of perceived organizational performance, which generally cover different aspects of performance, such as product or service quality, customer satisfaction, and reputation-related aspects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206312440118">Delaney &amp; Huselid, 1996</xref>). The items asked employees to rate the quality of the products served to customers, the quality of the customer service provided in the unit, the cleanliness of the restaurant, and how well they felt the unit performed as an employer on a 7-point scale (1 = <italic>very poor</italic> through 7 = <italic>very good</italic>). We computed an aggregate performance scale by averaging the four items. Cronbach’s alpha of this scale was .73. ICC(1) was .11. As we did not have access to customers, employees filled out all of these items. Research suggests that customer and employee ratings of service quality and performance are related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206312440118">Schneider, White, &amp; Paul, 1998</xref>). In SHRM research, HR or general manager perceptions of firm performance are also often used as a performance indicator (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206312440118">Bae &amp; Lawler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206312440118">Delaney &amp; Huselid, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206312440118">Den Hartog &amp; Verburg, 2004</xref>). Employee ratings also tend to be related to manager ratings. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206312440118">Van Woerkom and Croon (2009)</xref> found a .60 correlation between manager and employee ratings of team effectiveness. Employees perform all three tasks referred to in the items and observe their colleagues doing these same tasks (preparing products to be served to the customer, providing customer service, and ensuring a clean environment). Thus, we specifically selected elements of unit performance that employees could have informed views on (not, e.g., financial performance of which their knowledge would be limited).</p>

<sec id="section8-0149206312440118">
<title>Measures: Manager Rated</title>
<p>In addition to the 2,063 employees, 449 managers (on average of 5 per unit) participated. The 10 <italic>manager-rated HRM</italic> items (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0149206312440118">appendix</xref>) correspond with those of employees. The instruction to managers was to indicate the extent to which managers offered these employment practices to employees in the unit. An example is, “Training (at different stations) is provided to employees regularly.” All items were filled out in Dutch using the same response scales as for employees. We again performed a series of CFAs, and the results correspond with those of employee-rated HRM as the best fitting model was a second-order model with one overall factor representing the whole HR system, χ<sup>2</sup>(28) = 55.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; TLI = .97, CFI = .98, RMSEA = .05. Therefore, we first combined the HRM items into three subsystems, then summed these to form an overall HR system measure. Cronbach’s alpha was .86.</p>
<p>We used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206312440118">James, Demaree, and Wolf’s (1984)</xref> <italic>r<sub>wg</sub></italic> within-group agreement index to justify aggregating individual managers’ ratings of HRM to the branch level. The mean <italic>r<sub>wg</sub></italic> value for manager-rated HRM is .74, which is above the suggested .70 cutoff point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206312440118">James et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206312440118">Klein &amp; Kozlowski, 2000</xref>). This supports aggregation. We also tested whether average scores on manager-rated HRM differed between branches, using an <italic>F</italic> test from a one-way analysis of variance contrasting branch means. The test showed a significant between branch difference (<italic>F</italic> = 1.55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The ICC(1) for manager-rated HRM is .11, and ICC(2) is .71, which also suggests that aggregation is allowed. Thus, we aggregated manager-rated HRM to the branch level.</p>
<p>We performed a series of CFAs to examine the distinctiveness of the variables. We compared the fit of the hypothesized four-factor model (satisfaction was not included as it was a single item) with four alternative models: three-factor models combining employee-rated HRM and communication (Model 1), combining employee-rated HRM and unit performance (Model 2), and combining communication and unit performance (Model 3), and a two-factor model with all employee-rated items loading on one factor and all manager-rated items loading on a second factor (Model 4). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0149206312440118">Table 1</xref> shows the results indicating support for the hypothesized four-factor model and, therefore, the distinctiveness of the variables in this study.</p>

<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Taking the multilevel structure of our data into account, we applied multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) to test our hypotheses, using Mplus software. These analyses include both differences between groups and within groups (differences between individuals controlled for differences between groups). Having hypothesized some relationships at the between-group level, we needed to test these relationships at the unit level. Traditional multilevel linear models (MLMs) would then aggregate the variables in question and take only group means into account in analyses. Such an analysis on aggregated data is meant to capture only the differences between the groups and to be free of the variability within the groups. This is however not the case as the variance–covariance matrix of the aggregated variables not only is a function of the between-group differences but also partly reflects the within-group differences. Whether the contribution of the within-group components is large or not depends on the group size, but also on their relative value compared to their between-group counterpart, that is on the intraclass correlations (ICC) of the observed variables. Analyses based only on the covariances among the group means may thus be misleading as they will reflect not only differences between the groups but also differences within the groups. Thus, the results of an analysis on aggregated data cannot unequivocally be interpreted in terms of differences between the groups. MSEM provides benefits over using this aggregation approach as it avoids such problems by allowing for separate estimation of between-group and within-group relationships (for advantages of MSEM, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206312440118">Preacher, Zhang, &amp; Zyphur, 2011</xref>). In an MSEM model, based on theoretical considerations, both between-group and within-group relationships are estimated. The between part of the model gives estimates of relationships at the higher unit level, whereas the within part of the model describes the variation and covariation of variables within the units.</p>
<p>The importance of theoretical choices underpinning the complex relationships studied in multilevel models is stressed in the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206312440118">Hofmann, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206312440118">Hofmann &amp; Gavin, 1998</xref>). Thus, we based our modeling approach on theoretical choices. To test our hypotheses, we ran three multilevel SEM models. First, to test Hypotheses 1a and 1b and Hypothesis 2, a model including the relationships of manager-rated HRM with employee-rated HRM, satisfaction, and perceived unit performance was tested. As manager-rated HRM is a branch-level variable that does not vary within groups, the hypothesized relationships can occur only at the between-group level, and consequently these relationships were modeled at the between level.</p>
<p>Second, to test Hypotheses 4a and 4b and 5a and 5b, we tested a model with direct relationships between manager-rated HRM and unit performance and satisfaction, as well as indirect relationships via employee-rated HRM. We tested these hypotheses simultaneously in one model. As Hypotheses 4a and 4b propose within-group relationships among employee-rated HRM, satisfaction, and unit performance, these relationships were modeled at the within-group level. In addition, to test the mediating relationships proposed in Hypotheses 5a and 5b, direct relationships between manager-rated HRM and unit performance and satisfaction as well as indirect relationships via employee-rated HRM were modeled at the between-group level.</p>
<p>Third, to test Hypothesis 3, we tested a model combining the hypothesized relationships in this study in one analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206312440118">Figure 1</xref>), thus testing whether the proposed moderation of communication in the relationship between manager-rated and employee-rated HRM occurs and, in turn, is related to perceived unit performance and satisfaction. We fitted this model to the data as a multilevel path model by implementing the appropriate procedures in Mplus. The path model assumes that communication is a moderating variable that affects the relationship between manager-rated HRM and employee-rated HRM. Following the guidelines of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206312440118">Preacher, Rucker, and Hayes (2007)</xref>, to test moderated mediation in a single model, employee-rated HRM is regressed on manager-rated HRM, communication, and their product to test the interaction effect of manager-rated HRM and communication on employee-rated HRM. The outcome variables, perceived unit performance and satisfaction, are regressed on manager-rated HRM, communication, and employee-rated HRM. Manager-rated HRM and the interaction between manager-rated HRM and communication on employee-rated HRM, satisfaction, and perceived unit performance were modeled on the between level. Employee-rated HRM on satisfaction and perceived unit performance were modeled on the within level to represent the individual-level relationships as proposed in Hypotheses 4a and 4b. Our communication measure refers to all managers in the branch (thus can vary at the between level), yet communication is a perceptual variable measured at the individual level that also can vary between individuals (e.g., based on different preferences or experiences); thus, relationships including communication were modeled both at the between and within levels.</p>
<p>To eliminate (nonessential) forms of multicollinearity, all variables (except the product term) were first grand mean centered. We used grand mean as opposed to group mean centering because we are interested in the absolute values rather than the relative position of the person in the group. Maximum-likelihood estimation was used in all analyses. We report chi-square statistics and significance for all analyses. As chi-square significance is affected by sample size and the size of the correlations between study variables, we also used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206312440118">Hu and Bentler’s (1999)</xref> fit criteria, recommending cutoff values of .95 for the CFI and TLI and less than .06 for the RMSEA. We used maximum-likelihood estimation for missing data, using all available data.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics, reliabilities, and correlations are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206312440118">Table 2</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206312440118">Table 2</xref> shows that manager-rated HRM is significantly positively related to perceived unit performance (.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), employee satisfaction (.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and employee-rated HRM (.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), although correlations are rather low. Hypotheses 1a and 1b proposed that manager-rated HRM relates positively to perceived unit performance (Hypothesis 1a) and employee satisfaction (1b), and Hypothesis 2 proposed that manager-rated HRM is positively related to employee-rated HRM. Our first model tests these hypotheses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0149206312440118">Figure 2</xref> shows the (standardized) results of this analysis. This model fits the data well, χ<sup>2</sup>(0) = 0.00, <italic>ns</italic>; TLI = 1.00, CFI = 1.00, RMSEA = .00. Results show that manager-rated HRM is significantly related to perceived unit performance (.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), employee satisfaction (.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and employee-rated HRM (.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Thus, in units in which the managers rate HRM higher, perceived unit performance, employee satisfaction, and employee-rated HRM are also higher, supporting Hypotheses 1a, 1b, and 2.</p>

<p>Hypotheses 5a and 5b proposed a mediating role of employee-rated HRM in the relationship between manager-rated HRM and perceived unit performance (Hypothesis 5a) and employee satisfaction (Hypothesis 5b) at the between-group level. Results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0149206312440118">Figure 3</xref>) show that between groups, manager-rated HRM significantly predicts employee-rated HRM (.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), but when employee-rated HRM is taken into account, manager-rated HRM has no direct effect on perceived unit performance (.03, <italic>ns</italic>) or satisfaction (.03, <italic>ns</italic>). Employee-rated HRM has a significant effect on perceived performance (.59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and satisfaction (.74, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and manager-rated HRM has a significant effect on both perceived unit performance and satisfaction, via employee-rated HRM. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206312440118">Preacher and Hayes (2004)</xref> suggest two conditions need to be met in testing mediation. First, there should be an effect to be mediated. Second, the indirect effect should be statistically significant in the predicted direction. The first condition is met, as our first analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0149206312440118">Figure 2</xref>) shows significant relationships of manager-rated HRM with satisfaction and perceived unit performance. Second, the indirect effect from manager-rated HRM via employee-rated HRM to satisfaction (.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and perceived unit performance (.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) are both significant and positive. Thus, employee-rated HRM fully mediates the relationship between manager-rated HRM and perceived unit performance and satisfaction, which provides partial support for Hypothesis 5a (proposing partial mediation for performance) and full support for Hypothesis 5b (proposing full mediation for satisfaction).</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3 proposed the moderating role of communication in the relationship of manager-rated HRM with employee-rated HRM. The moderated mediation model we tested included all proposed relationships at the specified theoretical level (see above). This model fitted the data well, χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 9.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; TLI = .97, CFI = 1.00, RMSEA = .03. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206312440118">Table 3</xref> contains the main results and shows the estimates for both the between and the within parts of the model.</p>

<p>For satisfaction, results show that communication and employee-rated HRM are significant predictors, but manager-rated HRM is not. A similar pattern of results was found for unit performance. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206312440118">Preacher et al. (2007)</xref> we estimated conditional coefficients (i.e., simple effects) for the first stage (path from manager- to employee-rated HRM) and the second stage (paths from employee-rated HRM to outcomes) and direct (paths from manager-rated HRM to outcomes), indirect (paths from manager-rated HRM to outcomes via employee-rated HRM), and total effects of each path across levels of the moderator variable (communication) for both satisfaction and unit performance as outcomes. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0149206312440118">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0149206312440118">5</xref> present these simple effects. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0149206312440118">Table 4</xref> shows that manager-rated HRM has a significant negative indirect effect on satisfaction for low scores and a significant positive indirect effect for high scores on communication.

Furthermore, a positive direct relationship is found between manager-rated HRM and unit performance for high scores on communication. Overall, these results provide support for our moderated mediation model, supporting Hypothesis 3.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main purpose of our study was to contribute to the SHRM literature by testing how manager- and employee-rated HR systems align and addressing the role of managers’ communication quality in this relationship. Below we summarize key findings, provide theoretical implications, strengths, limitations, and research suggestions, and finally provide some practical implications.</p>
<sec id="section12-0149206312440118">
<title>Key Findings: A Summary</title>
<p>The key findings of the current study are threefold. First, in line with the idea that manager ratings of implemented HRM and employee ratings of perceived HRM form separate constructs that are not necessarily aligned (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206312440118">Nishii &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>), we find that HRM at the unit level as rated by several managers per unit related positively but weakly to employees’ HRM perceptions. One explanation for the low correlation between manager and employee ratings could be that moderators of this relationship exist, and we argued that the quality of unit managers’ organizational communication could act as such a moderator. Thus, the second and main finding of our study is that when the quality of communication is high, the relationship between manager- and employee-rated HRM increases. Manager-rated HRM and employee-rated HRM are more aligned when unit employees see their managers’ communication on organizational issues as highly informative, useful, and clear. Finally, we find that both manager and employee ratings of HRM relate to two types of employee-rated HR outcomes, and for both we also find mediation: Employee-rated HRM mediates the relationship of manager-rated HRM both with job satisfaction and with perceived unit performance. This mediation of employee HRM perceptions has often been proposed, yet only few empirical tests of this role of employee perceptions exist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0149206312440118">
<title>Implications for Theory</title>
<p>Our findings have several theoretical implications. The weak overall correlation between manager and employee ratings of HRM supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206312440118">Nishii and Wright (2008)</xref>, who hold that the organization’s intended HR system may not fully overlap with what is implemented and even less with what is perceived by employees. It also adds to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206312440118">Liao et al. (2009)</xref> by replicating the important finding that we should not assume that the employee and management perspective are aligned. Low alignment is a problem if, for HR practices to affect employees, they first have to be perceived and interpreted in a way that motivates employees (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206312440118">Nishii et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206312440118">Nishii &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>). Enhancing employee motivation to expend effort and perform is less likely to occur if employees do not have a good understanding of the motivating HR practices that are offered to them by managers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206312440118">Liao et al. (2009)</xref> thus suggest that motivation-related employee attributes may be more directly influenced by employee interpretation of the work system than other employee attributes (such as ones more related to the human capital of the organization). The full mediation of employee HR perceptions in the relationship of manager-rated HRM with job satisfaction is in line with the motivating role of perceived High Performance Work Systems.</p>
<p>In addition, certain practices might build overall human capital (e.g., strict skills selection or providing skills training), which affects performance regardless of employees’ perceptions or appreciation of such practices. We thus expected that the relationship between manager-rated HRM and unit performance would only partially be mediated by employee-rated HRM as both motivation-based effects as well as such additional effects could play a role in the relationship between manager-rated HRM and perceived unit performance. Partially in line with expectations, this relationship was found only when there was high communication quality. Where there was low communication quality, no direct relationship was found between manager views of HRM and employee perceptions of unit performance. This seems to correspond with behavioral perspective in SHRM as high quality communication may help to effectively bring across the desired employee behaviors that are motivated and rewarded through HR practices, which then feeds into unit performance. The current study was done in an organization with low skilled work. In contexts with higher skilled jobs, the role of HRM in building a strong human capital pool may have stronger effects on performance than in this context of less skilled workers and standardized work processes. Future work could include motivation-related variables as well as variables related to the human capital pool such as employee knowledge and skills to further explain the mechanisms underlying the relationship of HRM with outcomes in different contexts.</p>
<p>From a theoretical perspective, this study departs from existing research that tends to focus either on HR content (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206312440118">Liao et al., 2009</xref>) or on the HR implementation process (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206312440118">Bowen &amp; Ostroff, 2004</xref>). In the current study, manager and employee perceptions of available HR practices relate to content and the quality of communication to the implementation process, and the findings suggest the need to take both content and implementation into account. High communication quality is needed to effectively implement HRM content. More generally, the measure of quality of organizational communication is in line with the meta-features of a strong HR system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206312440118">Bowen and Ostroff (2004)</xref> proposed a set of meta-features that may influence whether employees build shared perceptions about the HR system. These include understandability of the HR content, consistency of the HR messages, relevance of the HR system to the strategic goal, instrumentality of the system for employee consequences, agreement among HR decision makers, and fairness of practices. Thus, they see agreement on HR practices among managers, consistent implementation, and communication as characteristics of a strong HR system.</p>
<p>When communication quality was rated as low, the indirect relationship between manager-rated HRM and satisfaction and perceived unit performance became negative. That effect is stronger than expected as we hypothesized that lower alignment rather than misalignment would occur under conditions of low quality communication. This misalignment might reflect employees receiving inconsistent, insufficient, or contradicting information when communication is low in quality. This could happen in multiple ways, for example, one manager giving inconsistent information or information from one manager differing from that of other relevant sources (e.g., other managers, peers, documents). As noted, consistency across sources is seen as an important part of HR system strength, and inconsistency in communication may have strong effects.</p>
<p>Signaling theory holds that signal consistency, defined as the agreement between multiple signals from one source, is important because conflicting signals confuse the receiver and are therefore less effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206312440118">Connelly, Certo, Ireland, &amp; Reutzel, 2011</xref>). If manager communication on organizational issues is unclear or inconsistent, employees receive confusing signals. Then, rather than having accurate information on intended or implemented HR practices, employees likely rely more on their own subjective interpretations of what is offered in terms of HRM (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206312440118">Nishii et al., 2008</xref>). Employees may also turn to other sources such as peers whose information on firm policies is also likely to be less accurate when unit managers’ communication is inconsistent. Such confusion likely negatively affects the relationship between manager- and employee-rated HRM and may even cause misalignment, which, in turn, can affect HR outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206312440118">Bowen &amp; Ostroff, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206312440118">Nishii et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206312440118">Nishii &amp; Wright, 2008</xref>). Signal inconsistency can occur with different signals from one manager but also between managers. In the current study, employees and managers work in rotating shifts, and, depending on who is on duty, employees report to all managers. This setting thus heightens the potential problem of signal inconsistency as different managers may view organizational issues including HR differently. As noted, agreement among managers is needed for a strong HR system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206312440118">Bowen &amp; Ostroff, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The research setting implied a focus on the communication of managers overall and not on the dyadic relationship between employee and line manager. The leader-member exchange (LMX) model emphasizes the role of dyadic relationship quality and argues that LMX affects many outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206312440118">Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995</xref>). For example, a meta-analysis shows LMX correlates with member job performance, satisfaction, and role clarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206312440118">Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997</xref>). Such dyadic relationships of managers and employees may also affect HR implementation as the relationship between manager- and employee-rated HR (and in turn employee outcomes) may be stronger when the relationship between manager and employee is of higher quality. Employees are likely to pay more attention to the behavior and communication of managers they have a high quality relationship with. Conversely, managers are likely to be more attentive to the needs of followers whom they have a better relationship with and are more likely to use all HR tools at their disposal to meet their needs and motivate them. Yet if managers have high and low LMX relationships in the group they lead, inconsistencies in communication and HR implementation may occur; thus, inconsistency in signals remains a concern.</p>

<title>Strengths, Limitations, and Suggestions for Research</title>
<p>The current study has several strengths, including the relatively large sample of business units, employees, and managers, the multilevel nature of the study, and the use of different rater sources for some variables. Conducting this study in one firm has advantages and drawbacks. An advantage is that the intended HR system was kept constant; thus, we can be more confident than in a multiorganization study that variations we find are due to the perceptions of managers and the way they implement HRM in the units and employee perceptions. However, the generalizability to other firms or sectors may suffer from this focus on one specific firm, and additional research in other contexts is needed. The study setting may have impacted some results. An example is that employees report to multiple managers depending on who is in charge during their shift. This means that we could not take into account that the quality of managers’ communication can vary across managers. Also, the rather strict overall HR policies of this organization leave relatively little room for managers to vary in what they choose to implement. They thus are likely trying to do similar things in terms of HR practices. In addition, employees do relatively low skilled work and all have similar tasks; this too may lead to less variation in what managers implement. Yet we did find sufficient meaningful variation and manager HR ratings relate significantly to employee HR ratings and outcomes.</p>
<p>Additional limitations include that perceived unit performance ratings were gathered from employees. Employees rated elements of unit performance that relate to their job and that they can judge, such as customer service and employee ratings of customer service relate to those of customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206312440118">Schneider et al., 1998</xref>). Performance perceptions of employees are also practically relevant to firms in their own right, for example, because employees may share these with others, and thus they have a reputation effect through word of mouth. However, there are also problems with this source of ratings. Employee perceptions may be affected by other factors such as their attitudes. The relatively strong variation within groups suggests individual-level variables indeed impact such ratings. We do find some agreement among employees on how well their unit performs; thus, ratings go beyond purely personal biases. Yet shared biases (e.g., liking of the managers) could also affect ratings. Also, single source and common method variance may have influenced our results. More broadly speaking, source and logical distance issues affect this type of study that tries to link either manager- or employee-rated HRM to manager- or employee-rated outcomes. Simply using managers as the source of performance ratings does not solve the source issue (but rather shifts it) as any same source ratings likely relate more strongly to each other.</p>
<p>The main purpose of our study was to establish an interaction effect, and in such cases some have argued that problems with method bias are less pronounced as such bias leads to attenuation of interaction terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206312440118">Lindell &amp; Whitney, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206312440118">Siemsen, Roth, &amp; Oliveira, 2010</xref>). Future work is needed to test the effect of employee-rated HRM on additional performance outcomes though. In the setting of our study, customer ratings of unit performance would have made a more ideal performance measure, and future research in this sector could focus on this.</p>
<p>The cross-sectional nature of this study implies that the direction of effects is argued theoretically rather than tested. Reversed causation or bidirectionality may play a role. Generally the idea that better performing firms may have more money to spend on HR practices may be as valid as the idea that beneficial HR practices increase financial performance (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206312440118">Wright, Gardner, Moynihan, &amp; Allen, 2005</xref>). Similarly at the individual level, whether HRM leads employees to be more satisfied and perceive the unit to perform better or whether more satisfied employees also perceive better unit performance and provide higher HRM ratings is not clear. Thus, this study does not test whether satisfaction and performance perceptions affect HR ratings or vice versa or both. Future (longitudinal) research is needed regarding direction of causality.</p>
<p>As noted, we did not include staffing in the HR measure as in the studied firm employees are not involved in selection and are not likely to have an accurate perception of the process. This firm has a highly standardized and centrally organized selection process (even first-line managers have little input) and focuses more on other practices such as socialization and training than on differentiation through strict selection to motivate employees and build human capital. However, conceptually, staffing practices form an important part of High Performance Work Systems that relate especially to building the human capital pool. It would be interesting to also research firms where staffing practices can be included in the measures.</p>
<p>Also, as only few relevant measures of communication quality were available, we used a shortened version of an existing scale. The items were similar to those used in related work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206312440118">Kernan &amp; Hanges, 2002</xref>), and our measurement model provided some validity information, yet additional validation and further development of communication measures taking other aspects into account (e.g., consistency in and across sources) are important. Individual differences and the frequency of contact or the aforementioned quality of the dyadic relationship (LMX) between managers and employees may also affect perceptions of communication. Future research could also examine additional moderators that may affect the relationship between manager- and employee-rated HRM such as supervisor (HR) skills or leadership style.</p>
<p>We focused on HR at the system level and looked at an overall HR system combining integrated sets of practices. Yet whether there is higher agreement between manager and employee ratings for some practices than others is also of interest. Managerial and employee perceptions might be more aligned for practices that are more directly linked to the HR roles that managers perform (e.g., appraisal), while how employees perceive a practice such as job design (e.g., meaningful tasks) may be less strongly linked to managers’ views as individual differences and preferences may play a stronger role there. In addition, we studied manager-rated HRM at the unit level. While aggregation was supported, there was also clear variation between managers in units. They did not always all strongly agree on HR implementation within units. Although research has started to address differences between employees and between employees and managers, this suggests the variability between different managers in a unit regarding HR also forms an important focus for future work as such variation is likely to affect HR outcomes.</p>

<title>Practical Implications</title>
<p>In line with related work, our study suggests that implementing High Performance Work Systems may “pay off” in terms of well-being and performance-related HR outcomes. The results suggest an important role for employee HR perceptions. Thus, in implementing an HR system, managers need to make sure that the intended system is also seen and understood by employees. Our service sector sample was one of employees in low skilled shift work jobs that consist for a large part of customer contact. Turnover in these jobs tends to be high. In addition, the firm has a uniform HR policy leaving little room for managers to vary in implementation. The low overall correlation of manager- and employee-rated HR suggests that a disconnect can occur even in a rather standardized context with pressure for uniformity in HR practices. Firms thus cannot rely solely on a strict paper policy and assume this will reach employees as intended.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that line managers’ clear, informative, and useful communication forms a crucial tool in effectively implementing HRM, and in the context of the studied firm the communication by managers may be even more crucial than the specific content of HR practices in affecting employee outcomes. Only when communication was high in quality did manager-rated HRM translate into employee perceptions. Also, managerial reports of implemented HR practices are more positive than employee HR ratings. This could just reflect self-serving bias of managers, yet it could also reflect the different roles that managers and employees perform and their differential access to information on intended HR policies. Managers have better insight in the firm’s intended HR policies and form the main filter of this information for employees. Only when they are able and attentive to communicating this information clearly and understandably does this positively affect employee-rated HRM. This calls attention to the role of line managers’ motivation and communication skills or more broadly their HR capabilities and highlights that developing such capabilities forms crucial HR tasks in organizations.</p>
