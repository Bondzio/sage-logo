<p>This remarkable book on social cohesion examines a topic which has been of interest to sociologists since the discipline was founded. Many wonder whether we are witnessing a major decline in social cohesion owing to globalization, the weakening of the nation state, rapidly changing values associated with hyper-modernization, and the emergence of a global economic crisis. The authors respond by examining the discourses and traditions of social cohesion often specific to a group of countries, and by investigating whether regimes of social cohesion can be identified along with their capacity to withstand the above processes by means of quantitative comparative analyses of institutional and opinion-related data.</p>
<p>Andy Green and Jan Janmaat searched the current literature for the best way to define the concept of social cohesion, which is seen more as a process than a stable condition. They submit that from a societal and institutionalist perspective, “Social cohesion refers to the property by which whole societies, and the individuals within them, are bound together through the action of specific attitudes, behaviours, rules and institutions which rely on consensus rather than pure coercion” (p. 18). Equality, common identities, diversity, and shared values are key words in discussions that identify three types of discourse: liberal, republican, and social-democratic.</p>
<p>Criticizing current research for ignoring social thought underlying “Western Intellectual Traditions of Social Cohesion,” the authors identify the founders of these traditions, and what differentiates them and the countries where their influence predominates. The goal of this approach is to conceptualize the “regimes of social cohesion” that would result from the institutionalization of ideological positions on social harmony in social discourse and practices.</p>
<p>The authors first discuss the liberal tradition of Locke and Mill which gives priority to the individual and the natural harmony of interests, then Tocqueville who on the contrary focuses on the role of civil society and democratic processes. The French republican tradition, conceived by Rousseau, was developed by Durkheim as opposed to the liberal current with an emphasis on social solidarity, an important notion for the social democratic political tradition. The authors brought Herder’s and Schlegel’s romantic conservative tradition in Germany into the fore—an ambiguous current that sees society as an organic totality, a vision highly contested today by many sociologists. Social cohesion in this vision is understood as the “submission of the individual to the state,” leading to “a particularly toxic version of nationalist thought” (pp. 38–39).</p>
<p>Green and Janmaat focus on the correspondence between these traditions and national institutional regimes using historiographic research. The authors submit that even if country-specific intellectual traditions were eclipsed by different <italic>conjonctures</italic> and reform movements, intellectual legacies regained strength and continued to generate specific regimes despite having mutated. Although they readily identified liberal countries and social-democratic northern countries, the authors encountered difficulty classifying continental European Union countries, which were rather rapidly grouped under the title of “European Social Market” (p. 57) which meant they had to combine republicanism and romantic conservatism.</p>
<p>The approach became far more cumbersome when they attempted to identify contemporary regimes of social cohesion from a comparative institutionalist and societal perspective, which was inspired more by Esping-Andersen’s analysis of welfare state regimes than Hall and Soskice’s analysis of “varieties of capitalism.” The authors retain three Western regime ideal-types: liberal, social democratic (Nordic countries), and social market (shared values and reliance on the state), the archetype of which would be Germany. Moreover they identify, with reservations, a “distinctive East Asian Regime” (stability and peace) used in their empirical analyses.</p>
<p>To flesh out these ideal-types, Green and Janmaat perform a series of secondary analyses of administrative data (social expenditures, income inequality, crime rate…), and international survey data on values and attitudes (social trust, diversity, xenophobia…) to build clusters of OECD countries. The consistency between ideal-types and the results according to the variables and type of analysis (scatterplots, cluster, indexes, or factor analysis) is not always evident. Nation states represent complex configurations that are difficult to reduce to ideal-types on the basis of high level verification. Although the analyses easily group northern socio-democratic countries together in contrast to liberal countries (but not without forcing the issue in the case of Canada where inequalities are less pronounced than in the United States and the United Kingdom and social policies differ, especially regionally) they have far more difficulty validating the social market regime owing to the excessive diversity of the countries under consideration. Can Germany be placed in the same category as Portugal or Greece? The results force the authors to qualify the classification power of their initial typology.</p>
<p>Surprised by the considerable diversity of values within countries associated with the social market regime, as compared with liberal states, the authors (using data from the World Value Survey) attempted to clarify the relationship between value diversity and social cohesion specifically with regard to support for democratic values.</p>
<p>The last chapter examines whether the global economic crisis, along with other factors advanced by various theories, erodes social cohesion. The authors consider the decline of the nation state, and the rise in individualism along with communitarian allegiances to be a sign of the fragmentation of identities. Increasing social inequalities and generational splits that broaden social distance between groups, and the decline in associative and civic participation erode the specific source of cohesion that is social capital.</p>
<p>Green and Janmaat question how the various regimes respond to the forces that shape developed countries today, or more specifically how public opinion and attitudes change or remain stable according to sets of countries associated with any specific regime regarding issues such as social and political trust, tolerance, and perceptions of conflicts between different types of groups. Although they often observe downward trends for many of these indicators, their analysis reveals the exception of public opinion in the so-called northern socio-democratic countries, which signal fairly resilient social cohesion. Liberal countries, those of the social market regime, and Southern European or East Asian countries, diverge often quite significantly with regard to these indicators, an observation that the authors attempt to explain. That discussion leads to an interesting interpretation of the potential dangers facing social cohesion in at least two types of regimes. In the Liberal regime, the danger would be declining belief in equity and opportunity. Ethnical diversity has always been well accepted in these countries, but that could change if “ethnic difference increasingly intersects with economic inequalities and struggles over increasingly scarce jobs and social resources” (p. 190). In the case of countries with a Social Market regime, the danger would stem from the fact that these countries have always placed importance on shared values and national culture, which are “challenged by rising social and ethnic diversity and by increasing value pluralism” (p. 197), thereby leading to virulent reactions in social strata.</p>
<p>This macrosociological research does not account for the role of entities that specifically build a community of citizens: families, friendships, education, work, the constellation of organizations that make up civil society, sports, and information and communication technologies. Social relationships are not discussed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094306113491549">1</xref></sup> The heavy-handed empirical approach tended to lose the reader in a maze of data, given that almost 30 countries were featured. Would it not have been possible to limit the number of countries included in the social market regime instead of dividing it in two, once inconsistencies between the data and ideal-type were observed? Also, this well-written work seems to overlook spelling, and at times the meaning of references or words in French. These criticisms do not however diminish the richness of this book, the great strength of which is having re-examined the issue of social cohesion by combining an excellent literature review with a comparative empirical analysis of the institutional foundations and dynamics of social cohesion, which leads to the rethinking of many accepted ideas.</p>
