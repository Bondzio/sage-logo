<abstract>
<p><italic>Aim</italic>: There are many women “missing” due to an unfavourable sex ratio in India,, which has strong patriarchal norms and a preference for sons. Female gender discrimination has been reported in health care, nutrition, education, and resource allocation due to man-made norms, religious beliefs, and recently by ultrasonography resulting in lowered sex ratio. <italic>Methods</italic>: The present study attempts to find out the level of awareness regarding sex determination and to explore preference of gender and factors associated among antenatal mothers attending a medical college in eastern India. Interviews were done by predesigned pretested proforma over 6 months. The data were analysed by SPSS 16.0 software for proportions with chi-squared tests and binary logistic regression analysis. <italic>Results</italic>: Most women who were multigravida did not know about contraceptives; 1.8% of mothers knew the sex of the fetus in present pregnancy while another 34.7% expressed willingness; 13.6% knew of a place which could tell sex of the fetus beforehand; 55.6% expressed their preference of sex of the baby for present pregnancy while 50.6% of their husbands had gender preference. Gender preference was significantly high in subjects with: lower socioeconomic status (<italic>p</italic>=0.011); lower level of education of mother (<italic>p</italic>=0.047) and husband (<italic>p</italic>=0.0001); multigravida (<italic>p</italic>=0.002); presence of living children (<italic>p</italic>=0.0001); and husband having preference of sex of baby (<italic>p</italic>=0.0001). <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: Parental education, socioeconomic background, and number of living issues were the main predictors for gender preference. Awareness regarding gender preference and related law and parental counselling to avoid gender preference with adoption of small family norm is recommended.</bold></p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Considering a society where individual access to nutrition and health care are deemed equal, ideally women tend to have markedly longer life expectancies and they are expected to survive more than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813478694">1</xref>]. There are at least 100 million women “missing” in the world due to unfavourable sex ratios, with close to a staggering 35–37 million in India itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813478694">2</xref>]. South Asian countries and India are societies with strong patriarchal norms and high degree of son preference. Extremely high levels of female gender discrimination have been reported in health care, nutrition, education, and resource allocation in northern and western states of India obtained through man-made norms, customs, traditions, religious beliefs, and more recently by ultrasonography, resulting in lower sex ratio.</p>
<p>In India, there has been a steady decline of sex ratios from 927 in 2001 to 914 females per 1000 males in 2011 – the lowest since independence. Most alarming is decline in child sex ratio (0–6 years). In Haryana, the number was least (830), followed by Punjab (846) according to Census of India 2011. In Uttar Pradesh, the largest state in India, 50% of the rural men and 64% of the rural women preferred a son, while 72% of the urban men and 78% of the urban women preferred a daughter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813478694">3</xref>]. The international Institute of Population Sciences (IIPS) and Macro International reported 62.2% preference for boys than girls among urban women in India in the year 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813478694">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Sons are preferred over daughters for a number of economic, social, and religious reasons, including financial support, old age security, property inheritance, dowry, family lineage, prestige and power, birth and death rituals, and salvation. Consequently women and girls are accorded lower status in the Indian society. Sex-selective abortions are even more common than infanticides in India as technology makes it simple and cheap to determine a fetus’s gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813478694">5</xref>]. In Jaipur, a western Indian city, 3500 sex-determined abortions are carried out every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813478694">5</xref>] despite legislation for prevention of sex determination and female feticide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813478694">6</xref>].</p>

<sec id="section2-1403494813478694">
<title>Aim</title>
<p>The present study was undertaken among antenatal mothers attending antenatal outpatient department of the Medical College, Kolkata, which is one of the esteemed medical colleges of eastern India and the pioneer medical institute in Asia, with the following objectives: to study the level of awareness regarding sex determination among study population and to explore the preference of gender and factors associated with it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1403494813478694" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>It was an observational, descriptive study with institution-based cross-sectional design conducted in the antenatal outpatient department of gynaecology and obstetrics of the Medical College among pregnant mothers attending the clinic. Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata is the pioneer institute in Asia and one of the renowned medical institutes in eastern India. The Eden Hospital (gynaecology and obstetrics) is a renowned tertiary care centre well known for its research and contribution in medical science. Ethical clearance and permission from appropriate hospital authority was taken before the conduction of the study. Based on existing literature, a semi-structured proforma was prepared in English. It was then pretested among the antenatal mothers after translation to local language and checked for reliability by Kronbach alpha test and necessary modifications were done. The study was conducted over a period of 6 months (from January to June 2011).</p>
<p>From the literature we obtained gender preference among antenatal mothers was 64% in rural India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813478694">3</xref>]. Taking Z<sub>α</sub> as 1.96 and 10% relative error, we obtained sample size from the formula (Z<sub>α</sub>)<sup>2</sup> × <italic>p</italic> × <italic>q</italic>/ (L)<sup>2</sup> as 216. Similarly taking gender preference of 62.2% for urban antenatal mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813478694">4</xref>], the sample size came out to be 233 applying the same formula. Thus the total sample size came out to be 449. The antenatal clinic runs 6 days a week (Mon-Sat) from 9 am till 2 pm. The average daily attendance was 150 patients per day with approximately 50 new patients. The average time taken to complete the proforma by interview was 30 minutes approximately, which allowed a daily intake of 10 patients as samples during the available outpatient department hours. These patients were purposively selected according to their residence (rural and urban) till the required number of samples was obtained. Two days in a week were fixed for data collection based on simple random sampling (Monday and Wednesday) and two researchers went for data collection on those days based on feasibility after adjusting for the daily work schedule. Informed verbal consent was obtained from each of the participants and they were assured that their confidentiality will be maintained and the information will be utilised solely for academic purpose.</p>
<p>The proforma contained questions regarding socio-demographic variables and issues related to gender preference and sex selection. The data were compiled in Microsoft Excel 2007 and were analysed using SPSS 16.0 for simple proportions; chi-squared tests were done to assess statistical significance and binary logistic regression was applied with the attributes found to be significantly related with gender preference upon univariate analysis to formulate predictor model for gender preference. <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Most of the study population belonged to the age group of 20–30 years (84.6%). They came from different districts of West Bengal, an eastern state of India of which Kolkata is the capital. Nearly 26.8% hailed from Kolkata, closely followed by Howrah (24.4%). There were also people coming from distant places like Darjeeling and Cooch Bihar. Most of them belonged to nuclear families, were urban residents, were Hindus, belonging to class V of Modified Prasad socioeconomic scale and were home makers. Only 47.7% were educated up to primary level while 30.3% of their spouses were educated up to secondary level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813478694">Table I</xref>).</p>

<p>Most of the study population were multigravida (53%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813478694">Table II</xref>); 73.4% never used/not mentioned any contraceptive method ever used; 32.9% had conceived for the second time. About 52.6% did not have any living children. Among those having history of abortion, 52.8% had spontaneous abortions while rest had induced abortion. The major reason for undergoing induced abortion was health grounds (52.0%) followed by economic causes and young age of previous child (20% each). Among the mothers who had a previous pregnancy, only 4.2% knew the sex of the baby. Only 1.8% of mothers knew the sex of the fetus in present pregnancy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813478694">Table II</xref>).

<p>Among the respondents, 22.7% stated economic dependence as reason for gender preference. Among the different cultural methods traditionally used to predict sex of the fetus before birth, abdominal girth was seen to be the most known one (21.7%) closely followed by looking pretty (15.9%) and astrologers opinion (12.9%). A total of 15.6% mothers had knowledge about some cultural method to select sex of the child before conception, and among them 15.9% knew about amulets, 13.2% about use of herbs, and 12.2% opined for certain lunar time of intercourse. 36.1% of the study population had no knowledge of any legal punishment for sex determination before birth. However, 54.6% knew about the declining number of females in India; 15.1% admitted that they themselves had faced some deprivation. Most common deprivation was regarding food (58.1%), followed by economic (38.7%), physical (35.5%), and psychological (29%).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1403494813478694">Table IV</xref> shows association of socio-demographic and cultural factors with gender preference. Gender preference was significantly high in subjects with lower socioeconomic status, lower level of education of mother and husband, among multigravida, living children, and a husband having preference of sex of baby. The rest of the variables considered were not significantly associated with gender preference of the subjects.</p>

<p>The decrease in sex ratio in India among 0–6 year children as per National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813478694">7</xref>] shows the decline from 934 females per 1000 males in NFHS 1 (1992–93) to 918 in NFHS 3 (2005–06). Similar figures were also reported by Indian National Census 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813478694">8</xref>]. This decline may be due to sex selection technology before birth, increase in mortality of girl children as compared to boys due to discrimination or systematic under counting of female children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813478694">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813478694"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813478694">11</xref>]. A strong preference for son has been found in Indian society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813478694">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813478694">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813478694"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813478694"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813478694"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813478694">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Our study revealed that nearly 56% of the mothers had expressed gender preference for present pregnancy, while up on enquiry more than 50% women stated that their husbands were also having gender preference. Likewise in a survey conducted in Pakistan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494813478694">17</xref>], significant gender preference for boys over girls (27.6% vs. 4.3%) was found out. Stathum et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494813478694">18</xref>] in 1993 reported 42% gender preference among British pregnant women. Again, in a UK survey on sex selection (2003), 16% gender preference among whites and 22% preference among citizens of Pakistani origin was noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813478694">19</xref>] and in a study conducted by International Center for Research on Women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813478694">20</xref>] among the ever-married women, 45.9% wanted more boys.</p>
<p>Among males (15–54 years), 20.4% had son preference and 2% had daughter preference. While considering the overall gender preference among males and females (15–49 years) in India (2005–06), more sons was preferred by 22.4% (5.7% in Tamilnadu, 39.2% in Bihar, 16.5% in West Bengal) and more daughters was preferred by 2.6% (1.2% in Bihar, 22.7% in Mizoram, 3.5% in West Bengal) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813478694">7</xref>]. In our study maximum gender preference was noted in the age group of above 30 years; however, no statistically significant difference was observed in different age strata. Gender preference in the higher age groups is obvious as higher age means more chance of an already delivered child not of the preferred gender.</p>
<p>About 50% of the rural men and 64% of the rural women in Uttar Pradesh preferred a son while 72% of urban males and 78% of the urban women preferred a daughter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813478694">3</xref>]. Similarly in our study rural residents had higher gender preference than their urban counterparts (<italic>p</italic>=0.097). However, studies conducted by. Pande [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494813478694">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494813478694">22</xref>] found that wealth and economic development do not reduce son preference but women education makes significant difference. In our study 83.5% of the respondents were literate and among them 46.1% had no gender preference. It was also observed that increase in literacy level reduces the gender preference among mothers (<italic>p</italic>=0.047). We also found that gender preference was lower among the mothers belonging to the higher socioeconomic strata. Education of husband was also significantly associated with gender preference of the respondents (<italic>p</italic>=0.0001).</p>
<p>Religion and type of family showed no significant association with gender preference. Most of the rural women according to NFHS 3 were homemakers or were engaged in manual labour in the fields comparable to our findings. Most of the husbands of the study population were daily labourers (41.2%). Occupation of either spouse showed no significant association with gender preference.</p>
<p>Average age of marriage for urban women was 18.23 years while 50% of the rural women married by the age of 15 years. All women whether urban or rural had first child within first 2 years of marriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813478694">7</xref>]. In our study we found that 16% of the respondents married before 18 years of age and gender preference was higher among them compared to those marrying above 18 years (<italic>p</italic>=0.074). We found that 31.6% of mothers had first pregnancies at their teen age which was higher than all India data (16%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813478694">7</xref>] but comparable to data of West Bengal (31.3%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813478694">7</xref>]. About 60.5% mothers becoming pregnant in their teens showed gender preference as compared to 53.4% of mothers becoming pregnant for the first time after the age of 19 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813478694">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Around 69% of the women considered two or less to be the ideal number of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813478694">7</xref>], which was 47% in the present study. We found that gender preference was not significantly associated with the ideal number of children wished by the respondents though significant association was obtained with presence of living children. We found that 2.8% of the respondents had three or more children which was lower than the national data that decreased from 50% in NFHS 1 to 42% in NFHS 2 and 33% in NFHS 3.</p>
<p>We found that 14% of the study population had history of abortion which was similar to the findings in Manipur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494813478694">23</xref>] but lower than (28%) the findings of the study conducted in suburban slums of Mumbai [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494813478694">24</xref>]. Among these the induced abortions were most likely performed to prevent the birth of a female child. We found that gender preference was not significantly associated with history of abortions. In a study conducted by Puri et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494813478694">25</xref>] among married women in slums of Chandigarh (<italic>n</italic>=375), 65.5% agreed to the fact that sex determination is a crime while 16.3% knew about punishment for sex determination. Similarly in our study we found that 63.9% were aware about law regarding sex determination but no significant relation was found among their knowledge and gender preference.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We must admit that being an institution-based cross-sectional study there is problem of generalisation for the community as well as true magnitude of gender preference cannot be exactly determined due to recall method used for the data collection with ample chance of conscious falsification. However, we can conclude that parental education, socioeconomic background, and number of living issues were the main predictors for gender preference. Awareness regarding gender preference and the consequences of violating the Prenatal Diagnostic Technique Act, parental counselling to avoid gender preference with adoption of small family norm is the cry of the day.</p>
