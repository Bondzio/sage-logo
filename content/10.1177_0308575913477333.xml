         <abstract>
            <p>John Triseliotis died on 29 September 2012, aged 83. He was a pioneering figure in the field of adoption and fostering whose work and policy influence will benefit social workers, researchers and others involved in adoption and child welfare for many years to come. In addition to his wider influence, John regularly reviewed books for this journal and was always very willing to comment on submissions, most recently a study of illegal practices in the Greek domestic adoption system (Nanou, 2011), a topic close to his heart. Following individual tributes from three of John's colleagues and friends, and to mark his contribution, we are reprinting extracts from his influential book <italic>In Search of Origins: The experiences of adopted people</italic> (1973).<sup>1</sup> The study on which it is based led to the reforms made later that decade, giving adopted people the right to seek information about their backgrounds and the circumstances surrounding their adoption.</p>

         </p>
         <p>John began his research career in 1966 when he realised that an impending change in Scottish adoption law intended, for the first time, to allow court records to be made available to bona fide researchers. Seizing the opportunity, he embarked on one of the first systematic evaluations of adoption, the results of which were published in 1970. Hitherto, few such studies had been undertaken, and almost all of them had been carried out in the United States.</p>
         <p>In order to appreciate the significance of this first study one needs to be reminded how difficult it was to mount such research in the 60s. There were few other studies on which to build; it was hard to find financial support; basic information from which to draw samples hardly existed and, in fields like adoption and fostering, it was an uphill struggle to obtain permission to see records or to conduct interviews. Furthermore, the analysis of data was mechanical and desperately time-consuming: computers did not arrive on the scene until the mid-70s and most of us did not gain access to them until the 80s. It is against this background that the importance of John’s early contribution to the more rigorous study of adoption and fostering has to be seen; and that was only the beginning. He went on to devote another 40 years of work to advance our understanding of services for children – as a researcher, adviser, teacher and campaigner.</p>
         <p>Those 40 years have witnessed quite dramatic changes in policy, in practice and in the problems amidst which services for children have evolved. John helped us to appreciate what these were. Moreover, he was able to place them in an historical context; witness his beautifully concise history of adoption in the opening pages of <italic>Adoption: Theory, policy and practice</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0308575913477333">Triseliotis, Shireman and Hundleby, 1997</xref>). But he did more than demonstrate what was, or had been, happening. Through his research and involvement he endeavoured to explore how services for children in need could be improved; how adopters and foster carers could be better supported; and how both prevention and restoration could be included in that quest. Drawing upon his various studies, John consistently argued for the disparate elements of our children’s services to be brought closer together in a common framework that, in his own words, covered ‘policy, planning and practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0308575913477333">Triseliotis and Marsh, 1993</xref>: 23).</p>
         <p>In all of this it is particularly notable how often John pursued his research and writing in collaboration with others. As far as I know he was the sole author of only two of his books. He was a most generous collaborator; and that extended to his many years of involvement with BAAF and indeed to our 40 years of friendship. He will be greatly missed.</p>

         </p>
         <p>John began his career as school teacher and social worker in Cyprus and London. He then carried out pioneering work from an Edinburgh base for more than 50 years. He was one of the first social workers to obtain a PhD (in Edinburgh) and went on to undertake research alongside academic teaching and administration at a time when this was unusual in university social work departments. He was appointed Lecturer and quite soon Professor of Social Work at the University of Edinburgh, where he was Director of Social Work Education for many years. John had a knack for identifying and highlighting key points that audiences found helpful to take away with them. His presentations were always interesting and laced with humour and he was popular as a tutor and supervisor at the same time as building an international reputation for his research and many writings. All this bore testimony to his intelligence, hard work and reliability. Perhaps even more important for those of us privileged to know him were his passion and compassion. John committed himself fully to whatever project he was engaged in and managed to focus on the matter in hand, even though he was involved in so many things. He strongly supported the interests and viewpoints of vulnerable people and was always ready to help anyone who asked for information or advice.</p>
         <p>Adoption was a central thread of John’s publications and discussions with policy-makers from the 1960s for several decades. After his seminal early work on adopted people’s origins, he led studies of adoption allowances and freeing for adoption in Scotland. These all contributed to shifts in attitudes, policy and practice. However, his interests and achievements spread well beyond adoption. In the 1990s, for instance, he identified that hitherto relatively little research had examined services for teenagers and he was successful in obtaining funds for a study on this topic that covered both England and Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0308575913477333">Triseliotis et al, 1995</xref>). Similarly, at a time of major impending change in social work education, he carried out with Professor Peter Marsh a wide-ranging investigation of social work programmes and their impact on newly qualified practitioners across Great Britain. After he formally ‘retired’ from Edinburgh University (John never really retired!), he conducted with Moira Walker and myself a thorough survey of fostering services in Scotland to illuminate issues of recruitment and retention, and obtain detailed feedback about the operations of fostering agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0308575913477333">Triseliotis, Borland and Hill, 2000</xref>).</p>
         <p>Typically in his research, John always wished to understand different perspectives – from professionals, decision-makers, parents and carers, and children and young people. Again, he was ahead of his time in the emphasis he put throughout his career on children’s perspectives, something we now take for granted. Having read transcripts of some of John’s interviews with children, I can vouch for his ability to engage warmly with them and obtain rich accounts.</p>
         <p>John was extremely helpful to myself and many others in our careers and was always willing to assist with matters large and small. I remember him with great affection and admiration.</p>

         </p>
         <p>Between 2000 and 2005 I had the greatest pleasure of working with John when he became the academic collaborator on <italic>The Adoption Triangle Revisited</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0308575913477333">Triseliotis, Feast and Kyle, 2005</xref>), the first British study to explore the individual experiences and perspectives of all the key players in the adoption, search and reunion process. This study built on the findings of a previous one, <italic>Adoption Search and Reunion: The long-term experience of adopted adults</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0308575913477333">Howe and Feast, 2003</xref>), which my colleagues and I had worked on with Professor David Howe while working at The Children’s Society’s Post Adoption and Care Project.</p>
         <p>When we approached John to ask if he would be our academic collaborator on this follow-up project, we were fully aware of his formidable reputation as a pioneer in the field of adoption. We had been inspired by his seminal work, <italic>In Search of Origins</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0308575913477333">Triseliotis, 1973</xref>), which played an important role in the development of the ethos that underpinned our adoption work. His research for this study illustrated that being adopted and curious about origins could go hand in hand. Adopted people did not have to be deviant or unhappily adopted to want to find out about their origins and family background but it was a normal and natural desire. An adoptive parent himself, John was an early champion of adopted people’s right to have the opportunity to access information about their origins. His research in this area was influential during the Houghton Committee debates of the early 1970s, when he argued that adopted people in England and Wales should have the right to obtain a copy of their original birth certificate. Hence, when John agreed to be the academic lead on our particular study it was a tremendous coup.</p>
         <p>John was a dedicated, conscientious worker and his input to the study was invaluable. He helped my team and me to formulate our hypothesis and build a robust quantitative and qualitative study, and make sense of the data that was gathered and apply a theoretical framework to the findings. Despite being such an authoritative figure in adoption research, he was always open to our ideas, encouraging us to be ambitious. He also ensured that the study had a unique aspect: under John’s guidance we were able to match pairs of birth mothers with their sons and daughters, and pairs of adoptive parents with their sons and daughters. In addition, we had the opportunity to analyse the experiences and perceptions from a triad perspective as we were able to match sets of birth mothers, adopted people and adoptive parents.</p>
         <p>John was made an OBE in 1989. In addition to his important contribution to child welfare practice and policy and his considerable academic reputation, he was a truly lovely man, with a wonderful sense of humour. He was also a supportive and caring colleague and a joy to work with. I feel privileged that I had the chance to collaborate with him on his last major study and on a subject about which he felt so passionate.</p>

            <title>Background to the study</title>
            <p>To my knowledge Scotland and Finland are the only countries in the western world where an adopted person can obtain, from official records, information that could lead to the tracing of the original parents. Under the provisions of the Adoption Act, the Registrar-General maintains an Adopted Children’s Register in which entries are made after every adoption order. He also keeps an index of the Adopted Children’s Register which is open to public search. In addition, the Registrar-General keeps a register, which makes traceable the connections between an entry in the register of births that had been marked ‘adopted’ and any corresponding entry in the Adopted Children’s Register. In England, such registers are not open to inspection or search ‘except under an order of the Court’ but the Scottish system provides that information from this register can be made available to the adopted persons themselves after they have attained the age of 17.</p>
            <p>There is no definite information about the reasons that prompted the Scottish Standing Committee in the House of Commons to insert this section in the Scottish Adoption Act of 1930. No minutes of the Committee’s discussion were kept. The only possible explanation is that this would make it possible for the adopted person to claim any inheritance from his biological parents to which he was entitled under the Act. In fact, it was not until 1964 that an adopted person in Scotland could inherit from his adopted parents and that he would have no right to an inheritance from his biological parents. However, a similar situation existed in England until 1949 and yet no such provision was made in the English Adoption Act of 1926. It is improbable that the Scottish Act of 1930 was recognising the importance of identity in its provision for such information to be made available.</p>
            <p>Any person over the age of 17 who has been adopted in Scotland can now write to or visit Register House in Edinburgh and, on production of evidence about himself, ask for a copy of his original birth certificate. Information that is usually available on such certificates includes the names of the parent(s), the child’s original name, its place and date of birth, the occupation of the natural parent(s) and their usual address at the time of the child’s birth. In the years 1961 to 1970 an average of 42 people (or 1.5 per thousand of adopted people over 17 years old) each year applied to or called at Register House and obtained this information from their original birth certificates. The lowest number of enquiries was 15 in 1964 and the highest 70 in 1970. Public discussion of adoption usually generates more enquiries, as was the case in 1970 when some attention was focused on adoption practice.</p>
            <p>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0308575913477333">The Houghton Committee Report, published in 1972</xref>, considered whether the existing right of access to original birth records should be withdrawn, but decided to wait until the results of this study were made available. The Committee was concerned about the danger of adopted children tracing their original parents in circumstances where this might not be welcomed by the latter. The Committee wished to strengthen anonymity that would help to protect both the child and the adoptive parents on the one hand and the natural parents on the other. Equally the adoptive home and any new family of the natural parents may need protection from interference by the other party or the fear of this.</p>
            <sec id="sec6-0308575913477333">
               <title>Aims</title>
               <p>The main aim of the study was to identify the general circumstances of adopted adults who seek information about their origins, to establish the reasons for the search, their motivation, their needs and objectives, and also to what use they put the information gained. To make such an assessment possible it was important to learn about the adoptees’ relevant past and current life situations, about possible internal and external pressures, and about the quality of their relationships and self-perception.</p>
               <p>When the project was planned it was hoped that answers to certain questions might not only further understanding of the adoption situation but also point towards desirable areas for legal reform and for practice changes.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="sec7-0308575913477333">
               <title>The sample</title>
               <p>The eventual sample was made up of 70 adoptees who applied or called at Register House in Edinburgh asking to be supplied with information from their original birth entries. An ongoing study was set up with the co-operation of the Registrar General, who agreed to forward or hand to every enquirer a copy of our letter telling them about the study and asking for their help. It was left to the adoptees to get in touch with the writer if they wished to participate. The ongoing study covered the period 1 December 1969 to 30 November 1970.</p>
               <p>Two groups of adoptees were identified whose stated search goals differed from the start. The goal of the first group was to find one or both of their natural parents while that of the second was to obtain background genealogical information. The two groups differed from each other in a number of ways, thus affording an opportunity not only for comparison but especially for gaining certain insights into the feelings, thinking and general needs of adopted people, and in particular of those preoccupied with their origins. The adoptees who wanted to meet their natural parents were far more strongly motivated and more determined than those interested only in background information.</p>
               <p>The adoptees in the sample came from different parts of the country and some were living outside Scotland at the time of the enquiry. A small number referred to their adoptive parents as foster parents, the word ‘adoptive’ not being much in use in their areas for this form of substitute parent–child relationship. This lack of differentiation between adoption and foster care could easily lead to misunderstandings where social workers were selecting families to act as foster parents, rather than adoptive ones.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="sec8-0308575913477333">
               <title>Adoptees’ knowledge about their adoptive status</title>
               <p>A very high percentage of adoptees in the sample came to know about their adoptive status well after the age usually recommended by the literature on adoption. Three out of every five were told or found out after the age of ten. The later parents postponed the revelation the greater the possibility that the adoptees would find out from outside sources. In the absence of a control sample it is difficult to say whether adoptees who do not search into their original backgrounds are told at an earlier or at a similar stage. The fact that a greater number of adoptees came to know about their adoptive status during adolescence and after made it possible for the study to reflect on certain developments in their lives that could not have been complicated by the knowledge of adoption.</p>
            </sec>
         </sec>
         <sec id="sec9-0308575913477333">
            <title>Findings</title>
            <p>Where the adoptees’ perception was generally of an unsatisfactory home life it was generally accompanied by a poor self-perception, too. Many had a negative image of themselves and talked of their inner ‘void’, their desolation and general incapacity to form meaningful relationships with other people. They felt ashamed and embarrassed at being adopted and illegitimate. A fair number of these had already received psychiatric treatment whilst others were obviously in need of such help. The search itself was helping to keep themselves together and the process was assuming greater importance than the goal. Their main criticism of their home life was about the lack of emotional satisfactions, absence of warmth and failure to develop in them a sense of belonging. The greater the dissatisfaction with their family relationships and with themselves, the greater the possibility that they would now be searching for their original parents. The better the image of themselves and of their parents, the greater the possibility that they would be looking for background information.</p>
            <p>Though adolescence was the most common period when the adoptees first thought of enquiring into their origins, it was some subsequent life crisis that eventually decided them to act. The most usual events that generated an impulse to search were death of one or both parents, illness, expectation of a child, pending marriage or separation or when inner pressures could no longer be contained. The most severe crises were precipitated by events which carried a sense of loss or abandonment, such as death of a parent, especially when followed by the re-marriage of the surviving one; and separation from or desertion by a parent, husband, boyfriend or girlfriend. Crises of this nature seemed to affect worse those who were less well settled and more vulnerable. The current experience of loss appeared to re-awaken the ‘rejection’ or ‘abandonment’ felt through the loss of the first parents. The death of one or both adoptive parents was usually followed by a strong desire for the first set of parents, usually the mother, but its intensity varied depending on the quality of the adoptees’ earlier home life.</p>
            <p>The adoptees’ expectations from the search were closely associated with the type and amount of information revealed, with the quality of their home life, the perception of themselves and with the nature of their current stress. Though all of them wanted to find answers to such questions as who their natural parents were, why they were given up for adoption and whether their first set of parents wanted them and loved them, many were also hoping to develop a relationship of friendship with them. There was a hope that their natural parents would make up to them what they had missed from their earlier relationships. The ones who were mainly satisfied with their adoptive home life were looking for information that would help them to complete themselves, whilst the more disillusioned ones were hoping for nourishment mainly from the mother.</p>
            <p>The outcome of the search left many adoptees with mixed feelings. Those who were looking for additional information were generally satisfied with the results, but ideally they would have liked more detailed particulars. They were surprised to find the paucity of the official records which often did not go beyond what they already knew. Those who set out hoping to meet their parents were less satisfied. Though they welcomed whatever information they obtained, they were mostly unsuccessful in their attempts to attain their main goal. After the initial search a very small number were thinking of giving up, but the rest, and these were mostly the ones who were feeling under the greatest pressure, were determined to go on. For them the search and its continuation seemed to protect them from their loneliness and unhappiness.</p>
            <p>A very small number were eventually successful in finding a parent or blood relation. With one exception, there was no indication that earlier expectations were fulfilled or relationships developed. Where a meeting occurred it was usually followed by some disillusionment in the adoptee, with a tendency for the latter to transfer onto the original parents many feelings that were formerly held about the adoptive ones. The adoptees claimed, however, that following these contacts they found it easier to come to terms with their conditions and circumstances.</p>
            <p>A number of important factors jointly or separately seemed to combine to bring about the search for the natural parents. These were: the non-disclosure of background genealogical information or the revelation of only hostile particulars; unsatisfactory adoptive home relationships; a negative self-image; and having had psychiatric help. Late knowledge of adoption had no significant influence on the search goals. A core of 22 adoptees in the Meet the Natural Parents group shared the first three of these characteristics compared with only one in the Background Information group.</p>
            <p>The study identified three main areas which have important implications for adoptive practice: the developing child’s need for a warm, caring and secure family life; the adoptees’ vulnerability to experiences of loss, rejection or abandonment; and the adopted person’s need to know as much as possible about the circumstances of their adoption and about their genealogical background in order to integrate these facts into their developing personality.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="sec10-0308575913477333">
            <title>Implications for policy and practice</title>
            <p>First, the study established precisely what adoptees wanted to know and so indicates the information that needs to be collected and retained at various points in the adoption process. This includes: the names of parents, especially their birth mother; specific descriptive details that help to individualise the person, for example, physical attributes, the jobs they did, any hobbies or specific skills or gifts such as musicality, and medical histories; the desire for information about both birth parents and possible siblings; and the desire to learn that their birth parents wanted them or loved them and that they were not rejected. The actual telling is of secondary importance to the quality of family relationships. Being told they were ‘special’ or ‘chosen’ had limited value; being told about birth parents’ feelings was more important than learning facts, especially if these were negative, such as being linked to criminality and promiscuity; the stigma of being ‘illegitimate’ was far more concerning than being adopted.</p>
            <p>The study also has shown that adolescence is the most crucial period during which adoptees become intensely preoccupied and curious about themselves and experience a strong urge to find out about their first pair of parents. They make a desperate attempt at this stage to complete themselves by integrating within their system their two pairs of parents. If knowledge about the first pair is not forthcoming, such integration may not take place or it may turn out to be very precarious and likely to collapse under stress. Most adoptive parents seem to respond appropriately to their children’s questions about their first parents, without feeling threatened or anxious. As a long period elapses, however, between the stage at which agencies pass on information to the parents and the stage at which the latter have to share it with their children, it would be advisable for agencies to make it a practice to give all relevant background particulars in writing. In this way not only are memory failures avoided but also, and equally important, is the avoidance of misinterpretation or misperception of verbal information.</p>
            <p>Irrespective of the approach suggested above, a minority of parents may still not find it easy to share what they know or may be dead at the time when the adoptee is curious to find out more. It is also not unusual for some adolescents to find it easier to accept information and advice from an outside source rather than from their own parents. For these reasons it is again important that the adopted person, and especially the adolescent, comes to know that he can go at any time to the agency that arranged his adoption and ask for details about his origins and why and how his adoption was arranged. There is no obvious reason why the agency should not respond to this need and discuss and share with the adoptee alone, or in his family’s presence, information from its records. Such a service would require that every agency keeps a very detailed account about the circumstances and genealogy of each child it places. The law could also help by directing that the birth certificate should bear the address of the agency that made the original arrangements so that adoptees would know where to go. Adoption agencies, by making themselves available, can be of great help not only to adoptees who happen to go through some crisis which they connect with their adoption, but also to some parents who find it difficult to cope with the child’s repeated questions about his origins.</p>
            <p>Because of personality or other special factors it is very possible that for a very small number of adoptees no amount of information or counselling will be of much help. They may see a meeting with their original parents as the only solution to their problems and in this respect the agency may have to exercise its judgement whether to act as a go-between for the child and his first parents. When a situation like this arises, perhaps only experienced reality can help people to come to some terms with their losses. This could eventually help them to emerge strengthened out of their isolation and distress. In an unpublished study by Triseliotis and Hall, the majority of mothers surrendering their children in Edinburgh in 1970 said they would not object to a future meeting between themselves and their child if this were suggested as necessary for their child’s welfare and mental health.</p>
            <p>The placing agency should ideally offer similar facilities and opportunities for counselling to the natural father or mother who, years later, may be focusing his or her possible unhappiness and guilt on the relinquishment of their child. In extreme cases the agency would again have to exercise its judgement whether a meeting between the original parent and the adoptee were advisable. For such an arrangement to take place it would be necessary for the adoptee to be adult enough to cope with this and for the agency to have prepared the ground well. So far, adoption agencies have only rarely known of natural parents calling back years later to ask for news about a relinquished child.</p>
            <p>The experience from Finland confirms most of our findings and recommendations. The main adoption agency there, which places about 225 children each year (45% of the total adoptions in the country), provides for adoptees at any age calling in to obtain background information about their biological parents. About 50 to 70 young people, mostly adolescents, go to the agency each year for information about their origins. Sometimes the initiative is taken by the adoptive parents who may call with the child. The service seems to have been of infinite benefit to the users without damage to the interests of other parties.</p>
            <p>The adoptees’ quest for their origins was not a vindictive venture, but an attempt to better understand themselves and their situation. The contribution of the law and of adoption agencies towards such an objective can be of immense value to those who happen to feel in a limbo state. The self-perception of all of us is partly based on what our parents and ancestors have been, going back many generations. Adoptees, too, wish to base themselves not only on their adoptive parents, but also on what their original parents and forebears have been. It is the writer’s view, based on his findings, that no person should be cut off from his or her origins.</p>
