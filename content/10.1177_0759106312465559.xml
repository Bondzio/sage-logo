<title>Project - Understanding Society - A Step Closer (UK ESDS)</title>
<p>November 2011 marked a major milestone in the development and delivery of <italic>Understanding Society</italic>, as the data from 100,000 people in 40,000 UK households became available for researchers to use at http://www.esds.ac.uk/findingData/usoc.asp.</p>
<p>The whole of Wave 1 of the survey (collected across the 24-month period from January 2009 to December 2010) is now ready to access and use. The available data also include the Ethnicity Boost Sample, a unique resource that provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine and analyse ethnicity-related topics and issues.</p>
<p>Director of the study, Nick Buck, said: “This is a momentous step for everyone who works on this world-leading survey. We need everyone now to spread the word that this fantastic resource is available and to make sure that every researcher with an interest in the social and economic circumstances, attitudes and beliefs of people in the UK is using Understanding Society.”</p>
<p>Nick said he was also looking forward to the release of Year 1 of Wave 2 data, which would mark a further milestone for the survey in respect of longitudinal research opportunities. A team of researchers, who have had early access to the data, is already working on a range of articles to be published soon. Topics range from the role social support networks play in coping with stressful events throughout the life-course to young people's health and well-being, the division of housework, links between parents' income and children's achievements, and a range of specially-commissioned ethnicity-related research using the survey's unique ethnicity boost sample.</p>
<p>Professor Paul Boyle, Chief Executive of the Economic and Social Research Council, which has funded the survey, said: “This is an exciting time for anyone interested in mapping the UK's social landscape. With the latest release of data from Understanding Society, researchers and policy makers will have access to unprecedented information allowing insights into our family relationships, health, our attitudes to the changing environment around us, our finances and neighbourhoods and much more. This new set of data is an important contribution to the UK's internationally renowned portfolio of longitudinal studies.”</p>
