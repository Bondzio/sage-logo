<title>Problem Addressed</title>
<p>In today’s corporate environment, corporate social responsibility (CSR) can be as powerful as earnings per share in the eyes of customers, employees and investors. One of the most effective ways to enhance your CSR profile is through a workplace giving and matching program that engages all of your employees, making them CSR ambassadors for your company. However, the cost and administrative hassles that come with workplace giving and matching can be overwhelming and turn a good program into a sinkhole of money and time. Furthermore, if a workplace giving program is not seen as empowering the employee, but rather as a way for management to support their selected causes, employees can become resentful and upset by a program that was designed to do good.</p>

<title>Innovation</title>
<p>The newest technology in workplace giving is a SaaS-based program that enables a company of any size to create or customize its workplace giving program with a fully branded experience. At the center of the technology is the ability for all employees to start their personal foundation, a charitable savings account, where they can manage, grow and share their charitable giving as they see fit. Think of it as a 401k for charitable giving. Once an employee establishes an account online, he or she can fund the account through payroll deductions, credit cards or ACH transfer. All the money that is deposited into the account is tax deductible immediately.</p>
<p>The company can then establish a corporate matching program with the parameters and limitations they decide on. The social media aspect of the platform enables the employees and the company to come together around select causes and campaigns. No matter what the criterion is established for the program, the platform tracks and administers all of the giving and the company writes one single check per period; no more sending checks to hundreds of nonprofits throughout the year. All of the tax deductions are itemized and one single report for taxes is available online.</p>
<p>Last, the platform also offers a selection of reward programs that enables every employee to earn more to give. For example, every time employees shop at Amazon, they can earn up to 4% for their account and give it to their favorite charity.</p>

<title>Return on Innovation</title>
<p>Historically, workplace giving requires tens of thousands of dollars to set up and hundreds of man-hours throughout the year to manage. With this new innovation, set up is at a fraction of the cost and administration functions are all completed on the web and available for review at anytime.</p>
<p>The reduced cost and elimination of administration are tangible returns. However, a robust workplace giving program will also create the following:</p>
