<abstract>
<p>The subject of Geography maintains a relatively strong position in English universities today. In contrast, the subject is experiencing declining popularity in schools. In this article I report on recent developments in the English school curriculum for 11–14-year-olds which have contributed to the current state of health of Geography. At the same time, I warn against complacency on the part of university Geographers researching and teaching worldwide by advising a certain mindfulness around school curriculum policy reform in England and its impact on the future of Geography in universities. I begin by introducing current education policy reform affecting Geography before summarizing findings from four research studies to serve as snapshots of the impact of changes on school curricula. Following a discussion of the implications of policy changes for the future health and status of school Geography, I conclude by discussing examples of Geography education research studies which demonstrate how school Geography might contribute to the ‘imagination of alternatives and concrete demonstrations of other ways of living in a society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132510394782">Massey, 2009</xref>: 137).</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>My first progress report on Geography and education in schools in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132510394782">Winter, 2009</xref>) traced the history and politics of school Geography (1976–2008) in the English schooling system in an attempt to understand the changing fortunes of the subject. Advancing the discussion to the end of the first decade of the 21st century is the main aim of this second progress report. I focus on developments in one educational stage, known as Key Stage 3 (KS3),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309132510394782">1</xref></sup> mainly because of the far-reaching and dramatic reforms taking place in England at this key stage. Before proceeding, it is important to stress that in England Geography remains a strong subject at all levels of the education system, compared with countries like the USA and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132510394782">Johnston, 2002</xref>). Nonetheless, uptake of Geography in English schools is declining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132510394782">Butt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132510394782">Stannard, 2003</xref>) and the implications for the future recruitment of students to undergraduate and teacher education Geography courses have been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132510394782">Castree et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309132510394782">Hill and Jones, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132510394782">Johnston, 2002</xref>). The warning signs are self-evident. University Geographers in England (and in countries in which the subject currently enjoys popularity) who ignore a downward trend in Geography uptake in schools do so at their peril. I invite non-English readers to make comparisons between the situation described here and the state of school Geography in their own countries in order to contribute to analysis and debate through the pages of this journal.</p>

<title>II The status of Geography as a school curriculum subject</title>
<p>The most recent National Curriculum reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132510394782">QCA, 2007</xref>) on the one hand appears to preserve Geography as part of the KS3 separate subject framework but, on the other hand, ushers in the ‘big picture of the curriculum’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309132510394782">QCA, 2008</xref>). This ‘big picture’ curriculum gives schools the freedom to organize school knowledge in different ways, either by retaining the separate subject curriculum or changing to a brand new curriculum structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309132510394782">Lambert, 2008</xref>). Underpinning the new flexible curriculum are a number of themes which can be traced back to two closely associated discourses: criticisms levelled at earlier versions of the National Curriculum and the influence of neoliberal thinking as manifest in the idea of the global knowledge-based economy.</p>
<sec id="section3-0309132510394782">
<title>1 Criticisms of the pre-2007 National Curriculum in England</title>
<p>The pre-2007 curriculum has been strongly criticized on the basis of its overprescription of factual subject knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132510394782">ATL, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309132510394782">Lord and Jones, 2006</xref>) and its fragmentation, arising from strictly defined subject compartments which, it is argued, prevented links being made across different subjects. The perceived solutions to these drawbacks are increased curriculum flexibility and coherence. Arguably, the former gives teachers more freedom to choose curriculum knowledge, the latter to integrate it holistically across different subjects. A third criticism of the pre-2007 curriculum arose from the policy ‘Every child matters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132510394782">DfES, 2003</xref>) which drew attention to failings in collaborative partnerships between children’s services (which included education). Here, the educational problem was identified as the ‘one-size-fits-all’ curriculum, which neglected attention to individual student needs and interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132510394782">Gilbert, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309132510394782">Kirk and Broadhead, 2007</xref>). In response, a more personalized learning agenda is advocated for the new curriculum through the introduction of personalized learning and thinking skills (PLTS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309132510394782">QCA, no date</xref>) and social and emotional skills (SEAL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132510394782">DfES, 2007</xref>). PLTS and SEAL are competency-based, outcomes-driven technical frameworks, focusing on developing students’ individual responsibility for managing their own learning, social and emotional relationships. The fourth criticism of the former curriculum was its outdatedness and irrelevance to the current and future interests and needs of young people in today’s fast-changing complex world of life and work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309132510394782">QCA, 2005</xref>). Schools can retain a curriculum framework based on subjects or shift to one based on personalized transferable skills or competences. The latter, it is claimed, prepares young people to manage flexibly the uncertainties predicted to face them in the 21st-century global knowledge-based economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132510394782">OECD, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>2 Neoliberalism and the global knowledge-based economy</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132510394782">Lambert and Morgan (2010)</xref> look to growth in the digital economy and the idea of the knowledge-based economy as driving forces of change in society, and, inevitably, in the nature of education systems, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132510394782">Lingard (2000)</xref> describes how globalization and its undercurrent of neoliberal thinking have stimulated the restructuring of both education policy and the policy-construction process. Acknowledging that neoliberal thinking about globalization is only one version, neoliberalism has assumed the ascendant position in global discourses around education policy, perpetuated by supranational institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309132510394782">Rizvi and Lingard, 2010</xref>). Global processes, however, are inevitably vernacularized through national and local political and cultural conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132510394782">Lingard, 2000</xref>). In the English context, education policy is understood to serve two purposes. The first is to prepare the nation for economic growth on the international stage by providing learners with opportunities to acquire appropriate skills for successful participation in the global knowledge-based economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132510394782">DCSF, 2009</xref>). The second is to produce ‘good citizens’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132510394782">Pykett, 2007</xref>) and to promote social cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309132510394782">Morgan, 2009</xref>). In curriculum terms, the knowledge-based economy promotes ‘know-how’ (competences or skills) not ‘know-what’ (facts); learning-to-learn, problem-solving and thinking skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309132510394782">Morgan, 2009</xref>) in place of memorization; ICT skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132510394782">OECD, 2000</xref>); useful, relevant broad-based knowledge in place of outdated subject concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132510394782">UNESCO, 2010</xref>) in diverse learning spaces, such as libraries, workplaces, communities and the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309132510394782">Leadbeater, 2008</xref>). The influence of neoliberal global discourses resonates through the ways in which curriculum policy problems are identified and their policy solutions constituted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132510394782">Schureich, 1994</xref>). What, then are the implications of these wider curriculum trends for the status of Geography education in schools?</p>

<sec id="section5-0309132510394782">
<title>III Implications of recent policy reform on Geography in English schools</title>
<p>In this section I investigate findings from four empirical research studies inquiring into recent curriculum change in KS3 school Humanities<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309132510394782">2</xref></sup> subjects in England. The investigation has two aims: to draw out issues associated with English school curriculum policy reform which are relevant to the future of school Geography, and to give an opportunity for readers living outside England to identify differences and similarities with the situation facing school Geography in their own countries.</p>
<p>Forty-seven secondary schools in the north of England responded to a small-scale pilot postal questionnaire survey conducted by the University of Sheffield in January 2009<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309132510394782">3</xref></sup> to investigate the situation facing the KS3 Humanities curriculum. A much larger online questionnaire survey was conducted by the Historical Association (HA) in Spring 2009 and involved over 700 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132510394782">Harris and Burn, forthcoming</xref>). In relation to the latter study, while it is not possible to extrapolate directly findings from a survey focusing on the KS3 History curriculum to the KS3 Geography curriculum, the effects of curriculum change on school Geography are likely to be similar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309132510394782">4</xref></sup> An OFSTED<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309132510394782">5</xref></sup> report (2009) concerning the implementation of the 2007 National Curriculum involved 84 schools, with the main survey consisting of 37 schools. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132510394782">Norman (2008)</xref> conducted interviews with teachers and students in four secondary schools and with curriculum policy-makers. She also used a questionnaire survey with Newly Qualified Teachers to gain insights into curriculum-making under the new ‘big picture’ policy regime.</p>
<p>All the studies revealed a decline or planned decline in discrete subject teaching at KS3, ranging from 25% to 60%. Positive effects of curriculum change across the studies included: increased flexibility (e.g. open-ended project work, group work, external partnerships); improvement in student skills; teachers working collaboratively across subject boundaries; improved student-teacher relations; and more confident students. The 2009 OFSTED report stated that the ‘Strengths of the best of these [competency curricula – CW] included good levels of interest on the part of students, good thematic and conceptual links that made learning more coherent, and shared approaches to the development of students’ general learning skills’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132510394782">OFSTED, 2009</xref>: 11–12).</p>
<p>The main disadvantages of the new curricula were: teachers no longer taught their specialist subjects; reduction in students’ subject specific knowledge, vocabulary and skills and a predicted decline in uptake of Humanities subjects and fall in standards in GCSE (KS4). Teachers experienced difficulties in covering all aspects of the KS3 curriculum and assessment. Ofsted subject inspectors ‘identified emerging problems with the courses. These included the loss of subject content and subject skills development; lack of continuity from primary school experience; lack of rigour and challenge; uneven quality of teaching and artificial “links” or themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132510394782">OFSTED, 2009</xref>: 12).</p>
<p>These studies raised wider issues. The HA study found that selective and independent schools protected time for History teaching while the academies<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309132510394782">6</xref></sup> reduced it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132510394782">Harris and Burn, forthcoming</xref>). Moreover, reasons for reducing discrete History teaching included reducing the KS3 programme from three to two years to allow KS4 to begin early, thereby giving more time to prepare students for public examinations and attracting students to subjects considered to be ‘easier’ and/or worth more pass grades than History for the same investment of teaching time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132510394782">Harris and Burn, forthcoming</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132510394782">Norman (2008)</xref> found, first, that in spite of a commitment to a ‘personalized’ curriculum teachers in one school chose the themes and content rather than giving this responsibility to students, leading to an unbalanced subject coverage. Second, students engaging with the competency curriculum did not recognize or understand what constituted historical and geographical knowledge. Third, Norman noted a neglect of curriculum theorizing among those employed to train teachers to develop the new curricula which resulted in curricula consisting of ‘cracking ideas’ without rationale, context or purpose (p. 141). She discovered that one research school offered its new KS3 curriculum package for sale for £21,000, generating the worry that a curriculum scheme devised for one specific school was assumed unproblematically to meet the needs and interests of learners in other schools.</p>
<p>Resonating through the discussion above are problems in the sense of the purpose of education and social justice. The differential take-up of competency curricula both between and within schools promotes differentiation between schools and students, while accountability measures exert pressures on schools to improve performance in examination results, compelling schools to make curriculum decisions which ignore social justice implications. These trends reveal a certain absence of attention to theoretical questions of curriculum rationale, philosophy and principles detectable in recent curriculum policy-making, with particular respect to equality issues. Finally, curriculum commodification has arrived with the establishment of a marketplace for ‘private’ curriculum transactions, whereby schools trade their curriculum schemes.</p>

<sec id="section6-0309132510394782">
<title>IV Implications of curriculum policy reform on the future of school Geography</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132510394782">Butt (2010)</xref> describes as ‘not uniformly high’ (p. 2) the quality of Geography education across English schools. The decline in the popularity of school Geography exposes the subject as vulnerable to further marginalization arising from the introduction of curriculum flexibility and the option of introducing a competency curriculum. Shifts in the KS3 school curriculum away from discrete subjects and towards competency curricula signal an impending change in the identity of the teacher, given the predicted decline in demand for trained and qualified subject specialists. Competency curricula centre around ‘knowledge-how’, or, as the Opening Minds curriculum defines competency, ‘the ability to understand and to do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132510394782">Bayliss, 1999</xref>: 27). Such knowledge can, arguably, be taught by a generalist teacher, especially when digital technologies play a key role. Under this system, teachers become knowledge managers or brokers, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309132510394782">Robertson (2005</xref>: 165) calls ‘solution assemblers’.</p>
<p>The move to competences runs the risk of denying students access to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309132510394782">Young (2008</xref>: 4) refers to as ‘powerful knowledge’ through the school curriculum. ‘Powerful knowledge’ is public knowledge associated with established traditions of thought that has been formed, argued about and improved upon over the ages. It is disciplined knowledge – in other words, specialized, context independent, theoretical ideas informed by principles and concepts. It contains its own internal standards of quality which allow for in-depth probing and the posing of questions about the reason why of things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309132510394782">Peters, 1966</xref>). At its best, it encourages a critical and political disposition, as Pring asserts:<disp-quote>
<p>The initiation into such a tradition gives a certain political independence, the power to resist the persuasions and propaganda of those with political power. To that extent the liberal education, which is manifested in the teaching of the humanities at its best, is at the heart of a genuinely political education. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309132510394782">Pring, 1999</xref>: 74)</p>
</disp-quote>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309132510394782">Young (2008)</xref>, ‘powerful knowledge’ cannot be acquired in the home, community or workplace: it extends beyond the particulars of immediate and everyday experiences into the realms of generalizations and explanations of the moral and political kind.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309132510394782">Lambert (2008</xref>: 208) refers to this point when he expresses concern about ‘the intellectual vacuum that can lie at the heart of practical curriculum making when subjects no longer play a leading part’. Indeed, the gap created in the curriculum by expunging subject knowledge can be rapidly filled by schemes available on the market which may not have undergone careful rigorous and critical scrutiny. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132510394782">Burton (2007)</xref> highlights the danger of purveyors of ‘edutainment’, ‘wherein charismatic, high profile education consultants deliver courses on new pedagogies … presented with a theatrical fervour and missionary zeal that is compelling’ (p. 7). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132510394782">Beach and Dovemark (2009</xref>: 691) cite Macbeath’s (2005) study which indicated that schools were ‘taking up current brain-based theories of learning and multiple intelligences in the same relatively <italic>uncritical</italic> ways’.</p>
<p>The most worrying aspect of the decline of Geography as a discrete school subject at KS3 arises from the inequalities pertaining to this trend. Denying students access to the ‘powerful knowledge’ of subjects like Geography and History involves a kind of disenfranchisement, for as long as traditional subjects maintain their ascendant position as the main routeway to high-status university entrance<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309132510394782">7</xref></sup> and enhanced social mobility. Within a differentiated curriculum, especially one differentiated on the basis of, on the one hand, subjects and, on the other, competences, parity of esteem evaporates. Curriculum differentiation (albeit inadvertently) increases inequalities between groups of young people. Selective schools in which students achieve high examination grades through separate subject teaching tend, unsurprisingly, to retain the subject curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132510394782">Harris and Burn, forthcoming</xref>) whereas schools in challenging circumstances struggling to meet target grades are more likely to consider the competency curriculum route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309132510394782">Young, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132510394782">Weedon and Lambert (2010)</xref> reveal unequal access to school Geography education at GCSE level (KS4) through their analysis of examination entries and performance. Geographical location, school type and the choice system for GCSE subjects influence the uptake of GCSE Geography. Schools located in inner-city areas with a relatively high proportion of students living in ‘deprived’ circumstances are more likely to have lower rates of Geography GCSE examination entries than suburban or rural schools. Furthermore, the highest levels of Geography GCSE entries are found in independent or grammar schools and the lowest levels in comprehensive and secondary modern schools. KS4 Geography seems to be of relevance to ‘academic’ or ‘more advantaged students’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132510394782">Hopkin and Lambert, 2010</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>The discussion thus far may imply that a dualism exists between two forms of school curriculum knowledge related to Humanities subjects – on one side, Geographical knowledge as a discrete subject associated with the pre-2007 curriculum, and, on the other, generic competency-based Humanities knowledge. I wish to argue, first, that pre-2007 National Curriculum geographical knowledge, although appearing to represent the sort of conceptually driven powerful knowledge about which Young writes, did not necessarily encourage the politically and morally informed inquiry approaches of the liberal education tradition as advanced by Pring. To summarize, pre-2007 Geographical knowledge in some schools remains locked into a legacy of modernist thinking inherited from the traditional and conservative epistemological paradigm which underpinned the first conception of the GNC in 1991. It is not, however, a question of choosing between, on the one hand, an excess of outdated disciplinary knowledge and few generic skills and, on the other hand, an excess of generic skills and a disciplinary knowledge vacuum. What is important here is recognition that there exist different ways of thinking about Geographical knowledge and skills, and each way of thinking is undergirded by complex moral and political discourses.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132510394782">Lambert and Morgan (2010</xref>: 36) state that ‘school geography is increasingly seen as a vehicle for maintaining the status quo, rather than as a means of potential transformation’. They claim that geography’s power lies in its ability to provide ‘a set of critical frameworks’ with which we can begin to raise significant questions about social and structural factors influencing the world. My second and connected argument is the need for school Geography revitalization of the politically and ethically responsible kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309132510394782">Massey, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132510394782">2009</xref>). In some schools such a revitalization is already under way through geography education research, and will form the next section. The remaining issue is whether time is running out for supporters of radical, responsible school Geography, as it becomes either marginalized by a tide of neoliberalism or squeezed out by traditional and modernist knowledge served primarily to elite social groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0309132510394782">
<title>V Other ways of thinking about Geographical knowledge in schools</title>
<p>The following examples demonstrate Geography as a decidedly ethico-political project, one that seeks to identify other voices and other ways of knowing that may be overlooked and one that strives for transformation to a more democratic and just world. First, examples of pioneering research relate to cultural politics and Geography education. The Young People’s Geography Project calls on teachers and policy-makers to draw on young people’s experiences to ‘shape relevant and worthwhile learning in Geography lessons’ which help them make sense of their own lives and the lives of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132510394782">Biddulph, 2010a</xref>: 45) to influence education policy developments and bring about change towards a more democratic future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132510394782">Biddulph, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing on postcolonial theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309132510394782">Fran Martin (2010)</xref> examines global citizenship, sustainability and school partnership critically to reveal significant issues of ethnocentrism, paternalism and colonial discourses embedded within school Geography. She argues that, given the legacy of the ‘imperial gaze’ in contemporary direct and indirect North–South relationships ‘In some respects geography is part of the problem rather than the solution’ (p. 215). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309132510394782">Jessica Pykett (2010)</xref> researches into citizenship education, showing what Geography might contribute towards ‘a more critically engaged form of citizenship’ (p. 226) and how teaching about the cultural politics of fair trade can encourage students’ development as ‘ethical citizens’.</p>
<p>Further examples demonstrating state-of-the-art geographical education research revolve around the notion of place knowledge. Eleanor Rawling explains how an engagement with poetry in Geography classrooms can provoke a different kind of thinking place – a kind of thinking that stirs and values the senses which are not traditionally experienced through the subject. She argues that the expressive arts – including music, literature and poetry can contribute an important dimension of critical knowledge to fragile relationships between humans and the earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132510394782">Rawling, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132510394782">Alan Morgan (2010)</xref> explains how place-based Geography education adopts a holistic understanding of learners as intellectual, emotional, moral, spiritual and social beings who participate in collaborative inquiries. Such inquiries are not abstract, decontextualized and remote from students’ lived experiences, but are situated in their ‘locally relevant “real-world” issues with a view to understanding and taking action and thereby contributing to the improvement of the home locality’ (p. 86).</p>

<title>VI Conclusion</title>
<p>School Geography for 11–14-year-olds in England is under threat from curriculum policy reform. The foregoing analysis points to key culprits of dissatisfaction with the curriculum structure and with the modernist framework of knowledge underpinning the original Geography National Curriculum and its successors. Such accusations, amounting to a serious and, in my view, fair criticism, have opened up a space into which the question of ‘If not <italic>this</italic> curriculum, then <italic>what</italic> curriculum?’ has entered. At this point, those committed to the knowledge-based economy wasted little time in making their claims on the school curriculum, as the new-found mantra of curriculum flexibility ushered in competency-based curricula to replace discrete subject curricula for some students in some schools, with profound implications for social justice and education. The next chapter of the story is difficult to anticipate as the new coalition government in England determines its education policies. Some things are more certain – that the curriculum is a deeply political phenomenon, open to change according to dominant political discourses of the time. Curriculum is an intensely powerful force in shaping teachers’, students’ and parents’ subjectivities and has an immensely significant influence on the nature of society. The Geography curriculum has, I argue, an important contribution to make in constructing a just society by engaging young people in critical and ethically responsible deliberation and analysis about the world in the school classroom.</p>
