<p>This special edition was commissioned in response to one of the largest media scandals in recent history—the illegal practice of phone hacking. Although the events originated in the United Kingdom and relate particularly to the newspaper industry, the ramifications extend across the globe and across media, just as the tentacles of the Rupert Murdoch empire reach far and wide. As you read the articles that follow so the story unfolds: the lies and the deceit (Tiffen), the wily entanglement and extensive associations of media and political elites (Grantham; Coleman); the macho news cultures (Breit and Ricketson); and the sheer lack of accountability and transparency (Cathcart; Freedman) all add up to a tale of considerable woe.</p>
<p>If you didn’t know it already then these articles reveal in sharp relief that the newspaper industry in the United Kingdom is in crisis. But the crisis itself is not simply about unethical journalism and we should ourselves take care to avoid the temptation to concentrate on the sensational, however gripping this particular tale continues to be. There is a broader context to this debate that must be understood if the news industry is to recover and not fall flat on its face once more in the near future.</p>
<p>Part of this context relates to the defunct business models of many printed newspapers. Newspaper circulation and readership levels are at an all-time low and key advertising revenue has migrated to online sites. In the past decade, there has been a tremendous growth in the number of news outlets available, including the advent of, and rapid increase in, free papers, the emergence of 24-hour television news and the popularization of online and mobile platforms. News is produced and distributed at a faster rate than ever before and often takes place on several platforms at once. This has provided the newspaper industry with some real challenges. In a corporate news world it is now difficult to maintain profit margins and shareholder returns unless you employ fewer journalists. But fewer journalists with more space to fill means doing more work in less time, often leading to a greater use of unattributed rewrites of press agency or public relations material and the cut-and-paste practice that is now commonly referred to as churnalism. Churnalism does not lend itself to transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>If you combine the faster and shallower corporate journalism of the digital age with the need to pull in readers for commercial rather than journalistic reasons, it is not difficult to see how the values of professional journalism are quickly cast aside in order to indulge in sensationalism, trade in gratuitous spectacles, and deal in dubious emotionalism. The culture of the corporate, tabloid newsroom embodies this practice to such an extent that Rebekah Brooks (former editor of the former tabloid newspaper <italic>News of the World</italic>) doesn’t need to give the green light to phone hacking, it’s just part and parcel of what is expected. The net result is denigration of the professional life and integrity of news journalists, leading to a detrimental impact on the quality of news journalism and a consequent damage to our democracy.</p>
<p>The relationship between news and democracy works best when journalists are given the freedom (and resources) to do the job most journalists want to do—to scrutinize, to monitor, hold to account, interrogate power, to facilitate and maintain deliberation. But freedom in this context does not simply mean freedom from censorship and interference from government so frequently associated with the term ‘freedom of the press’; it also means freedom from the constraints and limitations of a thoroughly corporate culture. In neo-liberal democracies the power of the market is just as significant as the power of government. In the UK, there is certainly no rush to regulate for a healthy relationship between news media and democracy, yet there is plenty of urgency about the need to deregulate media for the benefit of the market.</p>
<p>This latest scandal is shocking not because of the awfulness of the practice of phone hacking, and the lack of humanity it has revealed but because it has exposed the heart of a system that is deeply flawed. The phone hacking saga shows that a marketized and corporatized media cannot be relied on to deliver the conditions for deliberative democracy to flourish. Markets do not have democratic intent at their core. When markets fail or come under threat, or simply become too bullish, ethical journalistic practice is swept aside in pursuit of competitive and financial gain. Yes, we need a public inquiry, but what we really need is a whole new framework for news in the public interest. In different ways each of the articles that follow demand that the independent inquiry set up by the government and chaired by Lord Justice Leveson should do just this.</p>
<p>News is no ordinary commodity, it provides the vital resources for processes of information gathering, deliberation, and analysis that enables democracy to function. In an ideal world, unfettered by other pressures this would mean that news media would survey the sociopolitical environment; hold the government and other officials to account; provide a platform for intelligible and illuminating debate; offer incentives for citizens to learn, choose, and become involved; and encourage dialogue across a range of views. This ideal relationship is, however, hinged on a conception of independent journalism in the public interest that the hacking scandal has so thoroughly undermined. As the articles that follow bear witness to, we need to reestablish the link between news and democracy, between journalism and the public interest and ask: What is in the public interest in relation to the provision of news for democracy to thrive?</p>
<p>As both Des Freedman and Howard Tumber note, this is about more than simply shoring up the possibilities for enhanced self-regulation and requires that we seek new and imaginative ways of regulating for the relationship between news and democracy while retaining independent journalism and freedom of the press.</p>
<p>Giving more powers to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC)—a body funded by the news industry itself, that operates on the basis of voluntary opt-in (with the <italic>Daily Star</italic> and the Daily Express who have voluntarily opted out), with precious little by way of sanctions—would be a sticking plaster on a much deeper wound that will continue to fester until once more the smell becomes unbearable and another scandal erupts (see the article by Hackett and Skinner). In a climate where journalists’ jobs are ever more insecure, it takes a very brave journalist to blow the whistle or even “self-regulate” in the manner the PCC promotes. Self-regulation has become the sacred mantra associated with the freedom of the press in the UK—the only apparent means to ensure government can’t interfere in, dictate the terms, and thwart the practice of journalism. But this denies the influence and power of a corporate culture that wreaks its own havoc and sets its own agenda often more blatantly than any democratic government would ever dare. If you are relatively powerless (say a journalist in relation to an editor), then self-regulation can be meaningless, particularly when the person in power does not share your views or whose management style is dominated by arrogance and egoism as the article by Breit and Ricketson reveals.</p>
<p>Subjecting the press to regulation to ensure public interest concerns are met is however seen as tantamount to authoritarian rule—deliberate interference with and inhibition of the freedom of the press as profoundly antidemocratic. Yet this approach has done nothing to protect the public interest in the provision of news and its contribution to democratic life to date and everything to encourage commercial news vandalism. Regulation does not destroy journalistic freedom as public service broadcasting pays testimony to and as Stephen Coleman’s piece notes.</p>
<p>If we accept that there is a connection between news and democracy—that news provides the vital resources for processes of information gathering, deliberation, and analysis – then surely it is not unreasonable to accept that it is any democratic government’s responsibility to ensure that the conditions are in place to encourage healthy democratic practice. An excessively liberalized press has failed to provide the freedom to practice independent journalism in the public interest. But this still leaves us with some pretty big questions: How do we invest commercial news with public interest priorities? How do we address issues concerning the economic performance and sustainable growth of the news industry? How do we develop new funding models that will sustain local and national news ventures in the public interest?</p>
<p>At least the current crisis has allowed these questions to be raised. The articles that follow outline just how important they are. But critically, as the articles by Cathcart and Hackett and Skinner argue, if these questions are to have any traction at all then it is vital that each and everyone of us is involved in campaigning for media reform and doing the research to help provide some of the answers.</p>
