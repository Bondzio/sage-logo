<p>The forecasts for the world and the UK economy reported in this <italic>Review</italic> are produced using NIESR's model, NiGEM. The NiGEM model has been in use at the National Institute for forecasting and policy analysis since 1987, and is also used by a group of about 40 model subscribers, mainly in the policy community. Most countries in the OECD<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-002795011222000106">1</xref></sup> are modelled separately, and there are also separate models of China, India, Russia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Brazil, South Africa, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Bulgaria. The rest of the world is modelled through regional blocks so that the model is global in scope. All models contain the determinants of domestic demand, export and import volumes, prices, current accounts and net assets. Output is tied down in the long run by factor inputs and technical progress interacting through production functions, but is driven by demand in the short to medium term. Economies are linked through trade, competitiveness and financial markets and are fully simultaneous. Further details on the NiGEM model are available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nimodel.niesr.ac.uk/">http://nimodel.niesr.ac.uk/</ext-link>.</p>
<p>There are a number of key assumptions underlying our current forecast. The interest rates and exchange rate assumptions are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tableA1-002795011222000106">tables A1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="tableA2-002795011222000106">A2</xref>. Our short-term interest rate assumptions are generally based on current financial market expectations, as implied by the rates of return on treasury bills of different maturities. Long-term interest rate assumptions are consistent with forward estimates of short-term interest rates, allowing for a country-specific term premium in the Euro Area.</p>

<p>In this context, we note that after reversing its main policy rate to its record level of 1 per cent and engaging in two rounds of long-term refinancing operations, the ECB has recently adopted a ‘wait and see’ approach, as inflation is expected to remain above 2 per cent in 2012 and economic growth has stabilised at low levels. Meanwhile, the Bank of England maintained its interest rate at its record low 0.5 per cent, whilst expanding its programme of asset purchase by a further £50 billion in February. Total asset purchase reaches a total of £325 billion to date, aiming at averting a deflationary spiral by using central bank reserves to purchase government bonds. The Bank of Japan also maintained its current rate unchanged in the short term in order to support economic growth after the twin disasters of March 2011. The Federal Reserve continues to stress that interest rates in the US will remain low for an extended period, while Canada maintained the target for the overnight rate at 1 per cent, anticipating sluggish global growth and the risk that Europe's debt crisis could linger on.</p>
<p>Similarly, after widespread interest rate hikes in the emerging economies, official rates have been kept on hold in recent months as the global inflationary pressure coming from high food and oil prices appears to ease. However, in Brazil, the central bank has just announced its sixth policy rate cut since August 2011, which now stands at 9 per cent as a response to lower growth expectations this year.</p>

Long real rates followed nominal rates in a sharp drop since the second quarter of 2011 in the Euro Area, Canada, and Japan, whilst they have improved in recent months in the US. The monetary stance is expected to remain expansionary until 2013–14, when real interest rates in North America are expected to stabilise close to historical levels. A somewhat higher level in the Euro Area, where the long real rate is forecast to average 1 1/2 per cent this year, reflects the risk premium on sovereign debt in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy. We see real interest rates in Japan stabilising around a level rather below international rates of return.</p>

<p>Long real rates are illustrative measures of the state of the economy, but do not reflect the actual borrowing costs faced by firms, which pay a premium above the risk-free rates to reflect the risk of default. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA2-002795011222000106">Figure A2</xref> depicts the spread between corporate bond yields and 10-year government bond yields in the US, UK and Euro Area. Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, corporate spreads jumped to their highest level since the Great Depression. After falling to recent lows in April 2010, spreads in the UK have risen significantly throughout the second half of 2011 and the first half of 2012, reflecting constrained lending conditions for corporates. Spreads in the US have also risen over the same time period but to a lesser extent. Since the beginning of 2012, Euro Area spreads have started to fall and have reached the levels observed in the third quarter of 2010, most probably reflecting relief brought by the ECB's three-year loan programme.</p>

<p>Nominal exchange rates against the US dollar are generally assumed to remain constant at the prevailing rate in the first week of April 2012 in the short term. They then follow a backward-looking uncovered-interest parity condition, based on interest rate differentials relative to the US. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA3-002795011222000106">Figure A3</xref> illustrates the effective exchange rate projections for the US, Euro Area, Japan, Canada and the UK. The US dollar has weakened relative to other currencies since mid-2010, reflecting the looser monetary policy stance compared to most of the rest of the world. The US dollar effective exchange rate has stabilised since the beginning of 2012 after appreciating significantly in the last quarter of 2011. The Euro Area effective exchange rate has also not changed much over this year and currently stands at about 2 1/2 per cent below its level in the fourth quarter of 2011. Meanwhile, Japan's interventions to bring its currency down against the dollar seem to bring some relief, as the Yen has stabilised around 32 per cent above its pre-crisis level. Sterling lost nearly 20 per cent of its value between the end of 2007 and end of 2009, but has been broadly stable since then. The Canadian dollar tends to follow the oil price closely, and has followed it upward over the past year, with no significant changes observed since the beginning of 2012.</p>

<p>Our oil price assumptions for the short term are based on those of the US Energy Information Administration, who use information from forward markets as well as an evaluation of supply conditions. In the longer term, we assume that real oil prices will rise in line with the real interest rate. The oil price assumptions underlying our current forecast are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA4-002795011222000106">figure A4</xref> and in table 1 at the beginning of this chapter. Annual average oil prices, based on the average of Brent and Dubai spot prices, rose by almost 40 per cent between 2010 and 2011. Tight demand and supply balances and the Libyan crisis triggered this rise. Prices increased by a further 9 per cent in the first quarter this year, from $107.7 to $117.3 per barrel, in response to the recent standoff over Iran's nuclear plans. Brent crude oil prices reached levels well above $125 per barrel in the first half of March, but have recently eased back below $120. In our forecast, we assumed that oil prices would average $121.8 per barrel this year, up by more than $10 per barrel compared to our January 2012 baseline assumptions.</p>

<p>Our equity price assumptions for the US reflect the return on capital. Other equity markets are assumed to move in line with the US market, but are adjusted for different exchange rate movements and shifts in country-specific equity risk premia. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figA5-002795011222000106">Figure A5</xref> illustrates the equity price assumptions underlying our current forecast. Global share prices dropped sharply in the third quarter of 2011 in response to the deepening of the Euro Area debt crisis and the downgrade of US government debt. However, we have seen a rebound in most countries since October, with the exception of Greece, Portugal and Spain. In Japan, share prices have been on a declining trend since 2007, standing about 50 per cent below their pre-crisis levels, and were further exacerbated last year by the sharp decline recorded in the wake of the tsunami crisis.</p>

<p>Fiscal policy assumptions for 2012–13 follow announced policies. Average personal sector tax rates and effective corporate tax rate assumptions underlying the projections are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tableA3-002795011222000106">table A3</xref>. Government revenue as a share of GDP reported in the table reflects these tax rate assumptions and our forecast projections for income and profits, as well as our projections for consumption tax revenue. Consumption tax revenue projections also reflect indirect tax cuts in Germany and rises in Australia, Portugal and the UK in 2011. Moreover, we expect further increases in consumption taxes this year in Finland, Ireland and Italy. Following fiscal consolidation plans, average income tax rates in 2012–13 are expected to rise sharply in Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain as well as in the US where various temporary fiscal stimulus programmes have just come to an end. The effective corporate tax rate is expected to rise this year in Canada, Italy, Japan and the US, whilst falling in the UK. Finally, government spending in 2012 and 2013 is expected to continue to fall sharply as a share of GDP in Greece, Ireland and Spain, with more moderate adjustments planned in the majority of the remaining countries to address budget deficits.</p>
