<sec id="section4-0194599813477354">
<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>Medical charts of 103 surgically treated patients (71 patients younger than 70 years and 32 patients aged 70 years and older) in a tertiary referral center with sinonasal malignancy were retrospectively analyzed. Comorbidity was scored according to the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27 system. Treatment outcomes were analyzed by collecting treatment-related complications scores and survival data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599813477354">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Although comorbidity was more common in elderly patients, no significant differences were recorded in complications. In multivariate analysis, length of surgery was the only predictor for complication. Furthermore, no significant differences were seen in disease-specific survival and recurrence in young and elderly patients. Young patients with malignant epithelial tumors and melanoma had worse overall survival than patients with other histological subtypes. However, in elderly patients, no significant differences were seen in survival between histological subtypes.</p>

<sec id="section6-0194599813477354">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>For complications, survival, and recurrence, no differences were seen between young and elderly patients. Based on this study, surgery can also be safely performed in elderly sinonasal cancer patients after careful preoperative evaluation and patient selection.</p>

<body>
<p>Sinonasal malignancies are uncommon neoplasms. According to a recent Dutch study, the present incidence is about 11 cases per 1,000,000 inhabitant per year in the Netherlands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813477354">1</xref></sup> These rare tumors include several histological subtypes, which makes it difficult to perform prospective trials or even to collect enough cases for larger retrospective studies. The most common histological subtypes are epithelial tumors, with an incidence of 4.42 per million in Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813477354">2</xref></sup> The incidence of other subtypes, such as mucosal melanoma, sarcoma, and sinonasal tumors with neuroendocrine differentiation (STND), is even lower. The histological classification of these tumors is unfortunately not uniform in the literature, which makes it even more difficult to compare different studies.</p>
<p>Sinonasal tumors are presenting typically in an advanced stage and have poor prognosis, with an overall 5-year survival of 35% to 53%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813477354">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813477354"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813477354">5</xref></sup> The cornerstone of the treatment of these malignancies is surgery and postoperative (chemo)radiotherapy. This combined modality treatment proved to be associated with the best survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813477354">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813477354"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813477354"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813477354"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813477354"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813477354"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813477354">10</xref></sup> Although a great proportion of sinonasal cancer patients are elderly, the postoperative complication rate and predictors for complications and survival are poorly investigated in the aged population. Generally, there is an ongoing debate in the literature whether age is an independent predictor for posttreatment complication in head and neck cancer. Concerning paranasal cancer surgery, the only study focusing on this issue analyzed purely craniofacial resection and included different primary sites involving the skull base.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813477354">11</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate complications and survival of patients with nasal and paranasal malignancies, focusing on differences between elderly and younger patients undergoing surgery.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599813477354" sec-type="methods">
<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>Patients with cancer of the nasal cavity (C30.0 according to the ICD-O-3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813477354">12</xref></sup>) and of the paranasal sinuses (ICD-O-3: C31.0–C31.9) between 1995 and 2009 and treated by surgery in the University Medical Center Groningen were extracted from the database of the Comprehensive Cancer Centre in the Netherlands. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed patients surgically treated with a curative intention for malignant tumor of the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses. Patient and tumor characteristics, including age, sex, tumor site, stage (according to the AJCC 7th edition), and histological subtype were registered. Treatment parameters such as type and length of operation and eventual postoperative radiotherapy were extracted from medical records. Only therapeutic interventions were analyzed; diagnostic ones were not. Patients were analyzed in 2 age groups: patients 70 years and older and patients younger than 70 years.</p>
<p>Comorbidity of all patients was registered using the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27 index.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813477354">13</xref></sup> Complications were graded using the contracted form of the Clavien-Dindo classification of complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813477354">14</xref></sup> It has been recently used to analyze complications in head and neck cancer reconstructive surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813477354">15</xref></sup> The contracted form of this scoring system classifies complications within 1 month after surgery (or longer in case of prolonged hospitalization) in 5 grades. Univariate significance was determined using the chi-squared test, survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimations, and statistical differences in groups were determined by performing the log-rank test. Only disease-specific survival (DSS) data were included, as the analysis was performed in 2 different age groups, which hampers overall survival. DSS was defined as the time between surgery and death of patients due to locoregional recurrence or distant metastasis.</p>
<p>The review committee of the National Cancer Registration gave permission for this study as privacy was considered to be adequately covered. Historical cohort-based studies on medical records do not need Institutional Review Board approval in the Netherlands since there is no health risk.</p>

<title>Patient Characteristics</title>
<p>Characteristics of the surgical interventions are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813477354"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. One hundred seven patients were identified who have undergone in total 107 interventions for sinonasal malignancy in our institution. There were 71 patients younger than 70 years and 32 patients 70 years old or older. The mean age of the younger group was 54 years and 76 years of the elderly group. Most of the patients had advanced stage 3 and 4 disease, with slightly more advanced stages in the elderly patients, but the differences were not significant. Most of the primary tumors were found in the nasal cavity, followed by the maxillary sinus and ethmoid. We registered 73 surgical interventions in the younger group and 34 in the elderly group. The most common surgical procedure was lateral rhinotomy, followed by craniofacial resection and maxillectomy. The length of the surgery varied widely, between 15 minutes and more than 12 hours. The mean length of the procedures differed significantly between the 2 groups; it was 252 minutes in the young population versus 154 minutes in the elderly patients. The most common histological subtypes were the epithelial tumors in both age groups, accounting for almost 60% of all patients, followed by sinonasal tumors with neuroendocrine differentiation in the younger population (27%) and melanoma in the elderly patients (27%). Most, about 80%, of the patients received postoperative radiotherapy in both patient groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the first study analyzing comorbidity, postoperative complications, and DSS in sinonasal malignancies focusing on differences between elderly (≥70 years) and young patients (&lt;70 years). In our study, as expected, comorbidity was more common in elderly patients. Despite this, no significant difference was recorded in postoperative complications. This finding is very likely due to good patient selection in the elderly group, based on proper preoperative screening of patients. As only surgically treated patients were analyzed, there is surely a selection bias in the study population. We do not know how many patients were not treated surgically and for what reason. In multivariate analysis, length of surgery was the only predictor for complication; age, stage, and comorbidity were not. No significant difference was seen in the DSS of young and elderly patients. The survival of young patients differed significantly by histological subtype. However, in elderly patients, no significant difference was seen in survival between histological subtypes.</p>
<p>Our finding that comorbidity is more frequent and more severe in elderly patients corresponds with other studies on head and neck cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813477354">16</xref></sup> The similar postoperative complication rate in young and elderly patients observed in the present study is not really surprising. Previous articles on head and neck cancer patients had comparable findings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599813477354">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599813477354"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813477354"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599813477354">20</xref></sup> concluding that major head and neck surgery can also be safely performed in elderly patients after thorough preoperative evaluation. The present study analyzes only surgically treated patients; therefore, good patient selection for surgery is very likely the key to the not-increased complication rate despite higher occurrence of comorbid conditions. The postoperative complication rate of paranasal cancer sinus surgery has not been thoroughly investigated. The few studies focusing on postoperative complications almost all report exclusively on craniofacial resection. One exception is the study by Hanna et al. from 2009,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599813477354">21</xref></sup> which found an overall postoperative complication rate after endoscopic resection of sinonasal cancer as low as 11% regardless of whether a craniotomy was performed. This very favorable result is probably also because only surgical and no other complications were included in this study. The complication rate of ~35% in this study was in agreement with a large international multicentric study that found a 4.7% postoperative mortality and a 36.3% complication rate (including nonsurgical complications) after craniofacial resection of 1193 patients in 17 institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599813477354">22</xref></sup> Comorbidity was found to be the only significant predictor of mortality, while comorbidity, prior radiotherapy, and extent of intracranial tumor growth were independent predictors of postoperative complications. A more recent article also analyzed the incidence of postoperative complications after craniofacial resection, varying between 29.7% and 54%. The postoperative complications of craniofacial resection are well described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813477354">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599813477354">23</xref></sup> In the most recent and largest series by Ganly et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813477354">11</xref></sup> the postoperative complication rate in elderly patients was found to be as high as 42% and the mortality rate was 9%; both were significantly higher than in the younger group. In this study, age was found to be related to poorer survival. These data are difficult to compare with our results as our analysis includes different types of surgeries. However, our data contradict the previous findings of these studies showing that age and comorbidity are not independent predictors of complications. These conflicting data can be probably explained by careful patient selection in the operated population, especially in the elderly population. To address this question, all patients (and thus the primarily irradiated or palliated patient population) should be analyzed. On the other hand, we were the first to describe the relationship between surgery time and chance of complication after sinonasal cancer surgery. The finding that longer surgery predicts postoperative complication is an important issue. It should stimulate surgeons to perform more simple and faster interventions, especially in older and frail patients.</p>
<p>Our DSS was about 65%, which is better than most recent published studies in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813477354">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813477354"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813477354">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813477354">9</xref></sup> Most of these studies also investigate predictors of survival. Data on age as an independent negative predictor of survival are controversial. Some authors found it to be significant factor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813477354">6</xref></sup> whereas others did not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813477354">5</xref></sup> Comparing survival of different age groups is difficult as the life expectancy of the healthy aged population is shorter. Therefore, we did not include overall survival analysis in our present study. We did not find differences in the DSS of young and elderly patients in our series. Therefore, we conclude that the (treatment of) sinonasal malignant tumor does not shorten life expectancy more in elderly patients. Thus, although elderly patients have a shorter a priori life expectancy, the similar tumor-related survival should be a reason not to treat elderly patients differently. The analysis of survival in different histological subtypes brought an interesting finding in our series: histology was not related to DSS in elderly patients. Most studies found the worst survival in patients with a malignant sinonasal melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813477354">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599813477354">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599813477354">25</xref></sup>; our study confirmed this only in young patients. Some caution should be considered because only a small number of patients with melanoma were included. However, the difference between young and elderly patients with sinonasal melanomas is striking.</p>
<p>To make better choices in the treatment of these patients, a prospective study is needed. Our study cannot answer the question as to which cases surgical treatment must be avoided, as we did not include patients who were nonsurgically treated. For the proper decision making of the multidisciplinary team, patients should be included with all treatment intentions and modalities. Not only treatment outcome but pretreatment and posttreatment quality-of-life analysis could also help in deciding whether it is worth these patients to operate.</p>
<p>Based on this retrospective study, we can conclude that complications, survival, and recurrence are not significantly different in young and elderly patients undergoing surgery for sinonasal malignancies. Therefore, based on this study, surgery can also be safely performed in elderly sinonasal cancer patients after careful preoperative evaluation and patient selection. As only surgically treated patients were included, the present study surely suffers from selection bias. To further investigate the risk of age in sinonasal cancer treatment, a prospective study is needed.</p>
