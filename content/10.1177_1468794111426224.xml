<abstract>
<p>Using Timescapes ‘Men as Fathers’ (MAF) project data, qualitative longitudinal (QL) and psychosocial case study approaches are showcased for studying the making of paternal subjectivity in and through time. The accounts of two men from self-defined ‘working’ and ‘middle-class’ backgrounds are explored, focusing on how their <italic>lines of flight</italic> as paternal subjects are shaped by tensions between a push towards new subjectivities and the pull of old discourses. The men’s vexed intergenerational inheritance of classed versions of masculinity is shown to be an energizing force which, in dynamic relationship to other social and discursive forces, produces shifting investments in <italic>motherly</italic> and <italic>affectionate</italic> models of fathering. Adopting QL and psychosocial lenses, and foregrounding the importance of men’s intergenerational experiences, positions and transitions as paternal subjects, provides insights into the broad sociocultural transformations in masculinity and fatherhood threading through the dynamics of individual lives.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The dominance of sociocultural narratives proclaiming a new era of involved fatherhood has ignited debate among scholars adopting different, and sometimes conflicting theoretical lenses on how men who become fathers are living out their lives in today’s world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468794111426224">Featherstone, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468794111426224">Henwood and Procter, 2003</xref>). Changing sociocultural narratives of fatherhood cascading through western social theory, policy, popular culture and fathers’ own accounts have produced the cumulative effect of replacing previously prevalent models of fatherhood (e.g. the father as the absent breadwinner) with new hegemonic ideals emphasizing fathers’ active involvement in their children’s lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468794111426224">Dermott, 2003</xref>). Previous work of the ‘Men as Fathers’ study (subsequently referred to as the MAF study) complicates stories of change through its analysis of the co-existence (convergence and collision) in men’s accounts of both modern and traditional fatherly identifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468794111426224">Finn and Henwood, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468794111426224">Henwood and Finn, 2010</xref>). Setting aside grand narratives of historical progress, this research illuminates the complex range of social, discursive and psychological forces dynamically mediating men’s shifting <italic>identificatory positionings</italic> as first-time fathers. Highlighting the complex mix of hegemonic and non-hegemonic masculinities in play in men’s paternal imaginings, the research challenges uncritical celebration of new fatherhood and attempts to dismiss it as cultural fallacy.</p>
<p>This article develops the previous psychosocial work by adopting a more focused longitudinal lens on the playing out of men’s competing and contradictory paternal positionings (and lived lives) in both the short and longer term. A spotlight is thrown onto class positions, transitions and intergenerational transmissions to specify in greater depth the multiple relationalities and temporalities infusing men’s ways of becoming and being fathers. Our methodological interest is in conducting qualitative longitudinal (QL) case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468794111426224">Thomson, 2007</xref>): by adopting a theoretically light touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468794111426224">Charmaz and Henwood, 2008</xref>) we produce a kind of ethnographic <italic>thick description</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468794111426224">Geertz, 1973</xref>) capable of demonstrating the production of analytically rich insights out of a synthesis of theory, data and methods. Following a brief sketch of some key orienting methodological lenses we present our case studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1468794111426224" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodological lenses</title>
<p>Theoretically informed qualitative research in studies of gender, parenting and generation is increasingly focused on the production of new subjectivities in the linked contexts of: (1) sociocultural transformations around work, gender and caring roles and relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794111426224">Aitken, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468794111426224">Doucet, 2006</xref>); (2) late modern processes of <italic>reflexive modernization</italic> and <italic>detraditionalization</italic> after theorists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794111426224">Beck and Beck-Gernsheim (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468794111426224">Giddens (1990)</xref>, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468794111426224">Williams (2008)</xref>; and (3) gradual shifts in structure and agency as new generations act on the changing historical circumstances in which they find themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468794111426224">Brannen and Nilsen, 2006</xref>). Our interest in perspectives on new subjectivities means that we are committed to exploring when, how and why men’s sense making moves into and expands spaces for the production of new subjectivities which exceed dominant or hegemonic formations of masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794111426224">Connell, 1995</xref>) and fatherhood. We are also concerned with the individual, intersubjective and broader contextual processes and realities pulling men’s ways of doing and being fathers away from these non-hegemonic and transformative spaces and back onto more familiar territory of old discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468794111426224">Bjerrum Nielsen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Several perspectives within fatherhood and masculinity studies have been particularly fruitful for developing our analytical insights. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468794111426224">Doucet’s (2006)</xref> spatio-temporal approach to the reinvention and re-enactment of fathering emphasizes <italic>borderwork</italic> and <italic>border crossing</italic> (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468794111426224">Thorne, 1993</xref>), throwing light on the igniting and dampening down of gender differences in situations of parenting young children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794111426224">Aitken’s (2009)</xref> work on the ‘awkward spaces of fathering’ draws on Deleuzian motifs such as <italic>lines of flight</italic> to emphasize how fathers (and others) are remaking fatherhood as an institution through the everyday worlds and practices of fathering. Focusing on fathers’ lines of flight throws light on the ambiguous, hesitant and inconclusive nature of paternal subjectivity and practice conceived as an unfolding and never fully accomplished process of <italic>becoming other</italic>. It emphasizes the inevitable tensions between the possibilities fathering creates for new modes of existence (e.g. by ‘crossing over’ into ‘feminized’ spaces of nurturing and reproduction), and the reality of building viable identities within the often highly gender differentiated contexts in which fathers find themselves. Aitken’s focus guides attention towards the different choices opened up by the <italic>emotional work</italic> of fathering and the ways in which these choices are negotiated, modified and changed as they rub against socially mandated and affectively charged ideas of masculinity and fatherhood.</p>
<p>Psychosocial perspectives emphasizing the conscious and unconscious significance of biographical experiences in the negotiation of discursively available subject positionings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468794111426224">Gough’s 2009</xref> work on father-son relations) also inform our interpretations. In our case, this entails a willingness to listen beyond the men’s coherent narratives of positively embracing changing gendered and generational relationships. Instead, we focus on the tensions, inconsistencies and shifts in the men’s accounts and how they relate to the men’s affective investments in inherited masculine and paternal subject positions.</p>
<p>Scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468794111426224">Bertaux and Thompson (1993</xref>: 2) have argued that intergenerational transmission, understood as a ‘double-faceted’, individual and social, ‘two-way’ relationship, is a crucial lens for unpacking the connections between micro level processes (in particular the ‘microclimate’ of the family) and macro phenomenon such as broad patterns of class and social mobility. Our QL and psychosocial mode of enquiry explores the significance of intergenerational transmissions of classed masculinities in understanding men’s lines of flight (positions and transitions) within both shifting gendered and generational contexts and the emerging microclimates of their nascent families. It addresses the complex relationships between masculinity and class which are often implicit and under examined in masculinity studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468794111426224">Morgan, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>These methodological lenses inform our case studies by bringing into view the potential importance of classed paternal transmissions in the social and psychological experience of becoming a father, and the transformations becoming a father brings to bear on men’s identities, relationships and lives in and over time. Focusing upon transmission can be informative about continuities and changes in fatherhood/fathering between generations and how these are experienced and negotiated by fathers located in particular biographical, cultural and social contexts. These issues are explored in the case studies in relation to two interlinked themes arising out of the data: (1) the vexed rejection/replication of inherited classed masculinities; (2) classed transmissions and affective flows energizing the <italic>motherly</italic> and <italic>affectionate</italic> father identifications the men speak about in their narratives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468794111426224">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>The study</title>
<p>The MAF study follows two groups of men through their transition to and beyond first-time fatherhood. In 2000, 30 expectant first-time fathers were qualitatively interviewed and then followed through into second, and in some cases, third interviews within a year after their child’s birth. The project lay dormant for a period but was then reactivated as part of the Timescapes Network. Subsequently, 19 of the original participants were re-interviewed again in 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468794111426224">2</xref></sup> During the second phase of the study, a new sample of 16 expectant fathers was recruited and interviewed three times in 2008–9,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1468794111426224">3</xref></sup> so that the total sample was 46 men. Participants were aged between 15 and 41 at first interview and in a range of occupational and relationship situations. The project’s intensive design provides insight into change as it is happening, while the later interviews offer a longer-term perspective.</p>
<sec id="section4-1468794111426224">
<title>Ethical issues</title>
<p>Ethical issues arising were dealt with at dedicated MAF project meetings and subsequently shared with other teams at Timescapes’ Ethics Round Tables. Three issues have demanded our particular attention.</p>
<sec id="section5-1468794111426224">
<title>Anonymity</title>
<p>Waves of data created by tracking participants over time allowed factual information about participants to accumulate and their unfolding biographies to take shape. These data were then prepared for archiving and publication. A great deal of care and attention has been paid to these tasks to offset the risks of exposure inherent to the study method. All real names and company names were replaced by pseudonyms. Local place names and the names of specific institutions (e.g. hospitals) were edited out and geographic areas significantly widened. In cases where participants are more publically visible (e.g. have a strong internet presence) or occupy a work position that is prominent or uncommon, access to the data has been restricted. In making use of restricted data, the research team have taken additional precautions to protect anonymity, for example by providing only broad-brush information about a participant’s occupation, and adopting the same procedures when providing information about significant others. While ensuring that anonymity is maintained remains paramount, care has been taken to preserve the sense, meanings and authenticity of participants’ accounts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1468794111426224">
<title>Researcher change and continuity</title>
<p>As the MAF project has evolved during the first and second phases of the study there has been continuity and change in the make-up and roles of the research team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468794111426224">Henwood and Shirani, in press</xref>). In the case of the two participants in this article, the first, Malcolm, was interviewed by two researchers – on three occasions by the original researcher Joanne Kellett (nee Proctor) and eight years later by Mark Finn, while the second, Richard, was interviewed on three occasions by Fiona Shirani. The impact of researcher change and continuity on the study has been discussed in a Timescapes working paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468794111426224">Shirani, 2010</xref>), which concluded that researcher discontinuity has not been detrimental to the MAF inquiry process.</p>
<p>When Carrie Coltart replaced Mark Finn in September 2009, the data generation phase of study was almost complete, therefore she did not conduct any interviews. Changes to the make-up of the research team and the particular relationships each member has to the design of the study, the primary data, the two phases of the project and the other researchers mean that the MAF study has relied on collaborative working and routinely crossed conventional boundaries between primary and secondary analysis (Irwin et al., this issue). Particular ethical challenges are raised in such collaborative work stemming from the way some team members, who work on fixed-term contracts, can have restricted opportunities for career progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468794111426224">Mauthner and Doucet, 2008</xref>). These ethical concerns are integral to longitudinal qualitative studies such as ours where the efforts of research staff are essential to securing the long-term future of the study. They are also magnified in times of economic downturn for principle investigators as they struggle with the increased uncertainties and declining opportunities for future funding, creating competition between collaborating teams.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1468794111426224">
<title>Ethics of representation</title>
<p>A further ethical issue has arisen out of our interest in this article in examining the negotiation of classed masculine and paternal subjectivities in contexts of generational and gendered change. This interest inevitably draws us into representational contexts, shaped by class inequality, in which working-class men have been shown to be objects of unwarranted disdain – for example, as stubbornly resistant to sociocultural transformations around gender; and middle-class men the objects of respect – for example, autonomous, rational, and modern subjects of choice and agency (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468794111426224">Sayer, 2005</xref>, for a discussion of the unequal bases of respect, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468794111426224">Haylett, 2001</xref>, for a discussion of how this shapes representations of class and masculinity). For both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468794111426224">Sayer (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468794111426224">Haylett (2001)</xref> the problem of unwarranted disdain and respect is compounded by (increasingly) unequal access to practices and roles that warrant respect and often bring wider recognition (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468794111426224">Haylett, 2001</xref>, refers to the demise of heavy industry and the unions as examples of positive sources of identity-making being closed off for working-class men). We see the two fathers’ differential ‘access to the social bases of respect and self-respect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468794111426224">Sayer, 2005</xref>: 959) and their situated experience of negotiating different, albeit intertwined bases of respect (e.g. public and private versions of masculinity) in contexts of generational and gendered change as significant for our analysis. We also recognize that there is a very fine line between locating the men’s accounts within this representational context and fixing them within the evaluative logic of class inequality. We have sought to tread this line by emphasizing the vexed nature of both men’s experience of transmission and change around fathering and masculinity, and by highlighting both fathers’ active attempts to negotiate their intergenerational inheritance in response to new ideals of intimate and involved fatherhood.</p>

<sec id="section8-1468794111426224">
<title>Case study selection</title>
<p>To conduct our QL/psychosocial analysis we chose two participants with interesting similarities in their accounts: an absence of planning for the pregnancy on their part, identifications with motherly forms of fathering, and partners identified as independent and capable career-oriented women. This piqued our interest in the commonalities and differences in the experiences of these two White British fathers from self-identified ‘working-class’ and ‘upper-middle-class’ backgrounds. At the time of the first interview, Malcolm (32), son of a Bus Driver father and Shop Assistant mother, is working full-time, away from home, as a Prison Officer. However, by the fourth interview he occupies a position of significant managerial authority within his profession and works within commuting distance of home. At the time of the first interview, Richard (37), son of a mainstream Christian Minister father and Housewife mother, is working in a full-time senior position as a Professional Theologian, a position he retains at the time of the third round of interviews. To give a brief sense of the participants’ changing work arrangements over time: Malcolm and his partner Lynn both worked full-time pre-birth and continued to work full-time (after Lynn completed her maternity leave) with the assistance of full-time paid childcare and shared childcare at weekends. Eight years later and after the birth of the couple’s second child, Lynn had reduced her working hours to part-time. In the case of Richard, he and his wife Lindsay worked full-time pre- and post-birth (with the exception of maternity leave and the first weeks when Richard was the main carer to the child). Outside working hours, they used full-time paid childcare and shared the care of their daughter.</p>
<sec id="section9-1468794111426224">
<title>Biographical and intergenerational details as analytic resources</title>
<p>By foregrounding biographical details that are germane to our analysis (as above), and their subsequent reappearance (as part of the case study presentations), we are able to entwine biographical time in our analysis. Importantly, such details make reference not only to socio-economic/class positions, gender and familial relationships illuminating many dynamic aspects of the men’s biographies, but also to generational issues linking and differentiating the work/family practices and experiences of transmission by the two fathers. By focusing on the interplay between the various personal, social and relational aspects of fathering, and questions about <italic>generational</italic> issues in the men’s biographical accounts – presented as QL/psychosocial case studies, our analysis shows how the different routes and experiences of the men lead to similarities in the kinds of settlements they can make as paternal subjects in and through time.</p>

<title>Qualitative longitudinal/psychosocial analysis</title>
<sec id="section11-1468794111426224">
<title>Malcolm: taking flight from ‘macho’ masculinity: becoming a motherly father</title>
<p>In his pre-birth interview, the prospect of becoming a father provides Malcolm with a welcome opportunity to ‘grow up’ and leave behind a ‘laddish’ lifestyle in favour of a more sober and responsible adult male identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468794111426224">Lewis, 1986</xref>): ‘going down the pub as and when I want to, that will stop. Going out with the lads as and when I want to, that will stop’. The transition to fatherhood also presents Malcolm with the possibility of another form of identity reworking by providing a new focus for his ‘gooey persona’, a dimension of self which Malcolm sees as being submerged or requiring sophisticated handling (e.g. through humour) in his ‘macho area’ of work. The intertwined potentialities contained within fatherhood (e.g. for personal growth and greater intimacy in relationships) coalesce in Malcolm’s imaginings of his future self as a ‘modern’ ‘involved’ and ‘approachable’ father.</p>
<p>A closer inspection of Malcolm’s account lends deeper understanding of the range of mediating dynamics freighting his investments in ideals of modern fatherhood. A general cultural mood of optimism around changing gendered and generational relationships and discursive shifts around dominant models of fatherhood resonate with Malcolm’s negative memories of being fathered, encouraging Malcolm to distance himself from his ‘Victorian’ father and position his own preferred fathering identity as ‘more modern’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1468794111426224">4</xref></sup> Malcolm also talks about his relationship with his partner Lynn’s seven-year-old son Kyle in terms of powerful flows of emotion and affect – ‘well you can see he adores me and that’s so important, there’s nothing better’ – perhaps reinforcing his investments in a new father identity.</p>
<p>A common thread arguably running through the multiple mediations of Malcolm’s modern father identity (becoming even clearer in the later interviews) is his strong desire to take flight as a father from troubled and troubling ‘macho’ forms of masculinity. Malcolm articulates this view most explicitly in the second interview: ‘if [men] want to be macho or whatever then they shouldn’t be a father as far as I’m concerned, I don’t think the two mix really’. However, it is also implicit in his first interview, for example in his rejection of ‘traditional roles’ and his discussion of the demise of what Malcolm clearly sees as the more outworn patterns of fathering: ‘I think a lot of the bravado in men has gone. The big I’m the hard disciplinarian, the breadwinner, or whatever’. The importance Malcolm places on eschewing ‘macho’ masculinity in paternal spaces is perhaps increased by his personal proximity to this problematic subject positioning both in the form of classed masculine transmissions from his father and the embodied masculinity he is required to adopt in his work identity and practices: i.e. as a ‘tough’, ‘man’s man’ confronting the sometimes violent and aggressive behaviours of other men. The salience of ‘macho’ masculinity in Malcolm’s experience and its perceived incompatibility with good fathering (reinforced no doubt by cultural ideals dissociating fatherhood from traditional forms of masculinity, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794111426224">Aitken, 2009</xref>) is arguably key to unpacking Malcolm’s investment in highly involved, intimate or motherly fathering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468794111426224">Finn and Henwood, 2009</xref>). When asked in the first interview about what constitutes a good father Malcolm replies:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Someone who’s there, someone who’s approachable, full involvement down to changing nappies, washing nappies, whatever. I think to some degree, I would prefer to look at myself as a ‘mother’ figure. I know it sounds quite silly, but the role of the mother because they seem to be there all the time, involved all the time, and they’re ‘best friends’ so to speak.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>However, Malcolm’s ideal notion of the good father creates an immediate tension due to a lack of fit with the reality of his personal circumstances. Malcolm works long hours and suggests that the financial need for this arrangement will be even greater after the baby’s arrival:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>I might have to work overtime because Lynn is having quite a bit of time off work . . . we have to do that for a period of time until we can develop the home and get on further with other things.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>An additional barrier to involvement for Malcolm is that his job requires him to spend substantial periods of time away from home: not ideal circumstances in which Malcolm would choose to become a father. For example, Malcolm describes how he ‘relented’ to his partner’s desire for a child but, preferably, would have waited and ‘planned a bit more correctly’. He also laments the fact that he will be a ‘part-time father’, ‘that is not what I wanted in any way, shape or form’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1468794111426224">
<title>Richard: pinning hopes on the affectionate father model</title>
<p>Richard also talks about the unexpected nature of his wife’s pregnancy after 11 years of marriage (the couple had been told that fertility problems would make a successful pregnancy unlikely). Like Malcolm, Richard expresses concerns about the potential limits to father involvement, although differently from Malcolm, it is not primarily circumstances but ideology – Richard’s self-confessed ‘workaholism’ – which is at odds with the cultural emphasis on active paternal involvement.</p>
<p>A striking aspect of Richard’s account of becoming a father is the salience of paternal legacies and transmissions. Richard describes his adult relationship with his father as ‘friendly’, emphasizing that following his father into a church-based career has provided ‘common meeting ground’ for the two men. However, from the very outset of the interviews, Richard articulates his anxiety about the potential negative consequences of this paternal legacy in terms of complicating his social and psychological transition to first-time fatherhood: ‘I tend to follow the workaholic-type pattern my father did’. This raises concerns for him around the difficulties of reconciling work and fatherhood: ‘it’s the relationship between having a baby and what I do with the rest of my life because there’s no baby-shaped space at the minute’.</p>
<p>Like Malcolm, tensions around involvement seem to be affectively freighted for Richard, in his case by negative childhood memories of his father as a ‘remote figure’: ‘my perception is that for days as a child I would go without seeing my father . . . he’d be in his study or he’d be out’. Richard also talks about being ‘very hurt’ by his father when he inexplicably stopped taking him on planned days out, although he says he had ‘no ability’ to communicate these feelings to his father. In contrast to this experience, Richard hopes to have a ‘more positive relationship’ with his child than he did with his father: ‘I want to be close, which I think is about doing things – as I say I’ve got this big thing about doing things with the child and being more demonstrative and really living towards it’.</p>
<p>Richard seeks to reconcile his competing investments in work and paternal involvement through appeals to discourses of ‘quality time’. He talks about time as being ‘the biggie for me’, both a source of anxiety, but also a potentially positive focus for becoming a father: ‘it’s about time one created a baby-shaped space because I realize we need one, well time, both for the baby and for my wife’. Later, in the interview, Richard describes how he and his wife Lindsay had been living separate lives as they pursued individual career goals. In preparing with his wife for the baby’s arrival he starts to see the benefits of this ‘common focus’ in bringing the couple ‘together again’.</p>

<title>Malcolm: tensions around the motherly father identification and the pull of old discourses</title>
<p>A striking contradiction in Malcolm’s initial account is the contrast between his desire to be a modern or motherly father and the traditional elements of his nostalgic fantasy of ideal family life: ‘the father cutting the lawn, the children playing, mother might be cooking dinner’. How to explain the slippage between the new subjectivity configured through Malcolm’s construction of the good father and the old discourses underpinning Malcolm’s fantasy of family life? What does the long view offered by a QL approach tell us about Malcolm’s competing identifications and paternal line of flight? Malcolm’s investment in the potentialities of fatherhood seems to be ambivalent about creating spaces for the expression of a new masculine subjectivity. While Malcolm is drawn to the space of motherly fathering, this imaginary identification appears to pose powerful threats to his sense of worth by raising the spectre of the father as powerless, marginal and redundant within the family sphere.</p>
<p>Repeatedly during his interviews, Malcolm portrays his partner as a powerful and somewhat unpredictable woman. In the first interview Malcolm presents her as ‘the boss’, ‘she wears the trousers’, and also conveys his anxiety that she has no deep need for Malcolm and may discard him ‘now that [she’s] got what [she] wants’ (i.e. Malcolm’s child). In the second and third interviews, Malcolm constructs his partner as a powerful maternal gatekeeper (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468794111426224">Doucet, 2006</xref>) who controls his levels of involvement and is ‘jealous’ when he spends time with his daughter. This perceived situation is exacerbated by Malcolm’s working pattern of long hours and distance living arrangements and contributes to a sense of lack in terms of his competency and relevancy within family life:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Sometimes I would like more involvement . . . a little bit more to know what my daughter’s needs are and to sort of satisfy her do you know what I mean . . . She [Malcolm’s partner] doesn’t need a man, she doesn’t need a man . . . I don’t think she would miss me for the childcare, I don’t know, that’s the feeling I get.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In trying to unpack Malcolm’s desires and anxieties around the motherly father identification, close consideration is needed of the powerful fault line running through Malcolm’s accounts of his public and private senses of self. This can be straightforwardly expressed as a divide between a work-based (albeit vexed) ‘macho man’ identity based on the (limited) exercise of power and control, and a private paternal identity based on maternal sensibilities of intimacy, care and involvement. The fault line between Malcolm’s public and private senses of self gives insight into ‘double-faced’ (individual and cultural) and ‘two-way process’ of intergenerational transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468794111426224">Bertaux and Thompson, 1993</xref>). It illuminates both the shaping force of intergenerational transmissions of classed masculinity in terms of Malcolm’s inheritance of a ‘macho’ occupational identity (Malcolm’s father explicitly wanted him to get a ‘man’s job’), and Malcolm’s personal struggles to rework his private masculinity through his fathering: ‘if blokes are being macho while they have a child he is trying to prove his masculinity, I think in my mind they can prove it by being a bloody good father and true with their emotions’.</p>
<p>Tensions at the fault line of Malcolm’s public ‘macho’ and private ‘maternal’ identities might go some way toward explaining Malcolm’s sense of vulnerability and powerlessness as he makes the transition to fatherhood. One possible reading of Malcolm’s account of his feared redundancy and marginalization in family life is that they represent the uneasy and defensive ‘underside’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468794111426224">Craib, 2003</xref>) of Malcolm’s transformative account of taking flight from his father’s outworn paternal model by becoming a modern dad. From this perspective, gendered and generational relationships might present opportunities for Malcolm to develop new and better personal relationships (particularly with his children) but also threaten to strip away forms of power and control, which as a working-class man were always somewhat limited and, therefore, perhaps all the more closely guarded. In Malcolm’s accounts, letting go of traditional forms of masculine authority and power in the household seems to introduce new threats in the form of powerful and unpredictable maternal figures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468794111426224">Featherstone, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Viewed from this perspective, it might be argued that the fantasy of ideal family life constructed by Malcolm in the first interview resolves the tensions between competing motherly and macho identifications by ‘returning’ him to a nuclear family existence in which both affectionate father and clear masculine roles combine to create a coherent, unified, secure paternal identity. Here we can see the continuing power of the utopian imagery of 1950s family life (the cultural ideal of the breadwinner father, homemaker mother and dependent children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468794111426224">Coontz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468794111426224">Segal, 1990</xref>]) and the way this mythical construction of nuclear family acts as an energizing force which, in a dynamic nexus with other social and psychological forces, gives meaning, momentum and currency to more traditional father identifications.</p>
<p>In the third interview, Malcolm is still dreaming about an idyllic family life: ‘a farmhouse with a couple of acres around it . . . with panelled borders’. By the fourth interview, significant life experiences (he has married his partner, and had a second biological child) and an upwardly mobile career trajectory bring about some degree of convergence between fantasy and lived reality. Talking about his promotion into Prison Service management he states: ‘it’s given me a nice little life financially’. Here it is possible to link Malcolm’s fantasy of ideal family with his struggles to become upwardly socially mobile. Upward mobility perhaps offers Malcolm a means of escape from what he sees as outworn macho models of masculinity while offering him the chance to construct a stable, proven and unthreatening form of masculinity through the paternal roles of successful provider and protector. This intertwined identification arguably underpins Malcolm’s imagination of his family as nestled in a ‘big ball of cotton wool’ which, in the context of his discussion of the destructive masculinities he encounters daily in his work, articulates his commitment to protect his family from the dangers posed by external societal transmissions: ‘the job has made me very cynical, very protective of my own’. Malcolm also talks about being ‘fearful’ of replicating his father’s behaviours – possibly making a ‘cotton wool’ existence a focus for protecting against ‘inner’ transmissions of his father’s authoritarian masculinity. It is certainly of great importance to Malcolm that he is recognized by his children as a positive and welcome presence in their lives: ‘they want their dad around and I think that’s good’. It is perhaps the sense of escaping his paternal inheritance that informs Malcolm’s self-positioning in the fourth interview as a ‘survivor’: ‘you haven’t got to be what you’ve been moulded to be . . . you haven’t got to accept where you came in life’.</p>
<p>Malcolm’s successful upward mobility seems to crystallize his sense of competence and confidence as a father: ‘I’m very proud of them [his children], I think they’ll all be ok, I think they’ll be okay in life’. However, it also coincides with a dampening down of his earlier preoccupation with being a ‘modern’ father who is fully involved in family life: ‘I don’t probably show enough interest in the family management side of things’. In interview 3, Malcolm’s commitment to securing and improving his family’s economic status takes precedence over his desire for involvement: ‘I would like to be there every night and would like to muck in everyday’, ‘but it’s more important to hang on to what we have got than anything else’. Tensions arising out of Malcolm’s desires to develop a fathering identity by investing in both care and economic resources are interwoven with his commitment to upward mobility. Eight years later, this is to some extent resolved by settling on the familiar territory of the affectionate father who justifies involvement through discourses of quality time. While Malcolm talks about how he can spend several working days without having ‘a proper conversation’ with his children he also emphasizes dedicating time for the family to do ‘good quality stuff’: ‘we started doing camping . . . we’ve got a National Trust membership so we’ll go and look at the castles, wherever we are there’s plenty to see, educational for the kids and good days out’.</p>

<title>Richard: unexpected involvement creating a new line of flight?</title>
<p>A notable difference between Malcolm and Richard’s accounts can be seen in the contrasting playing out of expectations, identifications and lived experiences over the transition into and through the early months of fatherhood. While Malcolm talked in the pre-birth interview about seeing himself as a ‘mother figure’ to his child, Richard had hoped to be an affectionate father (by being emotionally demonstrative and spending ‘quality time’ with his child). However, Richard was unexpectedly placed in the position of primary carer in the early stages of his daughter’s infancy (as a result of his wife’s traumatic birth and serious post-partum health complications) and talks about developing a strong ‘maternal bond’ with his daughter as a result of this unanticipated experience. While Malcolm’s desires for a new paternal identity are dampened down by the multiple barriers to involvement he experiences upon becoming a father, Richard’s desires to take on a highly involved, child-focused caring identity are ignited by the pleasure he derives from being a primary carer to his infant daughter. His reflections on the father-child bond as ‘joyous’ and ‘something very special’ point to the positive and potentially transformative side of an otherwise fraught early parenting experience.</p>
<p>A fundamental transformation of Richard’s paternal horizons seems to flow out of this novel and affectively charged early parenting experience. Richard no longer talks about creating a ‘baby-shaped space’ within his life, but now sees ‘the whole’ as ‘baby-shaped . . . Beca has become the complete focus of everything we do’. Here, Richard’s emotional tone is dramatically different from his prior talk of approaching his wife’s pregnancy and labour as a ‘set of tasks’ that need to be ‘timetabled’: ‘I’m not so strong on the feeling side’. The reconstruction of Richard’s paternal outlook and identity in response to his early high levels of involvement during his daughter’s first month of life is extended into the reimagining of his possible future home/work-life trajectory:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>It has caused a fundamental change in where I see myself going . . . the whole idea about staying at home I’d have been horrified about 10 months ago, but now I think that may have become a real possibility at some point.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Equally noteworthy, though, is the way the novelty of Richard’s early parenting experience – and the transformed future pathways opened up by this experience – do not prompt a severing of links with the past as might be anticipated in light of Richard’s earlier dis-identification with his father’s ‘remote’ ‘workaholic’ pattern of parenting. Instead, Richard’s post-birth experiences seem to prompt quite different memories of his father, which create a positive coming together of ‘then’ and ‘now’ by evoking resonances, echoes and continuities in the men’s fathering. Far from being the distant man who ‘didn’t do children’, Richard now describes his father as an enthusiastic grandfather who ‘likes young children’. In the third interview, Richard still distances himself from his father’s remote pattern – ‘I’m consciously trying to be around more than my father’ – but also constructs his father as by no means a new convert to pleasures of involvement: ‘he’s always liked playing and interacting with young children’.</p>
<p>While Malcolm had no opportunity to reconnect with his father through intergenerational family relationships (his father died before Malcolm became a parent), Richard’s account forges a unifying ‘family chain’ between father and son through emphasizing their shared ‘socioeconomic position’ and financial means of creating the ‘type of environment’ and ‘range of experiences’ capable of promoting children’s ‘development’. Only a few months after his daughter’s birth, Richard is preoccupied with moving from his city location to a large house in the country. Richard and his wife buy a rural home which he sees as a safe environment in which to promote his daughter’s independence: ‘there’s a field next door with sheep in it, a field at the back which has horses in it, so she can still have some distance and freedom from us at a relatively young age’.</p>
<p>The environment Richard wants for his daughter – ‘village life, village school and stuff’ – is similar to his own childhood experience, so intergenerational continuity is evoked in Richard’s fathering/parenting culture: ‘I was allowed to wander round the village, I knew the local farmers, I’d go to our friends’ houses and things’. Another symmetry between Richard and his father is the way both are publically recognized as responsible, esteemed and loving father figures: Richard’s father through his ministry ‘doing the whole baptism bit’ and Richard through public comments that he is a ‘wonderful father’ (expressed by his father-in-law).</p>
<p>Here we can perhaps grasp a key difference in terms of Richard and Malcolm’s responses to their paternal inheritance. In a representational context where working-class macho masculinity is seen as culturally burdensome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468794111426224">Haylett, 2001</xref>), Malcolm must sever ties with his father’s fathering in order to construct himself as a modern paternal subject. In contrast, while Richard sees himself as belonging to a new generation of fathers (especially in terms of his emphasis on father care as important and distinctive from providing), he is also able to draw upon his paternal inheritance as a resource which enables him to construct a fathering identity with strong symbolic ties with a culturally prized and stable middle-class masculinity.</p>
<p>Rather than creating a sense of disjuncture between past and present selves, for Richard, a focus on hands-on care provides an opportunity to increase his considerable cultural and symbolic capital through extending his fields of action to include the development of new caring competencies. Richard’s expression of confidence in his ability to parent in a ‘hands-on way’ is suggestive of the personal resources he feels he can bring to fathering from his wider experience:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Lindsay and I are quite comfortable with change actually, we’re quite natural and quite good at responding to whatever the immediate situation is . . . So in practical terms [parenting Beca is] . . . just another set of things we’ve changed to adapt to.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Interestingly, in light of an analysis of the mobilization of discursive resources of class and masculinity, Richard actually talks about a lack of salience of gender in shaping his experience and identity: ‘man or male . . . it’s probably never been a particularly defining feature of how I perceive myself . . . there’s a sense in which Lindsay and I don’t operate out of gendered roles’.</p>
<p>Yet, analyses of the differential visibility and marking of middle- and working-class masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468794111426224">Haylett, 2001</xref>) suggest that intergenerational transmissions around a valued and persuasive middle-class masculine identity could remain constitutive of, and central to, Richard’s personal and paternal identity. This may go some way to explaining his original ‘horror’ at the thought of being a main carer to his child, and the tension he experiences in the second and third interview between a ‘push’ towards highly involved fatherhood and the ‘pull’ of established priorities around work-based opportunities and achievements: ‘the reality . . . is I suspect I will drift back into doing the amount of work I was doing before Beca was born’, ‘I’m too driven by the work I do’. Despite experiencing his unexpected period as a hands-on primary carer to his daughter as positively disruptive and personally transforming, reversion to the affectionate father who spends quality if not quantity time with his child seems somewhat inevitable, with Richard even contemplating carrying on the family tradition of sending his child to boarding school: ‘I may well be keener on repeating my parents’ behaviour than I necessarily would’ve admitted before we had Beca’.</p>
<p>While Richard’s experience of hands-on parenting ignites his interest in being a new father (an interest which coincides with his identification with ‘modern’ and ‘liberal’ perspectives and practices), this particular line of flight brings risk as well as opportunities. For example, this particular paternal trajectory seems to unsettle and undermine Richard’s investments in an inherited hegemonic masculinity, based on active and visible involvement in both public life and the rational world of workplace organization and principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468794111426224">Morgan, 2005</xref>). In Richard’s account of his upbringing, home is a place of messy emotions. In the first interview he talks about his parents not coping well with his mother’s clinical depression and the negative impact this had on his relationship with his mother, father and siblings. A coincidence between ingrained personal and cultural associations linking home to a loss/lack of prized masculine characteristics (autonomy, control, rationality) possibly pushes Richard away from the new ‘stay-at-home’ paternal trajectory, despite the pleasures and rewards he experiences in being a ‘hands-on’ dad. This is not to say that Richard is unchanged by his experience of early involvement, but rather that the radically new course opened up by this novel experience cannot be easily integrated into his established senses of self. Adjustment in the form of creating a ‘new space’ in his life for his daughter and living ‘more for the moment’ while maintaining an interest in his career offers one possible solution to the problem of uniting old with new, although not without its own costs: ‘I probably feel some pressure to be with Beca . . . although it’s probably an internal pressure to do that really . . . it’s something I want to do’.</p>

<title>Comparing the cases and conclusion</title>
<p>The two in-depth case study analyses showcase the power of psychosocial/QL analyses in illuminating the transition to fatherhood as an intense period (and process) of social and psychological change. The analyses draw attention to some striking commonalities in the father’s lines of flight. In both cases – albeit at different points in their journeys as fathers – the men are attracted to the new potentialities created by taking up positions within discourses of the new or modern father. Moreover, in both cases, the men’s enthusiasm about the new father model is undercut by their conflicting investments in dominant discourses of masculinity. The long view offered by QL approaches sees both men retreating from some of the more radical potentialities of the space of new fatherhood and back onto the more familiar territory of the affectionate father and its more secure or proven masculine footings (e.g. the father as provider and protector, visibly and actively involved in public life).</p>
<p>At the same time, taking a closer look at the social, relational and psychological mediating dynamics shaping the fathers’ lines of flight showed the more variegated aspects of the men’s positions and transition to first-time fatherhood. In Malcolm’s case, his vexed rejection of macho masculinity, the pressures and frustrations of his working life and relational tensions around perceived maternal gatekeeping create a dynamic nexus of energized forces initially igniting and then dampening down his investment in motherly fathering. In Richard’s case, vexed replication of his father’s ‘workaholic patterns’ seems to foreclose the possibility of becoming a highly involved father, although early high levels of practical involvement, positive recognition for his care giving and the absence of financial constraints unexpectedly draw Richard into the space of new fatherhood. A longer-term perspective, however, sees Richard being gradually drawn back toward a public masculine identity incompatible with high levels of day-to-day involvement.</p>
<p>Changing family working patterns and fathers’ increasing share of caregiving work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468794111426224">Doucet, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468794111426224">Featherstone, 2009</xref>) does not mean that settling upon an affectionate father identity simply involves retracing well-trodden pathways into and beyond first-time fatherhood. Commitment to such an identity can represent (as in Malcolm’s case) a dramatic flight away from childhood family microclimate (such as a father’s distant, authoritarian patterns) and way of transforming the emotional work of fathering (away from ‘jaundiced’ parenting ideals). In Richard’s case, commitment to both emotional involvement and shared caregiving makes active fathering less elective than it was for previous generations who ‘simply worked . . . there wasn’t any other time within their lives’, necessitating a subjective change among fathers (like himself) who now feel strong ‘internal pressure’ to create defined ‘child time’ in their busy lives. In both cases, the men can be seen to remain committed to ideals of ‘private masculinity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468794111426224">Whitehead, 2002</xref>) and place a strong emphasis on both family intimacy and desire for positive recognition from partners and children.</p>
<p>Situating the men’s accounts in a wider socio-historical context helps to make further sense of the complex combinations of ‘old’ and ‘new’ subjectivities emerging in and through time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468794111426224">Lupton and Barclay (1997</xref>: 145) identify discourses of emotional involvement – emphasizing ‘the ability to express affection for one’s children openly’ – as a significant part of masculine demeanour in the late 20th century. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794111426224">Aitken (2009)</xref> argues that models of the sentimental, affectionate and child-centred family which now dominate western cultures have a long history going back to the writings of thinkers such as Rousseau. He suggests that, historically, this ideal was tied to the notion of making the family attractive to men and was premised on the promise to fathers of ‘paternal certitude, power, prestige and pleasure’ (2009: 39). In our analysis, the convergence and collision between active and emotional involvement and dominant discourses of masculinity are shown to be live and ongoing issues for the two fathers. Yet it is also important to acknowledge the reflexive positions they adopted on gender and masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468794111426224">Whitehead, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468794111426224">Williams, 2008</xref>), whether fleetingly or in a more consistent fashion. Both fathers make numerous efforts to challenge and distance themselves from older assumptions about gender roles, identities and relationships, even though their attempts to disentangle from them are shown to be fraught, partial and incoherent.</p>
<p>The lines of flight foregrounded by our QL/psychosocial analysis therefore give some grounds for optimism concerning the positive ways men are responding to the challenges posed by changing socio-economic, gendered and generational relations, as well as emphasizing the continuing and contextually specific (social, cultural and psychological) barriers to paternal involvement. Methodologies which grant closer attention to spatial, temporal and relational qualities of paternal subjectivity and practice make it possible to appreciate the complex dynamics underpinning both opportunities and barriers to involvement and their potential implications for both policy and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468794111426224">Henwood et al., 2011</xref>). The MAF study takes a relational perspective to parenting which considers how experiences of one parent hold implications for the other. This article has relied on men’s accounts of negotiating masculinity and fatherhood as they enter into and experience parenthood, and we are conscious that the men’s partners may have presented a different picture of their shared situations. However, the article provides insights into the nuances of men’s lived experiences and sense making which may be of value to those trying to engage men and women around complex issues linked to contemporary couple, parenting and gender relationships (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468794111426224">Featherstone, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Our analysis has attempted to highlight the power of psychosocial QL analyses of new subjectivities in moving us beyond static, stereotypical and essentialist representations of fathers while acknowledging the powerful influences of history, culture and biography in shaping lines of flight. Addressing the significance of class along with other aspects of men’s multiple positions, and taking a long view of the transition to first-time fatherhood, has underlined the importance of research on particular identities, contexts and lived experiences as a means of specifying how broad sociocultural transformations thread through the dynamics of individual lives.</p>

<p>Malcolm doesn’t unpack his father’s ‘Victorian’ identity in great detail in the first interview, although he talks about wanting to be ‘more modern and approachable’ than his father and carefully distances himself from his father’s attitudes towards gender. Malcolm talks about his father wanting him to get a ‘man’s job’ and is explicit about not wanting to transmit such views to his own children: ‘I want to stay clear of that when I’m a father because if my child is a boy, and turns out to be gay, as long as it’s happy, it doesn’t matter. That’s not an issue, any issue about what is a man’s role, and what’s not’. His critical portrait of his father is further elucidated in the subsequent interviews. In the third interview he describes his father as a ‘bit of a dictator’, ‘when my father was at home it was horrible’. In the fourth interview, he describes his father as a ‘macho man’ and criticizes his father for bequeathing him a ‘jaundiced view of what a man was’.</p></fn>
