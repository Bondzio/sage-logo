<p>Every five years or so parliamentary candidates in Egypt—that is, those running for the People’s Assembly and the Shura Council—would spend millions on electoral campaigns. Why run for parliamentary office when, in an autocratic state like Hosni Mubarak’s Egypt, parliament had no real influence over policy? Why would citizens vote in such circumstances? Could this be a case of everyone feigning belief that the “emperor is clothed”? Lisa Blaydes, in her book <italic>Elections and Distributive Politics in Mubarak’s Egypt</italic>, shows that this is no tale out of Hans Christian Andersen. To be sure, there was a strategic logic for all actors—even a cynical citizenry—to engage in what, to the casual observer, might appeared to have been sham elections.</p>
<p>Blaydes situates her study of Egyptian “competitive electoral authoritarianism” in a theoretical framework based significantly on the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414011423520">Barbara Geddes (2005</xref>, 2008) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414011423520">Ellen Lust-Oskar (2005)</xref>, which concern the issue of elections in authoritarian settings and, moreover, with that of popular support for authoritarian regimes. Geddes as well as Lust-Oskar find that elections in authoritarian states can serve to stabilize a regime, in what are otherwise often merciless political environments. But why do they stabilize such regimes? Blaydes painstakingly and thoroughly unpacks the mechanisms at work in the institutional labyrinth that was Mubarak’s Egypt.</p>
<p>Though all regimes in the Arab world are authoritarian, each exhibits a unique set of institutional arrangements; and certainly, some are more authoritarian than others. Mubarak’s Egypt was among the more open of such regimes in that it allowed a relatively free press, held multiparty highly competitive elections, and was open to foreign investment, cultural exchange with the United States and Europe, and, perhaps most significant of all, American economic and military largesse.</p>
<p>But why would an authoritarian regime assume the risks of holding competitive elections? Why participate—either as a candidate or as a voter—in an election in an authoritarian setting? One assumption in the literature on elections and institutions is that parties contest elections, even in authoritarian environments, to influence policy. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414011423520">Gandhi and Przeworski (2006)</xref> argue that authoritarian regimes attempt to “co-opt” any opposition through “extensive policy compromises.” Blaydes, however, bluntly dispels this notion, based on an <italic>a priori</italic> understanding of what legislatures do—or, rather, do not do—in the Arab Middle East. And what they do not do, unparadoxically, is legislate (p. 15). Indeed, Blaydes convincingly shows that the purpose of participating in elections in Mubarak’s Egypt was not necessarily to influence policy; instead, it was to increase one’s “access to spoils”—among the most important being “state resources,” including first dibs on development contracts and public land sales, and an invaluable “parliamentary immunity,” which provided legal cover for otherwise illegal profiteering.</p>
<p>On assuming office in 1981, following the assassination of Anwar Sadat, who himself had introduced multiparty competitive elections in 1976, Hosni Mubarak and his cadres sought to ensure a supermajority for their National Democratic Party (NDP) in parliament and manipulated electoral rules accordingly. It determined which groups could form licensed parties (p. 40) and thus “compete” in the electoral process. With an NDP supermajority, the parliament would serve as a “rubber stamp” for initiatives devised by the regime, all the while maintaining a veneer of representative legitimacy; among the reasons for the latter was to assuage the sensibilities of Western aid donors. But in the “political space” that remained, competition for parliamentary seats was robust. And the regime, to ensure compliance on the part of the elite, doled out the spoils, such that corruption became <italic>endemic</italic>.</p>
<p>Of course, because corruption is <italic>officially</italic> illegal in Egypt, the regime could blackmail, with <italic>charges</italic> of corruption, parliamentarians that failed to fulfill the “terms of the contract,” namely giving regime officials their “cut” of the loot (p. 140). In this way too some measure of control was maintained by the regime.</p>
<p>This raises an interesting question: Why would anyone cast a vote under such circumstances? Here too there is no expectation of influencing policy. On one hand, a veritable “marketplace” of vote buying and vote selling exists in that an “exchange”—for real goods, to be sure—occurs either on election day or in the period immediately prior to it. Votes are sold for cash, for food, for trips to Mecca, for vacations, and for the payment of school fees, among a host of other perks. On the other hand, and particularly in rural areas, “longer-term clientelistic or familial relationships” determine who gets whose vote—and reciprocity is expected here as well, in the form of patronage goods (p. 107).</p>
<p>All of this added up to a remarkable degree of regime stability and longevity. But such a system inevitably creates the seeds of its own destruction. In the aftermath of structural adjustment and neoliberal reforms of the late 1980s and 1990s, which included the privatization of state assets, foreign trade liberalization, and the removal of consumer subsidies, and which crucially gave business elites-cum-parliamentarians the opportunity to amass even greater wealth at the expense of those on the lower rungs of the politico-economic totem pole, one could observe in Egypt a worsening epidemic of corruption, and more and more egregious instances of it. Blaydes quotes a columnist from <italic>Al-Ahram Weekly</italic> who wrote that parliamentarians have, in short, “milked the country dry” (p. 147). This, combined with an increasing income inequality over the decades, would culminate in what Blaydes identified as a hitherto “self-reinforcing” but progressively unstable “electoral authoritarian equilibrium” that by early 2011—while her book was making its way through the printing presses—had moved beyond the point at which it could be sustained. Waiting in the wings, as we would see, was the Egyptian military.</p>
<p>Regime–military relations were complex in Mubarak’s Egypt, particularly as the regime was itself a product of the 1952 “Free Officers” military coup. In its classic midcentury posture, the military-based regime led by Gamel Abdel Nasser sought to remake Egypt along the lines of a secular-inspired “Arab socialism” that was heralded as an antidote to Arab political and economic ills. In seeking to pry a civilian regime from the military in the early 1960s, Nasser formed the Arab Socialist Union. And yet, as a highly bureaucratized and centralized institution, the military not only maintained a far-reaching presence in Egyptian political, economic, and social life, but also, importantly, as Blaydes indicates, was the “final guarantor” of the Mubarak regime (p. 18). This logic was borne out in January and February 2011 as protests raged, led by students and labor union activists, in coordination with Islamists, as Blaydes would have expected (p. 172). And it was the military, in consort with the Obama administration (in keeping with the stated “democracy” promotion of the previous Bush administration; p. 205), that prevailed over Hosni Mubarak, forcing his resignation as president of Egypt.</p>
<p>Because of its established bureaucratic channels, the military, in its official four-person guise as the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, seamlessly stepped in to act as a “transition government,” which proceeded to unceremoniously ban the NDP in April 2011. But the question necessarily arises, transition to what? Is liberal-style democracy likely, as many have speculated?</p>
<p>Among the most interesting portions of the book is the discussion of the probable pitfalls of “democratic transition” in Egypt. Blaydes is indeed circumspect about the potential for what Westerners would call liberal democracy emerging in Egypt. As Blaydes writes, reflecting upon her own conversations in Egypt with liberal intellectuals, artists, and feminist activists, “Egyptian intellectuals find democratic transition less appealing because the results of a free election hold the possibility of bringing to power Islamist parties,” in large measure because the preferences of the “median voter” are likely in line with those of the Islamists. This, of course, would spell bad news as far as the “distribution of rights” is concerned, not only for the intellectual and artistic set but also for minority religious groups—notably the Coptic Christian community that composes roughly ten percent of the population—and secular-oriented women (p. 172; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414011423520">Mayer, 2007</xref>). How does the Islamist element fit into the narrative, especially in a country where Islam has formed, for well over a millennium, much of the cultural subtext?</p>
<p>Since its inception in 1928, in the context of a Western intellectual and institutional encroachment into Egypt that it viewed as corrosive, the opposition Muslim Brotherhood has sought an order based on Islamic principles. Through the decades the Brotherhood has varied its approach, from one of violence to that of nonviolence to that of electoral contestation, toward whatever Egyptian government happened to be in power. And though the Brotherhood often faced considerable regime-imposed barriers at election time, “democracy promotion . . . has become a critical part of the Brotherhood’s political strategy” (p. 151). Participation in a legitimate electoral process is entirely logical for the Brotherhood, especially in the context of “the growing Islamization of Egyptian society” (p. 154). Indeed, the Brotherhood has been able to cultivate support among vast swaths of the Egyptian populace, which since the 1970s has increasingly turned away from what it perceives as a substance-less Nasserite Arab socialism. But furthermore, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414011423520">Sheri Berman (2003)</xref> notes, since at least the 1980s, Egypt has been the scene of an increasing institutional Islamization, where in particular the courts have been appropriated for an Islamic agenda. Given the structural, social, and cultural factors at play, we will likely see a new form of authoritarianism emerge, though with perhaps an even deeper Islamic institutional layer.</p>
<p>In <italic>Elections and Distributive Politics in Mubarak’s Egypt</italic>, Lisa Blaydes employs a pluralistic methodological framework, utilizing an array of statistical tools, some simple game theoretic models, and commentary from interviews with individuals up and down the chain of Egypt’s political and economic institutions to explain both how and why competitive elections work in an authoritarian setting, but also noteworthy is the author’s keen sense of the nooks and crannies of Egyptian political and cultural life, making for a highly readable volume.</p>
<p>In short, this book offers up an excellent contribution to the broader literature on authoritarianism as well as to Middle Eastern areas studies.</p>
