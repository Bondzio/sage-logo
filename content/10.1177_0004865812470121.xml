<abstract>
<p>Braithwaite’s (1989) Reintegrative Shaming Theory has gained worldwide popularity in criminology. The main focus of the theory is on <italic>shaming</italic> as a tool for reducing repeat offending. However, recent criticisms levelled at the theory have questioned the effectiveness and reliability of shaming for reducing re-offending, particularly in Western jurisdictions. Some scholars have suggested that the reintegrative notion of <italic>forgiveness</italic> may prove a more effective strategy for reducing repeat offending. In response to these suggestions, this study will examine whether forgiveness might offer an effective approach for reducing recidivism among tax offenders. Using survey data collected from tax offenders who had been caught and punished by the Australian Tax Office, it will be shown that stigmatizing shaming had no direct impact on their subsequent compliance-related behaviours. Instead, stigmatizing shaming served to displace taxpayers’ sense of responsibility for their wrong-doing. Forgiveness, in contrast, was found to play an important independent role in reducing taxpayers’ repeat offending, and for increasing their cooperation with the tax authority. These results have important implications for both the theory of reintegrative shaming and for public policy, particularly in relation to identifying strategies that effectively and reliably reduce repeat offending.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0004865812470121" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past few decades much scholarship has been generated to try to identify enforcement strategies that can be used to reduce repeat offending among those who have broken the law. On the one hand there are those who advocate a deterrence-based approach to dealing with offenders, and some who also advocate that offenders should be named and shamed for their actions. On the other hand there are those who advocate an approach that seeks to reintegrate offenders back into law-abiding society.</p>
<p>John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865812470121">Braithwaite (1989)</xref>, for example, argues that deterrence-based strategies can be <italic>stigmatizing</italic> in nature. Braithwaite argues that stigmatizing forms of disapproval and punishment of offenders can humiliate individuals, in which case they will be more likely to externalize blame for what has happened, will be more likely to feel alienated from mainstream values, and will be more likely to direct anger towards the entity expressing disapproval (i.e. the authority). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865812470121">Braithwaite and Braithwaite (2001)</xref> further argue that such feelings of hostility increase the probability of defiance and non-compliance exhibited by an offender in the future. Such assertions have been canvassed in Braithwaite’s <italic>Reintegrative Shaming Theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865812470121">Braithwaite, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865812470121">Braithwaite and Braithwaite, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The primary argument underlying Reintegrative Shaming Theory is that the communication of disapproval by those in authority – what Braithwaite calls <italic>shaming</italic> – is of central importance in understanding the effect that criminal justice actions have on the subsequent offending behaviour of individuals. Shaming is any form of disapproval which can elicit feelings of shame over wrong-doing. It is these shame-related emotions and feelings, Braithwaite argues, that will go on to shape law-abiding behaviour and, consequently, control crime. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865812470121">Braithwaite (1989)</xref> distinguishes between two forms of shaming that can be utilized by authorities: shaming that is <italic>reintegrative</italic> in nature and shaming that is <italic>stigmatizing</italic> in nature. Shaming that is reintegrative in nature is carried out in a respectful and healing manner. Here, disapproval of an act is communicated with respect, and special effort is made to avert labelling the offender as a bad person. Reintegration of an offender back into a law-abiding community is best achieved not only by the offender facing up to their wrong-doing, but if shaming is subsequently followed by ‘gestures of reacceptance into the community by law-abiding citizens’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865812470121">Braithwaite, 1989</xref>: 55). The theory suggests that reintegrative forms of shaming will result in less re-offending. Conversely, shaming that is stigmatizing in nature involves communicating disapproval of a person with disrespect, where offenders are labelled with out-casting identities (e.g. thief, tax cheat, rapist), and where there are no rituals to terminate disapproval. Reintegrative Shaming Theory predicts that this latter type of shaming results in greater levels of re-offending.</p>
<p>A revision of Reintegrative Shaming Theory was undertaken by Braithwaite and Braithwaite in 2001 to further elaborate on the role that shame-related emotions play in mediating the relationship between shaming and subsequent behaviour. John and Valerie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865812470121">Braithwaite (2001)</xref> suggested that individuals respond to, or <italic>manage</italic>, shame differently, and that the way in which shame emotions are managed by offenders has important implications for future behaviour. One way of managing shame is through <italic>acknowledgement</italic> of the emotion, and this response is associated with empathy for victims, more remorse and regret over wrong-doing, and less externalization of blame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865812470121">Ahmed et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, it has been posited that reintegrative shaming results in lower offending, at least in part, because it is more likely to promote acknowledgement of shame emotions by offenders.</p>
<p>It is also argued that stigmatic shaming is less likely to elicit acknowledgement of shame, or a sense of remorse in an offender because it serves to humiliate an individual. Here, individuals are more likely to bypass shame whereby they externalize blame for what has happened and are more likely to direct anger towards the entity expressing disapproval; an emotional state which has been referred to as unacknowledged shame or <italic>shame displacement</italic>. Shame displacement indicates denial of the act. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865812470121">Braithwaite and Braithwaite (2001)</xref> argue that such feelings of hostility increase the probability of defiance and non-compliance exhibited by the offender in the future.</p>
<p>Reintegrative Shaming Theory has been increasingly used in the literature to explain how social control efforts may result in both conformity and deviance. However, while the theory has had broad appeal and has been quite influential in the criminological literature, surprisingly, relatively few studies have set out to <italic>empirically</italic> test the validity of the theory. Of those studies that have, the contexts in which they have been undertaken include juvenile offending (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0004865812470121">Hay, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0004865812470121">Sherman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0004865812470121">Zhang and Zhang, 2004</xref>), blue-collar offending (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865812470121">Botchkovar and Tittle, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004865812470121">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0004865812470121">Tittle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004865812470121">Tyler et al., 2007</xref>) and white-collar offending (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004865812470121">Ahmed and V Braithwaite, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004865812470121">Benson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0004865812470121">Murphy and Harris, 2007</xref>). Across these different crime contexts findings have been contradictory. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865812470121">Botchkovar and Tittle (2005)</xref> have found that both reintegrative and stigmatizing forms of shaming can result in negative consequences. They found that stigmatizing shaming, as per the theory’s predictions, fostered future deviance, but reintegrative shaming was also ‘positively predictive of projected crime/deviance’ (2005: 401). The authors suggested that in some cases reintegrative shaming might break down inhibitory processes of deterrence (for similar findings see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004865812470121">Botchkovar and Tittle 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865812470121">Miethe et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004865812470121">Tyler et al. (2007)</xref> also aimed to test whether reintegrative shaming offered through restorative justice conferences could reduce re-offending for drunk drivers. Using data from the Canberra RISE study, in which drunk drivers were either processed through traditional court (control condition) or diverted to a restorative justice conference (experimental condition), Tyler et al. found no evidence to suggest that the experimental treatment condition directly reduced repeat offending. However, they did find that those who judged their experience to be more reintegrative in nature were more likely to have positive orientations towards the law two years later.</p>
<p>In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0004865812470121">Makkai and Braithwaite (1994)</xref> have found broad support for the theory. They measured the influence of shaming and stigmatizing variables in relation to nursing home managers’ compliance with governmental rules and regulations regarding aged care. Makkai and Braithwaite observed the manner in which government inspectors dealt with nursing home managers when a breach in nursing home standards was detected. They found that reintegrative shaming achieved significantly higher compliance from the first to the second inspection compared with a stigmatizing approach. This result was contingent, however, on the prior relationship between the regulator and the nursing home manager; no such effect was found when there was no interdependent relationship between the two parties. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004865812470121">Rebellon, Piquero, Piquero and Tibbetts (2010)</xref> have also found evidence that anticipated feelings of shame over wrong-doing can mediate the effect of various attitudes towards offending on intention to commit an offence. In their study, university students were asked to imagine themselves in the same situation as a hypothetical offender, and were then asked about the anticipated shame they would feel if they committed the same offence. It was found that anticipation of shame predicted their intention to commit that offence. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0004865812470121">Murphy and Harris (2007)</xref> also found general support for the theory in a study of tax offenders. They found that feelings of reintegration or stigmatization experienced during an enforcement event were related to re-offending behaviour. Offenders who felt that their enforcement experience had been more stigmatizing in nature were more likely to re-offend, while those who felt the experience had been more reintegrative were less likely to re-offend (stigmatization and reintegration in their study was measured on a continuum). Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865812470121">Braithwaite and Braithwaite’s (2001)</xref> hypotheses, Murphy and Harris found that shame-related emotions also partially mediated the effect of stigmatization/reintegration on subsequent offending behaviour.</p>
<sec id="sec2-0004865812470121"><title>A critique of shaming and shame</title>
<p>Despite some empirical support for Reintegrative Shaming Theory, the conflicting findings across different studies have called shaming as the main variable of the theory into question. Further, the concept of shaming has been critiqued by some scholars, not only for its suitability in controlling crime but also for the psychological repercussions it might cause. Scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0004865812470121">Maxwell and Morris (2004: 133)</xref>, for example, have found shame to be a ‘troublesome concept’ and question a general theory of crime based on shaming and shame. They argue that shame includes a whole variety of emotions, many of which have negative connotations (e.g. ridicule, humiliation) and are understood differently by people depending on their experiences and personalities.</p>
<p>Shame as an emotion influencing people to comply with the law might also be a troublesome concept in that shame as a ‘master emotion’, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865812470121">Retzinger and Scheff (1996: 318)</xref>, is not particularly salient in many Western societies. In Western society the emphasis is on individualism rather than on cultural interdependence and communal participation. Retzinger and Scheff highlight the different meanings of shame in different cultural settings and point particularly to how people from Eastern societies (e.g. Japan) have a multitude of linguistic interpretations for the emotion of shame. Further, they suggest that shame for a person growing up in Yemen, Japan or Pakistan would have a very different meaning to a person growing up in a Western-based society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004865812470121">Morris and Trammell (2011)</xref>, for example, have shown that people from the Middle East produce not only different understandings of shame and shaming but that the definitions tend to be in conflict with Western definitions. The data collected from interviews in Yemen revealed not only conflicting linguistic shame interpretations when compared to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865812470121">Braithwaite’s (1989)</xref> model but also that shaming as a force to reduce future deviance varied from that of Western findings. This finding not only complements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865812470121">Retzinger and Scheff’s (1996)</xref> notion that shame might have different meanings and interpretations across people and cultures, but also that shame may be viewed in a narrow and negative way in the West.</p>
<p>Emotion researchers have also shown that people in the West associate emotions such as remorse and regret (emotions associated with shame acknowledgement) as negative emotions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865812470121">Kernis et al., 1993</xref>). In other words, it appears that shame-related emotions connote negative attributions in Western society while this is not necessarily so in Eastern societies. Given these arguments, it is perhaps not so surprising, therefore, that shaming and shame may produce inconsistent results on subsequent compliance behaviours across studies and between people from different countries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0004865812470121"><title>Considering forgiveness</title>
<p>Considering the differences between cultures in interpreting shame, as well as the various shame-emotions defined and experienced differently by individuals, one might not be surprised by the mixed results that have emerged in the reintegrative shaming literature. However, in acknowledging that shaming and shame are ‘troublesome’ concepts, Braithwaite never restricted his Reintegrative Shaming Theory to one variable of reintegration but encouraged scholars to take up the challenge and look for other elements that might be reintegrative in nature, and to analyse those elements for their theoretical appropriateness for reducing crime and re-offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865812470121">Ahmed et al., 2001</xref>: 21).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0004865812470121">Walgrave and Aertsen (1996)</xref>, for example, have argued that reintegration does not have to occur through shaming but can also be done through <italic>forgiveness</italic>. Forgiveness is commonly understood as a process in which negative affects, cognitions and behaviours are replaced by more positive feelings amongst both victim and offender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865812470121">Enright and Gassin, 1992</xref>). As a construct, forgiveness also has major cultural value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865812470121">Day et al., 2008</xref>), in that it features as a central idea in all of the world’s major religions. Reference to forgiveness has been found in the ancient writings of Judaist, Christian, Islamic, Hindu and Buddhist traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865812470121">Enright and Eastin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0004865812470121">Enright and Fitzgibbons, 2000</xref>). Forgiveness might therefore highlight socio-psychological emotions important in assessing reintegrative practices that might not easily be discovered through the shaming concept. Hence, a focus on forgiveness may eliminate the problems attached to the concept of shaming and shame emotions that have been prevalent in the literature while at the same time keeping the notion of reintegration intact.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004865812470121">Wallace, Exline and Baumeister (2008)</xref> noted that forgiveness yields both psychological and physical benefits for victims. For example, it has been shown that granting forgiveness to offenders can help <italic>victims</italic> recover from emotional pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004865812470121">McCullough et al., 1997</xref>) by reducing anger, grief, anxiety and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865812470121">Coyle and Enright, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004865812470121">Freedman and Enright, 1996</xref>). Forgiveness has also been shown to have a beneficial impact on victims’ physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0004865812470121">Witvliet et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0004865812470121">Worthington and Scherer, 2004</xref>). However, very little is known about how offenders behave in response to being forgiven for their indiscretions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004865812470121">Wallace et al. (2008: 454)</xref> point out, ‘research to date has offered little more than speculation about the answers to this important question’.</p>
<p>In our review of the forgiveness literature, we identified only a handful of studies that specifically examine the impact of forgiveness on subsequent transgressions. Many of these studies are limited, however, in their reliance on experimental methods utilizing hypothetical scenarios with undergraduate students (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865812470121">Kelln and Ellard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865812470121">Struthers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004865812470121">Wallace et al., 2008</xref>). These studies have tended to find that forgiveness shows promise as a potential method for increasing compliance, although compliance behaviour in these studies has tended to be measured as subsequent compliance with a laboratory assistant who had granted participants forgiveness versus no forgiveness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865812470121">Kelln and Ellard (1999)</xref>, for example, were interested in whether students granted forgiveness by an experimenter after having broken some computer equipment would later comply with the experimenter’s request to deliver envelopes; it was found that they did. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865812470121">Struthers et al. (2008)</xref> have also shown that study participants who were granted forgiveness after offending in an experimental study were also more likely to experience shame emotions, with shame mediating the effect of forgiveness on feelings of repentance. While these types of studies provide support for the idea that offenders may respond well to receiving forgiveness, the ecological validity of such studies can be called into question; in other words, they cannot tell us much about real-life offending behaviour. In perhaps the most relevant research to the present study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004865812470121">Ahmed and J Braithwaite (2005)</xref> found an interesting relationship between reintegrative shaming, forgiveness and real-life offending behaviour. Used as a variable in its own right, forgiveness provided to child bullies by their parents produced a 22.4 per cent reduction of repeat bullying behaviour, whereas reintegrative shaming produced only an 11.3 per cent reduction in repeat bullying. These particular results suggest that forgiveness may be more important for reducing repeat offending than reintegrative shaming.</p>
<p>As far as we are aware, no empirical studies have been published to date that examine the importance of forgiveness in preventing repeat offending in a real-life legal offending context. The present study therefore offers the first examination of how offenders respond to receiving forgiveness from both loved ones and from a legal authority that has previously punished them for breaking the law. Hence, in following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0004865812470121">Walgrave and Aertsen (1996)</xref>, and in taking up Braithwaite’s challenge, this paper will therefore examine forgiveness as a reintegrative variable to ascertain whether it will be useful in reducing recidivism among offenders who have broken the law. The question the present study seeks to address is whether forgiveness discourages or invites future transgressions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0004865812470121"><title>The present study</title>
<p>The present study uses a sample of tax offenders who had been caught and punished by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) for tax offences. Examining the role of forgiveness in the taxation context is particularly interesting because evasion of taxes produces no clear victim. It is society in general, not specific individuals, who are affected by taxes being evaded. Tax authorities across the globe generally adopt a deterrence-based approach when dealing with tax offenders, and the ATO is no exception. However, in the mid-2000s, the ATO had to re-evaluate using such an approach when their initial deterrence-based enforcement strategy backfired with over 30,000 tax offenders who had invested in aggressive tax planning schemes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004865812470121">Murphy, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Initially, taxpayers were sent letters advising them that they had purposefully set out to defraud the tax system and that they were required to pay outstanding taxes, penalties and interest within a two-week period (the average tax debt was reported to be approximately $53,000). However, more than 50 per cent of the offenders refused to pay back their tax debts, with many citing that they resented the implication they were ‘tax cheats’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004865812470121">Murphy, 2003</xref>: 391). As a result of the resistance and hostility the ATO encountered from the tax offender group, the ATO subsequently adopted a more reintegrative approach in which offenders’ personal circumstances were taken into account in the final determination of their case. The majority of tax offenders were re-contacted two years after the initial enforcement approach was instigated and were encouraged to settle their taxation debts by taking advantage of a two-year interest-free payment plan. The bad advice many taxpayers had received from accountants and financial advisers was also acknowledged by the ATO in letters to taxpayers, and the penalty component of their tax debts was abolished.</p>
<p>The present study seeks to examine how tax offenders perceived the ATO’s enforcement process, and how this impacted on their subsequent future tax compliance behaviour. Perceptions of both stigmatization and forgiveness received from the Tax Office were measured. Forgiveness from those known personally to the offender (i.e. family and friends) was also measured because research suggests that forgiveness offered by those close to us has a greater impact on subsequent behaviour than forgiveness offered by legal authorities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0004865812470121">Makkai and Braithwaite, 1994</xref>). This is because legal authorities do not have the same moral standing as those with personal connections to an offender because they lack emotional bonds with the offender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0004865812470121">Murphy and Hampton, 1988</xref>). Hence, this study attempts to explore the value of forgiveness being offered by both close significant others and also by the State in promoting future compliance behaviour. As noted earlier, the main question this study seeks to address is whether forgiveness discourages or invites future transgressions.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0004865812470121"><title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>A total of 1250 tax offenders drawn from the ATO’s case files were sent a survey package inviting them to participate in a research project about taxation. Participants were informed that the researchers were interested in their experiences of the ATO’s enforcement processes. Those who were interested in participating in the project were asked to send their completed survey back to researchers in a reply-paid envelope. A total of 478 taxpayers returned a completed survey. During the survey administration period, non-responders were contacted up to four times by mail, with a letter reminding them to participate in the project. This follow-up process was modelled on the Dillman Total Design Method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004865812470121">Dillman, 1978</xref>) to improve response rates. After taking into account recipients who were unable to complete the survey due to death, illness or where the address listed was incorrect (N = 189), an adjusted response rate of 52 per cent was obtained. Respondents were between 29 to 81 years of age (M = 55.78, SD = 8.54), 84 per cent were male,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0004865812470121">1</xref></sup> 75 per cent indicated that they were born in Australia,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0004865812470121">2</xref></sup> 83 per cent were married, and the average family income was reported to be AUS$87,830 (SD = $47,748; approximately US$83,647 or €65,846).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0004865812470121"><title>Questionnaire</title>
<p>The survey contained 295 questions measuring taxpayers’ attitudes toward paying tax, their views of the ATO, how they viewed the enforcement experience they had been through, and the impact it had on their lives. Also assessed were self-reported compliance-related behaviours. Only questions relevant to four categories of variables were used for the present study: (1) perceptions of stigmatizing shaming used by the ATO; (2) perceptions of forgiveness expressed by others (from those known to the offender and from the ATO); (3) emotional feelings of shame (shame acknowledgement and shame displacement); and (4) compliance (measured as self-reported tax non-compliance behaviour and self-reported level of cooperation with the ATO). Item non-response or missing data was low. Missing values on all items used to construct the scales was less than 5 per cent. To overcome the small amount of missing data contained in items in the present study, the expectation maximization (EM) method was utilized to replace the missing data.</p>
<p>The stigmatization and shame constructs were based on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865812470121">Ahmed et al. (2001)</xref>, the forgiveness measures were based on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004865812470121">Harris (2001)</xref>, and the compliance measures were developed by the first author. The Appendix presents the individual items used to construct each of these concepts.</p>
<sec id="sec8-0004865812470121"><title>Stigmatizing shaming</title>
<p>The 4-item stigmatization scale focused on whether negative judgements had been made by the ATO against the taxpayer during the original enforcement strategy. For example, perceptions of stigmatization were measured by asking whether people felt labelled by the ATO as a bad person or a criminal (e.g. ‘Do you feel as though you were treated as a criminal?’). Items were measured on a 1 (‘strongly disagree’) to 5 (‘strongly agree’) scale; higher scores indicate that the person felt more stigmatized by the ATO during the initial enforcement experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0004865812470121"><title>Forgiveness</title>
<p>Two scales were used to assess taxpayers’ perceptions of the forgiveness they had received from others over their wrong-doing. One 2-item scale assessed the level of perceived forgiveness tax offenders felt had been expressed by significant others such as family and friends (e.g. ‘Even though the matter is behind me, I still feel that others have not forgiven me for what I have done’). The other 2-item scale assessed perceived forgiveness given by the ATO (e.g. ‘Even though the matter is behind me, I still feel that the ATO will not forgive me for what I have done’). Scores were again measured on a 1 (‘strongly disagree’) to 5 (‘strongly agree’) scale, with higher scores indicating that the respondents did not feel forgiven. All forgiveness items were reverse coded for the purpose of later analysis; hence, higher scores on the recoded scales reflected greater perceptions of forgiveness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0004865812470121"><title>Shame emotions</title>
<p>The questions used to assess how tax offenders had <italic>managed</italic> subsequent emotional feelings of shame (shame acknowledgement and shame displacement) were informed by work undertaken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865812470121">Ahmed et al. (2001)</xref>. Three statements were used to assess shame acknowledgement (e.g. ‘I feel remorse’) and three to assess shame displacement (e.g. ‘I feel angry with the ATO’). Responses were measured on a scale from 1 (‘definitely do not feel this at all’) to 5 (‘definitely feel this a great deal’). Higher scores indicated greater levels of shame acknowledgement and shame displacement, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0004865812470121"><title>Compliance</title>
<p>Self-reported compliance behaviour was measured two ways: compliance with taxation obligations and cooperation with the ATO. The 6-item compliance scale focused on negative self-reported tax compliance behaviour. Participants were presented with six questions that asked them to reflect on their experience with the ATO’s enforcement procedures and how they believe the experience had affected their subsequent tax compliance behaviour (e.g. ‘I no longer declare all my income’). The items were measured on a 1 (‘strongly disagree’) to 5 (‘strongly agree’) scale, with higher scores indicating greater <italic>non</italic>-compliance. Taxpayer cooperation with the ATO was assessed via one item. Measured was taxpayers’ self-reported level of cooperation with the ATO at the time of completing the survey (‘How cooperative are you with the ATO today?’). The question was measured using a 1 (‘extremely uncooperative’) to 5 (‘extremely cooperative’) scale, with higher scores reflecting greater levels of cooperation.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0004865812470121"><title>Factor analysis</title>
<p>After assessing the factorability of individual scales, a principal axis factor analysis using Oblimin rotation was conducted to test for the assumed conceptual differentiation between the categories of variables used in this study. The analysis yielded a six-factor solution, explaining 67 per cent of the variance that confirmed the expected factor structure. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0004865812470121">Table 1</xref>, it was found that all items, apart from the cooperation measure, loaded clearly onto their respective factors. Factor 1 consisted of four items that measured the stigmatization people felt from the ATO’s enforcement approach. Factor 2 consisted of seven items: the six items that measured the self-reported compliance behaviour, and the 1-item cooperation measure. Factor 3 consisted of two items measuring perceived forgiveness from family/friends, Factor 4 consisted of three items measuring shame displacement, Factor 5 consisted of three items measuring shame acknowledgement, and Factor 6 consisted of two items measuring how people perceived forgiveness from the ATO. It should be noted that the cooperation measure loaded extremely weakly onto the compliance measure. It was therefore retained as a separate cooperation measure for further analysis.

<p>To examine the relationship between all scales of interest, a structural equation model was constructed using AMOS version 17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0004865812470121">Arbuckle and Wothke, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0004865812470121">Figure 1</xref> presents the diagrammatic representation of the best fitting model, with the fit indices indicating a reliable model (χ2 (8) = 8.40, <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.40; RMSEA = 0.01; CFI = 0.99; AGFI = 0.98). A small non-significant χ2 value indicates optimal fit, and values higher than 0.95 for the CFI and AGFI indicate the tested model provides an adequate fit to the data, as does a value lower than 0.05 for RMSEA. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0004865812470121">Figure 1</xref>, it can be seen that high levels of variance were explained in the ‘shame displacement’ (R2 = 0.33) and ‘shame acknowledgement’ (R2 = 0.23) constructs, and moderate to low levels of variance were explained in the ‘cooperation’ (R2 = 0.16) and ‘non-compliance’ (R2 = 0.07) constructs.
<fig id="fig1-0004865812470121" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Final model demonstrating the relationship between forgiveness (from both ATO and family/friends), stigmatizing shaming, feelings of shame and compliance-related behaviours (all values presented are standardized regression coefficients).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0004865812470121-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>In contrast to the bi-variate relationships, it can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0004865812470121">Figure 1</xref> that when all variables were considered together, the stigmatization construct only had one significant relationship. Those who felt they were stigmatized by the ATO during their original enforcement experience were much more likely to report displacing their shame. This result lends some support to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865812470121">Braithwaite’s (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865812470121">Ahmed et al.’s (2001)</xref> predictions that when people feel stigmatized they are more likely to displace their shame, feel anger, and are likely to blame others for their wrong-doing. Forgiveness appeared to predict more variables. For example, it can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0004865812470121">Figure 1</xref> that those who were more likely to perceive the ATO as forgiving them for their past transgressions were less likely to displace their shame, were more likely to indicate they were cooperative with the ATO, and were less likely to report re-offending. Forgiveness offered by family and friends also produced some interesting findings. Forgiveness from loved ones had a direct effect on subsequent tax compliance behaviour, with those who were more likely to feel forgiven by family and friends being less likely to re-offend. Interestingly, it can also be seen that forgiveness from loved ones predicted lower levels of shame acknowledgement. This particular finding therefore contradicts predictions in the literature that suggest that reintegrative forms of disapproval should increase feelings of shame and remorse over wrong-doing (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865812470121">Ahmed et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Feelings of shame acknowledgment were also found to predict re-offending in the model. As expected, those who had greater levels of shame acknowledgement (i.e. felt remorse and regret) were less likely to re-offend, while those who were more likely to displace their shame were more likely to re-offend. These two findings support reintegrative shaming theory. Finally, a negative relationship between non-compliance and cooperation was obtained, suggesting that those who were more likely to re-offend were also less likely to cooperate with the ATO. Taken together, the findings suggest that forgiveness discourages future transgressions while stigmatic shaming has the potential to increase re-offending through promoting a shame displacement response.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0004865812470121" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recently some scholars have questioned shaming and shame for their functionality in reducing re-offending (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865812470121">Botchkovar and Tittle, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004865812470121">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0004865812470121">Maxwell and Morris, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865812470121">Retzinger and Scheff, 1996</xref>). Although some studies testing the principles underlying Braithwaite’s Reintegrative Shaming Theory have revealed that reintegrative forms of shaming can lead to greater levels of shame acknowledgement and a reduction in repeat offending, other studies have revealed inconsistent results. Given these inconsistencies as well as the concerns over the viability of shaming and shame working as anticipated in Western jurisdictions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0004865812470121">Walgrave and Aertsen (1996)</xref> argued that, instead of shaming, reduced re-offending and reintegration might best be achieved by offering forgiveness to an offender. It is in this context that the present study aimed to empirically test whether forgiveness could be used as a tool to reduce repeat offending.</p>
<p>A number of interesting results were obtained. Stigmatic shaming by the ATO had a large impact on taxpayers’ feelings of shame displacement; if taxpayers felt stigmatized by their enforcement experience they were much more likely to displace their shame (i.e. feel anger and hostility towards others). In contrast, feeling forgiven by the ATO led taxpayers to express lower levels of shame displacement. What these specific findings demonstrate is that a regulatory agency that communicates forgiveness for past indiscretions can lead offenders to experience a less negative emotional state than an authority that tries to stigmatize offenders.</p>
<p>It was also found that stigmatic shaming had no direct impact on subsequent compliance behaviour. Instead, stigmatization appeared to have an impact on future tax evasion behaviour through the mediating influence of shame displacement. Those who were more likely to displace their shame in response to feeling stigmatized were more likely to report having subsequently evaded their taxes. Coupled with the findings presented in the previous paragraph, this suggests that an enforcement strategy that aims to humiliate and reprimand non-compliers can potentially have a detrimental effect in promoting future compliance behaviour. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004865812470121">Kagan and Scholz (1984)</xref> similarly argue that deterrence-based enforcement can generate resistance to compliance and weakened respect for authority and the law.</p>
<p>Forgiveness, in contrast, appeared to play a more constructive role than stigmatic shaming in predicting subsequent compliance behaviour. Feeling forgiven by the ATO not only reduced offenders’ levels of anger and blame towards others (i.e. shame displacement), but it also directly reduced subsequent tax evasion behaviour. It also led to greater levels of cooperation with the ATO. In other words, those who felt forgiven by the ATO for their past transgressions were less likely to report having evaded their taxes again as a result of the enforcement experience, and were more likely to indicate that they cooperated with the ATO. Feeling forgiven by loved ones also had a direct and positive impact on compliance behaviour. If offenders felt that their family and friends had forgiven them for their involvement in tax schemes they were less likely to continue evading their taxes. These findings suggest that forgiveness from both an authority and loved ones shows promise in reducing repeat offending. While one might expect forgiveness from loved ones to be more effective in shaping compliance-related behaviour than forgiveness from the State, these findings point to the value of regulatory authorities also conveying messages of forgiveness for past indiscretions if they wish to encourage long-term voluntary compliance from offenders.</p>
<p>As noted in the Results section, one of the particularly interesting findings from this study was that feeling forgiven by loved ones appeared to have a negative impact on shame acknowledgement. While we found the expected result that a higher level of shame acknowledgement was associated with lower levels of tax non-compliance, the literature predicts that reintegrative forms of disapproval should increase feelings of regret and remorse over wrong-doing (i.e. shame acknowledgement; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865812470121">Ahmed et al., 2001</xref>). Our study showed that feeling forgiven by loved ones actually led to lower shame acknowledgement. How might our finding be explained?</p>
<p>First, if we look at the situation surrounding this tax offender sample, the vast majority of offenders became involved in aggressive forms of tax avoidance as a result of bad advice from financial planners and tax accountants. Many taxpayers therefore claimed that they had been the ‘victims’ of bad advice and resented the ATO’s implication that they had attempted to defraud the tax system (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004865812470121">Murphy, 2003</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865812470121">Struthers et al. (2008)</xref>, taking responsibility for one’s offences can be a shameful event because it implies that one acted immorally. This is likely to threaten one’s identity as a good and honest person. Struthers et al. also argue that the type of forgiveness offered to offenders should matter for perpetrators who are low in responsibility for a transgression. They note that forgiveness that is intended to ‘reconcile without the tenor of negative evaluation and the fear of public exposure’ should lead offenders low in responsibility to feel less shame for their wrong-doing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865812470121">Struthers et al., 2008</xref>: 132). We suggest that forgiveness offered by loved ones may have conveyed this type of message. Given that taxpayers may have felt little responsibility for their wrong-doing, according to Struthers et al. such messages should result in lower levels of shame and remorse. Emotion researchers have also shown that people in the West think of emotions such as remorse and regret as negative emotions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865812470121">Kernis et al., 1993</xref>). Feeling forgiven by loved ones may therefore have communicated to offenders that they can let go of these negative emotions. Related to this is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004865812470121">Wallace et al.’s (2008)</xref> suggestion that if transgressors interpret forgiveness as a sign that their behaviour was relatively inoffensive, then equating forgiveness with condoning may in fact reduce or eliminate an offender’s shame and remorse over an offence. Given the circumstances surrounding many taxpayers’ involvement in tax schemes, perhaps tax offenders felt their loved ones condoned their behaviour by communicating they did nothing to feel bad about.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we may be able to reconcile this interesting finding by taking into account Shadd Maruna’s work on desistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0004865812470121">Maruna, 2001</xref>). Important in Maruna’s work is his discovery of the importance of ‘redemption scripts’. Using quantitative and qualitative data collected from serious offenders in the United Kingdom Maruna found that many of the offenders who had abandoned their criminal careers had made use of ‘redemption scripts’ to explain their former criminal behaviour. Offenders often made excuses for why they had offended and there was a general failure to acknowledge that they were to blame for what had occurred in their lives. At the same time, however, there was an acceptance that they now had the responsibility for helping to repair the harm they had caused and to right themselves for the future. In other words, while denying responsibility for past indiscretions (i.e. they felt little shame acknowledgement) the offenders simultaneously acknowledged that they had to ‘make good’ in the future. In the context of the present study, therefore, forgiveness by loved ones may have reduced re-offending by ameliorating tax offenders’ shame over offending while at the same time reinforcing their identification as law abiding citizens who needed to do right in the future.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0004865812470121">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite some unexpected outcomes, the findings in general support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865812470121">Braithwaite’s (1989)</xref> central focus on the positive notion of reintegration. Instead of reintegrative <italic>shaming</italic>, however, the results indicate that a reintegrative approach that conveys <italic>forgiveness</italic> for past transgressions appears promising for reducing retaliatory shame-related emotions and for fostering long-term compliance behaviour. Further, the results suggest that the effects of forgiveness on offending can be independent of shaming effects. These results are consistent with some earlier studies in the tax compliance literature. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0004865812470121">Murphy and Harris (2007)</xref> found that taxpayers experiencing less stigmatizing treatment during an enforcement experience were more likely to comply with their tax obligations two years later. Our findings also support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004865812470121">Ahmed and V Braithwaite’s (2004)</xref> research where – in a hypothetical scenario – participants threatened with punishment for evading tax were more likely to displace their shame by blaming the tax authority for their illicit act. This displacement of shame lowered not only hypothetical compliance behaviour but resulted in participants’ dissociation from the tax system.</p>
<p>In summary, the results have important policy implications for regulatory authorities because they show the value that offenders can place on an authority forgiving them for their indiscretions. This specific result implies that when an authority does not forgive – or is not reintegrative in its approach – future compliance by citizens might be jeopardized.</p>
<sec id="sec15-0004865812470121"><title>Strengths, limitations and suggestions for further research</title>
<p>The current study not only provides support for previous laboratory research on forgiveness, which shows forgiveness improves compliance, but it also advances the literature that explores the effectiveness of alternative regulatory enforcement strategies for reducing re-offending. As far as the authors are aware this is the first study that has examined the capacity of forgiveness being offered by a legal authority to reduce repeat offending in a real-life context. A major strength of this study therefore lies in the reliability of the data, which has been collected from real offenders, not from students subjected to an artificial manipulation in a laboratory setting.</p>
<p>Despite the contribution this research may offer, however, this study does have a number of important limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, the cross-sectional nature of the survey data somewhat limits the conclusions drawn by the study. The causal relationships between variables might possibly be obscured, as data from all participants was collected at the same point in time. Therefore, one cannot be sure that perceived forgiveness had a causal effect on subsequent compliance behaviour. Secondly, we only had access to self-reported tax compliance behaviour. Self-reported compliance behaviour in surveys may not be reflective of actual compliance behaviour (although research does support the suggestion that self-reports do correlate with actual behaviour; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865812470121">Fazio, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004865812470121">Pogarsky, 2004</xref>). Future research that uses actual tax compliance behaviour identified through an examination of taxpayers’ records and that then links these records to taxpayer survey responses would be one way to ascertain definitively whether the approach taken in an enforcement procedure has a long-term effect on actual taxpaying behaviour.</p>
<p>A third and more significant limitation of this study relates to the sample used. This study aimed to establish how tax evasion could be reduced and long-term tax-compliance achieved. Although the sample was a significant group, its narrow focus (i.e. taxpayers involved in aggressive tax planning) might perhaps limit the generalizability of the study to other types of offending behaviour. As noted earlier, this group of taxpayers viewed themselves as the victims of the tax system, rather than seeing themselves as tax offenders. Failure to acknowledge responsibility over their wrong-doing may have affected the results in a way that other tax offences may not. For example, perhaps forgiveness played a significant role with this group of taxpayers because they viewed themselves as law-abiding citizens caught up in an unfortunate situation. In other words, they may have felt they deserved understanding for their predicament as opposed to punishment, or they may have felt their situation excused their behaviour. There are clearly certain segments of the population who are amoral and greedy, and the issue of how best to deal with them in an enforcement situation may require more than simply offering forgiveness (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004865812470121">Levi’s 2010</xref> discussion of serious tax offenders). To ascertain whether the results of the present study can be replicated, future research might therefore aim to include a wider group of tax offenders where the ambiguity surrounding their offending is not disputed and where they clearly acknowledge responsibility over their wrong-doing. Whether forgiveness is effective for reducing recidivism for other types of crime is also unknown and might prove fruitful as an area for further research.</p>

<p>While shame and shaming might be difficult concepts to understand in Western jurisdictions, and may not be as effective as originally thought in reducing repeat offending, the results of the present study suggest that the reintegrative power of forgiveness shows promise for controlling subsequent offending behaviour. Although this is the first study to examine the role of forgiveness in the context of real-life re-offending behaviour in a legal context, the results are encouraging. They suggest that forgiveness is as important to shame acknowledgement and shame displacement for predicting recidivism, and importantly, that forgiveness has independent effects on offending. Future studies should seek to explore whether forgiveness can be used for other types of offenders. For authorities that aim to enforce their rules in a fair, healing and respectful manner, while at the same time nurturing a long-term commitment to law-abiding behaviour, forgiving offenders while still acknowledging their wrong-doing, may be the answer.</p>
