<p>The discursive practices of adoptive parents in two online transnational adoption forums (2006-2008) and observations of five international adoption workshops suggest that what Heather Jacobson described as <italic>culture keeping</italic>, the cultural socialization of children that retains a sense of native group identity, is more aptly characterized as <italic>cultural tourism</italic>, the selective appropriation and consumption of renovated cultural symbols, artifacts, and events that serve as the source of identity construction for adopted children. A feature of consumer capitalism, cultural tourism in transnational adoption helps shape the contours of cultural and racial identity. It also provides a partial understanding of how adopted children often fail to develop hybrid identities and how adult adoptees exist on the margins of two cultures.</p>

<p>Creating a family through transnational adoption suggests a reciprocal process that results in a hybrid family identity. However, recent studies indicate that this may not be the case. Instead, cultural absorption is unidirectional, as adoptive parents tend to rely on people like themselves to navigate what Heather <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X11418179">Jacobson (2008)</xref> calls <italic>culture keeping</italic>, the cultural socialization of children that retains a sense of native group identity. This article draws on the discursive practices of adoptive parents in two online adoption forums to suggest that what Jacobson describes as culture keeping is more aptly characterized as <italic>cultural tourism</italic>, the selective appropriation and consumption of renovated cultural symbols, artifacts, and cultural events as a means of constructing identity. As a feature of consumer capitalism, cultural tourism in adoption provides the symbolic basis for creation of cultural identity of adopted children and generates issues linked to a variety of life outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X11418179">Friedlander, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192513X11418179">Soon Huh &amp; Reid, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192513X11418179">Willing, 2004</xref>). Given the temporal and artificial character of these cultural constructions, children are in jeopardy of failing to establish collective identity or sense of membership in either their culture of origin or their adoptive culture. Thus, cultural tourism in transnational adoption provides the basis for defining grievances among the adult adopted collective (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192513X11418179">McGinnis, Livingston Smith, Ryan, &amp; Howard, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Because the Internet has become a central node through which various groups explore identities, this article combines virtual ethnography with real-life observations of five international adoption workshops as a way to explore and contextualize how adoptive parents address the mandate of cultural literacy in transnational adoption. Interactions in adoptive parent forums of Chinese and Guatemalan children examined for a period of 2 years (2006-2008) show how culture and ethnicity are framed and reframed through the medium of the Internet and how identity constructed online intersects with identity lived in the real world. The blurring of racial/ethnic and cultural boundaries in transnational adoption is also accompanied by the blurring of private and public boundaries in cyberspace, as discussions intended for an imagined community take place in a publicly viewable forum. Adoption forums provide the contemporary format through which parents define, legitimate, and solidify adoptive family identities and engage in the selective appropriation of culture. Adoptive parents use these forums to help navigate the ethnoracial consciousness of their children and thereby set the parameters of culture keeping. They also convey how cultural literacy in adoption reflects the practice of cultural tourism—the accessing of products, events, geographic sites, and other commercialized forms of culture. These practices, which are both liminal and reflexive, demonstrate how adopted children often fail to develop transcultural identities and instead occupy a social–spatial in-betweenness, on the margins of two cultures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0192513X11418179">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following section draws from the literature on adoption and cultural tourism to frame the nuances of cultural engagement by adoptive parents on behalf of their children. This is followed by an analysis of archived threads from two online adoption forums: a forum of adoptive parents of Chinese children and a forum of adoptive parents of Guatemalan children. The discursive practices of adoptive parents were analyzed to understand the cultural socialization practices that occur within these types of families. Because threads literally number in the thousands, thread discussions were extrapolated for a designated period of 2 years, beginning and ending in the month of November (2006-2008). A primary analysis of the concept of cultural engagement by adoptive parents is followed by a secondary analysis that teases out parent orientations toward culture keeping and cultural tourism. Observations of five international adoption workshops supplement this analysis and reveal how transnational adoptive parents select, avoid, and purchase culture.</p>
<sec id="section1-0192513X11418179">
<title>Transnational Adoption, Culture Keeping, and Cultural Tourism</title>
<p>Between 1989 and 2005, the number of transnational adoptions increased 180%, with the United States representing the largest receiving country of adopted children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11418179">Merino, 2010</xref>). In 2008, Guatemala sent 4,123 children to the United States alone, and the United Nation estimated that more than 15,000 Guatemalan children were adopted by receiving countries in that same year. China, the country that has been the largest source of adoptions to the United States over the past 10 years, sent approximately 73,000 children to the United States between 1995 and 2009. The significant numbers of transnational adoptions, and the global context in which they have occurred, requires us to examine how adoptive parents are situated as beneficiaries of this political and economic activity, and how they address the acquisition and maintenance of their child’s culture. Jacobson’s study (2008) highlighted activities by which adoptive mothers of Russian and Chinese children attempted to provide a sense of cultural awareness in their children. Online narratives of adoptive parents of African American and biracial children also conveyed efforts at cultural engagement; however, parents in this study often expressed ambivalence about maintaining ethnoracial awareness and wrestled with “how much” culture they should keep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X11418179">Quiroz, 2008</xref>). Indeed, culture keeping was often presented as more of a consumer choice as opposed to a child’s right. Transnational adoptions are also often transracial adoptions and the processes described by adoptive parents in domestic transracial adoption are mirrored in transnational adoption, with culture often serving as code for race. As Dorow and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X11418179">2006a</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X11418179">Ortiz &amp; Briggs, 2003</xref>) point out, how race matters in the adoption of Chinese children is inextricably linked to how it matters in the adoption of African American children. This is undoubtedly true for adoption from other countries.</p>
<p>Although culture keeping refers to efforts to maintain culture, <italic>cultural tourism</italic> emphasizes access to and selective appropriation of forms of culture, either its products and events, or geographic sites, such as historic sites, local museums, ethnic festivals, and neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192513X11418179">Smith &amp; Robinson, 2006</xref>). The former implies substantive attempts to create links to birth culture whereas the latter expands exposure to another culture without necessarily generating substantive alterations in life experience. As part of the larger processes of what Jeremy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X11418179">Rifkin (2001)</xref> calls <italic>hypercapitalism</italic>, where virtually everything is marketed and the growth of commercial access to personal experience is pronounced, cultural tourism has been said to transform cultures as commercialization, and cultural consumption inexorably alters group identity for financial gain. This is especially true in developing nations where opportunities for exploitation abound. As scholars debate the scope and value of hypercapitalism and cultural tourism, we are inevitably drawn to the various arenas affected by it. Family is one of these arenas. Cultural tourism finds a natural home in transnational adoption as adoptive parents are typically from first world nations and adopt children from sending countries that are often developing countries. Though characterized as a not-for-profit activity, transnational adoption involves exchange of significant sums of money that include formal costs and mandatory “donations” by parents during different stages of the adoption process. In addition, a mandate of cultural literacy now dominates the adoption arena and can be seen in popular adoption books, agency websites, and transnational adoption workshops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X11418179">Quiroz, 2007</xref>). Intersecting with this mandate are the ways in which culture has been commercialized in adoption. Adoption books and workshops are part of adoptive parent education, and a variety of paraphernalia can be bought in adoption stores, including ethnic dolls, folk music, t-shirts, cookbooks, children’s literature, and other cultural artifacts. Culture Camps are annual events where, for a fee, adoptive parents can send their children to be surrounded by other adopted children from their country of origin and where they can learn about their heritage. “Roots trips” help families return to the country of origin and are offered by some adoption agencies.</p>
<p>Transnational adoption and cultural tourism generate up to a billion dollars of revenue annually for both sending and receiving countries. Income from transnational adoption ranges from $200 to $400 million per year for sending countries such as India or Korea and to $1.3 billion for receiving countries in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X11418179">Europol, 2005</xref>). Income generated by adoption businesses in the United States is estimated at around $1 billion (Kim Park Nelson, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192513X11418179">Trenka, 2005</xref>). A similar commercialization of adoption occurs in China, where adoptive parents are taken on tours and encounter vendors who specifically target them to sell everything from magazines and artwork to dolls and clothes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X11418179">Jacobson, 2008</xref>). Indeed, “culture” has become a central feature of the adoption market as the consumption of products and events allows entrepreneurs to profit while alleviating the personal dissonance of adoptive parents and satisfying the adoption arena’s mandate of cultural literacy.</p>
<p>Adoption and cultural tourism are alike in that they are guided by the imperative of individual choice. Consumerism is often vividly displayed in forum discourse. A prospective parent in the Guatemalan adoption forum described the selection process akin to a shopping market along with the features of each program that factored into the decision-making process.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Guatemala is the country that we feel called towards, but we’ve also been looking into other countries as well so that we have more choices. Ethiopia was one other choice and we attended an Ethiopia adoption meeting but really felt that it is not for us at this time. We also got excited about El Salvador but found out you have to be married 5 years and we’ve only been married 3½ years. We are not qualified for China because I am not 30 and in so many other countries we are either not qualified for or the travel times are just way too long than for what we can do right now. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://forums.adoption.com/guatemala-adoption">http://forums.adoption.com/guatemala-adoption</ext-link>, November 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such comments support research that find a number of considerations are involved in the choices of adoptive parents, including cultural and racial preferences, constructions of children in other countries, religious calling, and restrictions of sending countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X11418179">Dorow, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X11418179">Quiroz, 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, within these parameters, adoptive parents often convey the shopping market aspects of transnational adoption.</p>
<p>Once parents elect to adopt, they must address how they will maintain their child’s ties to their culture of origin. One could argue that cultural tourism is the natural by-product of the cultural literacy mandate in the adoption arena as social workers and adoption representatives use workshops and home studies to develop and assess ethnoracial awareness. Sociologist Mary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192513X11418179">Waters (1990)</xref> referred to this superficial presentation of culture as “dime store” ethnicity, in which symbolic identification is not indicative of deep attachments and merely helps “decorate” the self-presentation. Cultural literacy in adoption is expressed idiosyncratically as adoptive parents, who are typically White, literally shop for the cultural representations that will ultimately be featured in the presentation of culture of origin to their child. This identity consists of cultural productions that often misrepresent the culture of origin and substitute for sustained contact with either native or transplanted members of that culture (hence, use of the term <italic>staged authenticity</italic>). Anyone who has surfed the websites of private adoption agencies can find a variety of services beyond child placement that include Heritage Camps (which are geared not only to children from other countries but also to U.S. children born in other states) and links to other venues to consume culture. For example, the “Culture on the Web” site on the Adoptive Families webpage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.adoptivefamilies.com/culture06/14/2010">www.adoptivefamilies.com/culture06/14/2010</ext-link>) provides links to a salon that features products to help with African American hair care (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cornrowsandco.com">www.cornrowsandco.com</ext-link>), board games and toys for African American children (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.littleafrica.com">www.littleafrica.com</ext-link>), heritage clothing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proudtobeme.com">www.proudtobeme.com</ext-link>), and even personalized birth country maps for transnationally adopted children (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.topgraphicaltreasures.com">www.topgraphicaltreasures.com</ext-link>). Indeed, dime-store ethnicity is both symbolized and promoted by cultural tourism in transnational adoption.</p>
<p>Those who have attended international adoption workshops can attest to the way that culture is displayed on tables dedicated to particular countries and presented as a collection of artifacts that can be purchased. Culture keeping is a central feature of adoption forums as parents ask for advice, share stories, and seek out other parents for support and a sense of community. Nevertheless, once children are adopted, culture keeping is largely in the hands of adoptive parents, whose commitment to developing their child’s ethnoracial consciousness and keeping his/her culture resides on a continuum and may even change over time. Much of the discourse of parents on these forums resonates to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X11418179">Regina Austin’s (2005)</xref> characterization of Black culture as often appropriated without being embraced. And just as commodification and commercialization of Black culture results in alienating the Black community from its own cultural productions, participation in cultural tourism by adoptive parents fosters what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X11418179">McCannell (1976)</xref> labeled as <italic>staged authenticity</italic>, a fictional or distorted construction of identity with limited possibilities for maintaining real or substantive ties to the culture of origin. Cultural tourism in adoption generates the potential for alienating adopted children from their cultures, thereby damaging their identities and sense of personhood.</p>

<title>Guatemalan and Chinese Adoption Forums: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Adoption.com">Adoption.com</ext-link></title>
<p>Adoption forums were chosen as an alternative way of examining this process because they provide parent viewpoints on a variety of issues, particularly cultural socialization. To quote media scholar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192513X11418179">Dana Boyd (2008)</xref>, these conversations are “public by default but private through intent” as adoption forums present intimate personal experiences to an imagined community of adoptive parents without the interference of the researcher. As with any real-world set of interactions, conversations in forums can be regular, intermittent, or single responses to messages (i.e., posts) and are typically initiated by statements, questions, or comments on a given topic (i.e., threads) and can occur immediately or within days of the original post. Adoptive parents who engage in transnational adoption are a small population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X11418179">Kreider, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192513X11418179">Newburger, 2001</xref>), and the population of adoptive forum participants is even smaller and predominantly female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X11418179">Anagnost, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X11418179">Fallows, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192513X11418179">Madden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X11418179">Noonan, 2007</xref>). Therefore, the majority of forum participants are likely to be White ethnic adoptive mothers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0192513X11418179">2</xref></sup> The appeal of adoption forums for this group may be because of parents’ limited ability to engage in face-to-face interactions, restrictions on access to other adoptive families, or limits on parents’ time. By engaging online, participants are able to interact during children’s nap times, between homework, and at times when children’s demands are not as great. Part of a larger database, the excerpts used in this article represent modalities of posts from two forums on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Adoption.com">Adoption.com</ext-link>, a forum of adoptive parents of Guatemalan children and a forum of adoptive parents of Chinese children. These forums were chosen because Guatemala and China are two of the largest sending countries of children to the United States in the past two decades and because racial/ethnic differences between adoptive mothers and their children were assumed to predispose an adoptive parent to cultural tourism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0192513X11418179">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Each forum produced literally thousands of archived pages of online messages and discussions that provide a rich source of information on various aspects of adoption. However, this examination targeted transnational adoption broadly and cultural socialization specifically. Content analysis yielded 16 analytic categories (see the appendix) as virtual pages within a thread averaged four posts or messages. Five of the 16 categories were extrapolated for further analysis of cultural socialization: (a) Supply and Placement of Children, (b) Ethnoracial Consciousness, (c) Cultural Literacy, (d) How Much Cultural Socialization is Enough, and (e) Transracialization/Hybrid Identities. The first category refers to posts that discuss the availability of children for transnational adoption, the costs and needs of adoptive families, the logistics in placement of children, and difficulties of adopting from specific countries. Threads on domestic and transnational adoption policy were placed in this category along with why people chose to adopt from a particular country. Ethnoracial consciousness refers to posts that discuss race, culture, and country of origin as important factors in the lives of adopted children and the necessity of developing these ties for children. This category included threads that described major life transitions by adoptive parents on behalf of their children, such as moving to new cities, neighborhoods, or churches on behalf of their children. Cultural literacy refers to knowledge acquired by parents about the adopted child’s culture and the obligation of parents to develop ethnoracial consciousness for themselves as well as engaging in culture keeping practices for their children. Often these posts described ways in which cultural literacy was learned along with questions and discussions about limitations of parents. Posts that discussed adoption agency involvement were also included here. The fourth category addresses parent questions about when they should know things about their child’s culture, how many and which cultural activities constituted appropriate cultural socialization. This category resembles cultural literacy in that posts often included questions seeking advice and participants addressing the obligations of parents in culture keeping. However, posts placed in this category were accompanied by complaints or arguments about the parameters of culture keeping (i.e., How much culture keeping was enough?). These issues continue to be at the heart of the cultural identity debate in adoption. The final category includes discussions of participants who describe a radical change in parents’ identities to one that fully incorporates the identity of their adopted child. Based on the literature, these five categories, with each category comprising multiple threads, form the concept of <italic>Cultural Engagement</italic>, broadly defined as values, beliefs, language, history, choices, and practices of parents regarding the culture of origin of their adopted child (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X11418179">Carsten &amp; Julia, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X11418179">Lee, 2006</xref>). Cultural engagement refers to the <italic>extent</italic> of cultural contact and the <italic>types</italic> of cultural contact in which parents engaged (intimate associations with members of the child’s community; participation in ethnic festivals, holidays, and rituals; membership in cultural associations; and memberships in adoptive parent support groups). Since posts in each thread represent different parents, no profile or assessment can be made about individual parent orientations. What can be assessed is the number of different people posting on each topic. Therefore, “extent of cultural contact” refers to the number of posts that address issues of cultural socialization as opposed to the degree to which any single person engaged in a configuration of activities.</p>

<p>Once grouped into categories, forum contents were reread and coded by an independent coder. On completion, I reread the posts again to explore any inconsistencies in coding, additional themes not captured in the initial analysis, and issues raised by the independent coder. Thread contents of categories illustrated the frequency of responses within each category. The categories were further examined for themes related to cultural engagement. Frequently, overlap in discussion threads and individual posts occurred. When this happened, the post was categorized under the dominant focus. For example, a thread on family acceptance often included posts that incorporated discussions on color-blindness or color-consciousness. However, because the dominant focus of the thread was family acceptance, the post/message was placed in this category.</p>
<p>More than 800 pages of online discussions on cultural engagement were produced in the Guatemalan forum between 2007 and 2008 (approximately 3,200 posts), and 653 pages of online discussions in the China adoption forum were produced between 2006 and 2008 (approximately 2,200 posts; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0192513X11418179">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>A nuanced analysis of cultural engagement was done to assess parent orientations as tending toward culture keeping or cultural tourism. For this analysis, cultural engagement had to be disaggregated and operationalized in some way. Therefore, culture keeping was defined as maintaining contacts with members of the child’s culture of origin, membership in cultural associations (exclusive of adoptive parent support groups), and substantive changes made in geographic and social spaces by parents on behalf of their adopted children. It also includes major shifts in identities of parents to include identification with their child’s identity of origins. Cultural tourism was identified by renaming, resistance to cultural socialization (as manifested in explicit statements made by parents and refusal to engage in particular practices), and consumption of cultural artifacts (e.g., recreation and media, dolls, clothing, food, books, culture camps). These discussions revealed stricter boundaries on parents’ willingness to engage culture and a reliance on cultural symbols to provide the basis of cultural identity. Though cultural artifacts are also used in culture keeping, it is the tenor of posts that determined their inclusion in the cultural tourism category. This analysis required reviewing the broad rubric of Cultural Engagement and teasing out practices, attitudes, and interpretations within threads so that threads were disaggregated and posts within threads were used as indicators of these orientations (thus, the post became the “unit of analysis”). For example, the category of cultural literacy contained threads focused on travel to a child’s country of origin. Posts within these threads revealed a broad range of parents’ viewpoints and practices. Discussions of frequent visits to the adopted child’s country or the importance of visits to the child’s country of origin was placed into culture keeping and regarded as significantly different from an abstract mulling of whether the child would want this experience at some future point in his/her life or an explicit refusal to travel to the country. In the following post, an adoptive parent of a Chinese child expresses the boundaries of racial exceptionalism that are argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X11418179">Anthony Shiu (2001)</xref> as immutable.</p>

<p>Of course we will never ignore that our daughter was born in China but we will not “shove” it down her throat either. We will discuss her birth country with her and I hope to return with her to China one day. . . . I believe the key is to find a balance. We will not speak to her in her native language because we cannot speak it ourselves. I will do my best to learn a few common terms before we go to China to get her but I will NOT learn a whole new language.

<p>Culture keeping implies substantive attempts to engage birth cultures and make cultural connections, whereas cultural tourism is implicit in negotiations by parents regarding how often and to what extent the culture of their adopted child must be addressed. As illustrated by the quote above, comments in the cultural tourism category suggested mild to serious resistance to addressing culture along with a failure to recognize ethnoracial consciousness and the acquisition of culture as a reciprocal obligation. The distinctions between these orientations can be subtle as elements do overlap and can be found within each orientation. However, orientations are not based on a single element but rather on how elements coalesce with one another and the number of posts that speak to each orientation. To reiterate, it is not individual parents who are being categorized but rather the modal orientation of forum posts.</p>
<p>Posts were assessed for each element within an orientation, and the number of posts for each element is presented. The total number of posts across indicators is taken to suggest a predominant orientation of parents toward cultural engagement. In addition to forum discussions, observations of five intercountry adoption workshops were conducted. Three workshops were observed in Illinois and two were observed in Texas. Though located in different states, workshop formats were similar, and each workshop lasted for approximately 2 hours. Workshops consisted of presentations by facilitators that were followed by either a panel of adult adoptees or one adoptive parent with her/his child who presented his/her experiences and perspectives on transnational adoption. Presentations were often followed by a question and answer session with prospective and adoptive parents. Notes were taken on these sessions and brochures, pamphlets, and guides were also gathered and examined.</p>

<title>Culture Keeping/Cultural Tourism</title>
<p>Though participants engaged in both culture keeping and cultural tourism, the majority of posts indicated a predisposition toward cultural tourism. Analysis of online adoption forums shows how parents struggled to engage culture. However, not all struggles reflected a desire to embrace the child’s culture or to infuse his/her culture into their lives. Participants who enthusiastically and unreservedly engaged in culture keeping were exceptional.</p>

<p>Our children are Chinese-Americans and I work very hard to expose them to Chinese culture. I try to provide her with as many role models as possible and I educate myself to as many Asian American issues as possible. I actively work with Asian groups and read about Asian American history. In addition I continue to expose—to her heritage by teaching her Mandarin, studying Zhuang customs (she is a member of that particular minority group) and celebrating many Chinese holidays because to many Asian Americans, heritage is an incredibly important part of their daily life. . . . I cannot share being Asian, but I can acknowledge its importance and provide her with as many positive outlets for her personal growth as possible.

<p>The majority of posts in both forums revealed how parents selectively extracted from culture to minimize challenges and to satisfy their obligation to keep culture. The most obvious aspect of cultural tourism in adoption is the choice of country from which to adopt. This choice was sometimes fortuitous, shaped by friends who had adopted. Other considerations also played a part in the choice of country. For example, one couple chose to adopt from Guatemala because the age limits of their preferred country (China) precluded participation in its program. When it came to selecting a country, few posts characterized choice of country as linked to limited finances or the cost of the adoption. However, a significant number of posts described how adoption agencies influenced decisions.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We started out looking to do a domestic adoption but it became clear to us that this just wasn’t a good fit because we weren’t comfortable with the idea of an open adoption. Their domestic program was structured so that the only option was to be willing to be in contact with the birth parents. When we told our social worker she suggested we consider their China adoption program. She mentioned that one of the benefits of the program was not having to deal with those types of issues since children are typically abandoned or relinquished at very young ages.

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the fact that the majority of transnational adoptions occur with the help of private adoption agencies, the role of adoption agencies in shaping the choice of program or country by adoptive parents is typically neglected. Operating within consumer capitalist culture, private adoption agencies undoubtedly respond by deciding which programs to offer and by attempting to create new markets in the face of shifting adoption policies.</p>
<p>The choice of country from which to adopt also relied as much on the social and political location of parents as that of their prospective children. In forum posts and adoption workshops parent views of race, gender, nation, and culture weighed heavily in their decisions when choosing a country from which to adopt, as these factors were seen to contribute not only to their success as parents but also to the child’s acceptance by extended family members and friends. Similar to the narratives of parents in Dorow’s ethnography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X11418179">2006b</xref>), the narratives of parents in these adoption forums also expose the racial formations of our society and signal how adopted children occupy different social statuses within our racial imaginary (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192513X11418179">Gailey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X11418179">Jacobson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192513X11418179">Shiao, Tuan, &amp; Rienzi, 2004</xref>). One woman became cognizant of these formations when offering her recommendation of a sending country to a friend.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I suggested Guatemala and explained all the reasons why I chose this country. Her remark was that while she was sure an Asian child would turn out smart, a good student, and go on to college and a career, she wasn’t so sure about a Hispanic child, especially a Hispanic boy. She would be too worried about his getting involved in gangs and drugs and dropping out of school.

<p>Obviously the “tolerable and even intriguing racial and cultural differences” of Chinese children as perceived by adoptive parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X11418179">Dorow, 2006a</xref>, p. 370) are not transferable to children of other racial/ethnic or cultural groups, such as Guatemalans, who are categorized as Hispanic. As “Hispanics,” Guatemalan children become embedded in the assumptions, stereotypes, and attitudes that currently prevail toward U.S. Latinos. Less explicit statements suggested that the market prospects of children in transnational adoption are linked to U.S. cultural and racial images, images to which adoptive parents or extended family members often subscribed.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My first choice was Guatemala, but to be honest, when I approached my family about it I could tell there would have been trouble. My husband had no problem but some of my other family members did. They didn’t say as much but when I told my sister, she said, “Why don’t you try Russia or the Ukraine?” My mother just said, “Do you really think they will fit in?” To be honest, I don’t know what “fit in” meant, whether she was referring to our family, our neighborhood, or what. I just couldn’t see bringing a child into that type of situation. So I decided on China.

<p>Other decisions made by adoptive parents were carefully considered in efforts to balance the interests of both parents and child. However, such contemplation also resulted in making choices that were justified in terms of time and other types of benefits such as love.</p>

<p>I’ve heard pros and cons about adopted children learning Chinese. The pros are obviously that the child will hopefully feel more connected to their cultural heritage. The cons are that the child might feel less connected to their a-parents because we are obviously not Chinese and we do not speak Chinese in the household. So, this could add a sense of separation between us and our daughters, unless of course, we participate. When I told her [a coworker] that we are not taking her to Chinese language classes, my coworker said some things that were meant to make me feel guilty. I didn’t feel guilty because there are so many other things that we do with her, that adding another class setting and travel time is nearly impossible. And I’m not convinced that this is something that she will feel jaded on if we don’t do it.

<title>Renaming and Cultural Avoidance</title>
<p>Many researchers have pointed to the significance of naming as demonstrating who has the power to say what about whom. Heather <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X11418179">Jacobson (2008)</xref> found that less than a third of the parents of Russian children she interviewed and less than a fifth of the parents of Chinese children retained their child’s name of origin. Because participation in adoption forums is so fluid, it is impossible to provide a delineated sample from which to make comparisons between online participants and offline participants in qualitative studies. However, the vast majority of posts in these adoption forums described renaming adopted children. Parents regarded renaming as a means of honoring family members and establishing a link to families for adopted children.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Addison Grace is named after both of her GREAT grandmothers. One from each side of the family. Both of my parents were so thrilled that she was given these names, the names of their dearly departed mothers (my grandmothers) and now she has the legacy of beautiful names to fit a beautiful girl. Her birth name was just not a name I really could envision her growing up with, so I changed it. We all have our reasons. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://forums.adoption.com/guatemela-adoption">http://forums.adoption.com/guatemela-adoption</ext-link>, January 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the same time that renaming reflected an attempt to facilitate acceptance of the adopted child, renaming children who could be 2 to 5 years old when they were adopted fails to take into account the impact on a child who already has had to make many adjustments. In the same way that names provide our sense of identity, renaming modifies that identity, as it obviates earlier experiences and memories of the renamed person (and by implication, the people associated with them).</p>
<p>Cultural avoidance is also a feature of transnational adoption as parents elect <italic>not</italic> to address their child’s culture or family of origin in a number of ways, and by so doing, deculturalize children, however inadvertently. <italic>Deculturalization</italic> refers to the historic process of how dominant groups literally stripped away the culture of dominated groups in the United States through enslavement, displacement, and abolishment of language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X11418179">Spring, 2006</xref>). Though the processes are more subtle in transnational adoption, acts such as renaming and cultural avoidance also result in loss of cultural identity for adopted children. Cultural avoidance is the silence surrounding the child’s culture, race, and nation of origin; the Anglicized name removes the last connection to that culture. This was manifested when parents reserved the decision for adopted children about how much immersion in their culture of origin is appropriate once they are grown.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If we as parents decide to make contact, then we leave our children with the potential burden of the effects and outcomes of that contact. Suppose we choose to offer some type of financial support; then our children may feel pressured to continue that support down the road. I absolutely agree that the decision should be made by the adoptee when he/she is ready . . . —but as adoptive parents, we should always let our children know that we are there and will support and assist them if they choose to make contact.

</disp-quote></p>
<p>This position, mirrored in posts on this topic, implicitly allows parents to relinquish responsibility for ethnoracial consciousness, assures distance from families of origin, and leaves the burden of identity to adoptees, as the angst of adult adoptees searching for identity is well documented in several autobiographical narratives (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X11418179">Dodds, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X11418179">E.

Cultural choices presumably left to adopted children to make when they are older are, in fact, already made by adoptive parents who rename their child, teach him/her a new language, and integrate him/her into their families and their culture. One mother who attended a Chinese cultural event sponsored by her adoption agency makes this explicit.</p>

<p>During the Q &amp;A [Question and Answer], it quickly became clear that the enthusiasm we [her family] feel for incorporating Chinese culture into our now Chinese-American family was in the minority. It is amazing to me that there are so many I encounter who would rather erase all mention of their child’s birth country and birth culture. I know that they want their child to be proud they are now American, but to say that they are no longer Chinese will only last as long as they are unable to look in a mirror. . . . I should note that I am not angry or venting here, I am just a little perplexed and confused about some of the attitudes I have encountered in the China adoption community.

<p>Contrary to the open adoption policy in U.S. domestic adoption, where some form of contact with birth families is not only required but also argued to present the optimal emotional condition for children, posts on these forums stated a desire to avoid contact with birth families.

<p>This parent could see no benefit of contact with the birth mother for the child or for the adoptive family, and cultural avoidance was presented under the guise of protecting the child. Implicit in renaming and cultural avoidance is the notion of White privilege: the invisible assets and entitlement of Whites that are not recognized but that serve to sustain different life outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X11418179">McIntosh, 1989</xref>). Coupled with White privilege is the idea of a “clean break,” where all ties to biological family are severed and where national citizenship and the Western philosophy of proprietorship and property conflicts with the philosophy of shared parenting. In this model children are desocialized and deidentified from defective cultures, races, or social statuses and resocialized in accordance with adoptive parent preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X11418179">Fonseca, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Cultural Events and Cultural Products</title>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious practice related to cultural tourism is the purchase of cultural products and services and participation in designated cultural events. Without prior knowledge or an interpretive framework within which another culture can be understood, parents must begin somewhere, and universal commodification of products, places, and services provides an obvious and easily available starting point. The challenge of engaging in cultural socialization when the culture is not one’s own often results in little more than trying to purchase it. Indeed, commodification and commercialization are hallmarks of our society, and therefore, both are evident in transnational adoption. Two parents interacting on a thread about how to address culture illustrate this point.</p>

<p>Parents celebrate ethnic holidays, decorate bedrooms with cultural artifacts, buy books that target the culture of their child, and purchase ethnic dolls, food, clothes, and customized “adoption” jewelry. These are the markers of cultural representation that parents use in hope of constructing a cultural identity for their children. For the most part, however, participation in cultural activities was intermittent at best and typically occurred with other adoptive families.</p>

<p>Participants in adoption workshops who had previously engaged in transnational adoptions often spoke about relying on adoptive parent support groups such as <italic>Raising China Children</italic> or <italic>Red Thread</italic>, and sponsoring adoption agencies provided lists of such groups at these workshops. Few parents online had close personal contacts with members of their child’s group of origin and fewer still traveled to their child’s native country. Consequently, cultural tourism was the primary mechanism for ethnic or cultural identity for adopted children. Most parents felt culturally literate by purchasing cultural artifacts and participating in cultural activities led by other adoptive parents in place of authentic cultural practices.</p>

<p>Rarely did adoptive parents report accommodating their children’s “otherness” by changing their own physical or social locations, and therefore, they might not have a full sense of their child’s experience of dislocation. To some parents, the act of adoption constitutes the significant life change that they assume is parallel to the adopted child’s. Few could reasonably argue, however, that changes in adoptive parents’ lives are comparable with what occurs to their children, who by virtue of their adoptive status have already experienced major life transitions. Adopted children experience changes of name, nation, language, and all that is familiar to them, including food, smells, and textures. To ease that transition, adoption agencies encourage parents to engage in practices that develop and sustain ethnoracial awareness. Nevertheless, forum posts indicated a very limited range of acculturation activities among parents, as community-based culture was typically substituted by tourist culture. A few adoptive parents even resisted minor accommodations.</p>

<p>We live in Vermont and we were required by the state to attend a one-day seminar based on this paper (Peggy McIntosh’s “White Privilege”). At first, my husband and I were a little offended that we HAD to attend this. We live in a state that is about 98% White but there is such a push everywhere for diversity.

<p>One of the central findings in Heather <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X11418179">Jacobson’s (2008)</xref> interviews with adoptive mothers of Russian and Chinese children was their lack of cultural contact with members of their child’s racial/ethnic group. Similarly, few parents online maintained close cultural contacts with members of the racial/ethnic groups of their adopted children. Parents were typically not located within the physical, geographical, social, or racial spaces of their adopted children, nor did they change their spaces on behalf of their children. Such spaces set the parameters of culture keeping and affirm Whiteness as the “unmarked cultural category” described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X11418179">Ruth Frankenberg (1993)</xref> in her study of White women. Some parents viewed the act of adoption as their personal contribution to multiculturalism. By remaining in her ethnically homogeneous neighborhood with a Guatemalan child, this adoptive mother believes she is stimulating social change.</p>

<p>I know everyone believes we should be living in a “diverse” neighborhood but I just don’t see the point. I refuse to give in to that sort of thinking. How will people ever change if they don’t have to? Besides, we have good friends here who are supportive of our decision and so if there are any neighbors who don’t like it, then they’re just going to have to learn, or keep it to themselves!

<p>The burden of changing adults’ dispositions implicitly rests on the adopted child as she/he must serve as the catalyst for social change. Studies of adult Korean adoptees suggest that the setting of such cultural parameters results in a “social spatial in-betweenness” for children and elides the challenges that adopted children must face in their identity development (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192513X11418179">Shiao et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Whatever the motivations for pursuing transnational adoption, there is no denying that cultures of privilege allow those who can afford it to seek out other people’s children to build their families. Adoption forums illustrate how parents selectively acknowledge, construct, and nurture aspects of their child’s cultural identity. And although some have endorsed the “baby market” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X11418179">Landes &amp; Posner, 1978</xref>), others have questioned its morality and ethics. More than other children from underrepresented groups in the United States, or even the children of immigrant groups, adopted children suffer from the conundrum of invisibility as culture keeping is portrayed by parents as successful but often by adult adoptees as nonexistent. Adoptees frequently find central aspects of their identities invisible to those closest to them and yet they remain patently visible to others in our society for a number of reasons (e.g., race, skin color). A striking example of this occurred in an international adoption workshop in which the facilitator provided a moving rendition of her adoptive family’s successful negotiation of culture. The mother and facilitator offered examples of what she deemed culture keeping, such as learning about the history of India and enrolling her daughter in Indian folk dance classes. After this discussion the facilitator’s daughter (in her late 20s) participated on a panel with three other adult adoptees and completely contradicted her adoptive mother’s narrative. The adopted daughter assessed her experiences as lacking real cultural understanding and her disposition as generally unhappy. She also contradicted her mother’s positive version of the cultural activities in which she was placed and described them as difficult and isolating. Far from feeling accepted, the daughter claimed that the other Indian children in her folk dance class regarded her as White, and therefore, she was socially ostracized from the group. Struck by these contrasting narratives, I observed the mother while her daughter spoke but witnessed no surprise regarding the discrepancies in their narratives and little obvious concern.</p>
<p>Some researchers now claim that adoptive families are more likely to be involved in assisting children to achieve a bicultural orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X11418179">Volkman, 2005</xref>). Recent qualitative and quantitative work, however, suggests that this assumption may be quite limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X11418179">Brian, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192513X11418179">Gailey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X11418179">R. M. Lee, Yun, Yoo, &amp; Nelson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192513X11418179">McGinnis et al., 2009</xref>). The major influences on adoptive parents are other adoptive parents, adoption agencies and professionals, and popular adoption books, all of which reflect the views of members of the dominant culture—hardly a template for developing cultural straddlers. What are the implications of cultural tourism for adopted children? According to some, cultural tourism results in “staged authenticity” or the misrepresentation of culture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0192513X11418179">4</xref></sup> Staged authenticity threatens the development of a healthy identity. The transnational profile can rarely be applied to adopted children who are unlikely to maintain ongoing contact with their communities of origin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0192513X11418179">5</xref></sup> These children are not likely to visit their countries of origin on a regular basis, speak their native tongue, or establish intimate relationships with members of their first country or with members who have migrated from their communities of origin. Consequently, the culture of origin of adopted children remains distant at best, replaced by a set of cultural productions that fail to capture the identity of origin. As Guatemalan and Chinese-born grow older they may recognize affiliation with a cultural group, but this recognition may largely be a function of their racialized experiences in their adopted country and how their otherness is marked. They are not likely to identify with that group or to engage as a committed participant in their community of origin or even a transplanted one. Those who do make the effort to reclaim their past must often navigate a hidden or altogether absent experience alone or with the help of friends rather than family.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X11418179">Emily Noonan (2007)</xref> found that Guatemalan adoption forums provide spaces in which mothers construct identities as American mothers of Guatemala-born children. However, it is not clear that their children will learn to identify themselves as Guatemalan. Recent research finds that college-age Korean Americans who were adopted have lower ethnic identity scores than do their immigrant and U.S.-born Korean counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X11418179">R. M. Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Other reports indicate that transracial adoption presents problems for adoptees as they mature for many of the reasons mentioned here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192513X11418179">McGinnis et al., 2009</xref>). Aside from the racism that many adoptees face in their new countries, it is important to understand how appropriation and market control of cultural representations potentially affect transnational adoptees. The United Nation’s Convention of the Rights of the Child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192513X11418179">1989</xref>) guarantees children the right to preserve their identity. Adoption forums highlight that the mere act of adoption does not automatically or inevitably translate to cultural awareness nor does it guarantee a commitment to the development of children’s cultural identity by adoptive parents. The discursive practices of adoptive parents illustrate how parents get to navigate issues of culture, race, ethnicity, and nation on behalf of their children. The notion of culture keeping masks what are largely practices embedded in cultural tourism in which the cultures of transnationally adopted children are appropriated but not embraced.</p>
<p>Essentially cultural tourism in adoption is directly linked to the neoliberal environment that stimulates it. Much in the way that other aspects of life have been subjected to commodification and consumption, transnational adoption has become part of the migration of goods, services, and people in our new global reality. Multicultural and diversity narratives found in other domains of society have been adapted to the adoption arena. Although our workplaces rely on professional development to engage diversity in a single workshop and our schools address multiculturalism as a month-long superficial acknowledgement of a group’s heritage or race, the adoption of children from a different culture is loaded with complexity. Adoptive parents can hardly be blamed for assuming that the prevailing multicultural template in which diversity and culture are typically dealt with in a single workshop or in a single chapter in popular adoption books is adequate coverage of this complicated territory.</p>
<p>Legal and cultural studies scholars highlight the links between cultural and economic empowerment and show that those who control cultural representations also control identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X11418179">Austin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192513X11418179">Smith &amp; Robinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0192513X11418179">Williams, 2003</xref>). Though racial, ethnic, and sexually oriented communities make attempts to reclaim power and, hence, identity, it is difficult to see how children in the transnational adoption market can resist the forces of commodification.</p>
<p>If we are to take a position that culture matters as a set of material and symbolic resources, then we must develop constructive ways to address it. Currently, transnational adoptive parenting can be likened to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192513X11418179">Waters’s (1990)</xref> “costless community,” one that allows parents to romanticize and selectively engage a cultural experience without advancing their understanding of power, exploitation, and oppression, and their role in these processes. Culture is promoted and understood as something that can be bought at a store or learned in a book instead of nurtured by a community. Parents choose their child, engage in cultural tourism, and therefore shape the contours of their child’s cultural and racial/ethnic identity. It is becoming clearer and clearer that as they develop, transnationally adopted children have lost something that matters.</p>
<p>Clearly, adoption forums do not provide delineated samples of adoptive parents and interpretations of posts fail to capture verbal or physical cues through face-to-face interviews with parents. Despite the large numbers of posts, the actual numbers of participants (who often engage in discussions on topics, posting multiple times) is relatively small. Nevertheless, adoption forums represent social, unbounded, and public spaces for people who seek validation, and we see the Internet’s potential for providing connections and community for adoptive parents. A careful reading of these posts supports recent findings on the ethnic identity development of adoptees and adds to our understanding of the lack of strong cultural identities among adult adoptees as a partial result of the sources of identity construction. Identity constructed online is a consequence of identities held a priori as well as imagined and learned identity via the adoption arena, all of which are forms of cultural tourism. Unfortunately, although cultural identity may be a choice or series of choices for adoptive parents, research and personal narratives tell us that despite their “honorary White” status, adopted children do not have these same choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192513X11418179">Samuels, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192513X11418179">Shiao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192513X11418179">Tuan, 1997</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0192513X11418179">6</xref></sup> For transnational parents to make real cultural connections, they must acknowledge the lives they have, the families they want, and the political and social realities of the cultures and countries from which children are extracted (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192513X11418179">Rothman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0192513X11418179">Yngvesson, 2010</xref>). Perhaps, if we modeled transnational adoption after domestic open adoption, the shallow water of cultural tourism could be deepened. Real, ongoing contact and hybridization of adoptive families could result in something beyond the postracial family, one that reminds us that culture keeping is a child’s right an enriching activity for all involved. It opens the door to mutual cultural appropriation.</p>
