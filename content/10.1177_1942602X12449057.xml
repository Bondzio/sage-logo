<abstract>
<p>A minority of states have legislation concerning non-student-specific epinephrine, or “stock” epinephrine, in schools. Stock epinephrine can be used in anaphylactic emergencies at schools for students who do not have epinephrine auto-injectors on campus. This is a potentially lifesaving measure that should be implemented in schools nationwide.</p>

<p>The well-documented increase in the prevalence of food allergies among children in the United States, with an estimated 8% of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942602X12449057">Gupta et al., 2011</xref>) now affected, has brought additional challenges to school staff and, in particular, school nurses. Two highly publicized cases of fatal anaphylaxis at schools in a span of 13 months have brought heightened attention to school food allergy management and, specifically, to the case for stock epinephrine in schools. Nearly 6 million children have food allergies, and nearly 40% (Gupta et al.) of those children have a history of severe reactions including anaphylaxis, a serious reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Schools must be prepared to handle allergic reactions that require epinephrine, the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. In an effort to protect students, not only those who are at risk for anaphylaxis but those who are potentially at risk due to undiagnosed food allergies, there is a nationwide effort to equip schools with non-student-specific epinephrine, also known as “stock” epinephrine.</p>
<p>The attention to the need for such legislation in recent months can be associated to a community response to the aforementioned fatalities. Neither child had epinephrine at school. Stock epinephrine protocols allow schools to promptly administer lifesaving medication, prescribed by a physician for the school, to students who do not have an epinephrine auto-injector at school. It would also be available in cases in which a prescribed epinephrine auto-injector is used but malfunctions or cases in which a second dose is needed before emergency responders arrive.</p>
<p>Approximately 20 to 25% of epinephrine administrations in schools involve individuals whose allergy was unknown at the time of the reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942602X12449057">McIntyre, Sheetz, Carroll, &amp; Young, 2005</xref>). The School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act was introduced in the U.S. Senate in November 2011, followed by its introduction in the U.S. House of Representatives in December 2011. This legislation encourages states to adopt laws requiring schools to have stock epinephrine auto-injectors so treatment can be promptly administered in an anaphylactic emergency. The bill has received widespread support—it is endorsed by NASN; the American Academy of Pediatrics; the American College of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology; the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology; the American Academy of Emergency Medicine; the National Association of Elementary School Principals; and the Food Allergy Initiative. The Food Allergy &amp; Anaphylaxis Network has been spearheading efforts to pass the bill. On average, it will cost a school just over $100 to purchase two epinephrine auto-injectors annually (with consideration of expiration dates and the need to stock a junior strength in elementary/early childhood schools) to prevent a fatality from anaphylaxis. (Please see the information box at conclusion.)</p>
<p>As of March 2012, this federal bill was still pending. At least seven states already have laws in place that allow for this practice, while at least six other states have legislation pending that makes this practice either mandatory or voluntary. While the language of the legislation is varied among those states with stock epinephrine laws in place, the overall purpose—to allow schools to keep an epinephrine auto-injector on campus—is the same. Usually, stock epinephrine state legislation provides that anyone who administers epinephrine in good faith shall not be liable for civil damages.</p>
<p>In March 2012, the Virginia House of Delegates and Senate passed a stock epinephrine law, to be known as “Amarria’s Law” after 7-year-old Amarria Denise Johnson, who died January 2, 2012, after experiencing an anaphylactic reaction at school. The bill was signed by Gov. Bob McDonnell on April 26, 2012, during a ceremony at Binford Middle School in Richmond.</p>
<p>Implementation of stock epinephrine laws helps ensure that students who experience an anaphylactic reaction at schools receive medical treatment immediately, which is key in such reactions. Studies of fatal food-induced anaphylaxis cases have shown that a delay in treatment was a critical factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942602X12449057">Bock, Muñoz-Furlong, &amp; Sampson, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942602X12449057">Sicherer and Simons (2007)</xref> noted that while those who must evaluate symptoms to decide whether to use epinephrine may be anxious to do so, they should always be instructed to administer the medication instead of taking the risk of waiting too long. Antihistamines and asthma medication cannot reverse the symptoms of anaphylaxis.</p>
<p>Hesitation to use epinephrine can be attributed to erroneously thinking a reaction is mild or to being overly concerned about harmful effects of epinephrine. Epinephrine’s side effects, such as anxiety and palpitations, are not harmful for the average, healthy child.</p>
<p>An epinephrine auto-injector is relatively simple to use—children as young as 8 are able to learn how to self-administer their own epinephrine auto-injectors. The devices are accompanied by an auto-injector trainer that can be used to instruct an entire school staff on proper usage. Additionally, manufacturers of the devices have educational materials that can be viewed online or even downloaded as an app to a mobile device.</p>
<p>Food allergy management in schools has evolved in recent years. With the passage of the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Management Act (FAAMA), signed by President Obama in January 2011, it is expected that more schools and school districts will implement comprehensive plans to keep students with food allergies safe. FAAMA requires the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop and make available a voluntary policy to manage the risk of food allergy and anaphylaxis in schools. These federal guidelines, expected to be released in the late Spring of 2012, are likely to include support for stock epinephrine in schools. While there are few studies focusing on allergic reactions in schools, the available data show that more than 15% of school-age children with food allergies have had a reaction in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1942602X12449057">Nowak-Wegrzyn, Conover-Walker, &amp; Wood, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942602X12449057">Sicherer, Furlong, DeSimone, &amp; Sampson, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Snapshots From Other States</title>
<p>In their study evaluating the incidence of anaphylaxis in Massachusetts schools, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942602X12449057">McIntyre et al. (2005)</xref> reported that 19% of the cases in which epinephrine was administered were reactions that occurred outside the school building (e.g., the playground, traveling to and from school, or field trips). In 24% of the cases, the life-threatening allergy was not known to school staff. The authors concluded that while anaphylactic reactions are not frequent in schools, they are not uncommon events either.</p>
<p>School nurses currently play a vital role in the management of a student’s food allergy at school. In addition, school staff such as teachers, food service employees, bus drivers, and other staff in contact with the student should also be made aware of students with known allergies and be informed and trained on emergency situations. As stock epinephrine laws go into effect, school nurses will play a critical implementation role. It will become crucial to have school nurse involvement in training others to use the stock epinephrine devices and school nurse management of stock epinephrine in the school building.</p>
<p>The state of Nebraska was at the forefront of addressing anaphylaxis and asthma issues. The state required every school to adopt an emergency-response protocol for anaphylaxis and asthma that includes the administration of lifesaving medication. In addition, every school was required to have an emergency response program in place by the end of the 2003-2004 school year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942602X12449057">Murphy et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Before this program was implemented statewide, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942602X12449057">Murphy et al. (2006)</xref> evaluated the protocol in 78 schools in Omaha from 1998 to 2003. School nurses recorded data each time the protocol was used, noting whether the student had an asthma action plan, a metered-dose inhaler, or neither. In cases where students experienced anaphylaxis, the school nurses recorded whether the student had epinephrine available at the school. None of the students in the five recorded anaphylaxis cases had epinephrine at school. Approximately 36% of the students treated with epinephrine, albuterol, or a combination of both did not have action plans or inhalers at school. Researchers in Nebraska (Murphy et al.) noted that the implementation of this protocol has resulted in increased awareness of the prevention and treatment of anaphylaxis among school staff and teachers.</p>
<p>In California, where school districts already are allowed to stock emergency epinephrine, it appears that the majority of schools do not have this lifesaving medication available for students other than those who have a prescription. In their study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942602X12449057">Morris, Baker, Belot, and Edwards (2011)</xref> surveyed California school nurses to learn more about school preparedness for anaphylaxis. Just 13% of nurses who responded to the survey said their school had stock epinephrine. Interestingly, 30% said they had used one student’s prescribed medication on another student in need of treatment. Among the reasons listed for not having stock epinephrine were lack of guidelines, limited availability of school nurses, lack of funding for training and medication, and lack of education (Morris et al.). The California Department of Education has posted comprehensive training standards to assist in safe implementation available at the following website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/he/hn/epiadmin.asp">http://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/he/hn/epiadmin.asp</ext-link>.</p>
<p>In Illinois, where a stock epinephrine bill was recently enacted, schools are in the implementation phase. A limitation of the law is that it simply allows rather than mandates schools to have stock epinephrine. Virginia’s law has a different twist. It requires local school boards to adopt and implement policies for the possession and administration of epinephrine in every school and allows the school nurse or other school employees to administer the medication to any student believed to be having an anaphylactic reaction.</p>
<p>In Ontario, Canada, Sabrina’s Law requires school boards to establish anaphylaxis policies that provide for annual anaphylaxis training for school staff and permits the use of epinephrine for students whose allergy was unknown. The law is named in honor of Sabrina Shannon, who died of an anaphylactic reaction that occurred during her first year of high school in 2003. In their study comparing anaphylaxis management in schools with and without food allergy management legislation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942602X12449057">Cicutto et al. (2012)</xref> found that school personnel in districts where anaphylaxis management is legislated had better epinephrine auto-injector technique. But they also found that school policies in regions that had anaphylaxis legislation in place were lacking in the areas of allowing epinephrine administration to individuals without prior consent and granting legal immunity in cases of good faith.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Epinephrine can be used not only for a student who is experiencing food-induced anaphylaxis but for students who are allergic to insect stings. It is the only medication that can reverse the symptoms of anaphylaxis, which can progress quickly. Seconds count when it comes to treating anaphylaxis, and schools nationwide should be equipped with epinephrine auto-injectors that can immediately be used to treat a student while waiting for emergency responders. Disparities across the nation are the impetus for the federal legislation. The School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act, if enacted, will encourage all states to create or revise their laws on administration of epinephrine to include provisions as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1942602X12449057" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Requiring public elementary and secondary schools to maintain a supply of epinephrine that has been prescribed by a licensed physician;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Permitting school personnel trained in the appropriate use of epinephrine to administer to a student for the treatment of anaphylaxis; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Ensuring school employees are not liable for negligence in administering epinephrine to any student believed to be having an anaphylactic reaction.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Stock epinephrine laws nationwide will enable school nurses to treat anaphylactic emergencies promptly, and could potentially save lives. ■</p>
