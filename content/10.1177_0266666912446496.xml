<abstract>
<p>The agricultural and food industries are excited by and looking forward to employing Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) as they see it as a viable means of promoting their markets. Based on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework, this study investigates how the technological and ambient environments of media characteristics influence viewer cognitive and emotional states, and how experiences subsequently affect their responses. This study examines whether the effects of media attributes and motivations affect viewer cognitive necessity and usefulness with respect to adopting specific media. The results of our survey of 254 observations collected indicate that interactivity has a significant positive impact on flow, relaxation, and enjoyment. Ease of use is significantly associated with flow, relaxation, and enjoyment. Senses of both professionalism and familiarity are found to significantly influence viewer cognitive and emotional states. This study finds that the gathering of agricultural information moderates the relationship between the three factors of cognitive and emotional states and behavioral intention to adopt IPTV such that the relationships are stronger for those factors that are related to a stronger sense of information gathering. The results should enable agricultural and food related business owners to obtain insight into using interactivity effectively to propel their businesses forward.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>New digital media forms have created and broadened new business opportunities. Among these new forms, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) has garnered a great deal of attention. With the rapid development of communication technologies, media markets have undergone a great amount of transformation and have witnessed stiffer and greater competition among all forms of media outlets. In accordance with technical developments as well as media expansion, however, a variety of media forms have fiercely competed with each other to the extent that user selection had become paramount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266666912446496">Lim 2007</xref>). Various digital media forms, including Internet, satellite broadcasting and mobile phone services, are now competing with traditional media forms such as terrestrial television, radio and newspapers for audience time and attention, which are obviously limited resources. The digital environment in the 21st century has unexpectedly ushered us into a multimedia era, and the convergence of broadcasting and telecommunication has changed the characteristics of media itself. Several characteristics which define the broadcasting environment in this digital era are as follows: multimedia, multi-channels, interactive services for mass media, changes in broadcasting concepts and consumer media usage behavior, and a consumer-centric marketing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266666912446496">Kim 2003</xref>). Media convergence and the above mentioned changes in media characteristics are reflected in the advent of IPTV. However, there have also been challenges with respect to the adoption of IPTV. In particular, little is known about the factors that determine IPTV adoption. This gap is the prime motivator of this research.</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations and to improve the explanatory value of media adoption, this study develops a research model to investigate innovation adoption with regard to IPTV. This model is grounded upon the Stimulus–Organism–Response (S-O-R) framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266666912446496">Bitner 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266666912446496">Williams and Dargel 2004</xref>). The goal of this paper is to fully capture and understand the impact of the two key dimensions of media characteristics (i.e. technological and ambient conditions) on viewers’ cognitive and emotional states and subsequent IPTV adoption behaviors. The S-O-R framework suggests that environmental stimuli influence the organismic experiences of viewers (i.e. an organism’s cognitive and emotional states such as flow, relaxation, and enjoyment), and subsequently affect response (behavioral intention to adopt media). This study examines the technological features and ambient conditions of media characteristics as environmental stimuli in our S-O-R framework. Two aspects of the technological characteristics (interactivity, and ease of use) and three aspects of ambient conditions (professionalism, familiarity, and expense) are examined to comprehend how these environmental stimuli influence the cognitive and emotional states of viewers and their intention to adopt media.</p>
<p>By addressing these research questions, this paper expands upon innovation adoption literature by exploring the behavioral intention to adopt IPTV. This extends the prior research on IPTV by providing the conceptual foundation for studying the social and economic behaviors of adopters. This study also extends the literature on media adopting behavior by examining how the relationship between the three factors of the cognitive and emotional states of organisms and behavioral intention to adopt media are moderated by information gathering, such that the relationships are stronger for those factors that have a stronger sense of information gathering. Finally, this paper also offers insight to IPTV providers by endeavoring to create a clearer understanding of the dynamics of IPTV adoption, thereby allowing IPTV and enhanced interactivity to be applied to business settings more effectively. </p>
<p>The rest of the paper is structured as follows: the second section presents the theoretical background, perspectives on IPTV, and the research hypotheses of the paper. The third section details the methodology, and the fourth describes the results of the study. The final section concludes with a discussion of the study’s contributions and limitations, and also provides suggestions for future research. </p>

<title>Theory and hypotheses development</title>
<p>The foundation of our theoretical framework is built on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266666912446496">Bitner 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266666912446496">Williams and Dargel 2004</xref>). This framework offers a structured view of the factors which influence the behavioral intention of media adoption. According to this framework, various aspects of the environment, such as ambient conditions, symbols, artifacts, architecture, and spatial arrangements can act as stimuli that cause changes to the internal or organismic experiences of people who adopt IPTV. These experiences, in turn, shape their behavioral responses to the stimuli. In our context, this study focuses on two broad categories of environmental stimuli to cover media characteristics (e.g. technological and ambient features of IPTV). These categories may influence the organism of viewers (an organism’s cognitive and emotional states such as flow, relaxation, and enjoyment, which lead to positive viewer responses (e.g. the intention to adopt IPTV)). Therefore, this study includes cognitive and emotional states of an organism as mediators since the S-O-R framework suggests that the effects of the technological and spatial environmental stimuli on a participant’s intention to purchase would be mediated through organismic experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266666912446496">Animesh et al. 2011</xref>). Numerous studies have applied this framework for their empirical investigations, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266666912446496">Animesh et al. (2011</xref>). This study focuses primarily on three types of virtual experiences, namely flow, relaxation, and enjoyment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266666912446496">Hoffman and Novak 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666912446496">Koufaris 2002</xref>). These three variables are likely to be influenced by the ambient conditions and technological environmental stimuli included in the model and tend to influence the social and emotional motives of media adoption. Furthermore, in order to make the study contextually relevant with IPTV for agricultural information, this study introduces ‘information gathering’ as a moderator to the S-O-R framework. Thus, this study further argues that agricultural information gathering moderates the extent to which cognitive and emotional states of an organism can determine adoption behavior (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266666912446496">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Perspectives on IPTV</title>
<p>IPTV is a system in which a digital television service is delivered via Internet Protocol over a network infrastructure, which may include delivery by a broadband connection. With IPTV, it is also possible to use multicast technology, which enables the transmission of a digital signal to the terminals of several clients simultaneously. For residential users, IPTV is often provided in conjunction with Video on Demand and may be bundled with Internet services such as Web access and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Commercially, IPTV, VoIP, Internet access services, and even mobile phone services can be offered by one service provider as “bundled services.” These phenomena have emerged as a direct result of the substantial convergence of media technologies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266666912446496">Figure 1</xref> shows the outline of IPTV service flow.</p>
<p>First, content produced by the content provider is digitized and then sent to a service provider. A service provider is then able to deliver the digital signal to a network provider. In South Korea, for example, a single company often functions as both a service and network provider simultaneously. Then the network provider distributes the digital signal to be decoded by each viewer.</p>
<p>An IPTV Global Forecast published by MRG (2009) projected that global IPTV subscribers would grow from 28 million in 2009 to 83 million in 2013, a compound annual growth rate of 31%. For Korea in particular, recent forecasts of IPTV growth are fairly encouraging. It is projected that by 2017, the number of IPTV subscribers will increase to more than 10.4 million (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0266666912446496">Figure 2</xref>). </p>

<p>In a competitive media environment, understanding the characteristics of IPTV and the motivations for using it are necessary to better understand the prospects and possibilities of using IPTV. IPTV has gained appeal because of its core characteristics, “access to internet and interactivity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266666912446496">Kang and Lee 2006</xref>). Precisely, the different characteristics and use-motivation of IPTV from other media outlets will most likely be important factors, which have an effect on the necessity and usefulness of IPTV. Therefore, this study empirically examines how IPTV’s characteristics and user motivations affect both cognitive necessity and usefulness, respectively, towards its adoption.</p>

<title>Media characteristics: technological environment</title>
<p>Each time a new form of media appears, a study examining the characteristics of this new form is necessary because the new form of media has adapted new technologies and has different traits from the older and already established media forms. Different traits of new media forms may determine whether or not that form can and will be received by a specific consumer segment. If the new media form is received, its characteristics will then decide how the new media form is used. Therefore, studying the characteristics of new media forms can be important work in estimating the potential of a form to come into regular operation and if that form will be used for the long term. Usually, new media forms are subjected to remediation of old media forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666912446496">Bolter and Grusin 1999</xref>). Thus, many studies examine the characteristics of new media forms in comparison with the old ones.</p>
<p>A research study has previously been conducted to examine media traits and the usability of Internet and television to understand the media using patterns of audiences. The results of this study showed that users are more motivated to use television rather than Internet due to its reality and usability. While audiences considered television as a more familiar media form, they regarded Internet as an interactive and informative media form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266666912446496">Park and Oh 2001</xref>). Subsequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666912446496">Park (2003</xref>) researched the media characteristics of cellular phone services, Internet and television in Korea. The results showed that media audiences regarded Internet as an unfamiliar, technical-oriented but active, informative medium with incredible information sources, while television was considered a passive, non-personal, familiar and convenient one-way medium with credible information sources. Cellular phone services were considered as an interactive, private and individual medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666912446496">Park 2003</xref>). Next, in a study on advertising media, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266666912446496">Chon, Park and Lee (2007</xref>) researched the characteristics of Internet media, newspapers and terrestrial broadcasters. They concluded that Internet media had strengths in creativity and timeliness. Newspapers had advantages in timeliness and reach, and terrestrial broadcasters had strengths in reach and advertising exposure effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266666912446496">Chon et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The technological features of media can enhance or inhibit viewers’ interactions with programs and thus influence their experiences. The extent to which users can interact with media programs (IPTV) and take part in gathering information or content in a mediated environment in real time has been referred to as the interactivity of the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266666912446496">Steuer 1992</xref>). In the context of e-commerce, interaction and real time service distribution have helped firms understand their consumers’ needs better and faster, and thereby cultivated an environment suitable for customization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266666912446496">Coupey 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266666912446496">Lee et al. 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>A high level of interactivity in media programs creates a sense of autonomy and control in the viewer’s mind, which can instill and reinforce a sense of relaxation and enjoyment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266666912446496">Jiang and Benbasat 2007</xref>). This attractive involvement in media program interactions and explorations leads to a loss of self-consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266666912446496">Coyle and Thorson 2001</xref>). As a result, such environments make the program experience playful and increase the sense of flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266666912446496">Hoffman and Novak 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266666912446496">Novak et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266666912446496">Webster et al. 1993</xref>). Therefore, this study posits that:</p>

<bold>H1a:</bold> Perceived interactivity is positively related to flow, relaxation, and enjoyment</p>

<title>Media characteristics: ambient conditions</title>
<p>It is important to study not only the characteristics of a new media form but also the motivations to use that new media form. This is because user motivations are closely connected to the characteristics of the form of media. When specific motivations correspond to particular characteristics of that form of media, insight is gained with respect to understanding which characteristics of that media form are the most appealing. Consequently, studies of motivations to use a particular form of media have to be carried out taking the characteristics of media into consideration. </p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666912446496">Park (2003</xref>) looked at the user motivations linked to Internet, television and cellular phone services. He concluded that motivations to use the Internet ranked higher than the other two media forms in terms of “stimulate and sexuality.” While television had the highest use motive, cellular phone services had the lowest use motive among the three media types. This result means that up until now, media users in Korea have regarded their cellular phone services as not just for communication. The reason why the Internet has been partially positioned as one of the popular forms of mass media with the means to replace television in Korea is that the Internet possesses interactivity, individuality and activity. Secondly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266666912446496">Song (1999</xref>) found that there were six factors of positive gratification patterns and six factors of negative gratification patterns. Finally, using multivariate factor analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266666912446496">Korgaonkar and Wolin (1999</xref>) suggested the presence of seven motivations regarding Web usage. The factors were as follows: 1) social escapism motivation, 2) transaction-based security and privacy concerns, 3) information motivation, 4) interactive control motivation, 5) socialization motivation, 6) non-transactional privacy concerns, and 7) economic motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266666912446496">Korgaonkar and Wolin 1999</xref>). Keeping this previous research in mind, this study posits the following hypotheses.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>H2a:</bold> A perceived sense of professionalism is positively related to flow, relaxation, and enjoyment</p>
</list-item>

<title>Cognitive and emotional state and behavioral intention of IPTV</title>
<p>As stated above, IPTV is a digital television service using Internet Protocol. To grasp the characteristics of and motivations to use IPTV, it is appropriate to utilize the existing research for television and the Internet at the same time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266666912446496">Kang and Lee (2006</xref>) have aimed to identify the actual demand of consumers for IPTV. First, they attempted to define an IPTV prototype, and they then explored the predictors that affected potential consumers in adopting IPTV from amongst competing media forms like television and the Internet. The results of their research showed five primary motives for adopting the IPTV prototype: interactive communication, diversity, convenience, risk aversion and multitasking. They asserted that these motivations were significant predictors of the use of the Internet and the use of IPTV in the near future. Their study also found that IPTV was functionally similar to existing television services and might replace these services in the future. The study empirically supported the functional similarity principle using two concepts of perceived functional similarity and media substitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266666912446496">Kang and Lee 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Acceptance of a new idea usually means that an individual has considered the subject in terms of necessity and usefulness. Perceived usefulness means the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266666912446496">Davis 1989</xref>). In this study, the concept of usefulness is used for capturing the perception of customers with respect to IPTV and their evaluation of its use for personal purposes. “Necessity is the mother of invention.” That means the necessity of a thing leads to that thing’s invention, and by extension of this logic, that thing is then accepted and used by those who needed it. As a proxy of motivation for a certain action, the concept of necessity is considered as a precedent variable of acceptance.</p>
<p>In the case of online gaming environments, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266666912446496">Yee (2006</xref>) has shown that the level of enjoyment obtained in such graphical environments affects the participant’s emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266666912446496">Yee 2006</xref>). As a result, a participant’s sense of flow will cause a greater desire for the participant to enhance his or her identity through buying virtual possessions. In our context, although necessity and usefulness can be regarded as preliminary measurements for the acceptance of new technology, sense of flow, relaxation, and enjoyment also enhance viewer intention to stay with the programs. This study applies these concepts to measure consumers’ actions of acceptance. In particular, in the case of media content, consumers’ decisions on acceptance can be identified from their consideration of the necessity and usefulness of content that is related to flow, relaxation, and enjoyment. Consequently, this study posits the following hypotheses.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>H3:</bold> Perceived sense of flow, relaxation, and enjoyment are positively related to the behavioral intention to adopt </p>

<title>The moderating effects of information gathering</title>
<p>Media attributes determine the selection of media. Users search to find appropriate media in order to satisfy their own demands. In this process of searching, the consideration of media form attributes plays a leading role in selecting media. In this process, a user’s understanding of the form of media rather than technical specifications from experts is more likely to impact the user’s selection.</p>
<p>In the case of agricultural information, consumers feel more of a necessity when certain attributes of that media form will meet the consumers’ wants. The necessity of using a particular form of media comes from that media form’s attributes which the user believes the media form possesses.</p>
<p>Regarding the attributes of media forms, several studies identified interactivity as one of the critical aspects in relation to digital media. Users can respond to information from digital media; they can ask questions, write their opinions, and order and search for information. From the perspective of information searching, a belief that a particular form of media is able to deliver professional information leads to a personal belief in the validity of the information transmitted by the media source. Traditional information systems (IS) literature tells us that familiarity and ease of use are the basis of adoption for information systems. This relationship can be applied to media adoption. Digital media is influenced by another factor: it can be personalized for each customer. This form of media can be manipulated to record the viewing habits and adjust to each customer’s individual particularities. Lastly, the economic factor is, of course, one of the fundamental issues in selecting media forms. The underlying logic is that customers make their own decisions based on their individual economic perspectives. With these factors in mind, this study posits the following hypothesis.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>H4:</bold> The relationship between the three factors of cognitive and emotional states of an organism and behavioral intention to adopt are moderated by information gathering, such that the relationships are stronger for those factors that are more strongly correlated with a sense of information gathering.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study used a survey method to test the developed model. All measures for constructs were developed through the successive stages of literature review, theoretical modeling, and refinement. This study assessed the research model using partial least squares (PLS) with PLS-Graph version 3.00. The item product terms approach of PLS, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266666912446496">Chin et al. (2003</xref>), was used to test the moderating effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266666912446496">Chin et al. 2003</xref>). Furthermore, post-hoc analysis was performed using multiple linear regressions to test the two models. For some variables, such as <italic>professionalism</italic>, <italic>ease of use</italic>, and so on, data were coded reversely due to the appropriate expressions of the Korean language. Among selecting methods of independent variables of regression analysis, the enter method was applied. All items solicited responses on a five-point Likert scale with 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, and 5 = strongly agree.</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The Media &amp; Future Institute conducted a survey of people interested in information systems for agriculture and fisheries to evaluate attribution and motivation and to understand the usefulness and necessity of a media channel about agriculture and fisheries according to the media platform. The Media &amp; Future Institute sent out emails to ask for participation in a survey to 3,000 individuals organized by the Agriculture Forestry Fisheries Information Service. The online survey included both email responses and website participation that encouraged 457 respondents who agreed to participate in the survey. The email which asked for cooperation was sent on September 24th and October 2nd 2008, and the survey was performed from September 25th to October 5th 2008.</p>
<p>The survey questionnaire was distributed to members of a website which is related to agricultural information from October 2008 for two weeks. After emailing the site members, participants were encouraged to log onto a web based survey site and answer the questions. Among the 457 responses, 254 observations were from users who had experience and were knowledgeable with IPTV, and these respondents were then used as the survey sample to test the research models in this study. IPTV service in South Korea is still in its infancy. However, pre-IPTV services which provide video-on-demand (VOD) had already been launched in July 2006. As of December 2008, the number of IPTV subscribers was around 1.6 million.</p>

Sense of professionalism had a strong impact on flow (path coefficient = 0.224, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.01), relaxation (path coefficient = 0.257, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.01), and enjoyment (path coefficient = 0.269, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.01) supporting H2a (1-3), and familiarity had an impact on flow (path coefficient = 0.161, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05), relaxation (path coefficient = 0.214, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.01), supporting H2a (1-2), but enjoyment (path coefficient = 0.094) was not significant, and hence did not support H2a (3). Finally, the hypothesis suggesting the relationship between expense to flow (path coefficient = 0.010), relaxation (path coefficient = 0.041), and enjoyment (path coefficient = −0.074) (i.e., H2b (1-3)) was not supported.</p>

<p>Overall, 17.7 percent (0.177) of the variance in flow, 28.5 percent (0.285) of the variance in relaxation, and 18.4 percent (0.184) of the variance in enjoyment were explained by the antecedent (exogenous) variables.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results suggest that media characteristics including the environmental features of both technological and ambient conditions influence the cognitive and emotional state of viewers in media programs, which in turn influence the intention to adopt IPTV. More specifically, regarding technological factors, this study found that interactivity has a significant positive impact on flow, relaxation, and enjoyment. Furthermore, ease of use has a strong effect on flow, relaxation, and enjoyment. As for the ambient conditions factors, both professionalism and familiarity are found to significantly influence flow, relaxation, and enjoyment. The results are consistent with the findings of previous studies, particularly those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266666912446496">Tsai and Tang (2012</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666912446496">Jang and Noh (2011</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266666912446496">Animesh et al. (2011</xref>). They found that interactivity impacts on RFID adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266666912446496">Tsai and Tang 2012</xref>), IPTV service quality, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment effect on customer acceptance of ITPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666912446496">Jang and Noh 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266666912446496">Shin and Hwang 2011</xref>), and that the interaction positively impacts on the intention to purchase virtual products mediating through flow respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266666912446496">Animesh et al. 2011</xref>). This study extends the literature by introducing cognitive media attributes and motivation to IPTV Adoption. However, expense was not significantly related to flow, relaxation, and enjoyment.</p>
<p>Our most anticipated hypothesized moderating effects of information gathering are found to be significant for the relationship between cognitive and emotional state and the behavioral intention to adopt. The results are consistent with the findings of previous studies, particularly of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266666912446496">Lu et al. (2010</xref>) where they found that intention to get information affects purchase intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266666912446496">Lu et al. 2010</xref>). This study extends the literature in the context of IPTV adoption by introducing information gathering as a moderator. Furthermore, to gain insights into this moderating effect, this study performed a post-hoc analysis by developing two different models as explained below based on the sample data collected.</p>
<sec id="section14-0266666912446496">
<title>Post-hoc analysis</title>
<p>In our post-hoc analysis, the research question raised here is what kind of attributes and motivational factors IPTV possesses that have an impact on the cognitive decision making process of users with respect to the necessity and usefulness of IPTV. To answer these questions, this study has developed two theoretical models which are based on traditional media studies. Previous literature has indicated that media attributes and motivation factors affect media adoption. Differences in media attributes and motivation lead to the adoption of different kinds of media. As an IPTV service provider, it is crucial to know what factors, that is, what attributes and motivation factors, the potential users want to have from IPTV services. Based on this research, this study investigates the types of attributes and motivation factors that play a role in influencing the adoption of IPTV. Here, this study approaches the matter in two discrete ways. One is to explain how users form a perception of necessity in relation to IPTV, and the other is to show how they form a perception of usefulness in relation to IPTV. Two different models are proposed: an Attributes Model (Model 1) and a Motivation Model (Model 2). </p>

</fig>
<p>In the Attributes Model (Model 1), in sum, the model proposes a hypothesis regarding the relationship between media attributes and user feelings of necessity. This hypothesis has six sub-hypotheses which test six different attributes of this particular form of media.</p>
<sec id="section15-0266666912446496">
<title>Post-hoc-Hypothesis 1</title>
<p>Cognitive media attributes (interactive, professionalism, familiarity, ease of use, personalization, and expense) of IPTV have an impact on feelings of necessity in relation to the IPTV channel for the agricultural program. (Attributes-Necessity Model: Model 1)</p>
<p>In the Motivation Model (Model 2), motivation factors of media form adoption determine the usefulness of the media. Motivation factors to adopt the form of media are related to the evaluation of how useful that form is from the perspective of the users. In other words, motivational factors are the reasons users adopt the media form. Thus, as an IPTV service provider, it is important to know what kinds of motivational factors lead IPTV users to adopt the service. From the perspective of agricultural information, the IPTV service providers should know what kinds of characteristics of information would make the incumbent users adopt an IPTV agricultural channel. This could be a starting point from which to prepare the IPTV agricultural channel for the service provider.</p>
<p>Literature on the motivational factors of media showed a variety of user purposes and the effects of user adoption of the media form. One of these factors is that users want to be relaxed while watching TV. The IPTV agricultural channel should also include this kind of benefit to the users. Another aspect of traditional media for users is that television programs provide users with entertainment. Only enjoyable channels can capture the attention of viewers. When traditional television moves to digitalized media, such as IPTV, television programs and media content can provide viewers with richer information than the previous standard. Information gathering becomes one of the major motivation factors when selecting IPTV. Demand to have the subject be able to communicate could be a basic purpose for the broadcasting media’s existence. Knowing commonly shared information allows the viewer to become a leader in a group and feel more comfortable in participating in discussion. This study, based on previous media literature, proposes a hypothesis that there is a relationship between motivational factors and the perceptions of usefulness for users of the IPTV channel. This hypothesis has four sub-hypotheses which test four different motivational factors of media selection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0266666912446496">
<title>Post-hoc-Hypothesis 2</title>
<p>Motivation factors (relaxing, enjoyable, information gathering, and topics to chat about) of IPTV have an impact on the feelings of usefulness in relation to the IPTV channel for an agricultural program. (Motivation-Usefulness Model: Model 2).</p>
<p>Prior to regression analysis, a correlation analysis was run to verify the discriminant validity among the variables. Each model was tested with a separate regression analysis. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0266666912446496">Table 5</xref> shows the results of the correlation analysis on the variables of the media attributes. The results verify that there is no high correlation among the variables of the media attributes. Thus, it is proven that the attributes variables relating to IPTV have discriminant validity. As a result, these variables can be used for the following statistical analysis.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study developed and tested a research model of innovation adoption with regard to IPTV based on an S-O-R framework. This study attempted to fully capture and understand the impact of the two key dimensions of media characteristics (e.g. technological and ambient conditions) on viewers’ cognitive and emotional states and subsequent IPTV adoption behaviors. Furthermore, this study discovered through post-hoc analysis that the media attributes have an influence the cognitive necessity of IPTV viewers and the motivational factors have an effects on the cognitive usefulness of IPTV as well as viewers of IPTV. The results of the Attributes-necessity Model reflect the new attributes of digital media and show that they are consistent with the traditional media literature as well. It is shown that the evaluation of necessity by viewers depends on the service’s price, and it was found that interactivity, which is a major difference between digital media and traditional analog media. The Motivation-usefulness Model showed consistent results with traditional media literature. From the results, it can be estimated that IPTV viewers want to relax and enjoy IPTV programs. When IPTV provides those kinds of programs, viewers feel IPTV is more useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266666912446496">Media &amp; Future Institute 2011</xref>). From the results of this study, we can infer that there are expectations regarding IPTV that are based both on the anticipation of new attributes as well as the desire for more traditional media attributes. Also, by utilizing these results, IPTV service providers can obtain insight on effective future programs and the proper application of these programs.</p>
<sec id="section18-0266666912446496">
<title>Contributions to research and practice</title>
<p>This study makes several contributions to the field. First, this study has extended the literature on the behavioral intention to adopt IPTV which has focused primarily on individual drivers of intention to adopt IPTV and media characteristics that stimulate adopting behavior by studying how contextual factors influence the intention to adopt through mediating factors related to cognitive and emotional states.</p>
<p>Second, recognizing the need to investigate media characteristics related to technological and non-technological aspects of viewer experiences with programs, this study employs the S-O-R framework to investigate how the technological characteristics (i.e. interactivity and ease of use) and the ambient conditions (i.e. professionalism, familiarity, and expense) of this form of media are able to impact cognitive and emotional states, and subsequently, the intention to adopt IPTV. This extends the prior research on IPTV which was mainly focused on the engineering and technological aspects of media characteristics, and it also provides the conceptual foundation for studying the social and economic behaviors of adopters.</p>
<p>The paper also contributes to practice. Most IPTV businesses are still in the exploration phase and are struggling to understand the dynamics of IPTV adoption and implications for their businesses. This study offers insights to providers who are considering exploring IPTV services. Our results suggest that although IPTV providers are better prepared than traditional entertainment providers because IPTV is better able to offer components and interactivity, it requires more emphasis on interactivity, in particular.</p>
<p>Finally, as our results indicate that both information gathering and the three cognitive and emotional state factors are related to the behavioral intention to adopt, IPTV providers would be wise to consider their joint impact. This significant moderating effect of information gathering points to the need to develop a mosaic of agricultural related knowledge in the IPTV program, which can be achieved through the development of its content. Building information systems in rural communities is closely connected with the financial well-being and the quality of life of the people who live in those areas. This is because it is important for businesses related to agricultural and fishery industries to be able to find information pertaining to the cultivation of agricultural, fishery and forestry resources. However, there is not yet enough of the types of information systems needed to provide the kinds of adequate and reliable information needed for those rural communities. Though some people use the Internet to get the information that they need, a number of people cannot truly put the Internet to good use on account of certain characteristics of the Internet – for instance, complicated interfaces, maintenance issues and technical knowhow. Therefore, the Internet usually has limitations for usage in the agricultural, fishery and forestry industries in terms of information gathering since most of the people in those fields generally have little technological experience. On the other hand, IPTV is essentially a television device, one of the most intimate media forms, and is expected to deliver essential information for rural communities effectively and efficiently.</p>

<sec id="section19-0266666912446496">
<title>Limitations and future research</title>
<p>Turning to the limitations of our analysis, this study collected self-reported data, which raises the issue of common method bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266666912446496">Podsakoff et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266666912446496">Podsakoff and Organ 1986</xref>). Furthermore, this study investigated the measurements of conceptual cognition which did not come from constructs, but from individual indicators, which could produce measurement errors. The online survey had validity because early adopters are more likely to participate in an online survey at the time of the launching of IPTV. However, it needs to be expanded further to the majority of users who are still not familiar with online surveys. Finally, our study utilized a cross-sectional survey design. While this design is suitable to address the questions that this study was interested in, a longitudinal research study on IPTV adoption could generate insights into how different technological and non-technological factors change and interact over time, as well as the effect of these changes on IPTV adoption. Hence, future studies that adopt a different sampling strategy will be useful to validate our findings.</p>
