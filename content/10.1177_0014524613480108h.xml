<p>Vigen Guroian’s book <italic>The Melody of Faith: Theology in an Orthodox Key</italic> is an outstanding addition to the already existent genre of texts on Orthodox theology. Guroian’s book stands apart from the rest inasmuch has it views Orthodox theology through the lens of a musical symphony, seeing theology as a musical score with the Bible, the Fathers, icons, and liturgy each offering their own particular contribution. Furthermore, Guroian’s own voice of interpretation and reflection shines through as he offers personal anecdotes to explore the practical implication of the theological realities more deeply.</p>
<p>After a brief preface where Guroian outlines his symphonic methodology and a brief defence of it based on Scripture and the Fathers, the author explores core tenets of Orthodox theology. The book contains six chapters discussing creation, eschatology, the incarnation, Mariology, the atonement, and the resurrection. Throughout the book major Orthodox themes arise such as viewing the atonement in light of the incarnation, seeing the crucifixion in light of the resurrection, and understanding Mary’s role as redemptive. Particularly interesting is the discussion of the incarnation and therefore the fall and sin through a therapeutic as opposed to forensic lens. This is a theme underlying much of Orthodox theology that does not often come to the surface.</p>
<p>The book provides a fresh look at traditional Orthodox themes by means of the musical theme as well as Guroian’s Armenian Orthodox tradition. Herein, the Armenian liturgy is referenced often. Though the book is clearly reliant upon the classical church Fathers, it becomes clear throughout that Guroian relies upon the later developments of Byzantine theology, particularly iconographic and liturgical, significantly more heavily than classic patristic sources such as Athanasius and Cyril of Alexandria. Elements of the discussion, such as the strong emphasis on the incarnation as therapeutic and the vicarious and sanctifying role of the Virgin Mary might be significantly less were these Fathers to have played a stronger role.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a great book and a very welcome contribution to the genre. It is well worth a read and will no doubt benefit students of theology in the years to come.</p>
