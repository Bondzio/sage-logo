<p>This book examines the issue of long-term sick absence (LTSA) in Scandinavian countries, involving scholars from the Scandinavian research group on “Social factors contributing to sickness absence.” Long-term sickness absence is defined differently across Scandinavian countries. In Sweden and Norway it is defined as having been certified as sick for more than 28 days in a row during the past year. Other countries specify more or fewer days. LTSA is an issue of concern because there was a dramatic rise of sickness absence from work between the late 1990s and the mid-2000s, more than doubling in this time period.</p>
<p>The approach of this book is multidisciplinary, not proposing a single approach to studying the phenomenon. Rather this is an attempt to provide a framework for understanding it by showing how sickness is influenced by social mechanisms and contextual factors. Thus, a range of theoretical and analytical approaches are employed. The book is divided into two parts—theoretical and empirical. The theoretical chapters examine the meanings and relationships of the triad: illness, disease, and sickness. The distinctions between these three concepts are basic to the investigation of LTSA. Two of the issues addressed in the theory chapters are (1) the social construction of sickness absence, and (2) the relationship between psycho-social environments and sickness. Sickness is a social identity, where others acknowledge the individual’s health problems in reference to his or her social activity, and the social situation generates certain rights and duties for the sick person (i.e., Parsons’ sick role concept).</p>
<p>With different emphases, contributors agree on a differentiation between illness, disease, and sickness. Illness is the subjective first-person perspective—that one experiences illness. Disease on the other hand is the medical profession’s perspective on health problems. It is the diagnosis of a “physiological malfunction.” Sickness is the social perspective. It is a social identity. Illness, disease, and sickness are different, but they are also interdependent. Typically, disease leads to an illness, which then results in sickness. Understanding this triad is presented as a mechanism for addressing, and possibly resolving, controversies about sickness absence and its certification.</p>
<p>Cases in which all three situations are present are easy to address, while cases in which only one of the situations is present are problematic. For example, illness—the person feels ill, but there is no diagnosed disease. In this instance the person is challenged to convince both the medical profession and social institutions about his or her situation. Cases are stronger and less controversial if two of the situations—disease and sickness, disease and illness, and illness and sickness—are present.</p>
<p>The increase in sickness absences in Sweden in the late 1990s and the early 2000s covered all diagnoses; however, the increase in mental diagnoses was especially significant. An argument is made that the work environment played a role in these increases in sickness. Using a social psychological approach and considering changes in the work environment over the years, the authors proposed that stress and losses of self-esteem were the culprits in generating illness.</p>
<p>The empirical studies in the second part of the book tend to focus on the relationship between the psycho-social environment and LTSA. Because health and social services have been the arenas of work with the highest percentage of employees certified as sick, a number of studies have been conducted on the relationship between the psychosocial conditions in working life in general and sickness absence in particular. This is especially true with “relational” or “emotional” work, where there is in-person contact between the employee and the public, and the employer exercises a degree of control over the emotional activities of the employees. Examples of professional groups engaged in emotional work are teachers, social workers, nurses, and care workers. One of the chapters reports on a case study of care workers at a nursing home. Results showed that the working situation over time had become too demanding and stressful for many of the employees, as a result of an increasing work burden on the increasingly smaller staff.</p>
<p>One of the chapters reported a study which found a strong relationship between LTSA and the psycho-social work environment (measured by a job strain model). Another study related rapid labor market changes to changes in the work environment leading to more LTSA. The implications of these kinds of results indicate a potential to reduce sickness absence by promoting good working conditions and interventions directed toward the social relations at work.</p>
<p>The concluding chapter proposes and takes a broad approach to studying the relationship between social factors and the LTSA phenomenon in Norway, where 12 percent of the workforce accounted for 80 percent of work absences. In a multivariate analysis, LTSA was examined by psycho-social working conditions, social capital, and lifestyle, each of which had independent effects. In addition to providing a framework for understanding sickness absence for policymakers in Scandinavian countries, this book is an important addition to the literature on the sociology of health and illness.</p>
