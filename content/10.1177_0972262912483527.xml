<abstract>
<p>Perception of organizational fairness is an important indicator of effectiveness of diversity climate of any organization. In the present study, a sincere attempt has been made to examine the perception of organizational fairness among diverse group employees. The study was conducted upon 207 lower and middle managerial level employees of two reputed public sector units situated at Orissa, India. The total sample was spread over five different social groups, namely—Oriya Hindu male, Oriya Hindu female, Oriya reserved category, non-Oriya Hindu male and Oriya non-Hindu male. First, we tried to examine the difference, if any, among the employees belonging to these different groups upon their perception of fairness in the organization. Also, multiple stepwise regression analyses were carried out to explicate the contributions from different dimensions of nature of training, informal activities and psychological contract towards perception of organizational fairness. The results indicate that, Oriya reserved category and Oriya Hindu female employees differ significantly from Oriya Hindu male employees and other groups upon perception of fairness. Regression analyses reveal that perceived relevance of interpersonal training and accommodativity of technical training are stronger predictors of perceived fairness in case of all the groups, whereas level of participation in informal activities and psychological contract on power emerge strong contributors towards fairness perception of reserved category as well as Oriya Hindu female employees. The findings have been discussed in light with relevant literature along with future implications.</p>

<p>Changing demographic characteristics of organizations all over the world including that of India has attracted the attention of academicians as well as practitioners. This changing demography presents both challenges and opportunities to individual employees as well as to the organization as a whole. On the positive side, people who earlier did not get an opportunity to develop their potentials now avail greater chances to realize that. Organizations also benefit in a number of ways like selection and placement, creativity, innovation and performance, etc. At the same time, diversity has the potential for negative outcomes. Tension, hostility, misunderstanding may grow among diverse group of employees. Our ability as individuals, organizations and a society to garner the benefits of workforce diversity, while reducing the disadvantages, depends upon our understanding of the dynamics related to diversity. The present study has been conceived in the light of the same.</p>
<p>We define workforce diversity as existence of difference in the composition of the employees of an organization or any department or unit of the organization upon demographic, psychological or organizational structure domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0972262912483527">Sia and Bhardwaj, 2008</xref>). Managing diversity refers to, managing the ability of all employees to contribute to organizational goals and to achieve their full potential unhindered by group identities such as gender, race, nationality, age and departmental affiliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0972262912483527">Cox, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0972262912483527">1993</xref>); comprehensive managerial process for developing an environment that works well for all employees, including dominant culture employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0972262912483527">Thomas, 1991</xref>). This implies an active recognition and appreciation of the increasingly multicultural nature of contemporary organization. We are working in a global village where people are internationally mobile or working locally but in global teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0972262912483527">Adler and Gunderson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0972262912483527">Conlin, 1999</xref>). India is composed of 28 states and seven union territories which have basically been carved upon linguistic criteria. When an individual belonging to one state joins an organization of another state, s/he may face difficulties related to language, religion, politics, interaction with host people and adjustment with new culture, etc. To lessen the uncertainty caused by cultural differences, employees should be aware of cultural diversity and develop the ability to build interconnections with people who are different from them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0972262912483527">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). Researchers emphasize upon cultural intelligence, which makes the individual navigate more easily and understand unfamiliar cultures and adjust behaviour to perform effectively in culturally diverse situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0972262912483527">Earley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0972262912483527">Earley and Ang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0972262912483527">Earley and Mosakowski, 2004</xref>), because individuals with high cultural quotients seem to be emotionally well adjusted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0972262912483527">Earley et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Diversity should be considered as a salient aspect of an organization, particularly those which are diversifying and differentiating. Workforce diversity adds reputations to the characteristics of an organization. Highly heterogeneous teams outperform moderately heterogeneous ones in the long run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0972262912483527">Earley and Mosakowski, 2004</xref>). In the globalized era, a diversified team helps in achieving the organizational objectives better than the non-diversified team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0972262912483527">Agrawal, 2012</xref>). According to Datta et al. (2005), industry characteristics affect the relative importance and value of high-performance work systems. Impact of those systems (human resource systems) on productivity is influenced by capital intensity, growth and differentiation. Now organizations are recognizing that varied set of experiences, disciplines and backgrounds is vital for break-through innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0972262912483527">Agrawal, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0972262912483527">Fleming, 2004</xref>) mastering the dual demands of creativity and operational efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0972262912483527">Randel and Jaussi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0972262912483527">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Diverse workgroups enhance performance because they have access to wide array of information necessary to solve complex problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0972262912483527">Leonard et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Diversity appears in Indian organizations due to many factors. Some of those may be pointed here. Article 16 of the Indian Constitution offers equality of opportunity for employment to citizens irrespective of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, or place of birth. Though the states in India have been carved upon linguistic basis, Article 19 of our Constitution offer the privilege for movement throughout the country and carry out business or profession of one’s choice. And more, Directive Principles of State Policy of Indian Constitution advocates reservation for weaker and deprived sections of the society like Scheduled Cast, Scheduled Tribe, Other Backward Classes and Women in various spheres including appointment and promotions in the organizations. Thus Indian Constitution envisages a strong legal foundation for diverse workforce.</p>
<p>In the last one-decade, the absolute number of male employees in India has dropped by about six hundred thousand whereas female employees have increased by a similar number. The total employment in PSUs has actually remained stagnant. In percentage terms, while male employees dropped down 5 per cent compared to 5 per cent rise in the number of female employees. This employment trend also corresponds to the faster growth in the services sector in the last decade. Since 1990, the sectors, which have added the maximum number of employees in the public sector, are community, social &amp; personal services and finance, insurance, real estate, etc. These are also the sectors most suited for females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0972262912483527">Kant and Sinha, 2004</xref>). Gradually women, minorities and deprived sections of the Indian society are becoming more qualified and skilled, thus entering various organizations in greater numbers and at different levels. Recently more and more organizations are undergoing expansion and entering gradually into international collaborations; a natural by-product of such events is workforce diversity.</p>
<p>A close perusal of the trends of urbanization worldwide indicates that most of the medium or large size organizations are located near urban centres. People from different parts and states of India migrate to those urban areas in search of jobs. As a consequence, people from different backgrounds including religion, languages, etc., settle themselves in these places. Factors like these bring changes in the demographic composition of the organizations from time to time. Indian workforce, hailing from diverse socio-cultural backgrounds, needs to be stitched together to meet the challenges and opportunities provided by the current business scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0972262912483527">Davis et al., 2006</xref>). Researchers should also make sincere effort to assess the perception of diverse group employees and to identify the relevant factors which may contribute towards perception of fairness and inclusiveness of the minority group employees.</p>
<p>The present study has been carried out in Orissa, one of the 28 states of India. All the diversity related aspects discussed above are also reflected in the organizations, particularly public sector organizations of Orissa. Orissa as an independent state was formed in 1936 on the basis of its major language Oriya (presently called Odia). The dominant religion in this state is Hinduism. However, in all the organizations, including private and public sector, at Orissa, we come across with employees belonging to other religious groups. Researchers indicate that in India, religion had an impact on workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0972262912483527">Rao, 2012</xref>). We can assume the same impact in the context of Orissa also. Caste has been a basic feature of Hindu society for centuries. Aryan cast system propagated division of labour into four casts two thousand years ago, which was useful at that time. When it became an inherited phenomena, the discriminatory consequences were manifested. Caste barriers endure despite the Indian government’s efforts in terms of legislations and policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0972262912483527">Saha, 1993</xref>). Orissa, being a Hindu dominated state, may have the bearings of this cast system in its organizations. All these socio-demographic dynamics of diversity necessitates taking up more and more studies in organizations of Orissa as well as India.</p>
<p>Diverse workforce, if not managed effectively can have many negative repercussions. Employees of minority groups and women employees, having lower representation in the organization, may feel themselves being highly segregated and are assumed by others to be representative of their social group in the organization. They feel highly contrasted with other members of their work environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0972262912483527">Kanter, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0972262912483527">Yoder, 1994</xref>). Employees from different cultural backgrounds feel that behaviour patterns, attitudes, values and expressions which are accepted in their own cultural settings may not be allowed in the new cultural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0972262912483527">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0972262912483527">Montabaur, 2002</xref>). As a result, intergroup misunderstandings and conflicts may occur due to differences in behavioural expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0972262912483527">Ang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0972262912483527">Kumar et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Minority and women employees may develop subjective experience of being discriminated due to their visible differences. Because of traditional or prevailing social attitudes and stereotypes, the observable differences become stigmatizing for them. In this context, Goffman (1963) speaks about tribal stigma based on membership in a certain ethnic group. When differences among people are visible, they are likely to evoke responses that are related directly to biases, prejudice, or stereotypes. These types of feelings in turn can adversely affect job satisfaction for minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0972262912483527">Milliken and Martins, 1996</xref>) as well as for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0972262912483527">Kanter, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0972262912483527">Mellor, 1996</xref>) and also the feeling and performance of the minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0972262912483527">Steele and Aronson, 1995</xref>). Behaviours, attitudes and perceptions all contribute to unequal power relationship among diverse groups in an organization. Even though minorities and women display same power behaviours as their male counterparts, these behaviours may be perceived differently. Stereotypes may distort and limit perceptions of power and attributes regarding sources of influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0972262912483527">Pettigrew and Martin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0972262912483527">Ragins and Sundstrom, 1989</xref>); women in leadership positions are devalued more than their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0972262912483527">Eagly et al., 1992</xref>). It would be wrong to mention that workplace discrimination is obsolete. Glass ceiling still prevails, not only for female employees, but for other non-traditional employee groups as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0972262912483527">Eagly and Chin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0972262912483527">Klein and Wang, 2010</xref>). In other words, there is a probability that employees from different socio-demographic backgrounds may have difference in their perception about the diversity climate of their organization. Perceived organizational fairness is a vital component of diversity climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0972262912483527">Barak et al., 1998</xref>). This is the major variable for the present study. We are proposing the following hypothesis:</p>

<title>Nature of Training and Perceived Fairness</title>
<p>Training can be best thought of as an organizational episode, that is, a series of cumulative experiences and the cognitions and feelings associated with those experiences, rather than as a detached event. So, training should be oriented in line with these experiences that individuals bring to the training programme. This will not be possible through the usual training procedures which follow overly simplistic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0972262912483527">Ford and Kraiger, 1995</xref>). Organizations in general and Indian organizations in particular usually follow traditional instructional systems design model of training, which has difficulty in three main areas. In India mostly the trainings are mass oriented and reductionistic in approach. Also the trainings are not oriented to bring any cultural change instead, aim to maintain the status quo in the organization. Though some organisations are gradually showing interest towards employee customized training programme, these are not very frequent. To make the training programmes effective for diverse workforce, these must be holistic, customized to individual employees and help to bring cultural change in the organization. In the present day context the organizations should evolve training method for accommodation. Training method for accommodation is oriented to change existing attitudes and to minimize biases that could adversely affect non-traditional organizational members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0972262912483527">Ferdman, 1992</xref>). Managers need to internalize to avoid stereotypes or biases through the use of techniques such as behaviour sampling strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0972262912483527">Ilgen and Youtz, 1986</xref>). According to Morgan et al. (1986), most organizations nowadays must not only develop employees’ knowledge and skill relevant for task accomplishment (‘task work’) but also must develop ‘team work’ or interpersonal skills. Offerman and Gowing (1990) view that the need to develop interpersonal skills is compounded by the increasing diversity in organizations, as employees must interact with dissimilar others. Keeping these needs and requirements in mind, the organizations now a day are adopting ‘technical’ training as well as interpersonal training programmes.</p>
<p>Training has become an important approach for dealing with the complex issues relevant to the changing workforce. The procedural justice approach suggests that perceptions of fairness are critical for organizational viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0972262912483527">Folger and Konovsky, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0972262912483527">McFarlin and Sweeney, 1992</xref>). Training is one way to potentially improve perceptions of fairness if all employees are given equal opportunities to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to be effective in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0972262912483527">Ford and Fisher, 1996</xref>). The trainer should play the role of a leader during the training programme. Wee and Morse (2007) suggest that the responsibility of the team leader is to delegate appropriately and to know each member’s strengths, weaknesses, likings and disliking through open communication. For this purpose, not only the training design and content is important, also important is the environment and atmosphere of the training programme. Earlier researches and training programmes have given more importance to the content of training but have ignored the nature and atmosphere of the training programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0972262912483527">Baldwin and Ford, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0972262912483527">Campbell, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0972262912483527">Ford and Fisher, 1996</xref>). That is why in the present study, the researcher has attempted to look into the nature of the training programmes. This may help in bridging the gap for customization of training and help to some extent in fostering a conducive diversity climate through cultural change of the organization.</p>
<p>Training programmes are designed with the intention to enhance the skills of the trainees so that they can meet the required standard and also can become at par with other employees in their department or organization. This will not only make the jobholder proficient in carrying out the assigned tasks in his/her job, will also foster perceived similarity. Also, induction training programmes as well as technical training programmes which are imparted at the entry level are a major source for organizational socialization In addition, interpersonal training programmes are organized with the purpose to develop familiarity among the participants as well as bring a change in their attitudes with the assumption that stereotypes and perceived inequities will be reduced. Many organizations and the trainers arrange various socio-cultural activities for the trainees during the period of the technical training also. If these are carried out effectively, we can assume that employees, particularly the new incumbents, will come nearer to other colleagues in terms of their skills as well as attitudes. But the effectiveness of a training programme can also be influenced by the trainees’ perception about that programme. When participants feel that a particular training is relevant and will be applicable to their job settings, then, it will be effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0972262912483527">Muir, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0972262912483527">Schumaker, 2004</xref>). However, these aspects of training have not been researched more. That is why, through this study the researcher has attempted to assess the implication of the above mentioned aspects through two variables, namely ‘accommodativity’ of the training programme and ‘perceived relevance’ of the training programme. Accommodativity of the training programme refers to the extent or degree to which the feelings, attitudes and values are being accommodated by the trainer as well as the other participants. Perceived relevance of training implies how far the individual or participant perceives the training programme to be relevant to fulfill individual as well as organizational purposes. For the present study we formulated the following two hypotheses:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>H2a. Accommodativity of the training programme will have significant contribution towards perception of organizational fairness.</italic></p>
<p><italic>H2b. Perceived relevance of the programme will have significant contribution towards perception of organizational fairness.</italic></p>

<sec id="section2-0972262912483527">
<title>Psychological Contract and Perceived Fairness</title>
<p>Psychological contract as a factor behind work performance was first discussed by Argyris (1960). Later this concept has been elaborated and flourished by Schein (1965), Kolb et al. (1971) and Rousseau (1989). It refers to the implicit mutual promises and obligations between an organization and its employees. Psychological contract is the set of expectations held by an individual about the working relationship with the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0972262912483527">Schemerhorn, 2002</xref>). It is the idiosyncratic perception of the employment agreement held by the individuals, have been much theorized but little researched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0972262912483527">Kalleberge and Reve, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0972262912483527">McFarlane and Tetrick, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0972262912483527">Robinson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0972262912483527">Robinson and Morrison, 1995</xref>). It may be noted that organization not only means the total organization as a whole; it also includes the groups or sub-groups within it. So the expectation by the organization includes expectation by the colleague/s, supervisor and department/division. When employee’s expectation (in return for organization’s or others’ expectation) is fulfilled, then we can say that there is compatibility in psychological contract. In other words, more the difference between the expectation and fulfillment more is the incompatibility.</p>
<p>Any employee’s expectations, whether explicit or implicit, if not fulfilled unlike that for others, may develop a perception that the ratio of his/her outcomes to input is unequal. And in turn, the individual may experience a state of inequity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0972262912483527">Austin and Walter, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0972262912483527">Dittrich and Carrell, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0972262912483527">Sharma and Kumar, 1998</xref>). Psychological contracts are much related to expectations, if violated or become incongruent with the constituent parties can result in similar consequences.</p>
<p>Psychological contracts provide a basis for the comprehensive perception of organizational justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0972262912483527">Blancero et al., 1996</xref>). Psychological contract violations impinges on employee attitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0972262912483527">Pate et al., 2003</xref>); is negatively associated with satisfaction, trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0972262912483527">Robinson and Rousseau, 1994</xref>), particularly when trust is crucial for organizational effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0972262912483527">Golembiewski and McConkie, 1975</xref>); lack of trust associated with decrease in quality and quantity of communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0972262912483527">O’Reilly and Roberts, 1976</xref>) and cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0972262912483527">Deutsch, 1973</xref>). Psychological contracts contribute to organizational commitment, however if the employees believe that the firm sends inconsistent mixed signals regarding its intentions, then the employee mistrusts its employer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0972262912483527">Agarwal, 2009</xref>). Thus, we may assume that incompatibility in psychological contract will influence perceived fairness in the organization. The second hypothesis proposed in the present study is:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>H3. Compatibility of psychological contract will have significant contribution towards organizational fairness.</italic></p>

<sec id="section3-0972262912483527">
<title>Informal Activities and Perceived Fairness</title>
<p>Management of any organization should try to create and empower an organizational culture that fosters a respectful and inclusive environment where every employee has the scope to learn, grow and contribute meaningfully to the organization’s success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0972262912483527">Lockwood, 2005</xref>). Opportunity for informal activities may be helpful towards this purpose. Informal activities, in any organization, mainly refer to the activities, which are not formal, i.e., which are not described as per the organizational statute and hence cannot be enforced upon the members. The participation in these activities is voluntary and depends upon some one’s interest. To assess the impact of informal activities, we have to measure the extent or level to which the employee participates in various informal activities.</p>
<p>Contact is a useful behavioural avenue for management of diversity. Islam and Hewstone (1993) suggest three dimensions of contact, which influence inter-group attitudes significantly. These are the frequency of contact, the quality of contact and whether the contact is inter-personal or inter-group in nature. Various informal activities in the organizations are major sources for interaction and provide adequate opportunities to maintain these three dimensions of contact. In Indian organizations, employees cutting across different functional departments come into contact of each other through various informal channels. These include company conveyance, canteen, sports and games arranged by the company, get-togethers and meetings organized from time to time, informal talking during leisure as well as working hours, etc. In diverse set up like Indian organizations, we can assume more informal contacts. In groups with high cultural heterogeneity, informal contacts and communication are more likely to involve members of different social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0972262912483527">Richard et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Informal activities create the scope for network overlapping. Gradually more and more employees come in contact with each other and it leads to network overlapping among them. More interaction results in more network overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0972262912483527">Sheriff, 1958</xref>). More the network overlap, lower the probability that there will be ethnic affirmation. People who feel included in a friendship network are more likely to exhibit accommodation than ethnic affirmation. More the interaction, more likely it is that stereotypes will change into socio-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0972262912483527">Triandis and Vassiliou, 1967</xref>). The presence of socio-types implies accurate perception, rather than stereotypic perception of the other group and understanding of cultural constructs of the diverse group employees. This, in turn can help to develop positive diverse climate in the organization. Because cultural constructs in India influence an individual’s personal and professional existence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0972262912483527">Varma et al., 2005</xref>). Group differences in access to network may contribute to differences in perceived power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0972262912483527">Ibarra, 1993</xref>). Organizations can create more and more avenues for informal activities which in turn can lend, at least partially, a base for open system of communication. An open system of communication would result in greater interpersonal trust, reduce sense of isolation and increased sense of psychological security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0972262912483527">Biswas et al., 2007</xref>). Against these backgrounds, we may formulate the following hypothesis:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>H4. Level of participation in informal activities will have significant contribution towards organizational fairness.</italic></p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The total sample of the present study consists of 207 employees belonging to lower as well as middle managerial level. Out of these, 118 belong to Rourkela Steel Plant and 89 belong to the Paradeep Phospate Ltd. Both the organizations are situated in Orissa, a state in eastern part of India. Simple random sampling method was followed for the data collection purpose. After clubbing the sample from both the organizations test of normality was carried out, which was found to be satisfactory. The total sample is spread over five socio-demographic groups, that is, 57 Oriya Hindu male respondents, 32 Oriya Hindu female employees, 44 non-Oriya Hindu male, 35 Oriya non-Hindu male and 39 Oriya reserved category respondents. The average age of the sample was 39.8 years; 180 respondents were graduates and 27 were post graduates; 165 were married and 42 were unmarried.</p>

<title>Nature of Training Questionnaire (NTQ)</title>
<p>It consisted of two subscales—technical training and interpersonal training. Technical training refers to the training provided to improve the skills specific to the concerned job. Interpersonal training refers to the training required to improve the interpersonal interaction, behaviour and attitude of the employees. And under each category, we have included the two dimensions—accommodativity of training programme/s and perceived relevance of training programme/s. Under technical training, there are 12 items belonging to ‘accommodativity’ and the item total correlation coefficients varied from 0.39 to 0.72; under ‘perceived relevance’ dimension there are 7 items and the item-total correlation coefficients varied between 0.42 and 0.85. In interpersonal training subscale there are eight items under accommodativity dimension having item total correlation varying in-between 0.40 to 0.86 and also eight items under the dimension of perceived relevance having item total correlations between 0.37 and 0.81. The cronbach alpha for the whole scale is 0.73. It is a five-point Likert type rating scale. The response pattern vary from strongly disagree (1), to strongly agree (5).</p>

<title>Informal Activities Questionnaire (IAQ)</title>
<p>This uni-dimensional questionnaire attempts to assess an employee’s level of participation in various informal activities like, picnic, celebration, games/sports, gossiping outside the job context, etc. The number of items in this questionnaire is 15. The item total correlation coefficients for these items ranged from 0.36 to 0.68 and the cronbach alpha for the test is 0.75. This is also a five-point Likert type rating scale. The response categories vary from Very Low (1), to Very High (5). Some of the sample items are mentioned below:

<title>Compatibility of Psychological Contract Questionnaire (CPCQ)</title>
<p>This tool consists of three dimensions. These are—Role &amp; Task, Power and Work Culture. There are 15 items in the dimension of ‘Role &amp; Task’ and seven items each in the other two dimensions, that is, ‘power’ and ‘culture’. The item-total correlation of the items under Role &amp; Task varied between 0.31 and 0.70, that for power ranged from 0.41 and 0.75 and under the dimension of culture it varied in-between 0.36 to 0.69. The cronbach alpha for the scale is 0.72. The composition of these items itself are of different nature. Each item is a composition of two statements in the form of <bold>ʻif…then’</bold> format. It can be clearer, if we go through some items:
<array>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><bold>If expectation is made upon me to…</bold></td>

<p>The response pattern is also little bit different here. The respondent has to give his/her response to each item in terms of two columns. The first column indicates the extent to which the respondent agrees with the statement and the second column indicates the extent to which it can be fulfilled in his/her case. For both the columns response has to be given in Likert type five-point scale varying in-between strongly disagree to strongly agree.</p>

For the present study the ‘Organisational Fairness’ dimension has been adopted. It refers to the extent to which employee perceives the plans, policies and programmes of the organization to be fair towards him/her. The response pattern for this questionnaire is also that of five-point Likert type scale, i.e., 1 for Strongly Disagree to 5 for Strongly Agree. The cronbach alpha of this questionnaire is 0.71.</p>

<p>The investigators tried to assess the contribution of each dimension of the predictor variables towards the three dimension of organizational fairness (OF). The predictors in this study are—nature of training, level of participation in informal activities and compatibility of psychological contract. For this purpose, at first, the product-moment correlation matrix was prepared among the dimensions of all the variables. This was done for all the five groups separately and for the total sample as a whole. Through these correlation matrixes, the researcher attempted to see the magnitude and direction of the relationships among the variables. Then, effort was made to find the contribution of dimensions of antecedent variables towards the dimensions of criterion variable through step-wise multiple regressions. Dimensions exhibiting significant correlations were picked up for regression analysis. The regression analyses have been conducted separately for each of the five different groups as well as the total sample.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0972262912483527">Table 2</xref> shows that for Oriya Hindu female group, the most potent and significant predictor of organizational fairness is perceived relevance of interpersonal training, which contributes to 70 per cent of the total variance of organizational fairness. Accommodativity of technical training, another dimension of nature of training, when entered into the equation at second step increases the total variance of organizational fairness by another 7.2 per cent. Therefore PRIT along with ATT explain 78 per cent of the total variance. Psychological contract on power (PCP)—a dimension of psychological contract—entering at the third step of the equation, increases the variance of OF by another 3.8 per cent and contribution of the final significant predictor, that is, Level of participation in informal activities is 2.7 per cent making the total variance 84.5 per cent. Therefore, it may be sated that, 84.5 per cent of the total variance of perceived fairness, for Oriya Hindu Female, is contributed by the predictor variables PRIT, ATT, PCP and LPIA. However, 15.5 per cent of the variance is not explained.</p>

Psychological contract on power has the most significant contribution, that is, 64.9 per cent towards the variance of organizational fairness. Coming in the second step of the equation, accommodativity of technical training contributes 8 per cent, thereby both psychological contract on power and accommodativity of technical training together contribute 73 per cent of the total variance. accommodativity of interpersonal training shows 4.4 per cent contribution towards the total variance of organizational fairness. Level of participation in informal activities predicts 2.9 per cent of the total variance and perceived relevance of interpersonal training predict 3.3 per cent of the total variance.

<p>The perspectives that emerge from the overall analyses are worth mentioning here. It comes out that, for female employees, organizational fairness is mainly influenced by perceived relevance of interpersonal training, accommodative atmosphere of the training programme, their implicit expectations relating power and their level of participation in informal activities. In case of reserved category employees perception of organizational fairness can be mainly attributed to their inner desire for power and atmosphere of the training programme (both technical and interpersonal) and participation in informal activities. However, for the total sample, it comes out that, perception of organizational fairness is largely influenced by relevance of interpersonal training, psychological contract compatibility on organizational culture and accommodativity of technical training.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0972262912483527" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is observed that, participants belonging to three minority groups, namely Oriya non-Hindu, Oriya Hindu Female and Oriya Reserved Category groups, differ significantly from Oriya Hindu Male group employees upon accommodativity of training programmes. They perceive, as if the programmes were just imposed upon them. Some respondents belonging to the minority groups felt that, cooperation from the co-trainees was very less. During the training programmes, some participants sort out their minor problems or inadequacies by discussing among themselves. However, some participants, usually belonging to the minority groups perhaps do not get that opportunity. In some occasions, some trainees hesitate to interact properly with the trainer. Some other interpersonal issues may also crop up during the conduction of those training programmes. This may lead to a feeling that they are not being valued and recognized properly during the training programme. This, in turn, may lessen the trainee’s interest in the training programme.</p>
<p>Respondents belonging to above three minority groups also exhibit significant difference from the majority Oriya Hindu Male group upon perceived relevance of interpersonal training. In these two studied organizations, various interpersonal training programmes are organized. They are based upon various themes like sensitivity training, ‘T’ groups, improvement of communication skills, presentation skills, total quality circle, self-awareness, action collaboration, etc. The duration of those programmes usually vary from five days to 15 days. Employees perhaps feel that, these interpersonal training programmes are not so relevant. During the interaction with some respondents, they indirectly opined that, these programmes don’t serve the purpose. Whatever is discussed or conducted during these programmes is hardly practiced in the actual situation. This may be due to two reasons. When the participants return to their original job, ztheir senior colleagues in particular and other employees in general might not have shown receptive attitude towards them. The other probability is that, the participants themselves might not be taking sincere initiative to practice the things imparted to them during their training programme.</p>
<p>Except, Oriya Hindu Female group, other groups don’t differ significantly from Oriya Hindu Male group upon level of participation in informal activities. The level of adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0972262912483527">Helson, 1964</xref>) for female employees in Orissa may be lower in comparison to some other states and metropolitan cities. Second, socialization of an individual matters a lot for his/her interpersonal interaction in social and organizational setting. However, it is not that, female employees are not at all interested to take active part in informal activities. The fact is that, other members in the organization—colleagues, subordinates or superiors—expect definite pattern of behaviour from them. When they confirm to those expectations they receive reinforcement, recognition and approval, when not are rejected, disapproved or punished.</p>
<p>Result indicates that, both female and reserved category employees differ significantly from other group employees upon the different dimensions of psychological contract. Perhaps they feel that, other colleagues don’t perceive them as competent enough and it is the reservation policy or some leniency, which has helped them to get the job. Superiors might be feeling that, the subordinates are supposed to fulfil extra demands like extra work, personal work, etc. Providing any extra benefit to the subordinates depends upon superior’s chosen characteristics which these female and reserved category employees may not be possessing. But when these employees, like any other employees, become ready for extra work or personal work of the superiors, would definitely expect some extra gain in return from their superiors. If, this does not actualize, it can generate incompatibility in their psychological contract.</p>
<p>As far as perceived fairness is concerned, it is again reflected that, female employees and reserved category employees differ significantly from other groups. We may assume that their work environment, participation in various organizational activities and fulfilment of their implicit expectations might be having significant contribution towards their perception of fairness. We have undertaken stepwise multiple regression analysis to unravel these contributions further.</p>
<p>The multiple regression analysis indicates that for the Oriya Hindu female group, variation in organizational fairness is predominantly determined by perceived relevance of interpersonal training followed by accommodativity of technical training and compatibility of psychological contract on power. As all of us know, interpersonal trainings are short term in nature and that, it can bring effective change in the employees and the organization as well. But for that to happen, the programmes should be valid as per the requirement of the participants and must be followed up religiously throughout the organization after the programmes are over. If interpersonal interventions met these criteria, employees will gradually feel that, they are being treated fairly by other employees and by the organization as whole. But if there is not adequate interpersonal relationship, even best intentions of the colleagues, superiors along with policies and privileges provided by the organization will be simply considered as eyewash. And proper interpersonal relationship can be developed through programmes which are perceived to be useful by the participants. Otherwise, they themselves would not follow whatever they learn during the programmes.</p>
<p>Accommodativity of technical training plays an important role in the variation of organizational fairness. Most often, technical trainings are compulsory for the participants. If the training environment is not accommodative, participants will not feel comfortable. They may develop a feeling that the trainer as well as the trainees are discriminating against him/her. Second, many of the technical training programmes, particularly induction training, continue for a long period. Mostly they are conducted on the job along with colleagues of the same department. The nature of atmosphere during these programmes is also a precursor of the organizational atmosphere to follow. If the female employees perceive that their needs and requirements are being taken care of and they are valued properly by the other participants, then with most probability, they will continue the same attitude after the training is over. An accommodative training atmosphere creates the scope for the participants to gradually develop self-control where the group of trainees serves as a support system for each trainee’s individual learning and the instructor gradually turns over control to the trainees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0972262912483527">Brown and Palinscar, 1989</xref>). This, in turn, will enhance the feeling of organizational fairness and organizational inclusiveness.</p>
<p>Another interesting finding, which appears for Oriya Hindu female group is compatibility of psychological contract on power, which came out to be a significant determinant of organizational fairness. The respondents belonged to managerial level and supervisory level. They have exposure to higher education and they possess a progressive mind-set. It is true that Oriya female employees have been socialized in a culture, in which most of the members including women are ready to accept a less powerful status for the women; women don’t hanker for power or run behind power-involved activities. Still they feel that delegation of power to female employees can bring them to an equitable position. Compatibility of power expectations can lead to psychological empowerment. Bhatnagar and Sandhu (2005) found that managers who perceive psychological empowerment, that is ability to take control of one’s situation in their occupational environment exhibit organizational citizenship behaviour.</p>
<p>Another group of respondents, which indicates important findings related to the criterion variable, is reserved category employees. For them, the variable organizational fairness is largely influenced by compatibility of psychological contract on power, followed by accommodativity of technical and interpersonal training respectively. From this, we may infer that, these employees have a striving for power and want to become at par with other employees. The historical background of Indian society reveals that the caste to which these employees belong had been deprived a lot during medieval period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0972262912483527">Srinivas, 1991</xref>). Even today, that mindset prevails in some parts of our society. And more in a few parts of the country, still the reserved category individuals readily accept their underestimated status without any question. However, those who are placed at the managerial position, that too in reputed public sector undertakings, have definitely adequate insight regarding the various socio-cultural dimensions of our country. They must be aspiring for equitable share of power in different spheres of their life. Their occupation is one of those major spheres. So it is quite natural that, they would look forward to formal as well as informal avenues which can provide different bases of power. If they are deprived from this, they may develop a feeling of discrimination.</p>
<p>Incompatibility of expectations on power might be arousing due to low-mobility in the organizational hierarchy. This may strengthen the in-group and out-group feeling. Hirose et al. (2005) found that, subordinates in low-mobility condition acted collectively more frequently and evaluated their group more positively than those in the high mobility condition. They also found a significant positive correlation between the frequency of subordinates’ collective action and in-group favouritism. This feeling may encourage the reserved category employees to foster a feeling of being discriminated by the ‘out-group’. This would definitely distort the feeling of fairness.</p>
<p>Participation in informal activities was found to be contributing significantly towards organizational fairness in case of reserved category as well as female employees. A reason behind this may be the nature of their appointment. Others might be attributing their appointment/success to their reservation status but not to their potential or competence. Stereotypes may distort and limit perceptions of power and attributes regarding sources of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0972262912483527">Pettigrew and Martin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0972262912483527">Ragins and Cotton, 1999</xref>). Greenhouse and Parasuraman (1993) also found that among highly successful managers, the performance of black managers was less likely to be attributed to ability and effort and was more likely to be attributed to help from others. Employees belonging to majority or dominant group attribute the success of minority group employees to external sources like affirmative action policy, Scheduled Cast or Scheduled Tribe reservations, extra organizational privileges, etc.; but not to their qualification, experience or ability. This may cause a feeling of inferiority and deterioration of their self esteem. In turn, their participation in various departmental and organizational activities may be hampered and they rather may perceive these various programmes to be discriminative in nature. But, to the contrary, if there is increased informal interaction, the employees will get to know more and more about each others’ individual competencies, attributes and values. Over time, as people acquire more information, their perception developed more upon observed behaviour and less on stereotypes prompted by overt characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0972262912483527">Jackson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0972262912483527">Newcomb, 1961</xref>). Due to this, they will gradually evaluate or judge each other upon individual dimensions, not upon group or class identity. And it can replace the stereotypes held by members of one group towards members of another group. In turn it can reduce the feeling of discrimination and enhance the perception of fairness. In other words, lower the level of participation in informal activities lower will be perceived fairness of the reserved and female employees.</p>
<p>Second, they might not have adequate opportunities unlike their dominant counterparts to take part in various informal activities. Group differences in access to network may contribute to differences in perceived power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0972262912483527">Ibarra, 1993</xref>). This will obviously lead to a reduction in their perceived fairness. But if the training instructors try to make the training atmosphere more accommodating, these will be carried over by both the minority as well as majority group participants to their original job situation. And this can have a greater positive impact towards perceived organizational fairness.</p>
<p>When we take the total sample into consideration, it comes out that, variation in the perception of organizational fairness is influenced by three major variables. In order of importance, these are—perceived relevance of interpersonal training (PRIT), compatibility of psychological contract on organizational culture (PCOC) and accommodativity of technical training (ATT). It is a well known fact that, technical training is inevitable as far as functioning of an organization is concerned. But in addition to this, humane aspect has to be taken care of so that proper cooperation and collaboration is maintained among the members/employees in an organization. Keeping this thing in mind, interpersonal training programmes are undertaken by organizations. But as we discussed earlier, if these programmes are not perceived to be relevant, or not followed up effectively during the post training period these cannot be successful in building healthy interpersonal relationship among the employees. In this type of situation, many employees, particularly minorities and women employees would feel discriminated by their colleagues and superiors.</p>

<title>Implications and Suggestions for Future Research</title>
<p>Findings from the present study have some significant implications. Sufficient care should be taken to customize the training programmes so that employees’ preferences, values and needs are accommodated as far as possible. Organizations must attempt to project the interpersonal training programmes as attractive, accommodative and relevant before the employees. Overall, we may suggest that training should be provided proper importance. Based upon a study covering 82 firms in India, Singh (2004) indicates that, there is a significant relationship between the human resource practices of training and compensation and perceived organizational as well as market performance.</p>
<p>Organizations should create various avenues for informal activities to motivate employees, particularly the female employees to participate actively in informal activities. The management of the organization should make sure that the non-official and implicit expectations of the employees are identified effectively and given due importance. This would help in developing a congenial atmosphere for diverse group employees. In addition, effective management of diversity necessitates some more effort on the part of the government also. Rao (2004) opines that, though India took a lead in Asia-Pacific region by setting up a full Ministry of Human Resources Development, the concept of ‘national human resource development’ (NHRD) in India, has largely been limited to education and culture. The complexity of the country perhaps makes it difficult to have integrated human resource development systems at the national level. Networking and learning from each other among various ministries, institutions and corporate sectors can, however, go a long way in effectively evolving and implementing NHRD policies.</p>
<p>The present study has been conducted upon two public sector units situated at Orissa. Future researches may cover different types of organizations including MNCs, service industries, etc. situated over different parts of India. The study has covered respondents belonging to five different social groups. Investigators may include more other groups and also groups based upon functional diversity i.e. diversity based upon departmental affiliation. In addition to the three predictor variables included in the study, further studies may be conducted picking up some other relevant variables also, like mentoring process, network-overlapping, contact, super-ordinate goals, etc. Future researches may use new techniques of organizational research. One such technique is text-based causal maps (TBCMs). Nadkarni and Narayanan (2005) suggest that, as a methodological tool TBCMs provide a way of accessing large, untapped resources of data generated by organizations. Future researches may even design and introduce special diversity-training programmes and find out the impact of those programmes. These are not the exhaustive list of suggestions for future researchers. They may chalk out innovative strategies constituting relevant variables to identify the untapped resources to explain the mechanism and consequences of workforce diversity in Indian organizations.</p>
