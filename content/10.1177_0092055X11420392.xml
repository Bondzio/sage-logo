<p><italic>Bachelorette, 34</italic> begins with the sound of several phone messages from a mother to her daughter, Kara (the documentarian and subject of the documentary). The mother tells Kara that she needs to hurry up and finish graduate school. She also says that she has met the perfect man for her daughter because he happens to be Kara’s age, but he’s “Catholic and Republican,” implying that Kara identifies with neither of these groups. The film is about a mother’s concern that her 34-year-old daughter is not married or dating and that “time is running out.” Kara says that her mother’s “campaign” to get her married began when she was 26 years old. In one section of the film, Kara’s mother describes four plans that she has for Kara, all of which involve different men whom Kara should consider for a future marriage. One plan involved marrying a 50-year-old family friend who offered to marry Kara. The mother notes that he is still married and his wife is currently healthy, but “she smokes.” There is hope for Kara! During some portions of the movie, I was laughing, but as with this example, it was the type of uncomfortable laughter that is associated with thinking, “Did she really just say that?”</p>
<p>I enjoyed watching this interesting and humorous documentary about a single woman whose mother is constantly pressuring her to get married. How the mother tries to set up the daughter with several men in mind, including married and gay men, is poignant, funny, and frankly sad at times. The film shows clips of Kara’s parents’ wedding and other family films, which are creatively spliced with 1950s advertisements and brief film clips about marriage and family. Even though we hear his voice a couple of times, the film notes that Kara’s father did not want to be interviewed. For class discussion, it might be interesting to ask students to speculate about why they think the father did not want to be involved with this documentary in the same way that the mother did.</p>
<p>The mother sees Kara’s inability to meet “the right man” as her daughter’s own fault. In one scene, the mother proposes a makeover of Kara. The makeover includes not only changing her physical appearance (e.g., wearing more makeup) but also making better decisions about where to have her morning coffee and which bookstores to attend. For example, her mother advises Kara to go to Barnes &amp; Noble, not the “gay and lesbian bookstore” that Kara enjoys visiting. She also suggests that Kara leave San Francisco and move to the Midwest, where she is supposedly more likely to find a husband. An instructor can point out that the mother sees Kara’s “problems” as her fault—a view based on individual choice—and then provide structural reasons why people meet or do not meet. Toward the end of the film, Kara tells her mother that she has lots of good friends, and they have their own little community, similar to supportive lesbian and gay communities. This offers opportunities for instructors to ask about the heterosexualized assumptions of the film and inquire how this film might be different if Kara identified as a lesbian.</p>
<p>I recommend this film for use in a variety of sociology classes, including introduction to sociology and courses on or related to marriage and family, sexuality, gender, and women’s studies. It highlights multiple issues about sexuality, gender, heterosexuality, and compulsory heterosexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092055X11420392">Rich 1980</xref>), the family as a social institution, marriage, cultural beliefs about marriage and variations in these beliefs, identity, the social construction of marriage and singleness, and kinship systems. In an upper-division family course, instructors might consider a discussion of the debates between the “marital-resilience” and “marital-decline” perspectives among sociology of family scholars (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092055X11420392">Amato 2004</xref> for a concise summary of this debate). How might these different sociological perspectives interpret this film? One could also discuss cultural differences in marriage, for example, arranged marriages, or marriages that are based primarily on economics, not romantic love.</p>
<p>Some possible introductory discussion questions for students might include: Why is this mother pressuring her daughter to get married? Does Kara want to get married? What if she doesn’t marry, or doesn’t want to get married? How and why does our society pressure people (particularly heterosexual men and women who have legal access to marriage) to marry? What is so great about marriage? Where do we get these ideas? What if the movie were about a 34-year-old single man? How might the movie be different?</p>
<p>There are several media reports that discuss “problems” with being single (most of which focus on women who are single). In my own classes, I find that students are more able to understand and apply statistics and sociological concepts when I can direct them toward media reports about the topics we are discussing. It might be useful for instructors to mention statistics from a controversial <italic>Newsweek</italic> article (published in 1986) that supposedly indicated that a woman who hasn’t married by the age of 30 has a greater chance of being “shot by a terrorist” than of getting married. A 20-year “anniversary” of the article appeared in <italic>Newsweek</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092055X11420392">McGinn 2006</xref>), revisiting the idea that the older (and more educated) a woman, the less her chances of getting married. At that point, the instructor can discuss critiques of these statistics by referring to Susan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092055X11420392">Faludi’s (1991)</xref> discussion of these data in <italic>Backlash</italic> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092055X11420392">Joel Best’s (2001)</xref> work on how statistics can be misleading and misused by various mediums. Finally, a recent <italic>Newsweek</italic> article, “‘I Don’t’: The Case Against Marriage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092055X11420392">Bennett and Ellison 2010</xref>), presents an alternative view to concerns about being single. Instructors can use these media reports about being single to encourage students to consider debates for and against marriage and/or lifelong singlehood.</p>
<p>Instructors can then place these news stories in a scholarly context by referring to relevant research about being single or pressures to get married. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X11420392">Trimberger’s (2005)</xref> <italic>The New Single Woman</italic> critiques the “soul mate ideal” that is a culturally dominant idea in the United States. Work by historian Stephanie Coontz, who is often cited in sociological textbooks about the family, would be useful. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092055X11420392">Coontz’s (2006)</xref> “A Pop Quiz on Marriage” from the <italic>New York Times</italic> is a useful teaching tool that dispels many dominant cultural myths about marriage and the family.</p>
<p>I liked this film and was already thinking about different ways I could use it in my sociology of gender class as I watched it. I must admit, I wanted to tell Kara’s mother, “Stop pressuring her!” by the middle of the movie, but perhaps that is my idiosyncratic response to the film. The best aspect of this documentary is that it will easily promote discussion and permit an instructor to move from this specific case to several sociological concepts, as well as discussions of deeply held assumptions that we make about being married and being single.</p>
