<p>I am grateful for James Livingston’s sharp, rigorous response. He is right to suggest that my article struck an overly “holy” tone, glossing over the tensions within Marx’s nineteenth-century theory and among the many who have sought to apply it to subsequent history. So, too, while there is much to learn from Marxism about money and finance, those lessons have been vitally reformed and augmented by learning from non-Marxist economists, most importantly, John Maynard Keynes, as Livingston points out, and the Keynesian theorist of financial crisis Hyman Minsky. Marxism has most to offer as an evolving tradition in searching conversation with writers and activists outside its orbit, providing a capacious platform for serious disagreement within its ranks. I thank Professor Livingston for exemplifying that spirit of open-minded criticism.</p>
<p>A distinctive value of Marxism today, to which I called attention, lies in its understanding of periodic crises as playing an essential part in capitalist development. Seen in this light, the escalating series of crises in recent decades fundamentally stems from the structural requirements of an economic regime based on private property and private profit rather than simply from short-term changes in financial practices and regulations, as is commonly supposed. More basically, crises arise not from any failure of capitalism’s unrivaled capacity to produce more and more goods, but from breakdowns in capitalists’ ability to reap sufficient profits from producing them. This is manifested in either the buildup of productive capacity beyond effective demand, as Livingston notes, or a redirection of profits into largely unproductive pursuits like speculating on securities and real estate, or both.</p>
<p>The long depression of the late-nineteenth century resulted from just such a combination of overproduction and overaccumulation, the latter evidenced in the conspicuous waste that Thorstein Veblen critiqued in <italic>The Theory of the Leisure Class</italic> (1899). It is important to recognize, as Livingston indicates, that while agricultural productivity skyrocketed, industrial workers’ resistance to efforts to reorganize the shop floor slowed the dramatic gains in industrial productivity resulting from mechanization and mass production. But the soaring output of factories and farms nevertheless far outpaced the growth of the market for their products—a problem redressed briefly and brutally by widespread insolvency, foreclosure, and unemployment, and more enduringly by the corporate consolidation for which the crisis-born destruction of countless firms, farms, and jobs cleared the way.</p>
<p>Although I referred to Marx’s theory of the long-term tendency of the profit rate to fall as modern technology supplants living labor, the ultimate source of surplus value, that axiom seems to me less central to either the recent scholarship I was synthesizing or my own article than Livingston suggests. The main morals I drew in this regard were rather that capitalist crises are crises of profitability, not production—a galling insight; that crises and the structural reforms to which they give rise indeed restore profits and growth in the short run; but that they thereby lay the groundwork for new cycles of overproduction, overaccumulation, and crisis in the long run. Thus, the neoliberal response to the crisis of the late 1960s and 1970s succeeded in creating a new, hyperfinancialized foundation for profits and growth, but only at the price of accelerating and accentuating the violent cycle of boom and bust. If this crucial contradiction between short-term profits for some and long-term perils for all was not as apparent in my article as I intended, then I thank Livingston for pressing for clarification.</p>
<p>While I am less obeisant to the “law” of falling profits than I led him to worry, I am, for related reasons, less compelled by the converse principle that Livingston draws from Marx: the supposed cancelation, in the twentieth century, of the capitalist dynamic through which surplus value derived from the exploitation of labor in the nineteenth. The many pages Livingston cites do not seem to me to convey such an unambiguous (and unfulfilled) prophecy. Even where Marx predicted that modern technology and the stock market would render both capitalists and laborers increasingly superfluous to the process of production, he almost invariably emphasized the necessity of revolutionary struggle to realize the latent socialist promise embodied in the socialization of ownership and industry.</p>
<p>Marx may have placed his faith most fully in the impersonal, inexorable evolution of socialism in the notebooks of the 1850s that became the <italic>Grundrisse</italic>, written in the immediate aftermath of the staggering defeat of the proletarian uprising that he and Engels had heralded ten years earlier. Trust in the emancipatory ends of the means of production themselves likewise gave false hope to many twentieth-century Marxists in the face of the perceived failure of working-class insurrection. But reliance on the system to slough off its capitalist skin appears to me to form the flip side of a populist faith in “the people” to overthrow “the plutocrats,” which lacks a systemic understanding of the deep, inherent bonds between Main Street masses and Wall Street classes.</p>
<p>Marxism at its best enlists a uniquely comprehensive analysis of the means and mechanisms of capitalist development in the service of socialist mobilization. Such an approach finds within the increasing centrality of finance the potential for radically transforming the organization of property, profit, and power through enlightened activism. That clear-eyed commitment distinguishes the finest recent work on Marxism in the age of financial crises, including Livingston’s.</p>
