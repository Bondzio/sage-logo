<abstract>
<p>Today’s low-income families must patch together their own safety nets from disparate sources of assistance within a context of budget cuts and the growing need for services because of the impact of the Great Recession. Doing so involves a complex and unacknowledged form of labor termed <italic>the unspoken shift</italic>, which generally falls on the shoulders of women. This article approaches the patchwork safety net system through the perspective of low-income mothers in Boston. Using findings from 6 years of research with low-income families, it argues for a more comprehensive approach to providing social services and reforming public policy.</p>

<body>
<p>I arrive at the Department of Transitional Assistance around noon on Monday. I have not received any food stamps for the past month. The waiting room is swamped. People stand holding their children in their arms in the entranceway or prop them on the half-wall that divides the room. As those who are lucky enough to find a chair are called, others scramble to take their seats. People approach the receptionist’s counter and are told simply to take a number and wait. “But I just have a question,” a man pushing a stroller insists. “Take a number and wait to be called,” the receptionist replies. “How long is the wait?” he responds. “I don’t know, but all these interruptions make it longer for everyone.” My number is 74. She just called 31.</p>
<p>A slightly disheveled-looking white woman sitting near me begins talking seemingly to herself or anyone else who will listen. “I was laid off from my job; I’m not like all these junkies trying to be on welfare forever. I just need some food stamps while I get back on my feet.” On the other side of me, a well-dressed Latino man takes offense. “Do I look like a junkie to you?” he asks her directly. “No, no, I didn’t mean you,” she quickly retorts. Another woman chimes in, and soon the argument has taken over half the room. I ponder how I, as a professionally dressed white woman, will be perceived and hesitantly chime in, “Hey, maybe we’re all just trying to get back on our feet.” My words seem to remain unheard.</p>
<p>After waiting two hours, I am finally called to the desk. “I need to speak with my caseworker,” I explain. “Write down your name and social security number and wait to be called.” My seat has been filled by a tired-looking woman and her toddler. Spotting an empty chair, I head to the back corner and settle in. It’s been another hour. No chance of getting any work done today, I resign to myself. At least I brought a book, although with everything happening in this busy room, it is hard to focus on feminist postcolonial theory. </p>
<p>It is now 4:30. A heavy-set middle-aged Latina woman with eyeglasses calls my name from the open door leading to the caseworkers’ cubicles. I jump up and hurry across the room. “I’m really sorry, but I’m leaving for the day. Can you come back tomorrow?” she asks me. My face drops. Four and a half hours of waiting to be told to come back tomorrow!? “I’m sorry; I have to work tomorrow,” I tell her in the most polite voice I can muster through my internal rage. “My case is scheduled to end today, and I’ve been waiting all afternoon.” She drops her shoulders with a sigh and agrees to take my paperwork and process it the next day. “I have a two-and-a-half hour drive home,” she grumbles to herself. “I’m sorry, it’s always one more. I just have to say no at some point.” I apologize and note how many times I’ve tried to reach her by telephone and fax and how difficult it is for me to come in person. “You can’t rely on the phones,” she says, “the caseloads are just too high. You just have to get yourself down here.”</p>
<p>My experience at the Department of Transitional Assistance that afternoon is all too reflective of the situation faced by low-income families today. The recent economic crisis brought public attention to what has been a long-standing crisis of social services. The emphasis on work following the welfare reforms of the late 1990s moved many low-income families into the “working poor.” By definition, their jobs are low paying, provide few benefits, and thus mandate supplemental public assistance to make ends meet. Simultaneously, social service funding has been cut substantially, while requests for emergency assistance have tripled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475159">Marchevsky &amp; Theoharis, 2009</xref>). Thus, funding cannot meet the demands for services. This crisis of social services marks the experience of survival for today’s low-income families. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the social service system has been systematically disassembled and outsourced. Funding for federal and state programs is now funneled through an array of community-based organizations, decentralizing and making the process of applying for assistance even more difficult. In addition, most public assistance programs have shifted from entitlements to block grants. In an entitlement system, if you are determined to be eligible, you automatically receive benefits; however, a block grant designates a set amount per program. If the program cannot meet the demand, applicants may be wait-listed or turned away entirely. This creates a labor-intensive system through which families must patch back together their own safety nets to make ends meet. </p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886109912475159">Edin and Lein (1997</xref>) drew attention to the patchwork of survival strategies that low-income women pieced together to survive. This idea of a patchwork quilt quickly emerged as a central metaphor as I began to explore and document the social safety net as it exists (or does not exist) today. Understanding such patchwork strategies has become increasingly important to studies of poverty and comprehension of the realities of those who are living on incomes that are at, below, or slightly above the poverty line in the early 21st century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886109912475159">DeParle, 2009</xref>). My own experiences as a low-income mother, working to support my family while parenting and being a successful graduate student, became the entry point from which I began my inquiry into how the patchwork quilt is structured, what policies shape it, and what it is like for other low-income women to perform the labor of patchwork.</p>
<p>Patchwork, both literally and metaphorically, is gendered work, generally performed by women. Historically, patchwork and quilting have been important practices through which marginalized women have recorded subjugated histories and expressed knowledge of the world from their own perspectives using a creative form of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886109912475159">Graulich &amp; Witzling, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886109912475159">Hedges, 1977</xref>). Quilting is used today as a means of working to unravel the complexities of the oppression of women throughout the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886109912475159">Washington, Moxley, &amp; Garriott, 2009</xref>). Beyond the literal quilt, the daily work of surviving in poverty can be likened to the creation of a complex tapestry drawing from many resources, performing a multiplicity of tasks and duties, and piecing together one’s own subsistence with the work of caregiving and nurturing for others in meaningful and artistic ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886109912475159">Aptheker, 1989</xref>). Trends, such as the feminization of poverty, have created a situation whereby women and their children are more likely to live in poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886109912475159">Christopher, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, the labor of family maintenance in poor families is generally marked as women’s work and performed by mothers and older daughters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886109912475159">Dodson, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies on low-income families and needs-based social service programs have focused on the experiences of either low-income wage earners or recipients of assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886109912475159">Newman, 1999</xref>) or on specific social service organizations with a primary focus on cash assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886109912475159">Rank, 2004</xref>) and food stamps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886109912475159">Fujiwara, 2005</xref>)—now called the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP)—and, more recently, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886109912475159">Mendenhall et al., 2010</xref>). However, what these studies have not examined is a more comprehensive inquiry into the unacknowledged labor performed by poor women as they navigate these multiple systems. What are the responsibilities that fall on poor women to maintain a patchwork system of support for their families? What are the requirements of sustaining each form of support? How do these requirements work in relation to one another?</p>
<p>In this article, I explore how low-income Boston-area families piece together the complex quilt of social services to meet their responsibilities and secure their economic survival. I argue that low-income women are engaged in an unacknowledged form of labor that is related to maintaining the patchwork social safety net. Borrowing from the neoclassic feminist work of Hoschschild’s <italic>The Second Shift </italic>(2003), I term this labor <italic>the unspoken shift</italic>. While the second shift largely refers to household and caregiving labor that is disproportionately performed by women, the unspoken shift goes beyond these daily household maintenance and caregiving obligations. It involves both a different type of labor and the development of specialized expertise to negotiate benefits and services successfully. Also, unlike the second shift, the labor of the unspoken shift is unique to poor women and is thus directly shaped by the intersections of their gender and social class. These intersections situate the unspoken shift as “women’s work” while ignoring, devaluing, and belittling this labor on the basis of public discourse that imagines poor women receiving public assistance as both lazy and unproductive. By centering my focus directly on women’s lived experiences, I begin to unravel these stereotypes, reveal the complexity of this labor, and introduce poverty from the perspective of poor women. </p>

<title>A Brief History of Welfare and Social Service Programs</title>
<p>In 1996, the American social welfare system was dramatically changed. While the most significant social service bill passed that year, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), referred primarily to the dissolution of a specific cash assistance program (Aid to Families with Dependent Children [AFDC]), the shift to a new program, Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF), led to rippling effects on the larger system of social supports for low-income individuals and families throughout the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475159">Marchevsky &amp; Theoharis, 2009</xref>). PRWORA, or welfare reform, replaced the AFDC entitlement program with a new block grant system of cash assistance and work support for low-income parents and their children. Although AFDC was far from a perfect system, this restructuring of the social welfare system tore the safety net out from under America’s poorest families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886109912475159">Hays, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886109912475159">Mink, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the language used in PRWORA and TANF strongly emphasized the importance of work as a means of moving to self-sufficiency, the “success” of welfare reform was not measured in terms of moving low-income families into living-wage careers but, rather, the number of people leaving the welfare rolls, regardless of their reason for doing so or the familial well-being of those who are transitioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886109912475159">Acs &amp; Loprest, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886109912475159">Cherlin, Bogen, Quane, &amp; Burton, 2002</xref>). As enrollment in the program dropped, the nation saw a large number of families move from welfare into wage poverty, and the program did not create financial independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886109912475159">Acs &amp; Loprest, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886109912475159">Shipler, 2004</xref>). Despite the proved effectiveness of alternate strategies for long-term self-sufficiency, such as postsecondary education, PRWORA largely emphasized a “work-first” model and did not allow attendance at college to count toward meeting federal work-participation rates; most states limited access or barred clients from pursuing higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886109912475159">Bok, 2004</xref>). Thus, the expanding class of working-poor families that was created through welfare reform and work-first policies continued to need supplemental benefits to make ends meet (DeParle, 2009).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>I came to tell the story of the patchwork safety net through my own experiences as a mother who has been trying to maneuver this system for the past 12 years. Since my oldest daughter was born in 1999, I have earnestly engaged, challenged, conquered, and been bested by the patchwork social safety net. When I started graduate school, I was encouraged by my advisers to begin taking field notes on my own experiences with the social welfare system and raising my children in poverty.</p>
<p>My personal experiences and field notes became a point of entry into a larger process of inquiry. This article presents a culmination of multiple research efforts that led me to the broader theoretical consideration of the patchwork social service system. From 2004 through 2011, I conducted research on low-income mothers and their experiences of the social welfare system and attempts to obtain a postsecondary education. This research included in-depth interviews with 10 low-income Boston-area single mothers who were current college students or who recently graduated, stopped out, or began the effort to return to college. The participants were recruited through flyers that were distributed to programs serving low-income mothers and network sampling through my personal connections as a local welfare rights advocate. Six participants identified as African American, two as white, and one as Latina. The final participant immigrated from Haiti and considered her race to be Haitian. The youngest participant was 19, and the oldest was 49. The ages of the participants were relatively evenly distributed: two were 19, three were in their 20s, three were in their 30s, and two were in their 40s. All the participants but one, Olivia, had only one child. Their children’s ages ranged from 5 months to 22 years; however, most of the children were younger than age 8. Perhaps, because the study was originally oriented toward postsecondary education, all the participants had at least some college or vocational training beyond high school; however, none had completed a 4-year degree; six participants were currently enrolled in college courses, and two of these participants were upperclassman. Of the remaining participants, two had previously attended vocational programs and were trying to reenroll in college, one had recently stopped out of college and one had graduated with a vocational degree.</p>
<p>In addition, I conducted institutional interviews with nine Boston-area social service administrators, including representatives from the Department of Transitional Assistance, two programs within a child care resource and referral agency, a jobs center, a program for teenage parents, two legal advocacy programs, a housing case manager, and an antipoverty advocacy and resource center. Although my research initially focused on issues pertaining to low-income mothers and postsecondary education, the complexity of navigating social services was a quickly emergent theme across the data. </p>
<p>In addition to my work as a researcher, I began to work as a community advocate for low-income women in the Greater Boston Area during this period. While this advocacy work did not provide data on participants in the same manner as the research methods just detailed, it added to my perspective on this topic in multiple ways. In my work as an advocate, I have scoured through the primary policy documents governing the Massachusetts Temporary Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (TAFDC, which is Massachusetts’s version of the TANF program) and SNAP programs and the federal regulations governing public housing and the housing-choice rental voucher program. I have helped guide low-income mothers through the process of using free tax preparation programs to file for the EITC; lobbied at the statehouse against cuts to programs and services; and attended, presented at, and facilitated multiple community meetings on issues ranging from the affordability of housing to the lack of mental health services in low-income communities. Through this work, I came to attend a monthly legal advocacy training series from 2007 to 2008 through the Massachusetts Legal Reform Institute that further expanded my technical and legal understanding of the programs and policies I already had come to know from experience. The knowledge I gleaned through the combination of these research, advocacy, and training efforts brought me back to my field notes, which I could now integrate into my data as a reflection of a broader and complex social issue that has received too little attention from researchers.</p>
<p>To highlight the complexity of the patchwork labor performed by contemporary low-income mothers, this article presents in-depth accounts of three case studies. These three cases were selected for their relative diversity. Each represents a range of primary sources of cash income (social security, TAFDC, and low-wage work), a range of ages (Jessica was in her 20s, Olivia was in her 30s, and Sylvia was in her late 40s), and a range of housing situations (private-market, public housing, and voucher-based housing). Each case also reflects a broad range of concerns that highlight important themes from the larger data. Thus, these cases illustrate the complexity of negotiating motherhood and providing on the economic margins of U.S. society.</p>

<title>A Balancing Act: Upholding Responsibilities and Meeting Needs</title>
<p>Although all families have needs that must be met, the strategies for meeting these needs are complicated when one’s ability to purchase goods and services is limited. Thus, while families have universal needs for food, shelter, clothing, and so forth, they provide for them in class-specific ways. Many contemporary low-income families combine formal and informal employment with the continuing receipt of noncash social service benefits, such as SNAP, Medicaid, subsidized housing, subsidized child care, emergency assistance, and the use of community-based organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886109912475159">Seccombe, 2011</xref>). What this has meant is that as low-income mothers struggle to meet the intense demands of balancing work and family, they also have to continue the time-intensive task of piecing together in-kind and cash benefits to pad their low wages. Doing so involves traveling from one office to another; repeatedly disclosing intimate and personal information; and documenting, in a detailed paper trail, the legitimacy of one’s story, all in a context in which those with minimal resources are expected to perform at optimal efficiency. Although there is little time to spare in this world, each office treats clients as if they have endless time to waste. Furthermore, poor families are often at the mercy of buses that are late, babysitters who do not show up, overworked caseworkers who misplace documents, and other similar barriers to the successful performance of the role of “good client.” This situation can lead to extreme levels of personal frustration, which add to the hardship and defeatism experienced while engaging this system. </p>
<sec id="section4-0886109912475159">
<title>Olivia</title>
<p>Olivia’s foremost responsibility is to her children. Her life is centered on the importance of giving the best to her two sons, Imani and Oscar. Her second strongest connection is the roots she has planted within her community, which she attributes to the traditions of her African American heritage. When we went out together, Olivia seemed to know everyone, often stopping for quick greetings as she strolled with her boys down the sidewalk. She made it a point to help her neighbors, but she also expected their support in return.</p>
<p>When I interviewed Olivia, she had just ended a long-term relationship with her children’s father, which she described as both abusive and neglectful. Because she felt she could never fully trust or depend on him, Olivia turned to the TAFDC program for financial help that allowed her to care for her children. But because Olivia’s 2-year-old son Oscar was born after she began receiving assistance, he fell under a state family cap policy and was excluded from receiving cash benefits. Thus, Olivia’s family of three was forced to live on a budget that was built to support the bare necessities for only two. As she approached the program’s 2-year time limit, she grew frantic about what she would do when her benefits were cut off. Seeing no future for her sons without furthering her education, Olivia went back to college to complete her bachelor’s degree.</p>
<p>TAFDC allowed Olivia to fulfill her goal to be a highly involved stay-at-home mother for 3½ years. Olivia was able to save money by preparing meals from scratch purchased with her food stamp benefits, relying on her feet and a double stroller as her primary means of transportation, and frequenting local parks and libraries to find activities for her children. Her rent was subsidized through a Section 8 housing voucher, she negotiated utility discounts on her electric and gas bills, and every winter she applied for fuel assistance through the city.</p>
<p>Even though Olivia was able to obtain benefits that many others in her situation struggle to gain access to, she still struggled to use them. Although she had Section 8 housing, it was hard to find an apartment that would accept her voucher, even though it is against Massachusetts state law for landlords to refuse them. Thus, she lived in a small apartment with an unresponsive landlord who did not complete necessary repairs or maintenance. Finding a doctor who would accept MassHealth insurance (Medicaid) was also difficult. However, it was finding a child care provider that proved the most challenging. Many child care centers limited the number of state subsidies they would accept or refused to accept vouchers at all. Even without the constraints of finding a “voucher slot,” high-quality child care is difficult to find, and there are often lengthy waiting lists for good centers; thus having a voucher made an already difficult feat even harder.</p>
<p>Olivia was happy to find a preschool with an open voucher slot for Imani, but even though the center provided infant and toddler care and was accepting new cash-paying families, it did not have a voucher slot open for Oscar. She continued to search, finally enrolling Oscar in a family child care center, but quickly came to question whether he was thriving. She constantly worried about the level of care the center was providing to her baby, and eventually she no longer felt comfortable leaving him there. But try as she might, between workfare hours, classes, appointments, and parent-coop obligations at Imani’s preschool, she could not find another center for Oscar that would accept her voucher. Instead, she opted to leave him with her mother.</p>
<p>A neighbor gave Olivia an old station wagon, which made it possible for her to get around to her many daily locations. Each morning, she would wake up early, get the boys ready for school, drive Imani to preschool, and then drive another 30 minutes to her mother’s Boston suburb to drop off Oscar. Then she would head back into the city to her morning class, afterward heading across town to her welfare-mandated “volunteer” workfare position where she worked daily from 1 to 5. Then she was off again to pick up Imani and brave Boston rush-hour traffic to get Oscar. This situation was taxing on Olivia’s energy, and the time away from her children deeply saddened her. Furthermore, paying for gas and car maintenance was draining on Olivia’s minimal finances. When her car broke down, getting Oscar to her mother’s house became too difficult, and she began taking him to work with her while she continued to search for a new child care center.</p>
<p>Child care is a basic imperative for any parent who is working or who is a student. Past research with low-income families has documented the safety and well-being of one’s children as the number one imperative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886109912475159">Scott, Edin, London, &amp; Mazelis, 2001</xref>). However, the funding for the income-eligible child care voucher program in Massachusetts is highly restricted. My institutional interviews revealed that the waiting list is 12–18 months. In addition, there are complex eligibility requirements to maintain a voucher. Through the TAFDC program, Olivia was able to get around this waiting list; yet, she still struggled to find child care that was safe and reliable for Oscar. Because of low reimbursement rates, child care centers heavily limit the number of vouchers they accept. The majority of child care facilities I have contacted had only one or two “voucher slots” per classroom. Thus, Olivia’s story illustrates a larger dilemma whereby public assistance dollars are not accepted as equal to cash.</p>
<p>Olivia’s life entails a juggling act of meeting obligations, managing crises, and maintaining her central roles as both a loving mother and a responsible provider. The multiple programs she must patch together to support her family reflect minimal consideration for the lived realities that make meeting their guidelines and requirements difficult for families. If, for example, the utility assistance office is open only from 1 p.m. until 4 p.m. and Olivia’s workfare hours are from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., what are her options for preventing sanction from the Department of Transitional Assistance while still getting the electricity turned back on? If Olivia is reported for bringing Oscar to work with her, she could be sanctioned and lose her cash assistance, but she has been offered no help to find a caregiver who will take her voucher and provide good-quality care for him. Where is he to go while she completes the work hours required to keep the funds that pay her rent and support her children? And what about Olivia’s own needs? When is she to find time to address her past domestic violence trauma or take care of herself in any way for that matter?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0886109912475159">
<title>Sylvia</title>
<p>When Sylvia is in public, she is friendly and conversational. But Sylvia lives a lonely life, in a body that prevents her mobility and inside a small public housing apartment where she spends most of her days and nights. While she has a lust for life, she feels constrained in her ability to act on it both by her physical limitations and her limited pocketbook. Also an African American single mother, Sylvia is in her late 40s and has struggled to survive in poverty her entire life. Although her son George is now 21 years old, he has had difficulty finding a job and continues to live with her. As a disabled person, Sylvia receives about $800 a month in Supplemental Security Income through the Social Security Administration and SNAP benefits of about $200. Living in public housing, her rent and utilities are capped at one third of her income. Because Sylvia’s disabilities severely limit her mobility, she cannot feasibly leave the house without a ride, but she cannot afford to own a car. She often asks George to do errands for her, but he is often out, and she cannot fully depend on him.</p>
<p>Living with her adult son also presents specific challenges for Sylvia both emotionally and in terms of her ability to maintain her household financially. After several sanctions for not obtaining paperwork from George that was required by the Department of Transitional Assistance, Sylvia had to have his portion of SNAP benefits terminated to prevent constant power clashes with her son and delays in her benefits. However, it is impossible to have him removed from her public housing case as long as he continues to live with her. This situation has also presented her with difficulty in obtaining necessary documentation. Because the housing authority is not in communication with other state agencies, the burden of proving his income fell to George, which ultimately, because it affected her ability to stay in her home, fell on Sylvia. Because he did not have a job or any source of income, the housing authority required George to fill out a “zero income packet.” This packet included four forms that had to be completed at four separate and distant offices to certify that George <italic>did not</italic> receive benefits through them: the Department of Transitional Assistance in Revere, the Unemployment Office in downtown Boston, the social security office in Somerville, and a public notary before whom George had to sign a sworn statement that he did not receive any other income. When Sylvia and George ventured to the social security office, they were told, after waiting 2 hours, that under a new policy, the office would not complete forms for people who were not receiving benefits. The waste of Sylvia’s time and the effort she made to arrange transportation for the trip were disregarded by her housing manager who shrugged saying, “Oops, I forgot.”</p>
<p>Getting around to social service offices is in itself complicated for many low-income people. Transportation requires time—often a lot of it if you rely on public transportation. Furthermore, social service providers themselves are not always located in convenient places for the public transit system; the costs of fares can also be prohibitive. Yet, welfare-to-work-style programs addressing transportation have failed effectively to eliminate the majority of transportation-related barriers for low-income mothers and leave out women like Sylvia who are unable to look for work because of a disability or other reasons, such as the need to care for young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886109912475159">Blumenberg, 2000</xref>). While Sylvia lives relatively close to a subway line, getting to the Department of Transitional Assistance office requires transferring between three different lines each way and more walking than her disabilities allow. Several times Sylvia has experienced an interruption in her SNAP benefits because she had no ride. Although the Department of Transitional Assistance does allow disabled clients to meet with caseworkers over the telephone, the telephone lines are usually busy, and the voicemail boxes are often full.</p>
<p>Transportation is not only an issue for Sylvia in terms of getting to the Department of Transitional Assistance, but makes all the tasks of daily living difficult for her. To get to the grocery store, the doctor, assistance appointments, or just about anywhere for that matter, she relies on rides from family members, friends, or neighbors. But the generosity of her family and friends often wears thin because Sylvia is entirely dependent on them for mobility. Knowing that her requests for rides are perceived as an imposition, Sylvia finds it hard to ask. She tries to avoid asking for rides by taking taxis or softens the guilt by offering gas money during the first week of the month when she still has a little bit left over from her social security check. But after paying her rent, telephone bill, and cable bill and picking up her prescriptions, she has only about $100 left, enough for only a couple of taxi rides, a little gas money, and part of the nonfood household goods for the month.</p>
<p>While there are programs available in Boston that offer door-to-door transportation to people with disabilities, overcoming the bureaucratic difficulties of obtaining access to the program can be a barrier. Sylvia has applied multiple times for “The Ride” (as this program is called) only to be told that her doctor has filled out the form in a manner that deems her ineligible. But even if Sylvia got access to The Ride, it may not fully alleviate her transportation needs. In interviews with users of “The Ride,” they said that they appreciated having transportation, but complained about its unreliability. Those who rely on inconsistent or unreliable means of transportation face repercussions for being perceived as unreliable or uncaring.</p>

<title>Jessica</title>
<p>Jessica is a 24-year-old Caucasian mother who recently graduated from a cosmetology program, ended a relationship with her daughter’s father, and moved back to Boston from New York. Through a referral to a friend’s landlord, she found a three-bedroom apartment, sight unseen, for $1,000 per month, a price so low it is nearly unheard of in Boston. She got a job at a salon near her home, but because she was paid as an independent contractor, her income varied depending on the number of clients she served in a given week and the cost of services. </p>
<p>Like Olivia, Jessica struggled with finding child care for her 2-year-old daughter Beth. First, she had a neighbor’s daughter babysit Beth while she was at work, but she struggled to earn enough to get by and found it was hard to pay the babysitter. She then had to turn to less reliable strategies by asking friends, family members, and neighbors to watch Beth as a favor on a day-to-day basis. Although Jessica tried to access the state’s child care assistance voucher program, she was told that it would be a 2-year wait before she could receive a voucher. Through my advocacy training, I told Jessica that if she received TAFDC benefits, she could get a voucher right away. So, even though she was working full time, Jessica applied and was deemed eligible because her wages were low and inconsistent. Through TAFDC, she was able to connect with cash assistance, SNAP, and MassHealth insurance benefits, as well as an immediate child care voucher. She used the voucher to send Beth to a family child care provider in the neighborhood who Jessica said, “isn’t perfect, but I just try not to think about it because I don’t have another choice.”</p>
<p>Maintaining her housing costs was also extremely difficult. Even though she had found a lower cost apartment, after rent and utilities, Jessica found herself unable to break even, let alone have anything extra. Trying to reduce her housing costs, she applied for every public housing and Section 8 waiting list in the Greater Boston Area, including the western suburbs, but was told that the waiting list was 3 to 5 years for public housing and even longer for Section 8.</p>
<p>During the work day, on breaks and between clients, Jessica often found herself on the telephone making calls to local charities to inquire about emergency assistance programs to help prevent the shutoff of utilities or eviction. Usually these calls provided nothing but dead ends. With the help of a friend, Jessica was able to figure out how to get an application for fuel assistance; produce the necessary income documentation by typing up a letter for her boss to sign and photocopying her paychecks; and take extra time during her lunch break to deliver the paperwork.</p>
<p>TAFDC participants and those transitioning from “welfare to work” have the most integrated system of case management. These clients have one caseworker who administers their cash, SNAP, MassHealth, and child care subsidy. But as Jessica’s income went up, she transitioned off the TAFDC program. She then had to maintain each of her state benefits separately (SNAP, MassHealth, and subsidized child care) which, for working-poor families, are administered through separate offices, have various renewal deadlines, and require different sets of documentation. This situation requires the working poor, whose time is already extremely stretched with the balance of work and family, to engage separate case managers, visit separate locations, individually apply for services, and provide duplicate documentation.</p>
<p>Although as a working-poor mother Jessica was able to claim the EITC, she did not think of this program as among the many public assistance programs she utilized. Perhaps, she did not think so partly because of the nature of this program as a tax credit, which both required less public display or stigma to claim and being a component of tax returns—a universal aspect of American life—did not “feel” like a public assistance program in the same way. Also, because the extra money from her EITC refund was distributed only once per year and quickly dried up with back bills and forgone necessities, it was not a reliable source of ongoing income in the way that monthly public assistance programs are. Furthermore, despite the added benefit of the EITC, her wages were not able to make up for the reduced level of assistance she received, and she found herself getting nowhere, a trend known as “the cliff effect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886109912475159">Dinan &amp; Cauthen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Because these benefits plus her wages were insufficient to support her basic needs, Jessica spent her days off visiting family members in the suburbs to do her laundry, traveling to local food pantries, searching for emergency assistance programs, and attending mandatory nutrition classes and recertification appointments for her food benefits. She did so, of course, in addition to the other generalized tasks of motherhood: cleaning, grocery shopping, cooking, playing with her toddler, scheduling doctor’s appointments, and performing the other everyday jobs of raising a family. To help alleviate the burden of her housing cost, she decided to bring in a roommate to rent the extra bedroom in her apartment: a single man similar in age to her, but who did not have children. Although Jessica was worried that this was disruptive to her daughter, she found few alternate options available.</p>
<p>While Jessica was able to save her family from the streets by this patchwork of strategies, she did so at great personal cost. She was continuously exhausted; felt torn away from spending time with Beth; and even though she was constantly out and on the go, she felt isolated and lonely with few opportunities to socialize and little time to take care of herself. Because her job is based on commission, her lack of social time had a direct bearing on her ability to develop her clientele and ultimately her ability to earn a living and improve her financial situation. </p>
<p>Many families, like Olivia’s, Sylvia’s, and Jessica’s, struggle to maintain these complicated and seemingly impossible systems. Navigating this field takes place in a broader context in which low-income parents must balance the other needs of their families and care for their children. Each family has a unique set of circumstances that mark their experience, such as the age of the children, disability, health, immigration status, language, domestic violence, or homelessness. In this way, individual situations add complexity to their lives as people work to patch together resources through negotiating the social service system.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While contemplating and doing the work of patchwork survival, I began to learn to sew literal quilts both as a part of my community activism and to celebrate the tradition of learning a craft from my mother. One type of quilt, the crazy quilt, reminds me the most of the patchwork strategy attempted by low-income families. The crazy quilt is made from random strips of fabric of various sizes and shapes that are carefully pieced together without any cohesive pattern or organization; the quilt is brought together only by the creative manipulation of the quilt maker and by her will to make the pieces fit. I know from my first experience trying to make a crazy quilt that sometimes the pieces do not quite fit together, and you get little holes between the patches. A more advanced quilt has a pattern, border, and backing that makes it cohesive, organized, and visually coherent. These qualities also make the quilt sturdier and less likely to have those pestering holes or inevitably to fall apart. Returning to the patchwork metaphor, a patchwork system leaves holes that allow families to fall through the cracks too easily. A coordinated and organized system that is responsive to the holistic needs of low-income families is more effective and more efficient and is sturdy enough to function as a legitimate safety net.</p>
<p>Often when we talk about contemporary social services and supports, we get lost in the patches and fail to acknowledge or see the quilt, how families rely on it, or the work that goes into maintaining it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886109912475159">Edin and Lein (1997</xref>) attempted to understand the more complex systems of survival in their research in the early 1990s. While important, this research did not take into account a postwelfare context in which many entitlements have already ended or a federal deficit crisis through which public assistance has come under attack. As advocates scramble to protect individual programs from the chopping block, we run the risk of getting lost in debates over which patches are most important while failing to acknowledge the ways in which the various programs come together in the lives of families that rely on them simultaneously.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by focusing on one realm of benefits or services, we fail to acknowledge the complexities of the labor of the unspoken shift itself (one exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886109912475159">Goodman and Epstein, 2008</xref>). Only by taking the perspective of women engaging in this unsung labor can we understand the experience of negotiating a system that fails to recognize the work performed by low-income women to navigate it, as well as how program policies and practices impede women’s ability to accomplish patchwork survival successfully.</p>
<p>Seeing the quilt in its entirety and variability is understandably overwhelming. The patchwork safety net is a complex and informal system of seemingly disassociated programs that are often considered too broad to grapple with. In 2009–2010, my friend Sarah, a counseling advocate, and I set out to map the responsibilities and obligations of my labor. On a 12-page list that we taped together like a quilt spread across the dining room table, we wrote out and categorized the different pieces of the puzzle. One square of paper read “Benefits” at the top. “Assemble packet for Section 8 recertification was written on the first line” with subcategories: “(1) get paperwork from landlord, (2) collect proof-of-income letter from work, (3) get letter from daughter’s therapist for a three-bedroom disability accommodation,” each line representing several hours of work to complete. Then the list continued with similarly mapped steps for upcoming deadlines for fuel assistance, SNAP, and MassHealth recertification. And this was only one category at one moment in time listing only those items with immediate deadlines. Work also had a category, then school. Caring for my disabled daughter entailed a long list of tasks, from scheduling school meetings, to therapy appointments, to finding summer camp programs (and, of course, the money to pay for them). And the list went on for 12 pages and was still far from complete. I will be the first to admit that this is a lot to grapple with.</p>
<p>Few low-income women have the training, resources, and connections even to map out their obligations, let alone meet them without feeling frustrated or defeated. This is exactly why we have to talk about issues of poverty from a situated perspective. Moreover, failing to acknowledge the complex labor of the unspoken shift continues the historic devaluation of women’s work overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475159">Crittenden, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886109912475159">Hoschchild, 2003</xref>) and, in particular, the disregard for the value of poor women’s unpaid family labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886109912475159">Dodson, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Ultimately, the patchwork safety net system is ineffective and unreasonably demanding. We eat up women’s time with the work of survival and thus make it impossible for women to work on self-improvement, personal empowerment, or education, thus trapping them in perpetual poverty. The system also takes away from caregiving and thus is a detriment for children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886109912475159">Attewell and Lavin (2007</xref>) wrote of the important secondary effects of a mother’s higher education on children’s long-term success and well-being, primarily because of mothers’ investment of time and energy with their children, increased community involvement, and positive role-modeling, which are impossible if a mother’s time is consumed with the work of basic survival.</p>
<sec id="section8-0886109912475159">
<title>Policy Recommendations</title>
<p>To formulate meaningful policy recommendations in a context of economic uncertainty, political tension, and a focus on reducing the federal deficit, it is important to work within the constraints of the present while simultaneously seeking to build a better system for the future. I have therefore developed policy recommendations based on three assumptions of social change and investment in the safety net for low-income families.</p>
<p>First, given the assumption that the system is not changing for the better and may get worse, we face a situation in which we are stuck with a patchwork. To negotiate a disintegrated social safety net system better, low-income families need improved and more direct access to legal advocates and social workers to serve as conavigators. However, social work and pro bono legal services organizations are largely funded through governmental and foundation grants and face the same funding crises as other nonprofit organizations. Thus, clients have limited access because of busy telephone signals, limited intake hours, and filtering processes that prevent them from getting help.</p>
<p>Access to advocates is essential not only to understand the complex patchwork system, but to deal with how emotionally overwhelming and defeating it can feel. Advocacy both gives legitimacy to a person’s assertion of his or her legal rights and clarifies complex policies in client-accessible terms. When clients better understand their rights, they often share this knowledge throughout their communities, leading to grassroots empowerment.</p>
<p>Yet, this form of legal and social work advocacy does nothing to redesign the patchwork “crazy quilt” itself. So, how do we take the current safety net and resew it into an organized system of support that makes sense? This second approach requires restructuring social services to facilitate an integrated case management system that would substantially reduce the work of the unspoken shift. Clients could simultaneously apply for multiple social services in a single location or even through a single case manager. Furthermore, by facilitating a more one-stop approach to providing social services, programs would cut costs and reduce errors or inconsistencies. The cliff effect could also be reduced through a more centralized system. By considering benefit levels in relation to one another, the system could implement reductions in benefits because of wage increases more gradually, allowing a greater opportunity for mobility. Within this system, families would spend less energy obtaining social services and could use their time better toward meeting immediate family needs, nurturing their children, improving job performance (through increased availability and decreased absenteeism), investing in self-care (e.g., receiving counseling or addressing health issues), or meeting long-term goals through education and training. At a minimum, programs and organizations should increase communication and collaboration to provide more direct systems of referral and access.</p>
<p>In addition, while TANF espouses “personal responsibility,” it simultaneously limits responsibly to one avenue: low-wage work and the continued maintenance of a patchwork support system. Alternate mechanisms for responsibility, such as college study, need to be available, and information about these opportunities must be clearly provided. Through an individualized case partnership strategy, welfare policy could be a mechanism to help families set realistic and meaningful goals. One of the options should be access to higher education.</p>
<p>We must also look deeper to ask why providers are not willing to accept state assistance vouchers and address these concerns and issues proactively to ensure the greater effectiveness of the program. This rejection of vouchers may be due, in part, to low reimbursement rates, which need to be reconsidered in budgetary allotments. It may also have to do with greater bureaucratic requirements, and efforts must be made to minimize bureaucratic barriers for providers who accept state subsidies. It may also be related, as I have heard time and again, to a hegemonic acceptance of stereotypes about poor families that imagine voucher holders as poor tenants, bad parents, or bad patients. To develop policy-based interventions for these ideological rejections, the manifestations of how and why such discrimination occurs needs to be further studied.</p>
<p>The third solution to the tattered safety net requires embracing a universal perspective on meeting human services needs as a societal duty to all citizens. Many scholars have suggested that these types of large-scale changes are the only true solutions to the crises of poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886109912475159">Newman, 2007</xref>). But as policy solutions, these ideas are optimal and may not be immediately realistic.</p>
<p>At a minimum, current funding must be maintained, rather than allowing for further cuts to programs that are already in crisis. Improved budgets could range from restoring previous funding levels, expanding funding to meet the current high level of need given the state of today’s economy, or understanding that meeting human needs is a societal rather than a personal obligation by adopting a universal approach to providing social services to our nation’s population. Understanding that these issues address universal human needs, rather than make up for the faults of the “morally deficient,” we can change the terms of human services and thus the way in which we provide them. The last of these options ultimately requires a transformative shift in societal values that, given recent political contention will most likely be an uphill battle.</p>

<sec id="section9-0886109912475159">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The crisis of social services is in large part a result of the deinvestment in families and continuous attempts to balance federal and state budgets by implementing further cuts to assistance programs that have already been stretched to the point of crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886109912475159">Greenstein, 2011</xref>). Given this situation, poverty advocates must not get caught in a discourse that pits the importance of one program against another. We must remember that all programs are important patches in the safety nets of low-income families and work together to protect these safety nets in their entirety.</p>
<p>Furthermore, given the long-term impacts of the recession and the large number of families who are struggling for basic survival, this is a time to expand social services, as well as opportunities for work and higher education, and to increase our value for women’s work in the home and unpaid labor outside the home to maintain supplemental support. We need to reprioritize supporting families within our national and state agendas and provide both the means to obtain living-wage jobs and to facilitate access to the education and training that will lead to them. We also need to fund and provide integrated and supportive entitlement programs for affordable housing, subsidized child care, universal health care, and a universal living wage. Obviously, we still have a long way to go, but this does not make these goals any less imperative.</p>
