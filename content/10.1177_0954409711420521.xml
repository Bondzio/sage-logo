<abstract>
<p>Maintaining track clearances in ballasted railway tracks are a critical issue for the safety and operational performance of the railway environment. In general, railway standards aredefined with respect to the minimum gauge clearance allowed between the dynamic swept envelope of the train vehicles and the fixed structure for a given vehicle speed. Absolute clearance of a line is categorized based on the clearance level, for example, in the UK, it is defined in terms of normal, reduced, or special reduced clearance. In special reduced clearance, the level of track fixity is defined as high fixity, medium fixity, and low fixity. In high track fixity, a concrete-slab track solution must be adopted; in medium track fixity, some form of ballast stabilization and/or reinforcement can be used. The principal requirement is that using a standard methodology, the clearances should always be greater than zero; the clearance representing the margin for unknown events. In this article, an <italic>in situ</italic> three-dimensional (3D) polyurethane ballast reinforcement technique is used to provide a very robust level of track fixity. The performance of the reinforcement technique is shown through experimental tests using a 200 ton capacity cyclic compression machine. The experimental tests are used to show the performance of the technique for applications like railway tunnels and station platforms where clearances issues are paramount. The base and shoulder GeoComposite experimental tests are performed with the initial ballast poorly compacted thus representing a worse case on-site scenario. Based on the experimental results, a new track fixity category is proposed termed <italic>virtual high fixity</italic>. A case study showing the impact and site application of the 3D polyurethane reinforcement research to Grovehill Tunnel UK is presented and reference is also made to another reinforced clearance issue site at Hoxton Station UK.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954409711420521"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>There are many instances in the railway environment when the fixity of the track has to be improved to ensure that gauge clearance can be maintained. For example, when existing tunnels are undergoing electrification, it is often necessary to lower the track so that the clearance of the overhead electrification equipment can be maintained (e.g. the <italic>pantograph clearance</italic>). Another example is in station environments where it is often necessary to ensure that clearances to station platforms are maintained, either from line speed increases or from different train vehicle types. The clearance can be determined from a variety of methods including laser sweeps and/or by total station measurements. The gauging process is whereby the <italic>dynamic swept envelope</italic> is used to determine the clearance of those vehicles to a fixed structure, termed <italic>gauge clearance</italic>, or to that of other vehicles on adjacent tracks termed <italic>passing clearance</italic>. In the UK, reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711420521">1</xref></bold>] is used to define and maintain clearances. It defines, in clearances to structures and inter-vehicles (C2.1 Table 1 in [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711420521">1</xref></bold>]), as <italic>Normal Clearance, Reduced Clearance</italic>, and <italic>Special Reduced Clearance</italic>. In the latter case, greater control measures are required by the infrastructure operator. The principal requirement is that by using a standard methodology, the clearances should always be greater than zero; the clearance representing the margin for unknown events. The control measures for special reduced clearance include a detailed risk assessment, which covers factors such as the number of vehicles, speeds, track fixity, track maintenance, and consequences of a glancing contact. Of particular interest to this article is the level of <italic>track fixity</italic> required in order to allow the special reduced clearance to be granted. The track fixity represents a ‘known’ parameter, i.e. its affects are classified as a known event.</p>
<sec id="sec2-0954409711420521"><title>1.1 Track fixity</title>
<p>Once the effective position of the track has been determined (e.g. through 3D laser point cloud surveying), an allowance for the gauge clearance and <italic>track tolerance</italic> can be made based on the level of track fixity applied. In reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711420521">1</xref></bold>], this is defined as:</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>High track fixity;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Medium track fixity;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Low track fixity.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Track fixity provides for track movement and the maintenance regime. High track fixity is track that isun-movable and normally relates to concrete slab-track (for example Southampton Tunnel and Hampstead Heath Tunnel, UK). Ballasted track is considered to have a normal vertical operational range of 25 mm; this corresponds to the difference between the maintained (i.e. the high level) and the deteriorated level (i.e. the low level). Values of +15 and −10 mm are used and reflect statistically on the likely position within the maintenance and deterioration cycle, should a section of track be considered at some time. For example, if the track is new, then the appropriate tolerance would be +0 and −25 mm, if it is at the end of its cycle, then it would be +25 and−0 mm. The principle is that the need to apply fixity should reflect the degree of knowledge in the life-cycle position and the need for future maintenance. For untreated ballast, the level of lateral deformation of sleepers can be found from reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711420521">2</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409711420521">4</xref></bold>]. Itdesirable to be able to use an alternative system for ballasted track that can provide a higher degree of track fixity, a good degree of ductility, and still provide high longevity.</p>
<p>This article describes such an alternative system which uses polyurethane reinforcement of the ballast to provide a high degree of track fixity while providing a rapid setting and high longevity solution. This article concentrates on the application of the technology in tunnels and presents cyclic laboratory test data, including test data for the treatment of the ballast at a very low initial compaction. Application of the technology at the Grovehill Tunnel site at Tunbridge Wells, UK and at Hoxton Station on the East London Line is highlighted.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0954409711420521"><title>2 BALLASTED RAILWAY TUNNELS</title>
<p>Ballasted railway tunnels exist across many railway networks. In the UK, many ballasted tunnels were formed during the Victoria era often within earth embankments or cut and cover construction. The linings are often of a brick nature and can extend into the invert, or down to a rock base [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409711420521">5</xref></bold>]. The existence of the rock base, which is often highly irregular, can generate many problems such as track geometry issues (ballast memory) and drainage issues leading to water ponding. If the track is to be lowered then issues surrounding ballast attrition may also manifest due to the higher ballast/sleeper/rock-base contact stresses, especially in the presence of water. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711420521">Figure 1</xref> shows drainage issues at Mound Tunnel Edinburgh. This tunnel was constructed in 1847; the Mound was a made hill formed during the excavation and draining of the Nor’ Loch in Edinburgh. The tunnel lining is made from an outer red brick masonry layer over 1metre thick, followed by up to 300 mm thick blue brick layer followed by 16 sandstone ribs across its length. The presence of water can also have a detrimental effect on the behaviour of concrete slab-track. At both Falkirk High Tunnel and at Grovehill Tunnel, which have paved concrete track (PACT) systems in place, the ingress of water has caused deterioration in the rail fixings. The latter of these two tunnels will be discussed later in this article. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711420521">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the types of problems and clearance issues generated in ballasted tunnel structures, here for uniform inverts. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711420521">Figure 2</xref>(a) shows the issue of gauge clearance, i.e. the minimum allowed distance between the tunnel wall and the dynamic vehicle swept envelope. It is not uncommon for parts of the brick lining to be removed to increase gauge clearance. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711420521">Figure 2</xref>(b) shows that the two railheads can experience a difference in ballast depth due to the curved nature of the invert, this can lead to differing track stiffness and rates of ballast attrition and hence an issue with the cross-level tolerance due to differences in railhead track settlement. This may allow a twist fault to develop. Many tunnels are curved and hence increased lateral forces generate additional concerns of gauge clearance due to lateral track drift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711420521">Fig. 2</xref>(c)). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711420521">Figure 2</xref>(d) shows that differences in the vertical track geometry can generate clearance issues. This can come about through the requirement for track maintenance. In fact, errors in track tamping can also give rise to clearance issues since the track is still <italic>floating geometry</italic>, i.e. not <italic>fixed geometry</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409711420521">Figure 3</xref> shows that the irregular invert can generate longitudinal errors in track geometry leading to clearance issues. At a given location, all three types may therefore be present. These types of track problems may generate undulations in the track geometry leading to rail corrugation and noise and vibration. It is therefore desirable to reinforce/stabilize the aggregate in ballasted tunnels to ensure track tolerances are maintained and to help prevent excessive maintenance. Such a system is now described.

<sec id="sec4-0954409711420521"><title>3 3D POLYURETHANE REINFORCEMENT</title>
<p>Polyurethane reinforcement of railway ballast involves the application of a combined two component system to the track. The polyurethane is classified as a rapidly reacting <italic>urethane cross-linked polymer</italic>. The two components comprise an isocyanate and a polyol which are combined in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting polymer gels within 10 s and reaches around 50 per cent of its stiffness/strength within minutes and around 90 per cent of its stiffness/strength within 1 h. The two components are pumped from separate independent bulk container (IBCs) using <italic>in situ</italic> transfer pumps to a larger electrically driven external pump whereby the two separate components are pumped to a mixing head. The mixing head comprises a static mixer (coiled plastic and/or metal elements) which forces the two components to mix together to form the polymer. The reaction is exothermic. To allow for application in low temperatures, the pumping lines and IBCs are heated. Application is very simple, if the polymer flowrate is known the amount of polymer applied can be controlled in a given area by simply controlling the pouring time. The polymer is not sprayed under pressure; it is simply poured from the application lance (containing the mixing elements). The range of properties of the polymer can be very large, for example, stiffness can typically range from 100 MPa to 2 GPa depending on application. These stiffnesses are controlled through the polymer rheology; other factors that can be modified include the hardness, viscosity, tensile strength, elongation at break, etc. Since the amount of polymer applied to the ballast can be easily controlled, a large range of stiffness, strength, and penetration depths can be achieved. The penetration depth is set by controlling the rheology of the polyol and by modifying the catalyst level. Typical penetration depths are between 100 and 500 mm depending on the application. Details of the system can be found in references [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409711420521">6</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711420521">8</xref></bold>]. As the polymer is applied to the surface of the ballast, it proceeds to penetrate through the ballast matrix to a predetermined depth. During this process, it interconnects to form a three-dimensional (3D) reinforcing cage, termed a <italic>GeoComposite</italic>. While some adhesion to the ballast occurs, the primary purposeof the polymer is to form this 3D reinforcing cage. Since this can be done after ballast compaction, theballast is reinforced in its preferred state. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409711420521">Figure4</xref> shows a cross-section through a typical GeoComposite. The polymer has a high degree of ductility; tensile strains within the polymer can exceed 100 per cent when necessary. Depending on the particular polymer formulated and the amount of polymer applied, the GeoComposite can have a wide range of different stiffness. The effect of increasing the ballast stiffness using the polymer and its effect on the track stiffness has been reported in reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954409711420521">9</xref></bold>]. The increased stiffness of the GeoComposite allows a better load distribution on the formation and thus allows the formation of a <italic>GeoPavement</italic>. The technique, generally referred to as the <italic>XiTRACK</italic> technique, has successfully been applied to many different ballasted track problems and proven to give excellent results [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409711420521">6</xref></bold><sup>,</sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954409711420521">7</xref></bold><sup>,</sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711420521">8</xref></bold><sup>,–</sup><bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409711420521">10</xref></bold>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711420521">Figure 5</xref> shows a typical cyclic compression test at 0.5 Hz on a unconfined GeoComposite specimen. The peak cyclic load is varied to illustrate the GeoComposite performance. In this specimen, the amount of polymer applied only accounts for around 22 per cent of the available void space; the GeoComposite is therefore still highly permeable. The sample was compacted by hand prior to polymer pouring (all ballast used in this article was at Network Rail standard). The figure shows that even when the load is cycled at failure, a high level of material ductility is observed by strong hysteresis in the stress–strain graph. This ductility is very beneficial in the railway environment, especially when considering shock loading conditions, such as those which exist at switch and crossings where discontinuities lead to high-induced impact forces and accelerations, and problems like wheel flats.

<sec id="sec5-0954409711420521"><title>3.1 Initial ballast box test</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711420521">Figure 6</xref>(a) shows an early test on a GeoComposite ‘box’ section which was performed at the UK National Engineering Laboratories. Prior to pouring the polymer, the ballast was compacted by hand; the box size was 600 × 600 × 300 mm<sup>3</sup>. The polymer used in this test was also applied at Points 215D near Bletchley Station on the UK West Coast Main Line in March 2000 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409711420521">10</xref></bold>]. The points were going out of alignment around three to four times per year prior to installation. Over the 10 year trial period that the system was installed, the site required no further maintenance proving that these GeoComposites canhave a dramatic impact on reducing track maintenance. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711420521">Figure 6</xref>(b) shows the minimum and maximum vertical contact stresses for the cyclic compression test shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711420521">Fig. 6</xref>(a). To ensure that no horizontal vibration occurred in the testing machine, a thin concrete cap was applied to give a flat contact surface. This box section was chosen so that a high-frequency compression machine could be used to provide a high number of cycles to determine vertical deformation characteristics. In total, 2 637 480 load cycles were applied to the specimen through a 250 mm diameter circular steel plate with a thickness of 40 mm.
<fig id="fig6-0954409711420521" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Initial ‘box’ test specimen performed at National Engineering Laboratories, UK: (a) compression machine, (b) minimum and maximum cyclic stress amplitudes at a loading frequency of 10 Hz, and (c) permanent (plastic) deformation with load cycles</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711420521-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The results of the vertical deformation versus permanent settlement are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711420521">Fig. 6</xref>(c). The graph shows that after 2.6 million load cycles, the permanent plastic settlement is approximately 0.42 mm. The highest typical stress level existing in tracks for heavy freight trains was quoted at 1250 kPa by Lackerby <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409711420521">11</xref></bold>]; however, track stresses are often around the 500 kPa level. The test shows that excellent cyclic performance can be obtained. This initial test indicates that at low clearance sites, a highly resilient track formation can be achieved, at a high fixity level, within a very short period of time. This value of resilient settlement is consistent with additional tests in the geopavement and accelerated fatigue testing (GRAFT) facility whereby ≈0.5 mm ofplastic settlement was measured when a GeoComposite slab-track was tested over Kaolin clay to 500 000 load cycles at equivalent North American peak axle loads [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954409711420521">9</xref></bold>].</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711420521">Figure 7</xref> shows how the polymer technique can be applied to solve these types of issues in ballasted tunnel tracks. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711420521">Figure 7</xref>(a) shows the problem of track formations overlying irregular bedrock, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409711420521">Fig. 3</xref>(a). To ensure vertical gauge clearance, the polymer can be applied to reinforce the lower ballast, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711420521">Fig. 7</xref>(b). This lower reinforcement forms a surface that is parallel to the rail to help retain track geometry and hence clearance; italso helps prevent twist faults from occurring due to the differing base profiles. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711420521">Fig. 7</xref>(c), the polymer is applied to reinforce the ballast shoulders and the area between the sleepers (the 6 ft). This helps to retain lateral track geometry and hence lateral gauge clearance. A fully reinforced track is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711420521">Fig. 7</xref>(d). The added benefit of this fully reinforced track is that the polymer used to reinforce the track in the lateral direction can be allowed to penetrate into the lower reinforced ballast to form a <italic>U-shaped</italic> channel section around each sleeper. This ties the whole treatment area together, meaning that lateral loading stresses are also transferred into the lower GeoComposite, thus increasing the lateral track resistance even further. The polymer can be applied in many different ways, either the whole ballast area is reinforced prior to the track geometry being reinstated, or through a ladder structure whereby the track geometry is first reinstated then the track is reinforced. This approach allows maximum flexibility to be achieved at installation. If the track is first treated prior to geometry correction, then either the ballast surface would have to be at the exact geometry, or a small upper unreinforced layer is left for post installation geometry correction. The approach taken would depend on the level of fixity required and the order in which the installation would be performed. If a ladder structureis used, whereby the ballast above the sleeper bottom is removed and the ballast area below the sleeper bottom in the shoulder and 6 ft area is reinforced (but not directly beneath the sleeper itself) then, if the ballast is in a relatively clean condition and hence does not require replacement, the track geometry can be ‘captured’ without having to remove any ballast below the sleeper bottom level (i.e. without disturbing the existing track geometry). The upper ballast can then be replaced and the ballast reinforced in the upper shoulder areas to capture the lateral track geometry. In this way, an entire tunnel track can be reinforced within a very short period of time and at a low relative cost. In addition, if track possession periods are available then the tunnel could be reinforced without any additional track downtime required, i.e. within the normal scheduled possessions. Application of the polymer still allows track drainage to occur through the GeoComposite, and hence a stable track platform can rapidly be created.

<sec id="sec6-0954409711420521"><title>4 BASE AND SHOULDER GEOCOMPOSITE TESTS</title>
<p>Two additional polymer reinforced ballast sections are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954409711420521">Fig. 8</xref> prior to pouring of the polymer on the ballast surface. These two specimens are 1100 mm wide × 1200 mm long × 250 mm high slab section, and a 300 mm wide × 1200 mm long × 300 mm high beam section. The slab section represents a typical GeoComposite reinforced section fortunnel floor applications (GeoComposite slab-track). The beam section represents reinforced side ballast to provide lateral fixity to the ballast shoulders, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711420521">Fig. 7</xref>, for tunnels and/or station platforms. Simple wooden shutters were used as the formwork for these sections which meant that virtually no compaction could be applied to the ballast. This was considered desirable since the results obtained would represent a worse case scenario in which ballast in a tunnel was placed and no compaction applied prior to pouring. After polymer pouring, both sections were slightly cemented in the centre to provide a flat loading surface for the loading plates. The side beam section was also slightly cemented along its full length to allow a flat surface onto which the load could be transferred to the flat compression machine platform base (the beam was previously rotated through 90° to simulate the lateral loading mechanism in the tunnel shoulders).

<p>To load the slab section, three stacked 250 × 420 × 130 mm<sup>3</sup> thick steel plates were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409711420521">Fig. 9</xref>(a)). Once the sample was set up for loading in the compression machine, 50 cycles were initially applied at a load of 200 kN and a frequency of0.5 Hz. Then, two monotonic load cycles were applied up to 1000 kN at a rate of 0.02 mm/s before the sample was tested to failure at a monotonic loading rate of 0.05 mm/s. A full sleeper section was not used since the force required to fail the slab would exceed the 200 t capacity of the test rig.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409711420521">Figures 9</xref>(b) and (c) show the load–displacement and vertical contact stress–strain plot of the initial 50 cycles. The effect of the initial poor compaction and the test setup (loading plates, cement, etc.) is seen as an initial 0.4 mm deformation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409711420521">Fig. 9</xref>(b) (the worst case scenario of very poor compaction). In terms of these initial compaction effects, a significant proportion of this initial settlement could be removed by applying the normal compaction procedures applied to railway ballast. Settlement from this source mainly originates from the base of the specimen; this is because the polymer is designed to stop penetrating at a given depth so that drainage layers below the GeoComposite layer would not become blocked. This, however, means that there is usually a lower layer of ballast that is not reinforced (typically around 50 mm). If this lower layer is not compacted prior to polymer pouring; then it can undergo an initial plastic settlement. What can clearly be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409711420521">Fig. 9</xref>(b) is the relatively rapid development of a resilient state limiting any further additional plastic densification. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409711420521">Figure 9</xref>(c) shows these initial cycles plotted in terms of vertical contact stress versus vertical strain. The contact stress applied in this test is significantly higher than the contact stress likely to be seen in normal track operation, again representing worst case scenarios. The development of the resilient state in the GeoComposite is confirmed by theinitial box test shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711420521">Fig. 6</xref> and by testing conventional polymer railway track applications in the GRAFT facility [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954409711420521">9</xref></bold>]. It is worth pointing out that the permanent plastic deformation of 0.42 mm seenin <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711420521">Fig. 6</xref> is within the accuracy of the compression machine itself at the National Engineering Laboratories. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954409711420521">Figure 10</xref> shows the final loading sequence of the specimen, again illustrating the ductility within the sample (similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711420521">Fig. 5</xref>). Plotted in the figure is the equivalent stiffness (obtained from numerical modelling [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954409711420521">12</xref></bold>]). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954409711420521">Figure 10</xref>(a) shows that the sample failed at an applied load of 1390 kN, which correlates to an applied stress of 13.2 MPa; this stress level is over ten times higher than the highest typical stress level existing in tracks for heavy freight trains [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409711420521">11</xref></bold>] and is within the range of the tensile strength capacity of individual ballast particles (12.3–54.8 MPa depending on particle size and ballast type), as found by single particle crushing tests undertaken by Lim <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409711420521">13</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954409711420521">14</xref></bold>]. The plastic vertical strain of the GeoComposite slab section at these high applied stress levels (2 per cent at 1200 kN and 4 per cent at 1390 kN) highlights the significant performance of GeoComposite reinforcement. The high level of applied stress was evident at the end of the test, as it was observed that the cement had started to crush under the loading plates. The vertical slab-track displacement is plotted against the contact vertical stress in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954409711420521">Fig. 10</xref>(b). The graph does not start at the vertical displacement equal to zero point due to the inclusion of the plastic settlement of the previous cyclic loading cases. However, the graph shows that in a real track application case, the likely operating peak transient deflection for freight loading would be around 1 mm even when the initial ballast compaction is poor. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954409711420521">Fig. 10</xref>(a), the equivalent Young’s modulus is 500 MPa, representing the straight part of the strain-hardening curve. The resilient modulus of unreinforced ballast has been investigated by many other researchers through large scale triaxial testing and a range of values have been quoted. Reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954409711420521">15</xref></bold>] adjusted well known ballast model parameters to represent a reasonable change in unreinforced ballast stiffness with induced stress level and found that 50–180 MPa is a reasonable range for ballast stiffness. This range matches well with references [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954409711420521">16</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954409711420521">18</xref></bold>]. At the lower end of this range, the ballast stiffness oftheGeoComposite slab-track increases from 50 to500 MPa representing a 900 per cent increase in ballast stiffness. At the higher range, from 180 to 500 MPa, a 177 per cent increase in stiffness is observed. Given that the ballast compaction was very poor prior to the addition of the polymer, it is likely that the initial unreinforced ballast stiffness was low. One can easily see that addition of the polymer, even in poorly compacted ballast, significantly increases the ballast stiffness. It should be remembered that the polymer properties and the amount of polymer applied can of course be modified to give higher or lower values as appropriate.

<sec id="sec8-0954409711420521"><title>4.2 Lateral beam section</title>
<p>The side beam section was loaded centrally from twostacked 250 × 420 × 130 mm<sup>3</sup> thick steel plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954409711420521">Fig. 11</xref>(a)) to represent the lateral load from the end of a sleeper to a tunnel wall as a train passes. Many different testing cycles were applied to the sample prior to the final monotonic failure test. These tests included an initial ten cycles of 100 kN at 0.016 Hz followed by 1000 cycles of 50 kN at 3 Hz before a further 5000 cycles of 100 kN at 3 Hz where applied. The accumulated plastic deformation after this loading was 0.3 mm [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954409711420521">9</xref></bold>]. An additional 5000 cycles of 200 kN at 3 Hz where applied before two further monotonic load cycles were applied up to 500 kN; the first one at 0.05 mm/s and the second one at 0.02 mm/s. Finally, the sample was loaded to failure at a monotonic loading rate of 0.02 mm/s. The final monotonic failure test is the one that is of particular interest for the lateral resistance study. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954409711420521">Figure 11</xref>(b) shows the load–displacement graph for the final (failure) monotonic test and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954409711420521">Fig. 11</xref>(c) shows the lateral contact stress versus lateral displacement response. It can be seen that the sample failed at an applied load of 730 kN (applied stress of approximately 10 MPa). Within these figures, the influence of the poorly compacted ballast can again be seen at the initiation of the applied load. As with the GeoComposite slab-track sample this initial setup settlement (<italic>albeit</italic> very small here) can be significantly reduced by appropriate compaction of the ballast prior to polymer pouring; but once again a worst case scenario is tested. The vertical plastic strain of the GeoComposite beam section is 0.66 per cent at 550 kN and 1.67 per cent at 730 kN highlighting the significant enhancement of the ballast. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954409711420521">Fig. 11</xref>(b), the lateral secant stiffness at 2 mm lateral deflection is approximately 250 kN/mm. In reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954409711420521">19</xref></bold>], the maximum lateral force in kN that can be applied on UK railway track is:

<p>where <italic>Y</italic> is the lateral force transmitted to the track per axle and <italic>W</italic> the static axle load. An additional consideration is that only lateral forces that are sustained for more than 2 m are to be taken into account. If we assume that an individual G44 sleeper has a lateral load of 100 kN applied to it (for a 25 ton static axle load <italic>Y</italic> = 91.75 kN), and we assume that all this lateral load is to be resisted by the lateral edge beam only (i.e. no lateral resistance is provided by the vertically loaded sleeper base or by other sleepers connected <italic>via</italic> the lateral bending stiffness of the two rails), then the lateral contact stress at the sleeper end is approximately 2350 kPa. This assumption is used since the base must undergo higher lateral displacements in order for its resistance to be mobilized than the GeoComposite edge beam. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954409711420521">Fig. 11</xref>(c), the lateral induced deflection (including the initial poor compaction settlement) is approximately 1.1 mm at a contact stress of 2350 kPa. For this particular GeoComposite, the individual lateral sleeper load (again assuming that all lateral loads are transmitted through the sleeper end only) would have to exceed approximately 411 kN in order to produce a contact stress of 9800 kPa. It should be remembered, however, that in the above test, the lateral load was applied over a testing area of 0.075 m<sup>2</sup>; for the G44 sleeper the end area is much less than this (estimated to be 0.042 m<sup>2</sup> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954409711420521">20</xref></bold>]), and hence the failure contact stress value for this sleeper is likely to be slightly higher than the 9800 kPa measured. If a greater lateral resistance was required, the polymer loading level of the GeoComposite beam could simply be increased. In reality, not all the lateral load would be resisted only by the lateral beam of course, but the experimental results show that a high degree of fixity is possible even when the initial ballast compaction is poor. A Young’s Modulus of approximately 600 MPa is required in order to represent the initial GeoComposite stiffness, again showing that a significant increase in ballast stiffness is achieved when the polyurethane polymer is applied. In reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409711420521">4</xref></bold>], passive end-resistance values for an unloaded G44 sleeper in ‘opentrack’ was measured to be approximately 0.9 kN if the shoulder is level with the sleeper top and 200 mm wide and 2.3 kN if the shoulder width was 600 mm wide (there was little benefit in extending the ballast shoulder width past 600 mm). In terms of the base, sleeper resistance on loose ballast was estimated as 2.1 kN per sleeper. The total resistance of an unloaded sleeper was estimated between 5.9 and 7.3 kN. Similar results were produced by European Rail Research Institute, Committee D202 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711420521">2</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409711420521">3</xref></bold>]. While these results are for ‘open track’ and hence a direct like for like comparison is not possible, they give an indication of the performance enhancement provided by the polymer reinforcement.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0954409711420521"><title>5 DISCUSSION OF GEOCOMPOSITE PERFORMANCE WITH RESPECT TO GAUGE CLEARANCE</title>
<p>As discussed in ‘<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec1-0954409711420521">Section 1</xref>’, Special Reduced Clearance (Table C2 in reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711420521">1</xref></bold>]) allows the use of a higher track fixity condition so that the absolute gauge clearance can be reduced in special circumstances, such as tunnels and station platforms. Based on this study, it is proposed that an additional category be considered that allows ballasted tracks to have an increased level of fixity using polyurethane polymers, hereby called <italic>virtual high fixity</italic>. The results of the vertical slab-track cyclic tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711420521">Figs 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409711420521">9</xref>) show excellent performance of the polyurethane GeoComposite. Even when ballast compaction is extremely poor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409711420521">Fig. 9</xref>), the level of induced settlement (as the resilient state develops) for a cyclic stress state significantly higher than would be expected in track, was approximately 0.63 mm; with approximately 0.4 mm of that settlement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409711420521">Fig. 9</xref>(a)) being attributed to the initial poor compaction state of the ballast and setup effects (loading plates etc). The final level of plastic settlement for the initial box section was only 0.42 mm after 2.6 million load cycles proving the cyclic performance. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954409711420521">Fig. 10</xref>(b), the vertical track deflection (at appropriate track stress levels) indicates approximately 1 mm of movement under load. In the lateral direction, the results show a significant increase in lateral resistance when the polyurethane is applied; for the case considered the results indicate only 1.1 mm of transient lateraldeflection. In both cases, the estimated GeoComposite stiffness is between 500 and 600 MPa. It should be noted that a small level of transient deflection is desirable as it has a positive effect on reducing rail stresses; for example, in concrete slab-track the rail pad stiffness would be designed to give a degree of transient deflection. It is therefore clear that the use of polyurethane reinforcement of ballast can have a significant impact in achieving a high degree of fixity in ballasted track applications where absolute gauge clearance is an issue. In terms of any potential fire issues with using polyurethanesin tunnel environments, this can easily be handled by providing an aggregate protection layer over the GeoComposite. Fire tests for the polyurethane used in this article have shown that by providing this protection layer the Ao(max) value, which is a Standard measure of the smoke emission, can be kept extremely low; significantly lower than for example the values set by the London Underground for their tunnel and station environments. Low values of Ao(max) mean that <italic>light transmittance</italic> values remain high. In addition, the GeoComposite passes the <italic>ignitability of building products</italic> Standard BS ENISO 11925-2:2002. The <italic>toxic fume</italic> Standard BS6853:1999 Annex B.2 also shows that the GeoComposite did not contain any harmful sulphur dioxides, hydrogen chlorides, hydrogen bromides, hydrogen fluorides, or hydrogen cyanides. Given that the properties of polyurethanes can be modified for a wide range of different stiffness, strength and penetration depths, and the amount of polymer applied per track location can be modified, it is clear that polyurethane reinforcement of railway track at gauge clearance problem sites is a significant step forward in track reinforcement and can therefore be considered as a technique to provide virtual high fixity within a given tolerance range (depending on the particular standard applied).</p>

<sec id="sec10-0954409711420521"><title>6 TRACK APPLICATION OF THE GEOCOMPOSITE RESEARCH</title>
<p>Grove Hill Tunnel no. 21 is located on the TTH line between Tunbridge Wells and Wadhurst stations in the UK. The tunnel is of the single bore, double track type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954409711420521">Fig. 12</xref>(a)), and was opened to traffic in 1851 as a fully ballasted tunnel. In 1986, the central drain in the tunnel was filled in and a concrete PACT system installed in order to ensure the gauge clearance. However, prolonged water ingress into the tunnel caused severe deterioration of the concrete track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954409711420521">Fig. 12</xref>(b)). Ultrasonic readings taken in 2005 indicated delamination of the PACT slab with the lower concrete base slab. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954409711420521">Figure 12</xref>(c) shows that water ingress also caused deterioration of the rail fixings resulting in the fitting of tie-bars in December 2004 to prevent gauge spread and rail overturning [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954409711420521">21</xref></bold>]. In 2007, the last 100 m of the PACT slab on the up and down lines towards the London end of the tunnel and the apron outside of the tunnel (24 m) was replaced with a polyurethane reinforced track slab [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954409711420521">22</xref></bold>]. In addition to replacing the PACT slab, the central 6 ft drain was also reinstated. This drain connects into the existing outfall. A polymer reinforced transition was also provided at both ends of the renewed track. The major parts of the tunnel lie within moderately strong siltstone/fine sandstone sequences. The tunnel serves both passenger (13 T, 20 T) and freight (25 T) rolling stock. The line speed is 25 m/h.

<sec id="sec11-0954409711420521"><title>6.1 Site inspection and investigation</title>
<p>A site inspection of the tunnel took place on the 20th August 2006. Deterioration of the slab track and the ingress of water into the tunnel were clearly observed. Poor vertical geometry at the wooden transition beams outside of the tunnel was also seen and measurements of the track dimensions taken.</p>
<p>Mean uniaxial compressive strength of the rock in the tunnel range from 7.5 to 18 MN/m<sup>2</sup> depending on the horizon [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954409711420521">23</xref></bold>]. Coefficients of horizontal permeability are around 1.7 × 10<sup>−6</sup> cm/s. Some areas of the tunnel floor were clayey in nature, but these were not thought to be excessive. The formation of a level surface at the base of the tunnel prior to re-ballasting meant that some areas of the base were stillconcrete. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954409711420521">Figure 13</xref> shows a cross-section of the track constructed at Grovehill Tunnel which is ofthetype shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711420521">Fig. 7</xref>(d). The only addition tothis design is an upper maintenance/geometry correction layer (between the bottom of the GeoComposite and the sleeper bottom). This was stipulated by the client to aid geometry correction at renewal and to aid any future maintenance (if required). The GeoComposite used in the treatment is similar to the one tested in this article. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954409711420521">Figure 14</xref> shows the installation of the polymer in 2007 at Grovehill Tunnel, here in the station area. The formation of the lower GeoComposite slab-track and the upper GeoComposite side beams can be clearly seen. The polymer in the beam sections was also set to penetrate into the lower GeoComposite slab to form the U-shaped channel section discussed earlier. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954409711420521">Figures 14</xref>(a) and (b) show the application lance, illustrating that the polymer is simply poured. The vehicle in the background contains the pump and the IBCs. The yellow squares represent the timing areas to ensure that the correct amount of polymer is being applied. Since the polymer reaches its strength very rapidly, installation of the polymer was performed much quicker than a conventional concrete slab-track system. This means that the track superstructure can be replaced within minutes of the lower ballast being reinforced. Since installation, performance of the system has been excellent even though the small unreinforced layer was stipulated. It is likely that this upper unreinforced layer would not be required in future installations since a ladder structure for the upper ballast layer can provide the necessary fixity once the final track geometry has been achieved. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954409711420521">Figure 14</xref>(c) completes the discussion on Grovehill Tunnel by showing the completed installation. Since Grovehill Tunnel was completed, there have been many other installations across the UK railway network at gauge clearance issue sites. A typical example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954409711420521">Fig. 15</xref> at Hoxton station on the East London Line to provide lateral gauge clearance. This track forms part of the line used to support the 2012 London Olympics. Since 2010, the technology has now been applied outside the UK.

<sec id="sec12-0954409711420521"><title>7 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>In this article, the testing and application of a rapidly reacting 3D polyurethane reinforcement technique, to ensure that gauge clearance issues on ballasted railway track can be maintained, has been presented. The article presented the results of a typical unconfined cyclic compression test, a ‘box’ sample test for high frequency loading and a lower frequency slab and side beam tests on a typical tunnel section of the GeoComposite. The development of a resilient state in the GeoComposite was highlighted through the box test and through the slab-track and side beam tests. The testing showed that if the ballast is not compacted prior to polymer application (worst case scenario), then a small initial plastic settlement will likely be observed, typically around 0.4 mm. If ballast compaction is applied prior to pouring then this value significantly reduces. The resilient state was developed with an additional plastic settlement up to 0.42 mm. The tests suggest that an additional category for track fixity, termed <italic>virtual high fixity</italic> could be developed with polyurethane reinforced railway ballast techniques in mind. To show the benefit of the research undertaken, the application of the 3D polyurethane reinforcement technique at Grovehill Tunnel was presented. In this example, typical problems observed around PACT concrete tunnel tracks were discussed and the application of the polymer to the base ballast and the lateral side beams was presented. Feedback from the local maintenance team on track performance since installation of the system has been excellent. In addition to Grovehill Tunnel, the installation of the system at Hoxton Station was also highlighted as a further gauge clearance issue example.</p>
