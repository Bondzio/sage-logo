<p>The history of the Italian scientific documentary is not very well known nor, with the exception of the pioneer efforts in cinema, is it contemplated in the more complete studies of the evolution of the genre. This article aims to outline the ground covered by Italian scientific cinema in the first 50 years of its existence, from the pioneering works by Roberto Omegna to the industrial documentaries of the 1950s.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The history of Italian non-fiction film-making is not well known in Italy and almost completely overlooked abroad. Retracing the steps of its development sheds light on the way in which science was understood and represented by film-makers, researchers and spectators. Italian documentary cinema was long identified with films which, disinclined to use narrative structures, relied on shots of small animals and natural phenomena, often reproduced in the laboratory. During the “rurality” period the Istituto Luce, in line with the Fascist political programme, accompanied their laboratory reconstructions with scenes of agrarian landscapes. From the 1950s, riding the wave of enthusiasm caused by the “economic boom,” government documentaries recreated Italy’s media image, transforming it on screen from an agricultural nation to an industrial power. Given the scarcity of bibliographical material available in the English language on this subject, this paper will attempt to outline the evolution of the genre in its first 50 years.</p>

<title>2. Between the insane asylum and the laboratory</title>
<p>Over telegraph lines the news travelled from Italy to Ireland. Radio waves carried it on to the United States. On February 23, 1908, the <italic>New York Times</italic> announced: “Moving Pictures of Clinics. Prof. Negro Successfully Uses Them to Demonstrate Nervous Diseases.” On February 17 the Italian scientific-didactic documentary was officially born in Turin, entryway for French influences and the country’s cinematographic capital. “An unusual audience and show yesterday at the Ambrosio Biograph! The hall which usually holds a crowd that peels oranges … to watch the exhilarating scenes of the jealous wife … was packed with a balding and spectacled scientific audience,” recounted the reporter for the <italic>Gazzetta di Torino</italic> the following day, enthusiasm slightly muted by <italic>bourgeois</italic> snobbery. The film shown, about two hours in length, was <italic>La nevropatologia</italic> (“Neuropathology”), a collection of 24 neuropsychiatric case histories. This was the first Italian film produced for use in university courses or at scientific meetings. <italic>Metteur en scène</italic>, Roberto Omegna, would play a central role in the history of the Italian scientific documentary up to the Second World War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0963662511412142">Tosi, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>In the years immediately prior to this screening the physiologist Osvaldo Polimanti – who in 1920 published, in German, a proper introduction to scientific cinematography entitled <italic>Wissenschaftliche Kinematographie</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0963662511412142">Polimanti, 1920</xref>) – inspired by Etienne-Jules Marey, had filmed the neuromotor system of dogs whose frontal lobes or cerebellum had been cut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0963662511412142">Polimanti, 1920</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662511412142">Cappozzo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662511412142">Dibattista, 2010</xref>: 125–192; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0963662511412142">Lorusso et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963662511412142">Figure 1</xref>). The same production company, Ambrosio Film, had ostensibly already produced films in 1907, since lost, with titles like <italic>Dottor Isnardi: amputazione</italic> (“Doctor Isnardi: Amputation”) and <italic>I rettili</italic> (“Reptiles”) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0963662511412142">Vascon Vitrotti, 1970</xref>: 37; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511412142">Gianetto, 2000</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Nevertheless, these films had a limited range of influence. It seems that Polimanti’s short films were never shown to the public; only a few stills were used to annotate an article published in <italic>Archiv für Anatomie und Physiologie</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0963662511412142">Polimanti, 1908</xref>). The two films mentioned by Ambrosio Film were never even reviewed; if indeed they existed, they were soon forgotten.</p>
<p>A history of forerunners could become a <italic>regressus ad infinitum</italic>: how should the shots of lands devastated by earthquakes and eruptions, typical of early Italian cinematography, be classified? Naturalistic films, entertainment or newsreels? <italic>The List of Silent Films Made in Italy since 1904</italic>, as the historian Maria Adriana Prolo reported in the early 1950s, “is desperately like a list of destroyed or lost valuable incunabula or rare drawings …. The tendency to attribute earlier production dates, to boast of non-existent collaborations, to set back the date of events to one’s advantage, was the constant cause of the errors that have been found for years in the recollection of our silent cinema” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0963662511412142">Prolo, 1951</xref>: 6, 89). <italic>Neuropathology</italic>, a “vertical anatomical chart” able to demonstrate “the writing of <italic>movements</italic> that cannot be reproduced with photography alone”, as the reporter for the <italic>Gazzetta di Torino</italic> commented, was never properly distributed to the general public (like the majority of medical films). However, it was, uniquely, screened in prestigious scientific assemblies, even at the Salpêtrière. In this way, it earned discreet appraisal in the European academic world, becoming the first Italian film of scientific content to be well known and discussed in Italy and abroad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662511412142">Bernardini, 2002</xref>: 108–110).</p>
<p>The case of Professor Negro, a neurologist at the University of Turin, was not an isolated one. As early as 1910, a debate had started to take shape in Italy on the potential of an educational cinema yet to be created. Works on the subject “Medicine and Surgery” were published in the journal of cinematographic culture, <italic>Lux</italic>. These testified not only to the use of Negro’s films in university didactics, but also to the films produced by Gaetano Rummo, pathologist at the University of Naples. After having tried his hand, in 1889–90, at filming the hysterical women at the Clinic of Siena with Marey’s “photographic revolver,” Rummo moved on to proper cinematographic technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0963662511412142">Rummo, 1890</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0963662511412142">Pazzi, 1898</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511412142">Cardillo, 1987</xref>: 33–37).</p>
<p>To corner the Italian market (excluding the educational films of Gaumont and Pathé), instructional films were shot “reproducing with admirable fidelity the superb harmonies of nature, the marvellous conquests of genius, the glorious splendours of science and human progress” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0963662511412142">Zoboli, 1913</xref>). Many enquirers into the human soul, such as the psychiatrist Giuseppe D’Abundo, and the father of criminal anthropology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662511412142">Cesare Lombroso (1900)</xref>, who perhaps had not yet watched a screening, imagined the “psychotic” possibilities of the cinema, since “some cinematographic projections, insignificant for many, and which do not cause particular emotional states in the majority of spectators, can be dangerous for subjects [with a particular predisposition] and even, at times, cause pronounced mental disorders” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662511412142">D’Abundo, 1911</xref>: 434). Nonetheless, by the second half of the 1910s most resistance had been overcome, so much so that discussion began about the possibility of using cinema as a teaching aid in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0963662511412142">Raffaelli, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662511412142">Brunetta, 2008</xref>: 64–66; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0963662511412142">Toschi, 2009</xref>: 80–84).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662511412142">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>With their interest in psychiatry and neurology, Italian film-makers followed in the footsteps of psychiatrist Jean-Martin Charcot, borrowing the underlying contradictions in his “theatrical” didactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511412142">Didi-Huberman, 1982</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963662511412142">2</xref></sup> The “obsession for seeing” (or “scopo-anxiety”) inherent in the culture of late positivism, had already created a series of devices, which, with the suffix “rama,” offered a guarantee of seeing. However, conscious of the difference between the original and a reproduction, the first who tried their hand at creating films were wary of ingenuous epistemological assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511412142">Bertozzi, 2008</xref>: 33–42). As well as scenes portraying “hydrocephalics of every type, idiots, imbeciles and feeble people who laugh and are stupidly frightened under the surveillance of nuns and caretakers,” according to the reviewer for <italic>Il Café-Chantant e la Rivista Fono-cinematografica</italic>, on November 19, 1908, most remembered from <italic>Neuropathology</italic> is the case history in which a hysterical female patient, with a mask over her eyes, is shown having a by-the-book crisis which takes place in front of a painted backdrop: the theatrical setting indicating the artificiality of the scene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511412142">Farassino, 1983</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963662511412142">Figure 2</xref>). So, was the case history a “documentary film” or a “docu-drama”? In an era in which the concept of cinematographic acting had not yet been developed, the status of a person who appeared in a film was not very different from that of a person shown in a picture postcard: names of the performers were not recorded. As a consequence, documentary films tended, in part out of thrift, to tautly reproduce reality, rather than record it naturalistically.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0963662511412142">3</xref></sup> Therefore the distinction is a modern one.</p>

</fig>
<p>Whilst scientific-didactic medical films were shot thanks to the initiative of academics desirous of emulating colleagues north of the Alps, soon the production of naturalistic films passed to director-cameramen, who, acquiring increasingly specialised professionalism, were able to tap into a profitable market segment. A perfect example can be found in the experiences of the photographer Roberto Omegna. Omegna was most likely inspired in Paris by the scientific work produced by Francis Martin Duncan for Urban Bioscope, with whom he had in common a technical virtuosity. Duncan’s work however, had a playful dimension, almost completely missing in Italian films (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511412142">McKernan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662511412142">Boon, 2008</xref>: 7–32). Thanks to his association first with the financier Arturo Ambrosio, second with Luciano De Feo, director of the Istituto Luce, a cinematographic production company created during the Fascist period, Omegna became the central figure in Italian scientific cinema until the end of the Second World War. During his time in Turin, besides his scientific-didactic production, he experimented with a wide variety of documentary types: naturalistic adventure films, for example <italic>Caccia al leopardo</italic> (“Leopard hunt”) (1908), a true blockbuster in Europe and the United States; ethnographic reports, for which he undertook journeys to Latin America, Asia and Africa, including <italic>Matrimonio abissino</italic> (“Abyssinian wedding”) (1909), considered to be “the first Italian ethnographic film, although it was not filmed in a strictly scientific style” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511412142">Calisi, 1960</xref>: 39);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0963662511412142">4</xref></sup> and films on natural catastrophes, such as coverage of the earthquake that hit Sicily and Calabria at the end of 1908, <italic>Disastro di Reggio e Messina</italic> (“Disaster at Reggio and Messina”) (1909). The last was criticised for its verity, and was part – together with films of production companies S.A.F.F.I.-Comerio, Itala, Cines, A. Croce &amp; C. – of the first mass media event, succeeding in unifying Italy more effectively than the efforts of many politicians.</p>
<p>Characteristic of Omegna’s activity was his focus on the micro-world, creating entomological documentaries or, during his collaboration with the Aquarium and Zoological Station of Naples, imaginative footage of marine biology, that anticipate the work of Jean Painlevé (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0963662511412142">Tosi, 1979</xref>: 49; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511412142">Bellows and McDougall, 2001</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0963662511412142">5</xref></sup> Omegna seems to have been inspired by the French tradition in the elaboration of narrative structure. While his films did not match the compelling screenplays of similar films made abroad, they were not burdened with the macabre melodramatic tone that these films at times suffered from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662511412142">Gaycken, 2005</xref>: 123–141). Omegna was a virtuoso with the film camera: as early as <italic>Vita delle farfalle</italic> (“Life of butterflies”) (1911), he used expedients that reveal the painstaking attention to detail with which he planned his shots: he artificially heated the environment to accelerate metamorphosis, even though he filmed in July; he did not feed the insects, so that once freed, instead of scattering, they would fly toward flowers beaded with water; and finally, he used spaced out shots, to show a much longer process in a shorter time frame.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0963662511412142">6</xref></sup> This, and the majority of Omegna’s films to follow, adopted an intermediate level of language, aimed at both specialists and the general public. This broad approach, seen separately from its historical context, might appear limited, but it was fairly common in the cinema of the time. The strength was the illusion of movement, which was alone enough to stimulate audience curiosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662511412142">Gunning, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Until the First World War, the Italian documentary was the result of pre-industrial activity, based on export, and characterised by a lively polycentrism. Turin’s Ambrosio specialised in exotic and ethnographic micro-naturalistic films, thanks in part to collaboration with tireless traveller Giovanni Vitrotti, who, in 1913, in Turin, founded the innovative but short-lived production house Leonardo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662511412142">Bracco et al., 2001</xref>). The Neapolitan A. Croce &amp; C. preferred the romantic landscape tradition, producing sensational naturalistic documentaries, often featuring Vesuvius or “picturesque” natural catastrophes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511412142">Bruno, 1995</xref>). Rome’s Cines, which also produced socio-entomological films such as <italic>Le api</italic> (“Bees”) and <italic>La malaria</italic> (“Malaria”) (both in 1911), chose to focus on tourist-landscape and proto-industrial films. Milan’s S.A.F.F.I.-Comerio produced three series entitled <italic>Il baco da seta</italic> (“The silkworm”) (1909), but soon abandoned the naturalistic genre to concentrate, under different company names, on war and current events documentaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511412142">Bernardini, 1980–82</xref>).</p>
<p>It is also important to note the individual efforts by “bystanders” who, although they only devoted themselves to the seventh art (cinema) for limited periods of time, showed originality and, in a few cases, started new trends. First and foremost was explorer-photographer Vittorio Sella, screen-writer and producer of <italic>Sul tetto del mondo</italic> (“At the top of the world”) (1910), on the Duke of the Abruzzi’s 1909 expedition to Karakorum. This film opened the way for a double variation on the mountain documentary: 1) the <italic>stricto sensu</italic> alpine film, which would soon be consecrated in the wartime epic. The First World War was, for Italy, a war which took place in the trenches, “waited for” more than fought in the Alps. For this reason, many newsreels, in addition to describing the Italian encampments, also introduced naturalistic digressions; 2) the adventure documentary, in which film-makers such as Arrigo Frusta, Giovanni Vitrotti, Mario Piacenza and others were put to the test. In <italic>Crociera aerea del decennale</italic> (“Air cruise of the decennial”) (1933), which documented the transoceanic flight made in 1933 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the birth of the Italian Air Force, Mario Craveri achieved the artistic peak of the genre, making use of futuristic experimentalism.</p>
<p>The advent of the feature film and the closure of foreign markets because of the First World War caused a crisis in the production of documentaries and a simplification of production sites, which led to the concentration of activity in Rome. Omegna moved there, bringing with him numerous films he had produced on his own (later given to the aforementioned Istituto Luce). The cosmos that he had painstakingly painted, inhabited by small animals who fought for life to the rhythm of epic symphonies, had always favoured familiar phenomena, nevertheless capable of revealing magical sensations. Fascist propaganda read into it what it wanted. With reference to <italic>La vita delle api</italic> (“Bees’ life”) (1924–25), for example, a reviewer in <italic>Domenica del Corriere</italic>, on October 9, 1927, commented that, “if a black and white drawing (for example the profile of Mussolini) was left in one of our beehives, we would see that drawing reproduced in a honeycomb frame …. Bees offer the most typical example of the Fascist regime in the natural world …. Therefore, the bee is an early fascist, nay, a primitive fascist.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0963662511412142">
<title>3. Laboratory or countryside?</title>
<p>Founded in 1924, the Istituto Luce soon earned a dominant market position, both for its political coverage and because it was not very cooperative with pre-existing agencies working in similar production activities. Fascist culture only began to take advantage of the educational-propagandistic potential of the cinema in the late 1920s. Up to that point, it had preferred to use printed materials. During the years of the “battle for grain,” Mussolini’s campaign to help Italy achieve self-sufficiency in grain production, the job of official culture was, “to ruralise Italy, to take the scholar, the Italian artist out of the city” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0963662511412142">Spaini, 1929</xref>). For this reason, an Agricultural Cinematheque was immediately created – followed by the institution of other, less active, thematic film libraries – in order to produce, distribute and preserve films on agricultural subjects.</p>
<p>In this context, the Istituto Luce redefined the agrarian landscape in documentary. Abandoning the tradition of “languid romantic views,” which still dominated outdoor films, it offered an image of fecund nature, ready to be rationally exploited by the <italic>homo oeconomicus</italic>.</p>
<p>But what was the best way to bring these films to the countryside and small towns which did not have cinemas, but where more than half of the Italian population lived? The solution, already used by previous institutes, was to create travelling cinemas, called cinemobiles or, in some areas even floating cinemas, following the course of rivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963662511412142">Figure 3</xref>). Together with experts and agriculture teachers, organisations of hygiene propaganda and local institutions, cinemobiles (blessed by the Catholic Church with formulas created ad hoc) became de facto guarantors of the projection of such films, otherwise inaccessible in Italian rural areas. The countryside entered the cinema; and the cinema, meaning the government with all of its control and propaganda, entered the countryside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662511412142">Mariani, 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0963662511412142">Toschi, 2009</xref>: 53–168). The collective viewing of a film was often carried out ritualistically. The release of <italic>La battaglia del grano</italic> (“The battle for grain”) (1925) was, for example, an event: projected on the same day, at the same time, in the 20 largest cities in the nation, it arrived in the squares of over 2,500 towns the following week. Making reference to the “field army,” the language used was often martial. Mussolini himself admonished, “It is necessary … to update agricultural practices where they are lingering in outdated procedures, reach every corner, to the last village, to the last man!” The totalitarian Fascist plan, intended to reach and educate/regiment every citizen, discovered in this way, at least in theory, the segmentation of the cinematographic market.</p>

</fig>
<p>The Istituto Luce produced countless agricultural-propagandistic films, some of which were distributed only in specific areas, according to the crop or the technical issue addressed. Nevertheless, the enthusiasm for rurality declined around the middle of the 1930s, for reasons related more to political changes than to the pursuit of its objectives.</p>
<p>Healthcare organisations participated significantly in the creation and distribution of documentaries on hygiene and health education. The proper life style and good food could eliminate every disease. A glass of wine wouldn’t hurt anyone. Italians had to appear to be athletic and buxom: weight loss, more than any other symptom, was, as is mentioned in <italic>Tubercolosi</italic> (“Tuberculosis”) (<italic>c</italic>.1930), the expression of incorrect hygiene. Open-air athletics would help the youth, often protagonists of hygiene-healthcare propaganda films, to grow up healthy. The young were inculcated with a sort of “sun mystique,” or the conviction, which emerges clearly from the countless films on gymnastics, that health depends on a sort of “vital-energy flow” balancing insufficiencies. This flow was usually attributed to the light of the sun, but sometimes, as in <italic>Istituto foto-radioterapico di Napoli</italic> (“Naples Photo-radio-therapeutic Institute”) (<italic>c</italic>.1925), with prodigious X-rays. In short, “the basic aim … is no longer to create fear of bacilli or to indicate how to combat disease, but … to popularise the concept of prevention, preserve health, fortify physical constitution and train the body for greater resistance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0963662511412142">Thomalia, 1930</xref>: 543).</p>
<p>Proof of Fascism’s growing interest in cinematographic culture was Mussolini’s inauguration, on October 28, 1928, of Rome’s planetarium, which for approximately 50 years would be the site of conferences and the showing of documentaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662511412142">Andrissi, 1930</xref>). The year had not yet come to an end when, on November 5, in the presence of the king, the Duce, with all the pomp appropriate for the occasion, celebrated the creation of the International Institute for Educational Cinematography, an organism of the League of Nations with headquarters in Rome. He headed it with journalist and cinema expert Luciano De Feo, who, after leaving the Istituto Luce, played a key role in proposing fruitful foreign influences in Italy, as was soon seen in the creation of the Venice Film Festival.</p>
<p>The International Institute for Educational Cinematography strove to favour the production, distribution and exchange of educational films between member countries. Nevertheless, productive activity came to a standstill several times, as in the case of the <italic>Cinematographic Medical and Surgical Encyclopaedia</italic>, a collection of films that were meant to record the “performances” of the greatest professionals in the field. Its production ran aground in the shallows of various ad hoc commissions. The institute was, above all, the setting for vocationally multi-disciplinary theoretical discussion, expressed in the pages of the <italic>International Review of Educational Cinematography</italic>, later called <italic>Intercine</italic>, published in five editions (Italian, English, French, Spanish and German), which dedicated a few issues to themes like hygiene and agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0963662511412142">Taillibert, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662511412142">Druick, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>La canzone dell’amore</italic> (“The song of love”), the first Italian talking film, was shown in Rome on October 7, 1930. Some warned that the technological revolution introduced in narrative movies would wipe out theatre, others that letting a didactic film talk would diminish the role of the teacher – the film should be an aid, not a substitute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0963662511412142">Mazzatosta, 1978</xref>: 159–169). While in the first case commercial motives pushed people to overcome their fears, in the second, less tied to the market, cultural qualms, pedagogical anxieties and the inability of teachers to acquire mastery of the new teaching tools prevailed, so much so that for a few more years part of the Istituto Luce’s didactic production remained silent. In this “mutism,” the Italians followed the model of the German UFA (Universum Film AG), with which collaborations and exchanges flourished following a first agreement in 1928, before the signing of the so-called “Rome-Berlin Axis.” This was a pact of friendship between the two nations and a prelude to their wartime relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511412142">Argentieri, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662511412142">Laura, 2000</xref>: 71–73). It is no surprise that the Istituto Luce was in harmony with a production house that, in the guidelines of its documentaries, prescribed the filming of “Germany’s landscapes, historic places, spas and recreational resorts … the achievements of German technology … the hygienic and social measures instituted by our major businesses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662511412142">Kreimeier, 1999</xref>: 23).</p>
<p>In the Fascist period, newsreels described the inauguration of “manly” scholastic buildings or “autarchic” factories, inflating expectations of Italians with a rhetoric of modernity complementary to that of ruralism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0963662511412142">Pettena, 2004</xref>). But when speaking of “official” science, they offered an academic and packaged image. For example in <italic>Sua Santità Pio XI e Sua Eccellenza Marconi inaugurano la nuova stazione a onde ultra corte</italic> (“His Holiness Pius XI and His Excellency Marconi inaugurate the new ultra-short waves station”) (1933), instead of the scientist, it was the pontiff who surprised us, in <italic>pluralis maiestatis</italic>, with the way in which “the human mind sees … a vision so distinct, measures with measurements so exact that the eye cannot see them and the hand cannot reach them.” Consistent with that thesis, scientific dissemination played the role of a “laboratory dye,” able to show with its virtuoso techniques – magnification, delay, high-speed, etc. – that which exists, but cannot usually be seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662511412142">Landecker, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>While the Istituto Luce’s agrarian documentaries and, in part, the hygiene-healthcare films, embraced the charms of the landscape, the films made by the company’s scientific section, appropriately called “laboratory” and directed by Omegna, continued to prefer interior shots. “The Laboratory of a Modern Doctor Faust” by the Istituto Luce, described in the July 1934 edition of the <italic>International Review of Educational Cinematography</italic>, was said to have “time-lapse film cameras, film cameras that could be attached to microscopes, cameras for microscopic photos, lamps for illuminating infinitesimal bodies, thermostats for conducting and maintaining bacilli cultures at special temperatures, lenses of every kind” and, naturally, terrariums, special animal cages, etc. The image of the amateur cameraman-director, now called the “professor,” changed into that of a scientist since he, too, worked in a laboratory. Nature is explicitly reconstructed in film, rather than captured in its spontaneity, as is made clear in the film <italic>Come nasce un cortometraggio</italic> (“The birth of a short film”) (1942), by Vittorio Solito. In showing a scene of rain created with water cannons, the voice-over instructs, “do not cry deception.” In almost Baconian terms, it was nature that had to adapt to the documentary film-maker’s needs. A review explained, “Professor Omegna … went to a lot of trouble to raise and, let us say, educate the insects …. Just consider that mantises lay their eggs at night and the light necessary for the photography shoot would have impeded them from giving birth. Hence the necessity to patiently accustom the insects …” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662511412142">Colosi, 1936</xref>: 179).</p>
<p>The painstaking accuracy with which Omegna produced dozens of films, thanks in part to meritorious aides, such as Gabriele Gabriellian and Eugenio Bava, earned him numerous awards, as in the cases of <italic>I fiori</italic> (“Flowers”) (1934), <italic>Uno sguardo al fondo marino</italic> (“A look at the seabed”) (1936) and <italic>Un mondo meraviglioso</italic> (“A marvellous world”) (1938). Several of his films were points of reference for a long time, more for meticulous microscopic shots than for his spare dramaturgy, although towards the end of his career, on occasion make-believe colours the narration, such as the affairs of the Cheese-eating family, protagonists in <italic>Topi in trappola</italic> (“Trapped mice”) (1939). Some of his films were later taken apart and used to create new works in the period following the Second World War, when funds were short. For example, scenes from <italic>Vita della zanzara</italic> (“Life of the mosquito”) (1940), were reused in the more narrative film <italic>Anopheles</italic> (1950) by Giampiero Pucci. With the fall of Fascism on July 25, 1943, followed by the closure of the laboratory and the transfer of the Istituto Luce to Venice, an important phase in scientific dissemination in Italy came to an end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662511412142">Laura, 2000</xref>: 36–43).</p>
<p>In the years between 1931 and 1940 it is possible to distinguish at least four periods of political-cinematographic inspiration which correspond to as many political phases in a regime increasingly megalomaniac: 1) ruralism; 2) gentrification; 3) the march toward creating an empire; 4) mobilisation for world dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662511412142">Brunetta, 2003</xref>: 84–86).</p>
<p>After the ruralist drive ran out of steam, while conventional products that were unable to stand on their own outside of the laboratory accumulated, echoes arrived from abroad of ethnographic and social criticism films by masters such as Robert J. Flaherty, Joris Ivens and John Grierson. On the tail of these stimuli, a debate on the epistemological status of the documentary was carried out in the second half of the 1930s in the pages of journals like <italic>Schermo</italic>, <italic>Cinema</italic> and <italic>Bianco e Nero</italic>. In particular, <italic>Man of Aran</italic> (1932) by Flaherty, winner at Venice of the Golden Lion for Best Foreign Film, did not astonish so much “for the knowledge it imparts about the geological structure of a certain island; but for the artistic value of this, in all honesty, documentation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511412142">Barbaro, 1939</xref>). Some only rewarded films that were “pretty” or those able to “beautify” the reality that they represented. “Continued effort is made to render a film attractive … with shots from below looking upward, charming angles, close-up shots, characteristic faces” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511412142">Alberini, 1939</xref>). The dusty Italian documentary was desacralised, with films such as the dreamlike <italic>Gente del Po</italic> (“People of the Po Valley”), by Michelangelo Antonioni (not released until 1947).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the academic discipline of medicine was undertaking a separate journey into documentary. The fields of physiology and surgery in particular turned cinematography into a research tool. However, the results did not always achieve the quality of films produced abroad. A misunderstood figure worthy of study is Gianni Palazzolo, a professor of veterinary sciences who worked between 1913 and 1914 with the Turin production houses Itala and Leonardo, on medical and micro-naturalistic documentaries, like the internationally admired <italic>La circolazione del sangue</italic> (“Circulation of the blood”) (1913). Good quality films were shot, starting in 1914 under the direction of Vittorio Putti, at the Orthopaedic Hospital Rizzoli in Bologna. Roentgen movies, which were aestheticised representations searching to free themselves from corporeal materiality, or narrative reports so vivid as to seem to be feature films, were fairly well distributed in scientific circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0963662511412142">Tartarini, 2003</xref>: 175–192).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0963662511412142">7</xref></sup> In Turin, Giuseppe Vicarelli, an expert in obstetrics, shot a few films, including one in 1923 showing a delivery by Caesarean section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0963662511412142">Vicarelli, 1925</xref>). “The importance that direct viewing can have in these cases, even in the face of long descriptions, is clear to everyone,” commented surgeon Roberto Alessandri in an article in the <italic>International Review of Educational Cinematography</italic> in May of 1930. That same year in Madrid, at the Fourth International Conference on Urology, Alessandri was acclaimed for two of his films on kidney operations produced by the Istituto Luce. Surgical cinematography had matured since the improbable virtuosi scenes of Doyen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963662511412142">Lefebvre, 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0963662511412142">8</xref></sup> Finally, between 1941 and 1946, the film-makers Francesco Pasinetti and Pietro Lamperti shot some surgical documentaries at the hospitals Rizzoli in Bologna and Fatebenefratelli in Milan.</p>
<p>In 1932–33, the histologist Giuseppe Levi – mentor of Nobel Prize winning scientists such as Salvador E. Luria, Renato Dulbecco and Rita Levi Montalcini – invited Omegna to Turin, and had an anti-vibration pedestal built for him in the university basement to guarantee the quality of the (spaced out) micro-shots of cells cultivated in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0963662511412142">Levi et al., 1934</xref>). Even the endocrinologist Nicola Pende, at the time considered the most promising biomedical researcher in Italy and soon to be the first to sign the <italic>Manifesto of Racist Scientists</italic> (1938), had a long-term dalliance with the world of cinematographic production. He had the Istituto Luce produce documentaries, including <italic>Posso io diventare un atleta?</italic> (“Can I become an athlete?”) (1936), screened in Berlin on the occasion of the Olympics, at an international conference on sports medicine and during the meeting of the Hitler youth organisations. In the film, each viewer was asked to choose the sport that best suited the biotype that nature had given him! (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0963662511412142">Figure 4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0963662511412142">9</xref></sup> This “advice” could be traced back to theories on race, granted greater attention in German cinema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0963662511412142">Schmidt, 2002</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Also in the 1930s, the engineer Ernesto Cauda wrote a well-informed handbook on scientific cinematography, <italic>Il cinematografo al servizio della scienza</italic> (“The cinema in the service of science”), expressing his hope that the medium be used not only for the documentation of results, but also for their production, in other words, as a research tool. He included an extensive bibliography in which only a couple of titles (on metapsychic phenomena) were in Italian, indicating how little researchers were studying the issue in Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662511412142">Cauda, 1935</xref>).</p>
<p>The Second World War quenched the enthusiasm of many. Immediately after, the <italic>Association internationale du film scientifique</italic> was founded, and Italy joined in 1949 with a commission for scientific cinematography. Its headquarters were selected by the National Council on Research, which later, much more so than the universities, hosted production activities, projects and events aiming at producing and distributing research documentaries. The commission allowed Ugo Cerletti, well known supporter of the use of electroshock therapy, to produce a film on <italic>Fisiologia comparata dell’elettroshock</italic> (“Comparative physiology of electroshock”), shown at the first world conference on psychiatry, held in Paris in 1950 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662511412142">Cerletti, 2006</xref>: 37–39, 219–226). Although it remained inactive at length because of a lack of funding, from 1956 to 1964 the commission published, in collaboration with other agencies, a journal entitled <italic>Cinema e scienza – televisione</italic>.</p>

<title>4. An all-Italian miracle</title>
<p>During the period of post-war reconstruction and the Marshall Plan, films produced by the European Recovery Program arrived in Italy to orient its political choices, elevate it culturally and introduce it to the <italic>American life style</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511412142">Anania and Tosatti, 2000</xref>). Films were created that showed surgical operations after an on-the-job accident, like <italic>Dobbiamo vivere ancora</italic> (“We still have to live”) (1948–50), by Vittorio Gallo. The voice-over explains that “in a certain sense, even our nation is receiving a kind of plasma to cure us of the disasters of the war. We receive the raw materials that are as important for our economy as blood is for the human body.” At the end of the operation, a perfect success, the patient-Italy is reminded that healing-reconstruction “is up to him now, only him!” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511412142">Bertozzi, 2008</xref>: 106–114).</p>
<p>In the newly formed Republic, Enzo Trovatelli was appointed head of the reconstituted scientific laboratory of the Istituto Luce. The institute was a captive of Omegna’s style, by now inadequate for representing the anxieties and impulses of a deeply changed society. “The field of the documentary … lagged behind all the other countries in the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662511412142">Freddi, 1994</xref>: 229). Microscopes and models, men in lab coats and farmers: these were the protagonists of the films in the series <italic>Incontri con la natura</italic> (“Encounters with nature”), inaugurated with <italic>I fiori</italic> (“Flowers”) (1953), a film that, while of value for the highly skilled time-lapse shots, is basically the colour version of Omegna’s classic. Trovatelli incarnated the ideal of meticulous, institutional and reassuring paradidactics, often developed with the help of famous scientist-administrators like Domenico Marotta, director of the National Institute of Health, where he produced <italic>Virus</italic> (1956). Trovatelli cultivated a circle of young talents, including Fausto Saraceni, Romolo Marcellini, and Virgilio Tosi, director of, among others, <italic>Le cure parentali</italic> (“Parental care”) (1958), which produced accurate aquatic shoots in the laboratory, and <italic>I roditori</italic> (“Rodents”) (1959), framed at the beginning and the end by sequences that hark back to <italic>Topi in trappola</italic> (“Trapped mice”). Tosi, who also led the way in the fields of didactics and the theoretical consideration of the scientific documentary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0963662511412142">Tosi, 1984</xref>), inherited the direction of the laboratory in the 1970s. His debut as a film director was <italic>La vipera</italic> (“The viper”) (1975), which later competed with a few “concept films,” short documentaries shot of a phenomenon while it was happening, like <italic>Formazione delle nuvole</italic> (“Cloud formation”) and <italic>Formazione delle tempeste</italic> (“Storm formation”) (both in 1976) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662511412142">Laura, 2000</xref>: 243–253). Finally, when the Istituto Luce became a joint-stock company, its tendency to produce industrial and naturalistic-tourist films for third parties was consolidated.</p>
<p>For documentaries that portrayed nature without necessarily reproducing it in the laboratory, one had to work outside of the Istituto Luce. Francesco Alliata, the “prince of images,” was the first, starting with the production of films like <italic>Cacciatori sottomarini</italic> (“Underwater hunters”) (1946), for which he developed an iron case to hold the film camera, or <italic>Tra Scilla e Cariddi</italic> (“Between Scilla and Cariddi”) (1948), shot with the help of a hyposcope, which allowed film-makers to shoot underwater without immersing the equipment. He then created Panaria, an underwater film production company, which presented the young Folco Quilici to the public with <italic>Sesto continente</italic> (“Sixth continent”) (1954). The film was such a success that it made a name for Quilici and was the beginning of a long career as a marine (and other) documentary film-maker, with works that earned multiple awards, like <italic>L’ultimo paradiso</italic> (“The last paradise”) (1956), <italic>Tikoyo e il suo pescecane</italic> (“Tikoyo and his shark”) (1961), <italic>Oceano</italic> (“Ocean”) (1971) and <italic>Fratello mare</italic> (“Brother sea”) (1974) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662511412142">Ballardini, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662511412142">Cafiero, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>With the war, the nation lost its African colonies, which had for a long time enriched newsreels and documentaries, more with the aim of enlivening the screenings with exotic scenes, than of informing spectators about the life of distant peoples. In the 1950s, many ethnographers turned their attention to the “primitives next door,” giving visibility to situations in Italy’s southern regions considered by the central government to be embarrassing cultural fossils which the so-called “economic miracle” would soon sweep away.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0963662511412142">10</xref></sup> Starting from the time of the first Italian Conference on Ethnographic Film Studies, in 1956, and the first Festival of Peoples, in 1959, opportunities to meet became more frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0963662511412142">Marano, 2007</xref>: 10–27), and the field developed as a result. In southern Italy (specifically Lucania and Salento), the “Ernesto De Martino style” of cinematography arose, where films were shot “with the aim of providing an accurate demonstration of the obscurantist influence of the Catholic church on popular culture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511412142">De Martino, 1996</xref>: 85). The films established a genre in Italy that achieved a fair level of success for at least 20 years. Among these, besides a few cinematographic encyclopaedia entries never brought to light, were: <italic>Magia lucana</italic> (“Lucanian magic”) (1958), <italic>Stendalì</italic> (“They still sound”) (1959), <italic>Passione del grano</italic> (“A passion for wheat”) (1960), <italic>La taranta</italic> (“The tarantula”) (or “The tarantella”), <italic>Il ballo delle vedove</italic> (“The widows’ dance”) and <italic>I maciari</italic> (“The magicians”) (all from 1962). These were little masterpieces, which developed a generation of film-makers, including Luigi Di Gianni, Michele Gandin, Giuseppe Ferrara, Lino Del Fra, Cecilia Mangini and Gianfranco Mingozzi.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0963662511412142">11</xref></sup> Doubts were raised later (in the 1970s and 1980s) about where science ended and art began. Were these auteur films or documentaries? Diego Carpitella, a director himself, complained that “one has the impression of always viewing an <italic>auteur</italic> film, which is contradictory from a scientific point of view” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511412142">Carpitella, 1977</xref>: 27).</p>
<p>Ethnography aside, experience of the war and comparison with foreign models created a desire for a realistic approach. This led to the creation of the reportage documentary which, unlike the Neorealist portrayal of urban destitution, bestowed on the (particularly industrial) landscape, an unheard of scenic presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662511412142">Grasso, 2007</xref>). <italic>Le ricerche del metano e del petrolio</italic> (“Finding methane and petroleum”) (1951), a multiple award winning energy epic composed by Virgilio Sabel and sponsored by the National Research Council and Agip (General Italian Oil Company), is an anthology of the techniques in use. In this film, the taste “for the world of exact sciences is linked to improved cinematographic technique …. As with a tap on pool balls, which bump into each other and return to the point of departure, the short film states with simplicity the principles that the phenomenon of the echo are based upon,” commented an enchanted reviewer from the journal <italic>Cinema</italic> (May 15, 1951). The same triumphalist style characterises <italic>Latina: dall’uranio all’energia elettrica</italic> (“Latina: From uranium to electrical energy”) (1963), directed by Sabel and Trovatelli for Simea (Southern Italian Atomic Energy Corporation) and Agip.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0963662511412142">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the 20 years of Fascism, a few films were inspired by modernism to give an industrial image of that which, for the most part, was not yet industrial. The “factory cinema” of the 1950s was a direct descendant of these. The results were at times surprising, as in <italic>Acciaio</italic> (“Steel”) (1933), by Walter Ruttmann, able to unite the functional elements of a melodramatic story with those of a realistic setting in the steel factories of Terni, in central Italy. In the post-war period important industrial concerns riding the wave of progress, commissioned screen representations of future techno-urban paradises, discussed in monographs, conferences, journals and festivals. For instance, entrepreneur Adriano Olivetti called upon directors such as Virgilio Sabel, Giorgio Ferroni, Michele Gandin and Nelo Risi, who shot films in which the ethical-aesthetic message lies in the exaltation of the factory <italic>life style</italic>, “a working cell aimed at justice for everyone, attentive to the well-being of the family, considerate of the arrival of children and, finally, participatory in the very life of the place” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0963662511412142">Olivetti, 2001</xref>: 100). Industrialist ideology, on one hand, led to the discovery of promising young talents, like Ermanno Olmi, director for Edisonvolta, perhaps the most powerful industrial group of the time, of an anti-decadent <italic>Venezia città moderna</italic> (“Venice: A modern city”) (1958). The film promoted the plant at Porto Marghera, located within the city limits of Venice, with elegant travelling shots and editing by analogy (e.g. the shot taken between the tower of San Marco and a smokestack). On the other hand, it confirmed that technological development had only positive aspects; sacrifices, if necessary, were to be made by animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0963662511412142">Perniola, 2004</xref>: 134–136).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0963662511412142">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>After having director Ubaldo Magnaghi shoot <italic>Le vie del metano</italic> (“The ways of methane”) (1952), in which, amidst glittering machines, it is predicted with pride that “in 1952 the production of petroleum and gasoline will reach 120,000 tons,” entrepreneur and public official Enrico Mattei, with the creation of Eni (National Hydrocarbons Corporation), embarked on a project to update the image of the peninsula. He commissioned a film from Joris Ivens in which “the celebration of company and Italian glories was forceful without sinking into propaganda” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0963662511412142">Perrone, 2001</xref>: 63). The operation went even further: <italic>L’Italia non è un paese povero</italic> (“Italy is not a poor country”) (1960) is a poetic union of ancient and modern. The film revealed the contradictions of the “Italian economic miracle,” recounting “the distribution of methane in the Po Valley, the story of two trees (an ancient olive tree and a technological ‘Christmas tree,’ as it is called, the equipment that controlled the entrance to the petroleum wells), the marriage between a Sicilian girl and a man from northern Italy who worked on an off-shore platform” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511412142">Bertozzi, 2008</xref>: 144). Meanwhile, the political situation had moved to the right, and the film was judged to be too explicit. Rai, then with a monopoly on Italian television transmission, broadcast only an incomplete version, and blocked its circulation in Italy and abroad.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0963662511412142">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Who watched the industrial films? Although the making of these films required significant economic and human resources, for the most part they never entered normal film circuits, but were screened at expositions, festivals, meetings, etc. They were produced with the knowledge that they would perhaps be viewed more by critics than spectators. Industrial cinema, “not much in demand and not well-distributed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662511412142">Camerana, 1971</xref>: 43–44), was never able to escape from an underlying contradiction: it was not constrained by pleasing the (non-paying) spectators; however, it had to yield to the will of the client. Nevertheless,
<disp-quote>
<p>the high-quality industrial film exists. It says little or nothing about the company, it rambles …. It seems to be a donation …. The director of the industrial film must not, at least not right away, make money for anyone, ideally he must inform, impart positive associations, convince. And it has another great advantage: its public has such poor faith in the possibilities of the medium that it tends to compliment any effort that is not evidently schizoid. As for the client, in Italy … it has limited itself to a minimal form of censorship: cutting that which is unrelated.

<title>5. Conclusions</title>
<p>This article has attempted to reconstruct the history of Italian scientific cinema in its first 50 years of existence. One of the dominant models throughout the period considered was that of the laboratory. On one hand, rather than portraying “free” nature, a reproduction of it was filmed “in captivity,” in an indoor cinematographic studio, providing an image made of explanatory scale models, graphics, tables, test tubes and microscopic shots. On the other hand, the life of the laboratory was adopted as a model of work efficiency, so fascinating as to push the film-makers, who often asked to be called “professors,” to set up professional cinematographic laboratories supplied with the most modern equipment. Interest in biological sciences (botanical and zoological) and micro-naturalistic phenomena was constant up to the Second World War, while there was little curiosity about the physical and chemical sciences and macro-phenomena, such as astronomy (these were focused on from the 1960s, a period not covered here).</p>
<p>The “discovery of the landscape” did not take place until the Fascist period, when numerous films were shot on agrarian topics. It was an expression of Mussolini’s totalitarian regime: with rural cinema not only did the countryside enter the cinema, but the cinema, in the sense of government control, entered the countryside. At this time, the foundations were laid for “industrialist modernism,” only fully expressed beginning in the 1950s with the industrial cinema.</p>
<p>Within the academic world it was above all the physicians who took advantage of the didactic and popularisation potential of cinematography. Nevertheless, films served to communicate about science, not to perform it. Cinematography’s potential for research, excepting a few cases, was relatively neglected until the Second World War. It was then that the development of visual anthropology in Italy allowed for (amid numerous difficulties and contradictions) the creation of a high quality ethnographic cinema, which was a way both to carry out and to communicate research at the same time. It did not last long, however, the period of its greatest creativity concluding at the end of the 1970s. By bringing to the screen scenes of life in the countryside, often censored by the official media but fairly successful abroad, Italian ethnographic cinema played a counterpoint role to the glossy productions of the industrial cinema.</p>
<p>The “official” Italian scientific cinema, making no attempt to appeal to market tastes, remained inhibited, well beyond the Fascist period, by its close links to the institutions keeping it alive. Financed by apposite commissions which were often highly politicised, it not infrequently produced didactic films, in which some attention may have been paid to technical virtuosity, but little or nothing was done to renew the worn-out dramaturgical clichés used. It was rare to find original productions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0963662511412142">15</xref></sup> Even the renowned Roberto Omegna in his later years reworked the communicative styles tested in his youth.</p>
<p>On January 3, 1954, the first regular programme on Italian television was broadcast. Science needed to find new ways to be communicated on the screen, and television was to provide a new resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511412142">de Ceglia, 2011</xref>). But that is another history.</p>

<p>The use of spaced out or time-lapse shots is documented as far back as 1900, when Wilhelm Pfeffer, of the University of Leipzig, published a work in which he presented the results of research carried out in the cinema on geotropism and plant growth. In 1902, Lucien Bull and Antoine Pizon turned to the microscopic world, filming the growth of a colony of Botrylli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0963662511412142">Thévenard and Tassel, 1948</xref>: 3–42; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511412142">Bull, 1994</xref>).

<p>We should also mention Vittorio De Seta and Fiorenzo Serra.

In light of the myth of progress, it demonised farmers, particularly those of the South, as bearers of a “barbarous” subculture. Finally it is necessary to recall the cinematographic encyclopaedia Conoscere (1952–1955), directed by Gandin. In this framework episodes such as “Water”, “Barometer” or “Chlorophyll” were shot.</p>
