<abstract>
<p>Prevailing policy and practice in the field of transition emphasizes the importance of designing services and supports based on research-based practices. We reviewed every article published across the 35-year history of <italic>Career Development and Transition for Exceptional Individuals</italic> (CDTEI) to document methodological trends in research focused on equipping youth and young adults with disabilities for adulthood. Although experimental research articles have assumed increasing prominence within the journal since the late 1980s, the vast majority of published studies could be characterized as primarily descriptive in focus. While almost one quarter of research articles involved some type of intervention evaluation, only 25 studies reported using research designs that could allow causal claims to be made. The data collection approaches used in these studies were quite diverse, with self-report surveys and questionnaires representing the dominant approach. We summarize the current methodological legacy of CDTEI and offer some modest recommendations for where the field might go next in its efforts to conduct rigorous research that enables youth with disabilities to flourish.</p>

<body>
<p>For more than three decades, the field of secondary education and transition has focused on the task of equipping youth and young adults with disabilities to flourish in their schools, workplaces, and communities. Although the language of “outcomes” has dominated the dialogue on transition, this collective work is fundamentally concerned with supporting young people and their families to have a high quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2165143413475659">Turnbull, Turnbull, Wehmeyer, &amp; Park, 2003</xref>). Indeed, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA) indicates a principal purpose of special education is to “prepare [students with disabilities] for further education, employment, and independent living” within national policy aimed at “ensuring equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.” Although this vision has still yet to be fully realized for many people with disabilities, the field of secondary education and transition has made impressive strides toward expanding opportunities and improving outcomes attained by students with disabilities during and after high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2165143413475659">Newman, Wagner, Cameto, Knokey, &amp; Shaver, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A constellation of factors has worked in tandem to shape the design and delivery of transition services and supports for students with disabilities over the past 35 years, including federal legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2165143413475659">D. R. Johnson, 2012</xref>), policy initiatives (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2165143413475659">Shriner &amp; Bellini, 1994</xref>), advocacy efforts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2165143413475659">Greenen &amp; Phelps, 1982</xref>), funding investments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2165143413475659">Rusch, Kohler, &amp; Hughes, 1992</xref>), model development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2165143413475659">Kohler &amp; Field, 2003</xref>), self-advocate stories (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2165143413475659">Lubaroff, 1988</xref>), and innovative practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2165143413475659">Kohler, DeStefano, Wermuth, Grayson, &amp; McGinty, 1994</xref>). It is the particular contribution of empirical research, however, that is the focus of this present article. Research in the field of secondary education and transition has played a prominent role in both spurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2165143413475659">Blackorby &amp; Wagner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2165143413475659">Halpern, 1990</xref>) and guiding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2165143413475659">Hughes et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2165143413475659">Test, Fowler, et al., 2009</xref>) efforts to improve transition experiences of young people with disabilities and their families. The enduring question for the field of secondary education and transition is as follows: “What must be done to make a meaningful and sustained difference in the in-school and postschool outcomes of young people with disabilities?”</p>
<p>Well-designed and carefully implemented research is essential to answering this question. The elusiveness of an “enviable life” for many young people with disabilities highlights the necessity of equipping practitioners to provide instruction, services, supports, and community linkages reflecting the very best of what we know works to improve student outcomes. Indeed, schools and service providers are now explicitly charged with ensuring their day-to-day work is grounded in research-based practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2165143413475659">IDEA, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2165143413475659">No Child Left Behind Act of 2002</xref>). Over the last decade, renewed calls have been issued to ensure practices in the field of special education broadly (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2165143413475659">Odom et al., 2005</xref>) and transition specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2165143413475659">Kohler &amp; Field, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2165143413475659">Test, Fowler, et al., 2009</xref>) are grounded in strong evidence emerging from rigorous studies. At the same time, much discussion has addressed the ways in which different methodological approaches can contribute to informing the evidence base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2165143413475659">Brantlinger, Jiminez, Klingner, Pugach, &amp; Richardson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2165143413475659">Odom et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2165143413475659">Test, Mazotti, et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Establishing a compelling knowledge base in the field of secondary education and transition is predicated in part on the sufficient availability of research studies focused on critical issues in the lives of young people with disabilities. As the premier journal in this particular field, a review of <italic>Career Development and Transition for Exceptional Individuals</italic> (CDTEI) can offer an intriguing window into the ways in which research has contributed to the dialogue on the design and delivery of transition services and supports. To document the place and prominence of research in this area of special education, we reviewed every article published in CDTEI since its inception in 1978. In reviewing the various methodological approaches used across these 35 volumes of the journal, we sought to answer the following questions:</p>
<list id="list1-2165143413475659" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>To what extent have research (i.e., data-based) studies been emphasized in CDTEI?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How have different methodological approaches been reflected within these research articles?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What approaches to data collection have been most often utilized within these studies?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What trends are evident in the answers to the first three questions?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We undertook this particular review for several reasons. First, 35 years represents an important milestone for <italic>any</italic> journal. Documenting the journey of CDTEI in terms of its methodological emphasis would prompt consideration on just how far the journal has come and where it might go next. Indeed, becoming the “‘journal of choice’ for transition-related research and discussion articles” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2165143413475659">Test &amp; Algozzine, 2003</xref>, pp. 123) is enhanced by just this sort of reflection. Second, trends in CDTEI likely reflect broader methodological trends in the field of transition. Although a more comprehensive review spanning multiple journals would be needed to definitively speak to how robust these trends are, it is instructive to consider changes in the ways in which different design tactics have been drawn on to answer questions of importance of the field. Third, such a review—especially when read in tandem with the other articles featured in this special issue—could point the field toward research gaps that might be addressed by future researchers. Finally, a methodological review can provide a historical benchmark against which future developments in the field might be referenced.</p>

<sec id="section2-2165143413475659">
<title>Review Process</title>
<p>We systematically reviewed all 581 articles published across the first 35 volumes of CDTEI. Each article was independently coded by at least two reviewers. Our review team was composed of four doctoral students, one postdoctoral fellow, and one university faculty member. Electronic versions of every article were downloaded and organized by volume and issue. We then coded each article using an online data management system, which we programmed to display relevant coding categories based on an initial screening of articles and automatically flag missing information.</p>
<p>Coding proceeded in a series of phases. First, all six reviewers independently coded all 24 articles in Volume 31 of the journal to examine the coding framework and refine our definitions. After compiling coding and reviewing discrepancies, we further refined the definitions and held a web conference to discuss the revised framework. Second, two reviewers were each assigned to code approximately half of the remaining volumes of the journal using the revised framework. Reviewers were counterbalanced so each person reviewed articles with at least three different reviewers. Individual coding sheets were again compiled and all discrepancies were reviewed. Some additional minor revisions were made to definitions and procedures, and all coders were informed about these updates. Third, two reviewers coded each of the remaining volumes. Again, the reviewers were counterbalanced to code with at least three different reviewers. Finally, all disagreements among two coders were reviewed, discussed, and corrected by two coders to ensure the final data set reflected the most accurate information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2165143413475659">
<title>Initial Screening of Articles</title>
<p>Each article was reviewed by two coders and initially categorized as a (a) data-based research study; (b) literature review; (c) position paper; (d) discussion or conceptual paper; (e) commentary, response, or rejoinder; (f) program description; (g) practice paper; (h) legal or policy analysis; (i) book, media, curriculum, or test review; (j) review of articles in other journals (e.g., “In Other Sources”); (k) letters to the editor, or (l) editorial or introduction to a special issue. These categories were adapted from a review conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2165143413475659">Mastropieri et al. (2009)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2165143413475659">
<title>Coding for Methodological Features</title>
<p>Data-based research and literature reviews were coded for particular methodological features. Literature reviews were categorized as (a) meta-analyses of group and/or single-subject design studies using statistical analyses, (b) narrative reviews, or (c) best-evidence syntheses. Data-based research articles were categorized as (a) interventions: group designs (e.g., outcome measures reported as group means or sums), (b) interventions: single-case designs (e.g., repeated measurement of dependent variable over time for individual participants), (c) descriptive-quantitative studies, (d) qualitative studies, and/or (e) instrument or measurement development. When mixed methods were used, studies were coded within both categories.</p>
<p>Intervention studies utilizing single-case research designs were categorized using the framework proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2165143413475659">Hammond and Gast (2010)</xref>: time-lagged designs (i.e., multiple baseline, multiple probe, changing criterion), comparison designs (i.e., multitreatment, alternating treatments, adapted alternating treatments, simultaneous treatments, parallel treatments), withdrawal or reversal designs, combination designs, or nonexperimental designs. Studies utilizing a group research design were coded for the presence of a control or comparison group, random assignment to treatment groups (with assignment at level of analysis), and demonstration of group equivalence or matching. Studies in which participants were randomly assigned to a treatment and control or comparison group were categorized as randomized designs. Studies including a control or comparison group and lacking random assignment, but demonstrating group equivalence or matching, were categorized as quasiexperimental designs. All other studies were categorized as nonexperimental (e.g., no control or comparison group, no group equivalence or matching, and no random assignment). These categories were based on established design categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2165143413475659">Gall, Gall, &amp; Borg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2165143413475659">Shadish, Cook, &amp; Campbell, 2002</xref>). For all interventions, we also recorded the name of the intervention and the primary outcomes on which data were collected.</p>
<p>Using a framework proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2165143413475659">B. Johnson and Christensen (2008)</xref>, we categorized descriptive-quantitative studies as using simple descriptive (i.e., data-based descriptions of an individual or group), causal-comparative (i.e., data analyses comparing two or more groups), and/or correlational/predictor (i.e., data analyses exploring statistical associations among variables) analyses. Because these three subcategories were not mutually exclusive, individual studies could be coded as falling under one or more of these categories. We categorized qualitative studies as using phenomenological, ethnographic, case study, grounded theory, or historical research designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2165143413475659">B. Johnson &amp; Christensen, 2008</xref>). We also recorded any narrative descriptions of the qualitative designs provided by authors.</p>
<p>For each data-based research study, we categorized the data collection approaches clearly used in the study, including (a) formal tests and assessments, (b) questionnaires or surveys, (c) individual interviews, (d) focus groups, (e) observations, (f) secondary analyses of extant data (i.e., no original data collection on the part of the research team), and (g) document analysis or analyses of archival records. We also recorded when data collection approaches were unclear (i.e., insufficient description to characterize data collection).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2165143413475659">
<title>Intercoder Agreement</title>
<p>Because our coding approach was modified slightly after reviewing approximately half of the articles, we calculated intercoder agreement for the remaining subset of 266 articles. Because these articles were coded hierarchically (e.g., features of single-case design articles were only coded if a study was categorized as using a single-case intervention design), intercoder agreement was calculated at each level of the hierarchy. Agreement on the initial screening of article type (e.g., data-based research study, literature review, or other type of article) was 98.1%. For all data-based research articles, agreement for broad design category (i.e., single subject, group design, descriptive quantitative, instrument development, qualitative, other) was 94.9% and agreement for data collection method was 93.2%. Within each type of design category, agreement was 82.6% for the specific type qualitative design, 75.0% for the specific single-subject design, 82.5% for the specific descriptive-quantitative design, and 90.0% for the specific group design used. Any disagreements were reviewed and resolved by a third reviewer in collaboration with the first author.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2165143413475659">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Categories of articles considered to be qualitatively different from the others (e.g., those not typically peer reviewed, those that were quite brief) were excluded from the total number of articles (i.e., denominator) when calculating percentages of articles with specific features. Excluded articles included book, media curriculum, or test reviews; reviews of articles in other journals; or editorials/introductions to special issues. Once these 86 articles were excluded, 495 articles remained. Because the number of issues per volume expanded from two to three in 2007 and a special third issue was published in 1981, we generally report findings as both the frequency and percentage of all articles (per year).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section8-2165143413475659">
<title>Categories of Articles</title>
<p>Across all 35 volumes of CDTEI, fewer than half of articles (44.4%, <italic>n</italic> = 220) did not report findings from a data-based research study. Instead, these articles primarily represented discussion papers, program or practice descriptions, legal or policy analyses, position papers, and other articles (e.g., reviews, editorials, commentaries). Only 4.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 23) of all articles were systematic literature reviews. Most of these literature reviews were narrative reviews; only two articles described meta-analyses of studies using group and/or single-case designs. Data-based studies were the focus of 55.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 275) of all articles.</p>
<p>Over the 35-year history of the journal, data-based studies have become increasingly prominent. Overall, an increasing trend in the proportion of all articles that are data-based is evident (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2165143413475659">Figure 1</xref>). During the first decade of the journal, 26.1% of articles were data-based compared with 74.6% of all articles published during the most recent decade. Lower percentages of data-based articles within particular volumes (e.g., 1981, 1996) are sometimes attributable to special topical issues.</p>

<title>Descriptive Studies</title>
<p>Among the 274 articles describing data-based studies, 59.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 163) used descriptive-quantitative designs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2165143413475659">Table 1</xref>). All of these studies included simple descriptive findings. More than one quarter (29.1%, <italic>n</italic> = 80) of data-based studies also included causal-comparative analyses and 13.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 37) included correlational or predictor analyses. Although an increasing trend in the total number of descriptive-quantitative articles is evident across all years of the journal, the proportion of descriptive-quantitative articles, while fairly sizable, has remained fairly consistent over time. For example, during the first 10 years of the journal, 63.4% of all studies utilized descriptive-quantitative designs compared with 51.1% of all studies published during the last decade.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Slightly less than one fifth (19.3%, <italic>n</italic> = 53) of all studies incorporated qualitative research designs. Although specific qualitative designs were inconsistently named in articles, phenomenological approaches were used in 14.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 40) of data-based studies, case study approaches in 4.0% (<italic>n</italic> = 11) of studies, and grounded theory approaches in 0.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 2) of articles. Overall, an increasing trend in the number and proportion of qualitative studies featured in the journal is evident. Although no qualitative studies appeared in the journal until 1986, 30 qualitative studies have been published in the journal during the last decade.</p>
<p>Finally, articles describing the development of assessment and measurement instruments have appeared relatively less frequently in the journal. Specifically, only 4.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 13) of all data-based articles have focused on instrument development (e.g., a measure of vocational preferences, a measure of coworker involvement in supported employment). This focus has remained steady across all years of the journal.</p>

<title>Intervention-Focused Studies</title>
<p>Among the 275 articles describing data-based studies, 24.0% (<italic>n</italic> = 66) explored the impact of some type of interventions. Overall, a fairly flat trend is evident in the proportion of all CDTEI articles that are intervention focused (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2165143413475659">Figure 1</xref>). An average of 1.9 (range = 0–4) intervention studies has been published in each volume of the journal. The focus of these interventions has primarily been on improving outcomes related to employment status, self-determination, and transition-related knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>Although an intervention focus characterizes approximately one quarter of all data-based studies, the designs used to evaluate the impact of these interventions varied considerably (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2165143413475659">Table 1</xref>). Specifically, 18.2% (<italic>n</italic> = 12) of these 66 intervention studies incorporated randomized or quasiexperimental group designs, 19.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 13) used single-case designs, and 62.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 41) could be considered nonexperimental. Among these latter nonexperimental designs, 34 (82.9%) lacked a control group, 5 (12.2%) included a control group but lacked randomization or matching, and 2 (4.9%) used single-case designs that do not allow causal claims to be made (e.g., A-B design).</p>
<p>Group design studies using quasiexperimental (<italic>n</italic> = 3) or randomized designs (<italic>n</italic> = 9) represented 4.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 12) of all data-based articles. Studies utilizing single-case designs represented just 4.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 13) of all data-based articles. These studies almost exclusively used time-lagged designs (e.g., multiple-baseline, multiple-probe designs). While the number of strong intervention evaluations has remained low, a small increase has been seen in recent volumes (2010–2011). During the last decade, 11 group design or single-case experimental studies have been published compared with just 4 studies in the first decade of the journal.</p>

<title>Data Collection Methods</title>
<p>Across data-based studies, as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2165143413475659">Table 2</xref>, the most frequently reported data collection approaches included surveys and questionnaires (50.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 138 studies), individual interviews (20.0%, <italic>n</italic> = 55 studies), content analyses (18.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 50 studies), and tests or formal assessments (17.1%, <italic>n</italic> = 47 studies). Less frequently reported were direct observations (10.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 30 studies), focus groups (6.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 17 studies), and secondary analyses of extant data (5.8%, <italic>n</italic> = 16 studies). In some cases, the method of data collection was unclear or not reported (3.3%, <italic>n</italic> = 9). Although the majority (77.1%, <italic>n</italic> = 212) of studies used just one of these data collection methods, 15.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 43) of studies combined two approaches, 5.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 16) combined three approaches, and 1.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 4) combined four approaches.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As one of the premier (and oldest) journals in the field of secondary education and transition, CDTEI offers a useful vantage point from which to consider where the field of transition research has been, where it currently resides, and where it might venture in the years ahead. We reviewed every article published throughout the 35-year history of CDTEI to document methodological trends and possibilities related to equipping youth and young adults with disabilities for adulthood. We were struck by the considerable breadth of methodological approaches used to explore issues in the lives of transition-age youth with disabilities. At the same time, we noticed clear gaps that should be addressed if the field is to develop a compelling knowledge base focused on how best to support young people with disabilities well during this phase of life. In the remainder of this article, we summarize the methodological legacy of this journal, describe the current empirical landscape, and offer some modest recommendations for where the field might go next.</p>
<p>First, we found that the prominence of data-based studies has increased within the journal throughout its history. Early volumes of CDTEI were dominated by program and practice descriptions, discussion papers, editorials, and other nonempirical articles. A sharp jump in the proportion of data-based articles took place in 1988, followed by a steady increase in such an emphasis up to the present (i.e., 56.5% of articles from 1998 to 2012 were data-based). This pattern resembles findings from a recent review of articles published in 11 other prominent special education journals between 1987 and 2007. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2165143413475659">Mastropieri and colleagues (2009)</xref> reported that 58% all articles published across these two decades were data-based, with a slight increase in trend over this time span. Whether CDTEI’s increasing trend primarily indicates a shift in the editorial decisions being made for the journal and/or reflects changes in the nature of all scholarship within the field (or some other factor) is difficult to discern. Nevertheless, we consider this growing empirical emphasis to be an important and necessary accompaniment to the legislative and policy attention focusing on transition since 1990. In other words, the field still needs compelling data on which to base its policy and practice decisions.</p>
<p>Second, the large majority of these data-based studies (nearly 80%) could be characterized as primarily descriptive in nature. Such studies can make essential contributions to the design and delivery of transition education by documenting prevailing outcomes for students in and out of school, identifying trends and gaps in services and supports, exploring new constructs, describing particular practices, or exploring relations among variables. For example, descriptive-quantitative designs have been used extensively in this journal to answer a range of questions. Basic descriptive designs can explore questions related to “what is” by documenting the current landscape in classrooms, schools, and communities (e.g., To what extent are student’s strengths considered when developing Individualized Education Programs [IEPs])? How do special education teachers perceive the effects of inclusion and community job training on vocational competencies of students with disabilities? To what extent do students with severe intellectual disabilities attending a high-poverty high school report using self-determination and educational planning skills?). Causal-comparative designs can enhance understanding of how two or more groups compare and/or contrast on selected measures (e.g., Do parents and youth with disabilities agree on the level of support they think the youth will need to attain important goals in adulthood?). Correlational and predictor studies—used in less than one quarter of descriptive-quantitative articles in the journal—can enable researchers to explore how student-, staff-, school-, community-, and family-related variables relate to or predict one another (e.g., What factors predict postsecondary education enrollment for students with learning disabilities? How are the constructs of self-determination and quality of life related?). Although each of these three categories of questions (i.e., descriptive, comparative, correlational) can each provide important insights into critical issues in the education of youth, we encourage the field to explore increasingly complex research questions that move the field beyond simple description.</p>
<p>While the majority of descriptive studies utilized quantitative analysis, a sizable number adopted qualitative methodology. Indeed, qualitative research continues to make noteworthy contributions to the field of transition. Nearly one fifth of all empirical studies published in CDTEI incorporated qualitative methodology, a trend that has steadily increased since the 1990s. The importance of qualitative designs to informing evidence-based policy and practice in special education has been highlighted elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2165143413475659">Brantlinger et al., 2005</xref>) and is certainly reflected within the pages of CDTEI. For example, researchers have probed the perceptions of key stakeholders on transition practices and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2165143413475659">Lehmann &amp; Baker, 1994</xref>), explored the experiences of students with intellectual disability transitioning from school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2165143413475659">Paiewonsky, 2011</xref>), and investigated practitioners’ understanding of constructs like self-determination and student involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2165143413475659">Martin, Greene, &amp; Borland, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>At the same time, we found synthesizing the methodological features of this approach within the journal to be a challenging task. In many of the published articles, the specific methodological and analytic approaches used by the researchers were either broadly described or not mentioned at all; across other studies, particular terms were used to reference somewhat different approaches. This lack of clarity made it difficult to ascertain exactly how data were collected and analyzed. As is true with quantitative approaches, clear and replicable descriptions of methodology are critical for interpretation and synthesis of study findings. As approaches to qualitative research continue to advance, it is important that researchers draw on the strongest features of qualitative methodology to answer questions of importance to the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2165143413475659">Trainor &amp; Graue, 2012</xref>), and clearly describe these methodological approaches to readers.</p>
<p>Third, although descriptive studies make an important contribution by enhancing our understanding of issues and phenomena in the field of transition, descriptions alone do not provide adequate scientific evidence to judge the efficacy of policies or interventions. We found that a fairly low proportion of articles moved beyond description to evaluate interventions. Although substantial variability in this proportion was apparent from year to year, less than one tenth of all data-based studies (and 5.1% of all published articles) utilized some type of group experimental or single-case design to explore the impact of an intervention. Reviews in other education-related fields have also documented low proportions of intervention research, particularly those using rigorous designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2165143413475659">Hsieh et al., 2005</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2165143413475659">Seethaler and Fuchs (2005)</xref> reported that just 5.5% of articles published over a 5-year period in five prominent journals described intervention studies. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2165143413475659">Mastropieri et al. (2009)</xref> reported that just 15.9% of all data-based articles published in 11 special education journals focused on intervention evaluations. Within this latter review, a relatively small proportion of intervention studies was implemented in high schools, further highlighting the paucity of intervention work conducted with transition-age youth with disabilities. Indeed, literature reviews specific to the field of transition have consistently emphasized the persistent need for evaluations of interventions focused on equipping youth and young adults to transition well to life after high school (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2165143413475659">Storey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2165143413475659">Test, Fowler, et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although we were somewhat surprised by the absence of a clear increase in the trend of intervention evaluations across this 35-year period, the proportion of these studies using designs that could allow causal inferences has actually increased somewhat in recent years. This increase—which we consider to be encouraging—might be attributable to multiple factors, including heightened attention in the field of education on articulating core indicators of high-quality empirical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2165143413475659">Gersten et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2165143413475659">Horner et al., 2005</xref>), rising expectations of quality among editorial boards and reviewers, the natural progression of programmatic lines of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2165143413475659">Odom et al., 2005</xref>), more rigorous external funding requirements, and/or strengthened doctoral training programs. Nevertheless, we found only 25 studies reporting experimental designs that would allow researchers to draw strong conclusions about the impact of a particular intervention package. The need for rigorous intervention studies to evaluate the breadth of transition service and support needs of youth and young adults with disabilities persists. Moreover, intervention evaluations within this journal have primarily addressed the areas of career development, self-determination, and community-based instruction. Far less is known about the efficacy of interventions focusing on other areas, such as professional development approaches, interagency collaboration models, family supports, civic engagement, and program design. We also encourage future researchers to consider design tactics that enable the field to extend beyond demonstration questions (i.e., Does a particular intervention have an impact? Does a new approach work better than “usual practices”?) and explore comparative and component analyses that help the field understand the relative impact of different approaches as well as the essential (and nonessential) features of effective transition interventions. Finally, as the number of intervention studies continues to accrue, strong meta-analytic efforts will be needed to synthesize this growing literature base to determine which interventions work best with which students in which contexts and for which outcomes, as well as to identify remaining gaps to be addressed in future research.</p>
<p>Fourth, as suggested above, the contributions of multiple methodologies to understanding issues of importance in the education of youth and young adults with disabilities were absolutely evident throughout the pages of CDTEI. Although we have stressed the particular need for rigorous intervention studies, we likewise emphasize multiple methodologies are essential for answering the breadth of questions posed by practitioners and policy makers in the field of transition. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2165143413475659">Odom et al. (2005)</xref> noted, special education research is especially complex and diverse methodologies that must be drawn on to adequately inform policy and practice. At the same time, we would emphasize that our focus on data-based articles in this review is not intended to diminish the contributions of other types of articles, such as conceptual papers, position papers, systematic reviews, and discussion papers. Indeed, both empirical and nonempirical scholarship can (and should) work in tandem to guide the field as it pushes forward.</p>
<p>Fifth, we were intrigued by the breadth of data collection approaches used to answer research questions. Not surprisingly, the use of surveys and questionnaires has comprised the dominant approach to data collection, having been used in half of all studies. The heavy reliance on researcher-developed surveys and questionnaires may in part reflect the complexity and diversity of constructs researchers aim to measure. However, this approach has critical limitations. The measurement quality of researcher-developed surveys and questionnaires that have not been validated or psychometrically analyzed is unclear. In addition, when researchers measuring a similar construct use different measures, it can be difficult to compare or synthesize findings across studies. We encourage additional efforts to develop validated, reliable measures to assess constructs of high interest to the field of transition. The quality of research studies is inherently tied to the quality of the measurement. However, two gaps are worth noting. First, relatively few secondary analyses of large-scale or nationally representative databases have been published in this journal. Given the wide availability of federally funded longitudinal studies (e.g., National Longitudinal Transition Study, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health), national databases (e.g., American Community Survey, Department of Labor data, Office of Special Education Programs data, Rehabilitation Services Administration 911 data), and state longitudinal and follow-up data sets (e.g., state Department of Educations, Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities agencies), researchers have a number of excellent sources of extant information about the experiences and pathways of large samples of youth and young adults with disabilities. Second, relatively few studies incorporated direct observation. Although permanent products and self-report data can provide valuable insights into the design and delivery of transition services, direct observations sometimes offer a more objective approach for documenting the realities and complexities of transition practice as it is implemented.</p>
<sec id="section13-2165143413475659">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Several limitations to our review should be considered. First, we limited our methodological review to a single venue for publishing transition-related research. Transition research has been published across numerous excellent journals, including outlets that are disability specific (e.g., <italic>Behavioral Disorders, Research and Practice for Persons with Severe Disabilities</italic>), cross-categorical (e.g., <italic>Exceptional Children, Remedial and Special Education</italic>), and topical (e.g., <italic>Journal of Postsecondary Education and Disability, Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation Counseling Bulletin</italic>). Thus, it may be that intervention evaluations are sent to journals with a broader reach or have greater prominence. Second, we focused narrowly on methodological approaches and did not analyze quality indicators associated with each of these approaches. Indeed, it would not be feasible to rigorously analyze key features of all of these methodologies in a single review paper. Rather, such analyses are more properly suited for targeted, topical reviews (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2165143413475659">Storey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2165143413475659">Test, Mazzotti, et al., 2009</xref>). Third, we did not link our analyses to those carried out by the other authors of articles published in this special issue. It would be interesting to explore the ways in which different methodologies were applied to particular transition issues and how authorship trends were associated with methodological approaches. Fourth, we can only speculate about historical factors that may account for some of the trends evident within the journal. For example, the ways in which funding initiatives, editorial priorities, developments in the field, researchers’ interests, legislation, and other factors individually and collectively shaped the stories told in CDTEI are complicated to disentangle.</p>

<title>Implications for the Field of Transition</title>
<p>As we consider the future of the field, we offer a few recommendations for research in the area of career development and transition. First, given legislative and policy initiatives focused on identifying and implementing scientifically based educational interventions, the need for rigorous intervention studies remains ever pressing. Systematic reviews conducted by the National Secondary Transition Technical Assistance Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsttac.org">www.nsttac.org</ext-link>) suggest numerous transition practices have only accrued “potential” and “moderate” levels of evidence of efficacy and many others remain altogether unexamined. Future researchers should be encouraged and equipped to carry out rigorous experimental studies addressing those practices holding the greatest potential to improve the quality of life and outcomes of young people with disabilities. Such trends already appear to be gaining some momentum.</p>
<p>Second, the field continues to need longitudinal research that convincingly links the impact of specific transition practices and programs to medium- and long-term student outcomes. Although analyses of postschool predictors provide useful insights into how transition services and supports shape outcomes, experimental studies examining whether and how short-term interventions produce lasting changes remain sorely lacking in the literature.</p>
<p>Third, the overall strength of the evidence base relies in part on the quality of measures used in research studies. Documenting those experiences and outcomes of most importance in the lives of transition-age youth is a challenging endeavor. Constructs such as collaboration, self-determination, natural supports, quality of life, community and postsecondary inclusion, and social connections are incredibly difficult to capture well. Similarly, detailing the practices and procedures that comprise transition interventions requires great precision. However, rigor must also be brought to the development and refinement of both outcome and fidelity measures to enable the field to convincingly link practices with meaningful improvements in students’ lives.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must further expand efforts to equip early career researchers with strong training and mentoring to conduct high-quality empirical studies. Transition is a particularly complex area of study that sometimes necessitates the use of creative design applications. As a field, we should identify new contexts for sharing methodological approaches that address the unique complexities associated with conducting applied research in the field of transition.</p>
<p>Finally, high-quality studies in the field of transition can be expensive to conduct and challenging to coordinate. The availability of external funding from federal agencies like the Institute of Education Sciences, the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, and the National Institutes of Health will be critical to supporting the growth of the evidence base in our field. At the same time, new funding sources are sorely needed to support the types of collaborative, large-scale research that can move the field forward faster.</p>
<p>For 35 years, CDTEI has featured diverse and compelling scholarship aimed at equipping young people with disabilities and their families to flourish. As a leading publication outlet for the field of secondary education and transition, the journal has made sustained contributions to the development of research-based practices. We hope the findings of this review will spur the journal to continue and deepen its emphasis on showcasing rigorous research that makes a real difference in the lives of youth and young adults with disabilities.</p>
