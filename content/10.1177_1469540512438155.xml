<abstract>
<p>The pervasiveness of children’s consumer culture and the complex intimacy between young consumers’ identities and the marketplace is not a new thesis. However, this article recognizes the significant dearth of both empirical and theoretical accounts of young adolescents’ specific consumption practices as they attempt to mediate the intricacies of their lived experiences and social contexts. This dearth is first explored by detailing the over-emphasis on developmentalism, socialization theory and the sacred/empowered dichotomy. Subsequently, a metaphorical conceptualization of those who are no longer but concurrently not yet – the liminal – is used as a lens of analysis, and a multi-method research approach of diaries, interviews, collages and shopping trips is undertaken. A theory of liminal consumption is explored as a result, highlighting the tangible light and shade, indeterminacy and yet ambition in which these young adolescents’ consumption practices and social contexts are inextricably intertwined.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that ‘a consumer culture of childhood stands as a ubiquitous fixture in public life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469540512438155">Cook, 2004b</xref>: 1), there are few theoretical accounts of young people’s specific negotiations and ‘styles of agency’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469540512438155">James and Prout, 1996</xref>: 47) as they mediate the intricacies of their lived experiences and social contexts within contemporary consumer culture. Within the realm of children’s consumer culture theorists, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469540512438155">Martens et al. (2004: 161)</xref> contend that ‘relatively little is known about how children engage in practices of consumption or what the significance of this is to their everyday lives and broader issues of social organisation’.</p>
<p>Similar attestations of empirical dearth appear in the articulations of child sociologists who argue that despite their prevalence in other theoretical domains, children within sociology have been regarded very much as a ‘muted group, i.e. unperceived or elusive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469540512438155">Hardman, 2001</xref>: 502). At a macro level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469540512438155">Cook (2008: 220)</xref> insightfully contends that ‘children and childhood remain absent from or marginalized in a good deal of extant writing on consumption and consumer culture’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469540512438155">James and Prout (1997)</xref> explore this point further by arguing that it was not so much that children were absent from social studies research but that they had been rendered silent. Rather than focus on children as worthy of study in their own right, ‘children have been studied indirectly within sociology via the sub-disciplinary areas of family, gender, health and education’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469540512438155">Brannen and O’Brien, 1995</xref>: 729). As a result, much is still unknown in relation to ‘the variety of forms of engagement which children have with the hierarchies, the boundaries and other features of the social situations in which they are located’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469540512438155">James and Prout, 1996</xref>: 49).</p>
<p>This article aims to respond to the call for theoretical and empirical insight into the lived experiences of young people as they mediate the shifting milieus of their social lives specifically through engagement with a myriad consumption practices. Focusing on the tween, I aim to theorize not only in relation to children’s own experiences with consumption, but also to engage with the consumption practices of tweens conceptualized as those in the interstices of sociocultural organization; those who are liminal (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469540512438155">Turner, 1967</xref>). It is worth noting at this juncture that the term ‘tween’ will be used throughout this research in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469540512438155">Cook and Kaiser’s (2004)</xref> conception of the three dimensions to the pre-teen age segment; namely the subteen (the 1940s–1970s trade term), tween (the age range in general) and Tween (the emergent social construction of commercial discourse in the 1990s). Thus, this research aims to explore this group of young consumers as an age range – tween – as opposed to understanding their lived experience through the constructed lens of the marketing category Tween.</p>
<p>First, I will briefly reflect upon the factors that have implicitly led to an overemphasis on the ‘production of consumption’ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469540512438155">Martens et al., 2004</xref>) in relation to children’s consumption experiences at the expense of empirical insight. This includes consideration of the ‘dogma of developmentalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1469540512438155">Qvortrup, 2004</xref>) and its expansive integration via socialization theory, and the sacred/empowered dichotomy of conceptualization. The ‘doing childhood’ perspective and notions of ‘commercial enculturation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540512438155">Cook, 2010</xref>) as a possible alternative to the being/becoming debate are then presented and located firmly within the context of this research.</p>
<p>This is followed by a consideration of the theoretical framework of liminality and the consumption practices of those who are fundamentally betwixt and between two ‘instances of completeness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540512438155">Cook, 2005</xref>: 4), highlighting its utility as a theoretical lens of inquiry in this context. Using empirical data gathered as part of a larger study on tween consumption, a theory of liminal consumption is outlined that aims to encapsulate the consumption practices of these social neophytes when ‘relatively stable points of cultural and social interface begin to shift’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469540512438155">Russell and Tyler, 2005</xref>: 225).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1469540512438155"><title>Children’s consumer culture: Crux contextual issues</title>
<p>The silencing of children’s voices within consumer culture research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469540512438155">Qvortrup, 1994</xref>), also referred to by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469540512438155">Martens et al.(2004)</xref> as ‘the production of consumption approach’, has been attributed to a duality of factors by those seeking to disentangle the muted voices of young consumers.</p>
<p>One such factor centres on the subordinate theoretical positioning occupied by children within the paradigm that has dominated the sociology of children for decades: developmentalism, disseminated in the main by the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469540512438155">Piaget (e.g. 1955)</xref>. Although relegating the child’s social world to a thing of inconsequentiality, the developmentalist paradigm via its manifestation through socialization theory has been applied to consumer research of children via a myriad of studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469540512438155">Achenreiner and John, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469540512438155">Chaplin and John, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469540512438155">Grant and Stephen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469540512438155">Hogg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1469540512438155">Lawlor and Prothero, 2003</xref>). This paradigm, although revealing little of the ways in which children use consumer culture to mediate the intricacies of their lived experiences, has clearly found integration and application within the literature. However, the predominance of the socialization paradigm and its implicit assumptions of the child envisaged as an incomplete work in progress, evolving along a trajectory of cognitive capacity to a point of adult competence, has been both empirically and theoretically questioned of late.</p>
<p>One potential conceptualization of this divergent path is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540512438155">Cook’s (2010)</xref> concept of ‘commercial enculturation’, which theorizes in relation to the ‘variety of ways children come to know and participate in commercial life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540512438155">Cook, 2010</xref>: 66). This insightful theoretical perspective shifts the focus to ‘how consumption and meaning, and thus culture, cannot be separated from each other but arise together through social contexts and processes of parenting and socializing with others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540512438155">Cook, 2010</xref>: 66). Thus commercial enculturation espouses the notion that a more discerning perspective can be gained by viewing children as not so much socialized into becoming one kind of specific consumer as they are seen entering into social relationships with and through goods and their associations.</p>
<p>A second correlating factor implicit in the over-emphasis on the production of consumption approach to children’s consumer culture research is the stifling dichotomy or polarization that is thought to permeate theorizations and research of child consumption practices. Fundamentally the ‘dichotomous child’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540512438155">Cook, 2005</xref>) mirrors a broader debate on structure versus agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469540512438155">Buckingham and Sefton-Green, 2003</xref>). Those adopting the structural approach to studying the child and contemporary consumption regard the child as fragile, pure and pristine, thereby vulnerable to the Machiavellian strategies and invasions of consumerism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469540512438155">Gregory-Thomas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1469540512438155">Quart, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1469540512438155">Schor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1469540512438155">Steinberg and Kincheloe, 1998</xref>). The opposing side of this binary conceptualization of the tween is occupied by an agentive approach which posits children as epitomizing the ‘sanctity of personhood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540512438155">Cook, 2004a</xref>: 149). Rather than exist as submissive victims of capitalist ingenuity, children are rendered ‘creative in their appropriation of consumer goods and media’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1469540512438155">Seiter, 1993</xref>: 9–10).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540512438155">Cook (2004a)</xref> warns that unless scholars step outside of this all encompassing and yet concurrently futile dispute, child consumer culture will remain a marginal area of research. In a similar direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469540512438155">Langer (2005)</xref> contends that consumer culture research focused on the child needs ‘an alternative to the either/or positions of uncritical celebration/puritanical condemnation of children’s consumer pleasures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469540512438155">Langer, 2005</xref>: 269), if the body of research in this area is to progress. ‘Debate about whether or not children are active or passive is … a distraction from more important questions about the social and cultural structures in which their active choices are made’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469540512438155">Langer, 2005</xref>: 263). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469540512438155">Langer’s (2005)</xref> criticism of the dichotomous orientation of research on the child consumer is therefore founded on recognition of the importance of the social context and cultural structure in which this interaction between child and consumption practices takes place.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1469540512438155"><title>A way forward? ‘New social studies of childhood’ and the ‘doing’ childhood perspective</title>
<p>Viewing children as socio-cognitive incompetents who must pass through predefined stages if they are to become recognized as complete individuals is not a perspective that has permeated unchallenged. Disciplines such as social constructionism and symbolic interactionism meant that there was a growing awareness that the meanings of childhood may differ from culture to culture and in addition that children had noticeable agency as social actors in their social worlds. However it is the cumulative work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469540512438155">James et al. (1998)</xref> that is credited as formally instigating the new paradigm, resulting in a re-terming of the sociology of childhood to ‘new social studies of childhood’. From this theoretically evolved perspective the child ‘does not have to be approached from an assumed shortfall of competence, reason or significance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469540512438155">James et al., 1998</xref>: 207).</p>
<p>An attempt at resolving or at best addressing the fundamental issues raised by the either/or dichotomy is proffered by the ‘doing’ childhood perspective. Essentially this epistemological standpoint acknowledges that one cannot entirely negate the structural influences on a child’s lived experience by positing children as fully agentive beings; however, concurrently portraying children as inconsequential becomings is equally problematic. Thus the perspective of ‘doing childhood’, which ‘seeks to privilege children’s knowledge of the world they inhabit while also emphasizing the need, as in the case of adult “doing” to place that existence within its broader social context’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469540512438155">Russell and Tyler, 2005</xref>: 227), has emerged as a welcome epistemological evolution.</p>
<p>However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469540512438155">Cook (2008)</xref> succinctly argues, the ‘doing’ childhood standpoint, founded as it is in the sociological realms of childhood research, is very often divorced from the work of those who engage with the consumer preferences and practices of children (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469540512438155">Buckingham, 2000</xref>; Cross, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1469540512438155">Seiter, 1993</xref>). He argues that ‘scholars have not made a point of situating children’s consumption and the consumer culture of childhood in relation to consumption in general and consumption theory specifically’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469540512438155">Cook, 2008</xref>: 221). Thus this research aims to begin aligning micro understandings and theorizations of children’s social worlds and consumer culture practices with meso-levels of consumption theory extant.</p>
<p>In this article I locate my work firmly within this evolved epistemological framework, which aims to explore ‘children’s agency in the very moment that children themselves are learning about and coming to grips with the constraints and possibilities of the very differently structured environments they encounter in their everyday lives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469540512438155">James and Prout, 1996</xref>: 46). Despite the noticeable dearth of research empirically and theoretically engaging with the specificities of children’s own mediations with social context, structural environments, identity and consumption aside from ‘effects research’ and deliberations of dichotomies, there have been several seminal papers igniting an interest and readjusting the lens of analysis in this area. Studies with contextual specificities such as the interweaving of commercial media and children’s life worlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469540512438155">Griffin et al., 2005</xref>), the consumption experiences of children deemed to represent those living in poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469540512438155">Elliot and Leonard, 2004</xref>), and children’s management of existential worries through consumption of products, media and advertising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469540512438155">O’Donohoe and Bartholomew, 2006</xref>) highlight the fruitful insights obtained when research engages with young consumers as ‘inextricably entwined with consumer culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469540512438155">Buckingham, 2000</xref>: 166).</p>
<p>Two seminal studies related specifically to tweens aligning with a ‘doing’ childhood epistemology thus reinforcing the importance of focusing on this particular age group and their experiences with consumption and rendering viable their existence as a distinct cultural category worthy of exploration are those by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1469540512438155">Waerdahl (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469540512438155">Russell and Tyler (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469540512438155">2005)</xref>. Through their exploration of consumption patterns and social age identity as well as gender, consumption and identity amongst tweens respectively, these studies add impetus to the perspective that research with young consumers must involve ‘considerations of the various social, cultural and economic opportunities and constraints shaping young girls’ engagement with consumer culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469540512438155">Russell and Tyler, 2002</xref>: 621). ‘Such attempts to justify children as embodied and constructive and as considered in the occupation of a world of their own making are important empirical contributions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469540512438155">Jenks, 2005</xref>: 12).</p>
<p>Using the theoretical framework of liminality as a lens through which to align with this epistemological evolution within children’s consumer culture research requires a brief delineation of its core ideologies as they pertain to the empirical task at hand.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1469540512438155"><title>The centre of nowhere: The theoretical framework of liminality</title>
<p>It is primarily the work of Victor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469540512438155">Turner (e.g. 1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1469540512438155">1969</xref>) that explores the liminal space existing midway between two identifiable states. Defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1469540512438155">Turner and Turner (1978: 249)</xref> as ‘the state and process of mid-transition in a rite of passage’, a ‘moment in and out of time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1469540512438155">Turner, 1969</xref>: 96), the liminal phase of a transition, represents an instance of incompleteness when the liminars (the ritual subjects in this phase) ‘elude or slip through the network of classifications that normally locate states and positions in cultural space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1469540512438155">Turner, 1969</xref>: 95). In other words, the liminar is understood as experiencing a suspension of identities in which commitment to the fixed and definable social categories from which they left and towards which they gravitate cannot be made.</p>
<p>Delineating the attributes of liminal entities serves to illustrate the core premises of the theory. One such attribute is structural and social invisibility, seclusion from the spheres of everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469540512438155">Turner, 1967</xref>). In addition, ideologies of liminal theory espouse characteristics such as symbolization of concurrent degeneration and gestation or parturition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469540512438155">Turner, 1967</xref>), heteronomy, tabula rasa silence, equality and obscurity. The symbolization of individuals reasoned liminal as well as the liminal phase itself highlights the central premise of Turner’s theorizations. Those residing in this ‘fruitful darkness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469540512438155">Turner, 1967</xref>: 110), in the gaps between what is grouped and typified are simultaneously nothing and everything.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469540512438155">Turner’s (1967</xref>: 110) ‘invitation to investigators of culture to focus their attention on the phenomena and processes of mid-transition’ has resulted in contrasting disciplines welcoming liminality and its constituent dimensions into their midst to enrich an understanding and analysis of many instances of interim sociocultural positioning. Place and space (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1469540512438155">Pritchard and Morgan, 2006</xref>), performance (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469540512438155">Dunne, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1469540512438155">Rill, 2006</xref>) technology and personhood (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469540512438155">Anderson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469540512438155">Campbell et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1469540512438155">Waskul, 2005</xref>), and illness and loss (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469540512438155">Little et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469540512438155">Jones et al., 2007</xref>), are some of the contextual specificities in which ideologies of the liminal have been applied, theorized and brought to realization amidst sociocultural ambiguity and suspended identities.</p>
<p>It is also worth considering once again at this point <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469540512438155">Cook’s (2008)</xref> assertion that theories of children’s consumption activities need distance from intransitivity and more integration with macro consumption theory. In relation to interpretive consumer research’s current brand of organization and theorization-Consumer Culture Theory (CCT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469540512438155">Arnould and Thompson, 2005</xref>) liminal theory has been under-utilized as a theoretical lens through which to understand the consumption practices of those betwixt and between social categories or states of being. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1469540512438155">Schouten (1991)</xref> represents the inaugural integration of this anthropological perspective on mid-transition with individual consumption practices, concluding that ‘little is yet known about the consumption behaviours of liminal people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1469540512438155">Schouten, 1991</xref>: 422).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1469540512438155">Noble and Walker (1997)</xref> articulate notions of ‘liminal transitions’ as opposed to the state of liminality itself and utilize a positivist framework. Several other studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469540512438155">Hogg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469540512438155">Landzelius, 2001</xref>) have approached consumption practices in a liminal state but commonly relegate the liminal to a constituent dimension of a wider terrain of focus. It is thus proposed that theorizations of young consumers’ relations and meaning systems with consumer culture in the context of their shifting and suspended identities at this nexus of sociocultural organization are given theoretical rigour and a fruitful interdisciplinary dimension by viewing these social neophytes through the lens of the liminal.</p>
<p>The journey to threshold voices, enacting this transition from theoretical frameworks and empirical dearth to emergent data and subsequent theorizations in relation to liminal consumption, are now presented through a brief overview of method.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1469540512438155"><title>Research procedures</title>
<p>Cognizant of the fundamental objectives or purpose of this work – to explore tweens’ engagement with consumption practices in the context of the shifting identities and sociocultural organization of their liminal existence – several key methodological decisions were taken.</p>
<p>First, in relation to sample, two underlying premises enabled the setting of sample parameters. In terms of what specific age group the ‘tween’ should constitute or represent, chronological conceptualizations of the tween derived from marketing discourse were consulted (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469540512438155">Lindstrom, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1469540512438155">Siegal et al., 2004</xref>). Overriding consensus outlined the tween segment as young consumers between 8 and 12. It was decided that mindful of the inherent ideologies of liminality, a time period deemed fundamentally disruptive or ambiguous in the life of the pre-adolescent was needed in order to capture the lived experience of ‘betwixt and between’ at its most vivid. Thus a longitudinal study of a year was carried out amongst 15 tween girls aged between 11–12, who were undergoing the transition from primary to secondary school.</p>
<p>In addition, the participants were of homogenous gender. For the most part when discussing or theorizing on the subject of tweens, females are the focus of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469540512438155">Cook, 2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469540512438155">2004c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469540512438155">Lindstrom, 2003</xref>). In his delineation of the history of the child’s ‘commercial personae’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469540512438155">Cook (2004b)</xref> illustrates that, in part because of the intrinsic linking between the clothing industry and the assumed importance of clothing more to female identity, ‘the child is most often a girl’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469540512438155">Cook, 2004b</xref>: 82). It was decided to align this research with these prevailing conceptualizations of the child consumer. Aside from socio-historic consistency, cognizant of the potential variance in lived experiences of liminality for boys versus girls, it was decided to focus on the predominant conceptualization of the tween construct; females. Such potential variances primarily relate to puberty and gender-based socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469540512438155">Adler and Adler, 2003</xref>), which significantly lend themselves to divergent lived experiences for boys and girls of similar ages.</p>
<p>In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469540512438155">Richardson’s (1994)</xref> conceptualization of multiple methods within the interpretivst domain as ‘crystallization’, five different data collection methods were employed: 15 personal diaries, five accompanied shopping trips, 30 in-depth interviews (which were conducted at two separate intervals), researcher diaries and 15 e-collages. Each method was chosen to fulfil a specific purpose and reflect a unique and yet holistic angle of repose on the lived experience and consumption practices of the liminars, aligning with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469540512438155">Richardson’s (1994: 523)</xref> premise that ‘what we see depends on the angle of our repose’.</p>
<p>In addition, it emerged following the first set of interviews that the participants appeared to be having difficulty accessing and articulating opinions, thoughts and feelings in relation to consumption practices. Thus, e-collages were incorporated into the interview experience throughout December 2006. The literature extant espouses the favourable aspects and outcomes of incorporating ‘fun’, ‘novel’ and child-centred research methods into the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540512438155">Banister and Booth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469540512438155">Barker and Weller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469540512438155">Cappello, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469540512438155">Hill et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469540512438155">O’Kane, 2000</xref>). It was decided that a consumption collage would be an attractive option to this age group. However mindful of the liminal status of this age group, entirely comfortable neither as child or teen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469540512438155">Russell and Tyler, 2005</xref>), child-like collages based around pictures, glue and coloured markers were considered unsuitable.</p>
<p>Thus the researcher decided that a computer-based collage would ensure agency and responsibility on the part of the participant but would concurrently provide tangible research data. Prior to the interviews, 183 images were downloaded from the Google images search engine. These images were selected at the researcher’s discretion with the main influences being brands, interests or products that the participants had mentioned in their first interviews as well as personal and research-generated knowledge of current trends. Participants were requested to complete the collage, shown how to do this and allowed an unlimited time in which to complete this project. On average, participants took between 15 and 20 minutes to complete the collage. Following the completion of the task, participants were asked to chat about their choices, which proved a successful method of generating talk and insight around consumption objects and practices.</p>
<p>In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469540512438155">McCracken’s (1988: 41)</xref> assertion that analysis of qualitative data must prove ‘mechanistic and indeterminate in roughly equal portions’, the approach to analysing the output of such a myriad set of data collection techniques required a specific combination of creative scope firmly underlined by systematic rigour. Cognizant of this, a grounded theory process of organization – comprising stages of transcription, open coding, and memo writing – was utilized that fulfilled such criteria. Next, inductive analysis of interview and diary transcripts, as well as researcher diary content and shopping trip field notes was carried out. The process of these preliminary stages of analysis progressed towards axial coding and selective coding with a view to identifying a ‘core category or construct around which the other categories and constructs revolve that relates them to one another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469540512438155">Spiggle, 1994</xref>: 495).</p>
<p>This strategic and yet essentially creative process of data analysis culminated in a stage of data interpretation. Data interpretation was carried out in the manner of ‘a hermeneutic circle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540512438155">Arnold and Fischer, 1994</xref>: 63, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469540512438155">Thompson et al., 1994</xref>: 433), which is best characterized as an iterative procedure whereby interpretation was essentially a back and forth process: back and forth between personal meaning and theoretical background as well as between phase 1 and phase 2 of data collection. This hermeneutic approach allowed for a balance between voicing the children and their consumption experiences but concurrently understanding their lived experience in the context of consumption theory extant.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1469540512438155"><title>Liminal consumption: The fruitful darkness</title>
<p>This work is an attempt to address the dearth of empirical research aimed at exploring children’s consumption practices grounded in a conceptualization of young consumers as ‘engaged and embedded in diverse environments but also as mobile actors confronting different social settings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469540512438155">James and Prout, 1996</xref>: 49). I sought to investigate the strategies of action and styles of agency utilized and embraced by these social neophytes as they grappled with existing on the threshold of two worlds, belonging to neither but embedded in both. Mindful of the need to integrate understandings of children’s consumption practices with broader theorizations of consumption, the findings are presented as a possible theory of liminal consumption, encapsulated by the notion, drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469540512438155">Turner (e.g. 1967)</xref> of the liminal period as a fruitful darkness. Thus the tweens’ ‘darkness’ – their social ambiguity and heightened sense of personal and collective inadequacy – belies a ‘fruitful’ furnace of consumption practices aimed at mediating this disruptive, unstable period of time. Two constitutive conceptual categories are discussed that represent core elements of the liminal consumption theory; namely consumption coping and liminality.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1469540512438155"><title>Liminality</title>
<sec id="sec8-1469540512438155"><title>Me vs. I</title>
<p>One of the most overtly liminal components that emerged in relation to the tweens’ engagement with boundaries was the tension arising from a clashing duality of age perceptions. Testament to the fact that these girls exist as liminal beings, their social and legal categorizations were often at odds with one another. Significantly, this resulted in an acute sense of social invisibility, ambiguity and, very often, exclusion from realms of social and commercial activity.</p>
<p>Elaine relays how regardless of the assigned responsibility of caring for her younger siblings within her own family unit, many people external to this family would consider her, at 12 years of age, far too young to be held responsible for young children. However she is quick to point out that she herself does not hold the same view:
<disp-quote>
<p>E: but I am far more mature than a lot of 13 year olds I know. I think it is more to do with the fact that people hear 12 years old and they think oh that’s too young to babysit children</p>
<p>I: and when do you think they would be okay with it … other people?</p>
<p>E: I think at about 14 or 15 it is more acceptable, by other people, to be babysitting for children</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In this extract Elaine is visibly grappling with her own sense of social development versus the collective consensus of those who ascribe to the thesis of cognitive development in line with social competency. She exists uncomfortably on the threshold of what is deemed acceptable legally and how she regards her own sense of development socially. This finding resonates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469540512438155">Mead’s (1934)</xref> theorizations on self-development as an inherently social process, specifically his conceptualization of a duality of dimensions to each self; namely the ‘I’ – the personal, core understanding of self – versus the ‘Me’ – presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469540512438155">Mead (1934)</xref> as the socially oriented self, that which is visible to those around you. In this instance however, it is not so much that Elaine is conveying a child-like persona to those around her, rather they are ascribing childhood status regardless of her individual capabilities.</p>
<p>Similarly in this example grounded in a marketplace experience, Rachel highlights the strain between the distance she herself feels from the realm of childhood and other peoples’ conceptualization of her as far removed from teen autonomy:
<disp-quote>
<p>I: how do you decide what to buy, when you’re shopping?</p>
<p>R: well probably like … well my mother has to come to town with me and she says oh this is lovely and she calls over the shop assistant … then I feel like such a child and I’m like oh no I hate that and she’s like oh yea this is lovely try this on … and I’m like oh no …. I hate this outfit … like I hate the pants or something … and then you know the way you wouldn’t want to say it in front of the shop assistant and then you’re just like … sigh … oh okay I’ll try it on</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Rachel’s experience here with her mother and the sales assistant exemplifies her occupation of or location in a category lacking boundaries or clarification. She feels in a position to exert independent choice while the adults present clearly classify Rachel as a child who must be instructed as to what looks best. Thus her developing sense of autonomy resides uncomfortably beside societies attempt to categorize her as a child.</p>
<p>The incongruence between the duality of age perceptions in relation to the tweens appears to manifest in a tangible sense of social invisibility characterizing their interstitial existence. Angela points out that their ambiguous social categorization, their alignment with the interstices of age demarcation means that an outlet for them in the community is often lacking or intangible:
<disp-quote>
<p>I: what is it like being 12….?</p>
<p>A: I don’t know … its not good anyway … coz you can’t do much</p>
<p>I: what do you mean … what can’t you do?</p>
<p>A: there’s nothing to do for us in Kilkenny … nothing to do around here really</p>
<p>I: and what kind of stuff do you want to do…that maybe you can’t</p>
<p>A: well you can’t really go to the cinema much at my age coz you’re always too young to see them … like something could look really good but it’s probably like 15s or something …</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here it appears that Angela’s own sense of readiness to engage with the sphere of teen activities is at odds with what society has deemed acceptable for her age and as a result she feels the leisure resources have become restricted. This restriction lends itself to a pervading sense of social invisibility for these social anomalies.</p>
<p>The tweens also relay instances of social invisibility in their engagement with the boundaries of the marketplace:
<disp-quote>
<p>I: what else do you do around Kilkenny?</p>
<p>R: well I can’t wait for the new shopping centre to come coz there’s hardly any shops for us, our age, and if there are they are really expensive, so you need a parent with you to buy anything … and that’s not fun … you know the way you’d only bring twenty euro into town and you’d be like oh my God its thirty euro and stuff like that …</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It appears that in line with their straddling of two spheres of market segmentation, child and teen, the girls have the burgeoning financial independence of a trainee teen but are not recognized by the marketplace as displaying such an identity. Instead they are rendered invisible in the marketplace, its strict segmentations reinforcing the polarities in between which they exist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1469540512438155"><title>Balancing in the boundaries</title>
<p>This concept further illustrates the lived experience of a liminal tween. Existing on the threshold between two sociocultural and marketplace groupings implies a sense of being equidistant to both. Several data excerpts reveal an inherent oscillation between past, future and present identities, located as these social neophytes are within the boundaries of categorization. Post-structuralist perspectives on the self acknowledge this multiplicity or simultaneity of temporality; ‘identities are not only embedded in the present, but are constructed in terms of the conjunction of past and future’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1469540512438155">Linstead and Thomas, 2002</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>Although attempting to move forward and realize the destination of their trajectory towards teenhood, the remnants of their childhood subjectivities still feature in their understanding of their current existence, lending itself to a highly liminal experience. As argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469540512438155">Clifford-Poston (2006: xiii)</xref> ‘they (tweens) have a different preoccupation to children and yet can swiftly slot back into childhood’. The e-collage, as described previously was intrinsic in the emergence of this concept. Most of the discussions surrounding the girls’ younger selves originated in their inclusion of a child-like image in their collage, which at times resembled almost monstrous juxtapositions of child and teen worlds colliding. Like many of the other tweens, Emily chose to include a picture of Mickey Mouse in her assemblage of images (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1469540512438155">Figure 1</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>I: what about this page?</p>
<p>E: Disney … I love Mickey Mouse … well I loved him … I remember when I was in third class, I went to Disney World Florida Orlando … best place I’ve ever been to in my life … it was just brilliant</p>
<p>I: and did you go to Seaworld?</p>
<p>E: ye and when you’re in Disney you wish you were younger so you can enjoy it more …</p></disp-quote>
<fig id="fig1-1469540512438155" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Sample of collage (1).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1469540512438155-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Here Emily reverts back to a time in her past which still remains in her present, her family holiday to Disneyworld. Irrespective of her quest to locate herself in the domain of teen where the social imperatives are more mini-skirts than Mickey Mouse, Emily establishes the symbolic potency of this image in relation to her current self-conceptualization.</p>
<p>The concept of looking backwards while progressively moving forwards is also illustrated by the regret several of the girls expressed at elements of their childhood subjectivities that they had lost. Being the youngest in the family seems to have resulted in Eva becoming socialized in the ways of de-infantilizing Christmas much sooner than some of her peers. Because she has several older brothers and sisters, her mother and father are well accustomed to the tradition of allowing their kids to choose their own presents. Now that Eva no longer believes in Santa, which appears indicative of a young teen persona, she is brought into town to pick out her own presents. Although this endows Eva with a more mature status, she expresses a yearning to return to the comfort and magic of childhood Christmases:
<disp-quote>
<p>I: when did you find out there was no Santa?</p>
<p>E: about sixth class … I came to terms (laughs)</p>
<p>I: who told you … people in school?</p>
<p>E: you just kinda catch on … c’mon a guy with reindeer walking on the roofs every Christmas … he spends the whole year making toys with elves …</p>
<p>I: ha ha … it is funny that we believe it</p>
<p>E: yeh but it feels better when you believe … more Christmassy … and you get more anyway</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Although eager to renounce the majority of her childhood allegiances in order to prepare for her role as a young teen, Eva clearly laments the loss of some parts of her past, in particular the innocence of believing in Santa and having free reign to request presents without a more mature awareness of the financial burden of this ‘magic’ for her parents.</p>
<p>Angela expresses almost an identical sentiment. Losing the magic of Christmas is one of the most negative aspects of her maturation, of being no longer a child but yet close enough to remember what it felt like to believe in the magic of the mystery gift giver:
<disp-quote>
<p>I: what way does it work now with your mum and presents and stuff … do you write a list for her or does she get surprises?</p>
<p>A: am I get them from Santa … laughs … only jokin … am</p>
<p>I: when did you stop believing in Santa?</p>
<p>A: in fifth class I think … it was kinda like a few people started sayin it was all made up and then sooner or later everyone believed it … its crappy when you find out</p>
<p>I: what do you mean?</p>
<p>A: well when you find out that its really your mammy and daddy then you feel like you’re not a child anymore and things are not as good or exciting …</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here Angela equates the realization that Santa is a fabricated myth with the loss of excitement around Christmas time. Perhaps on the precipice of forsaking all that is childlike the tweens developed a renewed perspective on the unquestionable magic and enjoyment that was part of their pre-teen existence. So despite their underlying ambitions to divest of the past and become au fait with the future, the liminal existence of the tweens was reflective of a complex interface or fusion of past, present and future. In addition, there is the perspective of the most prolific proponent of the liminality theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469540512438155">Turner (1967</xref>: 106), which asserts that ‘liminality is the realm of primitive hypothesis, where there is a certain freedom to juggle with the factors of existence’. Therefore there is no real need for the girls to remain in a world signifying child or alternatively commit to a sphere of teenage interactions. Delving into the past and tip-toeing into the future is a veritable reality for these ambiguously defined individuals.</p>
<p>In line with the epistemological perspective of ‘doing’ childhood, several emergent consumption strategies were investigated aiming to explore the mediation of consumption in the context of these liminars’ shifting boundaries and thresholds.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1469540512438155"><title>Consumption coping</title>
<sec id="sec11-1469540512438155"><title>Disconnection</title>
<p>Amongst several of the girls, it became common to hear their previous consumption strategies being ridiculed. It appears that such blatant disassociation from activities of the past helped in dislocating from the child sphere in order to prepare for inevitable progression towards a teen world.</p>
<p>Amanda is vocal in her denigration of the self she now recognizes and categorizes as ‘younger’:
<disp-quote>
<p>I: do you like secondary</p>
<p>A: I way prefer it to primary …</p>
<p>I: oh you way prefer it to primary I thought you said …</p>
<p>A: oh no … and our uniforms were so horrible … and our ties were so far up … in John of God … we were looking at the video the other day … coz I had my camcorder … and we were all going around and we all looked so stupid and babyish</p>
<p>I: why?</p>
<p>A: we just looked … we had our ties up here and our top bottoms all tied up … we looked like I don’t know what … and our skirts were down to our ankles</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here Amanda is identifying and dismissing the signals of youth that she now associates with her younger, primary school self. It is important to her subjectification process, to the successful progression towards and relocation within an advanced social category that certitudes of her former subjectivity are undermined and eventually forsaken.</p>
<p>Making a conscious effort to express a detachment from the signifiers of a more youthful subjectivity is also evident from Elaine’s account:
<disp-quote>
<p>E: I used to buy ones (magazines) like called Girl Talk or something when I was small … it was about like puppys and stuff … now it’s like why did I waste all my money on that baby stuff … what was I like?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Her former sense of self, manifest in the juvenile consumption habits once engaged with, is now deemed highly incongruent with her current self-conceptualization and the process of subject positioning she is entangled in. The self that purchased puppy magazines now seems alien to Elaine, as she makes a conscious effort to relocate her subjectivity within an antithetical realm.</p>
<p>Eva also overtly ridicules her former self conceptualizations in an attempt to reconfigure the social perception of her evolving subjectivities. By espousing a derisive tone towards the childhood self she once conveyed to others through consumption practices Eva is actively engaging in subject positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540512438155">Davies and Harré, 1990</xref>), gravitating towards the subject category of teen, which will act as the nexus of all her social interactions for the foreseeable future:
<disp-quote>
<p>I: okay so what about….ah…what’s that</p>
<p>E: handbag … coz from the age of seven to about eleven, I was obsessed with handbags … huh … I used to think I was really cool going around with handbags …</p>
<p>I: ha ha … and what did you put in your handbag</p>
<p>E: nothing (laughs) … it was actually just empty …</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here Eva is constructing a parallel between a younger self and a sense of socially undeveloped consumption practices. She now considers herself in a position to reflect back on those years, which in reality only represent 12 months having past. This self-reflection enables her to differentiate from the self she is now in the process of reconstructing during her liminal existence.</p>
<p>‘The social transition from childhood to youth is a transformation of subjectivities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1469540512438155">Staunaes, 2005</xref>: 149). These examples suggest that transforming one’s subjectivity, which emerged as a core focus of liminars, involves an overt disparagement of and subsequent extrication from the childhood subject position conveyed through consumption practices. In addition, this subject repositioning ensures that the girls can envisage a progression from the ‘troubling subject position’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1469540512438155">Wetherell and Maybin, 1996</xref>) of non-descript tween to the culturally significant and symbolically assured category of young teen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1469540512438155"><title>Social comparison</title>
<p>In line with the literature extant that highlights the heightened sense of one’s social environment and its ability to generate exigencies in the lives of tweens (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469540512438155">Adler and Adler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469540512438155">Harter, 1999</xref>), social comparison emerged as an inherent aspect of liminal tweens’ consumption practices. The ability of social comparison to ignite an altered sense of self and a invigorated focus on consumption-based solutions to now palpable inadequacies is illustrated by Emily’s account. Discussing the inclusion of a picture showing a fashionable-looking girl in her collage, social comparison emerges as a genuine source of anxiety and inadequacy for Emily as well as forming the foundation of her impetus to resolve the situation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1469540512438155">Figure 2</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p><bold>I:</bold> what about her … what do you think about the way she’s dressed?</p>
<p><bold>E:</bold> am …. I like her hair as well as her clothes … I’d love to have straight hair … you see my hair it goes all mad … its nice when it’s done … but it’s just going greasy now</p>
<p><bold>I:</bold> would your mum ever let you have a straightener?</p>
<p><bold>E:</bold> yeh I wanted a GHD but its gonna ruin my hair and my mum said no Emily you’re going to use it every day and I said I’ll only use it after I wash it but I know I will use it every day!</p>
<p><bold>I:</bold> yeh I know</p>
<p><bold>E:</bold> my hair just goes … I’m sick of tying it back … I just hate tying it back … and you see … there’s this girl in my class and her hair’s so straight … you know that silky straight hair … she never dries her hair … she lets it dry naturally … and it dries so silky and soft … it dries in strands you know that way … I have to get a straightener …</p></disp-quote>
<fig id="fig2-1469540512438155" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Sample of collage (2).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1469540512438155-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Her admiration for her classmate’s hair has made Emily evaluate her own appearance and find it significantly lacking in comparison. Having become aware of a consumption-based solution to her problem, Emily focuses on the possibility of aligning herself with this flagrant normative of teen identity: having an ideal appearance.</p>
<p>This finding is also congruent with notions of ‘emphasized femininity’ theorized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469540512438155">Connell (1987). Connell’s (1987)</xref> empirical work highlighted what he termed a ‘compliance’ by females to the anticipated wants of not only men but society as a whole through the construction of their gender around ‘accommodating the interests and desires of men’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469540512438155">Connell, 1987</xref>: 186). Emphasizing one’s femininity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469540512438155">Connell (1987)</xref> deduced was recognized as the most culturally prized form of femininity, despite the fact that it may be quite alien to girls of a high school age. Through this additional theoretical lens of focus, therefore, Emily is not only grappling with individual levels and personal implications of social comparison but also represents an attempt at crafting an ‘emphasized’ version of her feminine self in line with what society at large represents, in part through marketing communications (as seen in the collage sample in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1469540512438155">Figure 2</xref>), as the idealized form of the female exterior.</p>
<p>Hannah’s series of diary entries following a class excursion vividly illustrates how outside the neutralizing domain of the school uniform, the social outing evolves into a competitive, social comparison-inducing opportunity. Suddenly the totality of Hannah’s wardrobe seems starkly inept and incomplete. Her meagre array of ‘designer gear’ is held up in comparison to her peers and found to be severely lacking.

<p>15th November 2006</p>
<p>last night was sooo much fun. Except everyone was dressed in their finest designer gear and REAL uggs (which cost like €300). I know I own an Abercrombie jumper (and I wore it last night) but it’s the only piece of Abercrombie I have! … have to get more</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Acutely attuned to the dynamics of social comparison in which their consumption practices appear to be grounded, the tweens reveal how observation of such dynamics has led to the construction of an archetypal anti-role model of consumption. For example Eva provides a detailed list of criteria that ensure that one doesn’t become an anti-role model of consumption, cognizant of the level of social comparison that she believes to be in operation. Most of these imperatives revolve around a specific configuration of brand consumption:
<disp-quote>
<p>I: are you wearing brands right now?</p>
<p>E: could be … it’ll take a while to check</p>
<p>I: what about your runners then?</p>
<p>E: yea I love Nike Air … you have to have Nike Air</p>
<p>I: oh right….why do you like them so much?</p>
<p>E: everyone just have to have Nike Air</p>
<p>I: right</p>
<p>E: if you don’t people think you don’t have a penney … I know a person who doesn’t have Nike Air … they just get normal runners and I dunno … it’s like you don’t make friends or something like that …</p>
<p>I: explain that to me</p>
<p>E: like if you haven’t got Nike … like if you haven’t got a certain brand that everyone has … if you haven’t got any brand at all … people aren’t really that good friends with you</p>
<p>I: do you think so</p>
<p>E: or if you buy your brand just coz other people are buying it … you have kinda have no kinda type or taste</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>According to Eva at least, a young girl’s worth as a person is directly linked to her ability to choose and display certain branded products. She is constructing, using Nike air in particular, an anti-role model who will incur social isolation as a result of their non-alignment with the ‘criteria of consumption’. By ignoring the dictates of the masses and unspoken dynamics of social comparison and subsequent judgment, it appears that one is projecting a social self that is deemed inadequate and unworthy of social acceptability.</p>
<p>Concurrently, while outlining the modes of consumption that must be adhered to if one is to earn social acceptance, Eva points out that equally negative attributions are warranted when an individual distastefully wears brands based only on their social appeal rather than possessing any real brand knowledge or interest. In other words, to be too keen to conform or mimic, without any depth to the behaviour, is just as big a social error as avoiding brands altogether. The tweens appear to be walking a veritable tightrope. Get the configuration right and social acceptance is a certainty, mindlessly consume symbolic resources without supportive learning, and exclusion becomes a real possibility. Comparing oneself in a social situation acts thus as a gauge of acceptability.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1469540512438155"><title>Collective cohesion</title>
<p>Cognizant of their sociocultural status as ambiguous neophytes, the tweens displayed consumption strategies centred on aligning with the collective imperatives of the fledgling teen environs towards which they must gravitate. Elaine’s interview reveals how she manages the indeterminacy of the signifying systems of consumption and adolescence through engagement with a form of unquestioning collectivity, forgoing any intervention of personal preference:
<disp-quote>
<p>I: and what about these</p>
<p>E: I love dubes … coz everyone loves dubes … actually I don’t know why everyone likes them so much … they’re actually pretty ugly … but I can’t say that anyway coz everyone has them</p>
<p>I: and is that why you got them</p>
<p>E: coz everyone has them? Yeh definitely</p>
<p>I: it wasn’t like they are the nicest shoes I’ve ever seen in my life</p>
<p>E: (laughs) … no</p>
<p>I: and why do you think … there has to be something going for them … are they comfy?</p>
<p>E: I don’t know … they look okay … and am … I was actually told I shouldn’t get them by the people coz my feet are like broad or something and they’re not that comfy …</p>
<p>I: so you couldn’t walk for ages in them</p>
<p>E: no you could but like … it wouldn’t be like oh these feel so soft and …</p>
<p>I: cushioned?</p>
<p>E: yeh!</p>
<p>I: and so did you get them when you were just going into secondary school or when you were in sixth class</p>
<p>E: just going into secondary</p>
<p>I: but did you know about them in sixth class</p>
<p>E: ye one girl had them</p>
<p>I: and how come you didn’t get them then</p>
<p>E: coz no-one really had them then …</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>By aligning herself with the mindless, group-oriented decisions of her peers, Elaine forgoes any input of her personal consumption preferences. Not only is she saying that she has decided to subsume her individual tastes under the overbearing force of social demands and consumption imperatives but also implies that she cannot even speak ill of the brands that form the conforming constellation. Furthermore, she ignores the recommendations of those who inform her of the unsuitability of the shoe to her own foot shape, primarily because this advice deviates from adherence to the collective forces of her social space. Elaine cannot provide any tangible reason for choosing to incorporate this brand into her frame of reference and consumption practices, apart from its central position in the ‘uniform’ of brands and products extolled by the masses. By adhering to the imperatives of the collective mindset, she is engaging in a consumption strategy that she believes will ensure the fulfilment of her trajectory towards teen subjectivity.</p>
<p>Eva’s interview is vividly reflective of one who focuses their energies on engaging with a collective outlook. The majority of consumer culture oriented information that she has accrued is in line with what Eva espouses as the trends and fashions of her peers and wider sociocultural networks. Her discussion of the Playboy bunny brand exemplifies the ‘I = everyone’ dialectic that underlines Eva’s consumption styles of agency during this liminal time:
<disp-quote>
<p>I: so what about the playboy teeshirt?</p>
<p>E: I love Playboy … everyone loves Playboy</p>
<p>I: why? … tell me about it</p>
<p>E: I don’t actually know … we just like the bunny … or something … I don’t actually know … if one person buys it like you get it and then suddenly everyone has it and then everyone likes it so I don’t actually know what it is about it</p>
<p>I: right … so it takes one person to go out and go ‘I’m buying it’</p>
<p>E: yea and then it takes three people to make it popular</p>
<p>I: and would you be that kind of person … would you wait until someone else has it or would you go and get it yourself first</p>
<p>E: yeh I’d wait until I’ve seen a few people get it … to see whether it’s nice or not</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This extract is rife with collectively oriented opinions and attitudes. For Eva adopting the collective mindset has led to mindless decisions and a blurring or neutralizing of individual preference formation. She even speaks in the collective voice almost as if they (Eva and her peers) were one person. In line with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469540512438155">Langer (2005)</xref> this sense of unquestioning, compulsive group consumption fulfils the regenerative needs of capitalist consumerism by igniting the incessant desiring, emulating and imitating that is necessary to sustain itself as a system. In addition, Eva relays how she uses the collective experience of others engaged with a brand as a trial prior to her own purchase of the label. It is almost as if the particulars of a brand are rendered futile, and replaced by its collective adoption or social significance. Collective cohesion highlights how these liminars engage with a strategy of consumption focused on subsuming risky individual preferences beneath the security of collective consensus as they exist on the threshold of their old and new worlds.</p>

<sec id="sec14-1469540512438155"><title>Theoretical conclusions: The fruitful darkness</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469540512438155">Turner’s (1967)</xref> metaphorical conceptualization of the lived experience of those who are no longer but concurrently not yet, adds insightful impetus to a theorization of these young consumers’ mediation of shifting social milieus and consumption practices. Cognizant of the fact that the tweens’ lack clear sociocultural categorization, and consequently engage – bricolage style – in a fusion of past, present and future selves, there is a tangible darkness to their sense of self. The clashing of social and personal subjectivities results in frustration, confusion and invisibility. Belonging in neither signifying realm but concurrently embedded in both, these social anomalies thus experience a suspension of identities akin to a cocooned chrysalis, in the midst of an inevitable transformation.</p>
<p>However, despite the potent darkness and ambiguity inherent in their threshold existence as social incongruities, the liminal period is proposed to represent a fruitful darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469540512438155">Turner, 1967</xref>: 110). The conceptualization of the liminal period as a fruitful darkness or a cocoon of possibilities acknowledges the contextual conditions of liminality, but also captures the sense of focused ambition and agency that characterizes this period of existing as social anomalies in relation to the consumption strategies and styles of agency used by the tweens to navigate this rockiest of terrain. Collective cohesion, social comparison and disconnection emerged as consumption practices oriented towards the inevitable emergence from the suspended, socially ambiguous liminal threshold into a teen subjectivity and a subsequent immersion in teen consumer culture.</p>
<p>Thus, the metaphor of fruitful darkness encapsulates the concurrent darkness and energy, the restorative obscurity that epitomizes the liminar’s experiences within the interstices of social categorization. Although shadowed and blurred from societal categorization, the tweens engage with strategic consumption practices that ready them for progression across their threshold. Liminal consumption emerges as a theoretical understanding of those who exist and consume mid-way along a threshold of suspended identities, belonging to neither child nor teen sphere but concurrently embedded in both. By theorizing in relation to the liminal tween, this research has evolved from a micro-level study focused on the specific consumption practices of a selected group, to a meso-level project with theoretical potential outside the sample studied for the purposes of this research.</p>
<p>In addition, by stepping outside of the dichotomy debate as well as the ‘production of consumption’ perspective via the adoption of a ‘doing childhood’ epistemological orientation, this research contributes to a timely re-focus within the discipline. The ‘fruitful darkness’ theorization highlights that conceptualizations of child consumers as merely ‘becoming’ are inept in the face of tangible ‘fruitful’ consumption activities that although often rendered less potent due to their liminal status, are none the less intricate, focused and worthy of exploration. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540512438155">Cook (2010)</xref> outlines in his discussion of ‘commercial enculturation’ as a much needed alternative to child consumer socialization approaches, these tweens are no longer merely ‘becoming’ consumers but have entered into a very visible social relation with consumption as they mediate their liminal status with consumption objects and practices.</p>
<p>Finally, through the methodological tools of diaries, in-depth interviews, collages and shopping trips, this exploration is possible. The voice of the child consumer was resurrected from the sea of effects-oriented research that has threatened to subsume the child’s own perspective beneath a mass of abstract theorizations and social constructions, thereby reconsidering the richness of children’s voices.</p>
<p>The complex intimacy uncovered between young adolescent identity and the marketplace attests to the blurred boundary between personhood and consumerism, however problematic that inference may be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469540512438155">Langer, 2005</xref>). In addition, this research aims to begin aligning micro understandings and theorizations of children’s social worlds and consumer culture practices with existing meso and macro levels of consumption theory, for example the burgeoning interpretative consumer research literature (e.g. CCT).</p>
<p>It is clear that in times when that identity is liminal, slipping between the cracks of sociocultural organization, consumption practices take on a preparatory, mediating force. Thus those who resemble social neophytes, understudies waiting in the wings between the signifying worlds of child and teen, through their consumption practices embody, not darkness and inconsequential becoming, but rather a fruitful indeterminacy.</p>

<bio><p><bold>Kevina Cody</bold> currently lectures at both undergraduate and postgraduate level in the school of Marketing, at the Dublin Institute of Technology. Modules delivered include consumer behaviour, communications, brand management and dissertation research methods. Her research interests are primarily in the area of consumer culture and marketing communications, specifically the myriad interactions between the commercial world of the market and the social exchanges of groups and individuals. In particular, Kevina's previous research has looked at the mediation of childhood experiences through the lens and symbolic resources of consumer culture. Kevina's work is currently published in <italic>Marketing Theory</italic>. She has already published in <italic>Advances in Consumer Research</italic>, as well as presented papers at ACR, EACR and CTC (Child/Teen Consumption).</p></bio>
