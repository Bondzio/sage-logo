<p>Sylvain Chomet’s animated feature <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> (2003) makes recurrent references to cycles and recycling. Putting spokes in interlinking wheels, these offer new perspectives on the exploitative cycles of the global market and challenge some of the constituent discourses of French exceptionalism: economic, philosophical and cinematic. Instead of figuring a big bad American Other, the film exposes French co-implication in the global market, past and present, and in its exploitative entertainment industry. The examination of these motifs reveals intersections with and divergences from <italic>altermondialiste</italic> debates and critics of (late) capitalism such as Barthes, Baudrillard, Debord and Derrida. Chomet also seeks to negotiate the ways in which his film in turn colludes in such cycles. Indeed Chomet’s recycling of cinematic techniques and images (feature and animation; French, Hollywood and <italic>anime</italic>; hand-drawn and CGI) invites questions as to the enduring critical potential of cinema.</p>

<p>Sylvain Chomet’s <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> was a surprise hit at Cannes and internationally in 2003,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0957155812443178">1</xref></sup> and has attracted a broad spectrum of international scholarly attention. Significant analyses of the film have already considered it in terms of its cross-cultural intertexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957155812443178">Floquet, 2006</xref>); of nostalgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957155812443178">Place-Verghnes, 2007</xref>); of its relationship with the history of animation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957155812443178">McCann, 2008</xref>); of the mechanisms of trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957155812443178">Waldron, 2008</xref>) and of the tensions between French urban centres and <italic>banlieues</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155812443178">Austin, 2009</xref>). However, this animated film’s recurrent references to recycling and to cycles – vehicular, conceptual and economic – have not been explored. Yet examining these motifs in Chomet’s film offers new perspectives on French co-implication in the exploitative cycles of the global market and its entertainment industry, challenges some of the constituent discourses of French exceptionalism – economic, philosophical and cinematic – and invites questions as to the enduring critical potential of film. Instead of figuring an unambiguous big bad American Other, the film exposes how France is involved in oiling the wheels of global market economics. In <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> cycles and recycling resonate with and supplement French critiques of (late) capitalism. Simultaneously, these recurrent motifs shed light on the effects of the commodifying, novelty-led cycles of the entertainment industry and challenge cinematic clichés of ‘bright lights, big city’. And, all the while, Chomet intervenes in debates as to how, whilst cinema is a cog in the wheels of the market, filmmaking may yet challenge dominant discourses and aesthetics.</p>
<p><italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> opens with a black-and-white ‘film within a film’ of the Belleville Cartoune music hall, featuring acts from the 1920s to the 1940s. It then spans the 1950s childhood in outlying Paris of Champion, Chomet’s bicycle-obsessed protagonist; the ill-named grown-up cyclist’s participation in a 1960s Tour de France; and his abduction from the race and shipment across a CGI ocean to the apparently North American twenty-first-century city of Belleville. Here Champion is exploited by a French Mafia, and is finally freed by the ingenious <italic>bricolage</italic> of his indomitable Portuguese grandmother Mme Souza and the now aged Triplettes de Belleville, a trio which once sang at the Belleville Cartoune. The film moves between sepia tones, black-and-white feature film footage and a muted palette. With a hand-drawn aesthetic quietly underpinned by CGI technology, it also harks back to animation’s Golden Age; and having practically no dialogue and a jazz-predominant soundtrack, to silent film, Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Josephine Baker, Django Reinhardt and Fred Astaire make brief appearances in the opening sequence alongside the fictional Triplettes de Belleville. There is a wealth of filmic intertexts which put French films including Jacques Tati comedies and <italic>noir</italic> favourite, <italic>Les Tontons flingueurs</italic> (dir. Lautner, 1963) alongside Hollywood landmarks ranging from the first animated feature, <italic>Gertie the Dinosaur</italic> (dir. McKay, 1914) and Disney’s Golden Age of animation to <italic>Bullitt</italic> (dir. Yates, 1968), <italic>The Italian Job</italic> (dir. Collinson, 1969), <italic>Men in Black</italic> (dir. Sonnenfeld, 1997) and <italic>The Matrix</italic> (dir. L. and A. Wachowski, 1999). The film is also full of references to other icons of French visual culture, ranging from Toulouse-Lautrec to comic cartoonist Albert Dubout’s 1930s anti-bourgeois representations of ‘la grosse bonne-femme et son petit bonhomme’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0957155812443178">2</xref></sup> and late twentieth-century <italic>bande dessinateurs</italic> Gotlib and Lob.</p>
<p>Indeed, at a first glance <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> may appear to be a Francocentric – or even a French exceptionalist – film. The first part is set in what is to become a suburb of Paris and revolves around cycling, culminating in a long Tour de France sequence. This includes a cameo appearance by de Gaulle and several of the film’s intertexts to Tati’s bicycle-premised <italic>Jour de Fête</italic> (dir. Tati, 1949), and so to the concerns Tati evokes about a perceived French alacrity to adopt American-style <italic>rapidité</italic>. A French Wine Center is nestled amidst Belleville’s skyscrapers and is run by a beret-toting dyspeptic French Mafia gang, as, indeed, is the whole city. Yet Chomet’s representations of cycling and recycling, together with his own recycling of techniques and images from a century of cinema (from silent to <italic>noir</italic>; feature to animation; hand-drawn cells to CGI; French to Hollywood to Japanese <italic>anime</italic>), put spokes in a number of interlinking wheels of which France is shown to be a dynamo.</p>
<sec id="section1-0957155812443178">
<title>French co-implication in vicious global cycles</title>
<p>Instead of echoing French exceptionalist discourses which figure France as the victim of American neoliberalism, <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> exposes French co-implication in the global market. Champion’s arrival in Belleville is marked by a close-up of an obese lookalike ‘Statue of Liberty’. However, if Belleville’s apparently present-day inhabitants are literally represented as global (their spherical proportions transcend ethnicity), the consumer avidity and excess that pertain in an ostensibly North American city already appear to have been operating in 1960s France. And although the hamburger-brandishing ‘Liberty’ resonates with José Bové’s <italic>fin de millénaire</italic> campaign against <italic>la malbouffe</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0957155812443178">3</xref></sup> Chomet’s fat Tour de France spectators suggest that for decades France has adopted some of the patterns of consumption associated with North America.</p>
<p>Likewise, the wine-drinking, beret-wearing, cigarette-smoking and 2CV-driving French Mafia seem to send up the worst of stereotypical representations of French cultural specificity. However, geographically and economically, these French baddies are firmly established in the middle of the global city and dominate its parallel economy. That France may actively collude in the iniquitous cycles of the global market rather than being its victim is also suggested by the way in which the Wine Center building and its cycling-premised gambling den slots into the skyline of Belleville. Furthermore, Chomet’s French Mafia boss bears more than a passing resemblance both to Bové with his distinctive moustache and to similarly mustachioed SuperDupont, Gotlib and Lob’s comic-book ‘hero’ who mixes Superman with caricatures of French exceptionalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0957155812443178">4</xref></sup> SuperDupont supports economic patriotism, smokes Gauloises, drinks red wine and, like Bové, who rose to fame protesting against US bans on Roquefort in 1999, eats French cheese. Yet this seems to be much more than a humorous knock at French protectionism. Chomet destabilises the cliché of France as the victim of American neoliberalism, and with his infinitely reproducing Gallic Mafiosi suggests the extent – and recurrence – of active French involvement in global market economics.</p>
<p>Moreover, to consider the obese Statue of Liberty simply as an anti-American French exceptionalist jibe would be to forget that Ellis Island’s Liberty was a gift from France to the USA, and that she is historically linked to the politics – and economics – of immigration; and, arguably, to the fate of immigrants in the present-day global marketplace, predicated as it is on earlier colonial and economic cycles of exploitation. Indeed Chomet’s emphasis on ports suggests not only the movement of goods, but also the movement of people. The ship carrying the kidnapped cyclists leaves from what appears to be Marseille, a port associated with colonial and postcolonial immigration. The cyclists’ manacled passage over the ocean reminds spectators that the global market has foundations in slavery (and that in addition to the Anglophone ‘slave triangle’ of the UK, Africa and the USA, there was one between France, Africa and the Caribbean). Meanwhile Canada, recalled by the architectural features of Belleville which reference Montreal and Quebec City, was, of course, once colonised by France. So by linking the past and the present, economically and in terms of human traffic, <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> recalls how the slave trade and colonialism constitute earlier cycles of what is now called globalisation.</p>
<p>Chomet also reminds audiences how, over hundreds of years, countries such as France, Canada and the US have become the adopted home of economic immigrants from a range of backgrounds: European as well as (neo)colonial. Champion’s grandmother Mme Souza recalls the waves of early twentieth-century Portuguese immigrants arriving in France’s cities and employed in domestic service or industry (many lived in Belleville in Paris, home to successive waves of immigrants, now predominantly postcolonial). An emaciated Hispanic-looking beggar in Belleville utters one of the emphatically rare snatches of dialogue in a French Canadian accent. Indeed, beyond the postcolonial and transnational lenses through which much French and Francophone cinema is analysed, this film brings into focus broader economic and neo-imperial flows of goods and people. Meanwhile Madame Souza’s mute horror as the Triplettes smack their lips at frog soup, frog brochettes and tadpole popcorn simultaneously sends up xenophobic clichés of the French and France’s own self-image as a <italic>terre d’asile</italic> for all comers. The Portuguese grandmother’s rendition of the fado song ‘Uma casa portuguesa’ is a tuneless cacophony to the French triplets (and implicitly to the audience). She and dog Bruno are excluded from the Triplettes’ nighttime enjoyment of Tati’s <italic>Jour de Fête</italic>, so Madame Souza at once evokes layers of French immigration and concomitant failures of integration.</p>
<p>What is more, French protagonists contribute willingly – if obliviously – to the vicious cycles that exploit them. Throughout <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> Champion’s physique, his obsession with cycling, and Chomet’s attention to gestural detail bring to mind Tati’s hapless village postman François. If <italic>Jour de Fête</italic>’s François who elects to uncritically adopt modernisation <italic>à l’américain</italic> is Tati’s metonymy for France during the early days of post-war modernisation, then Champion performs a parallel function, but as an unthinking cog in the wheels of contemporary global consumption. And this is not unique to docile Champion, whose cyclist compatriots are also hooked up to wine drips and peddle unquestioningly to fuel the French Mafia’s gambling den. Despite having been discarded by the mainstream entertainment industry, the impoverished Triplettes continue to perform their old hits to the Mafia boss, now as a skiffle act using domestic appliances. Meanwhile, the midget Portuguese mechanic works underground, oiling the wheels of the corrupt parallel economy that exploits him. Indeed, in addition to disrupting binary clichés that construct France as America’s neo-imperial victim, Chomet reveals racism and marginalisation – historical and contemporary – within the <italic>hexagone</italic>.</p>

<title>There’ll always be Disney in Paris?</title>
<p><italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> at once adds new perspectives to the diverse range of recent French critical interventions on the new inequities of the audiovisual sphere,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0957155812443178">5</xref></sup> and destabilises cultural exceptionalist narratives which position French cinema as the victim of the big bad Hollywood machine. However, Chomet’s focus is on French cinema’s co-implication in the global entertainment industry. What is more, by figuring his phantasmatic city as an amalgam of various global cities, and as the site of serial waves of immigration, exploitation and failures of integration, Chomet also brings into question cinema’s role in creating images of ‘bright lights, big city’: imaginary constructs which play a role in precipitating migratory flows, nationally and transnationally.</p>
<p>Chomet’s choice of the name Belleville is no doubt ironically intended: this unbeautiful, inhospitable city punctures one of the dreams of modernity so often evoked by cinema on both sides of the Atlantic. Belleville’s architectural references span New York, Toronto, Quebec City and Montreal – and of course Paris, for the Belleville of the present-day twentieth <italic>arrondissement</italic> was once one of Paris’s outlying villages. And Paris, the ‘City of Light’, like New York has a particularly strong claim to creating images of ‘bright lights, big city’. Yet instead of inspiring awe, oppression and disillusion are evoked by the first glimpse of Belleville, a paradoxical, animated version of the classic high-angled shot. There are also a lot of ground-level perspectives foregrounding the mean streets between the walls of skyscrapers, ramshackle tenements and dilapidated docks. Rather than dialogue, with its promise of communication, the soundtrack resonates with the most alienating of city sounds. So although Chomet’s are animated city streets, they evoke the grim reality of metropolises: the human and material degradation often occluded in celluloid representations of high-rise chrome and steel.</p>
<p>Much has been written about what is perceived as a dynamic relationship between cities, modernity, mobility and the moving image.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0957155812443178">6</xref></sup> Giuliana Bruno, for example, argues that the new geography of modernity – the cityscape with its arcades, bridges, railways, electric underground, powered flights, skyscrapers, department stores and exhibition halls – produced a new spatio-visuality emphasising transit. She suggests that this mobility has an inherently cinematic quality, such that the changes in perception of relationships between space, place and bodies in movement experienced in the modern city effectively laid the foundations for the invention of cinema, of the moving image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957155812443178">Bruno, 2002</xref>). Chomet too is evidently concerned with the relationships between cinema, cities, movement and modernity, but by contrast, his emphasis is on going round in circles. The film is full of trains, boats and, <italic>bien sûr</italic>, bicycles. Yet a toy train on the circular track that runs over puppy Bruno’s tail leaves the traumatised dog serially compelled to bark at over-ground commuters whom the dog perceives as prisoners. The rusting ship the French Mafia use to take Champion and his compatriot captive cyclists over to Belleville links France with earlier cycles of human exploitation. And the captured Tour de France competitors pedal endlessly to power the corrupt wheels of exploitation. So instead of forward movement, vehicles in this city reference vicious cycles.</p>
<p>As the film draws to a close, a skyline shot of the receding cityscape reminds spectators of Disney’s Magic Kingdom (and perhaps of Disneyland in Paris). The Portuguese mechanic’s loyalty card for <italic>Hollyfood</italic> fast-food outlets and a souvenir photo complete with Mickey Mouse ears is an example of how entertainment networks – French and global – simultaneously produce and fail to live up to immigrants’ dreams. When the Mafia boss is blown up in the penultimate sequence of the film, the explosion that lights up the sky over Belleville looks like a tawdry red, white and blue version of the firework finale of the Main Street Electric Parade, recycled every night across Disney’s global empire (and so, of course, at Disneyland Paris). But strains of the ‘Marseillaise’ can be heard as the boss’s beret floats back down to earth, beyond a knee-jerk anti-Americanism, further suggesting collusion in global economic cycles through resonances of Bastille Day firework displays.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0957155812443178">7</xref></sup> Earlier, the animated ‘camera’ zooms into a close-up of the toilet bowl in the Triplettes’ tenement block, clearly framing excrement drawn in the shape of Mickey Mouse’s head. Here, whilst the animated reality of the American dream is revealed, so is the notion that French dreams – and economic realities – are also bound up with it.</p>
<p>What is more, beyond Disney, and beyond North America, in the opening sequence set in France, Chomet foregrounds earlier cycles of exploitation from Josephine Baker, with her body shape exaggerated and a titillating skirt of bananas recalling the racism of belle époque negrophilia, to the Triplettes discarded by the French entertainment industry. Here once again Chomet destabilises French critical discourses of the big bad economic American Other with its big bad Hollywood film industry that toppled French cinematic ascendancy. And these are not the only critical discourses linked with late capitalism that are brought into question.</p>

<title>Spokes in the wheels of thought (and sport)</title>
<p>Chomet’s recurrent use of motifs of cycles and recycling also supplements French critiques of (late) capitalism – critiques which, perhaps in spite of themselves, may have certain French exceptionalist overtones. If Chomet’s Tour de France sequence operates as a microcosm for France’s adoption of global market economics, the representation of what has become a commercial nightmare also intersects with and supplements Roland Barthes’s analysis of the 1950s Tour de France in <italic>Mythologies</italic>, which seeks to reveal the nationalist and capitalist ideologies that sustain this exceptionalist dream:
<disp-quote>
<p>Je crois que le Tour est à la fois un mythe d’expression et un mythe de projection, réaliste et utopique tout en même temps. Le Tour exprime et libère les Français à travers une fable unique où les impostures traditionnelles … se mêlent à des formes d’intérêt positif, à l’image utopique d’un monde qui cherche obstinément à se réconcilier par le spectacle d’une clarté totale des rapports entre l’homme, les hommes, et la Nature. Ce qui est vicié dans le Tour, c’est la base, les mobiles économiques, le profit ultime de l’épreuve, générateur d’alibis idéologiques. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957155812443178">Barthes, 1957</xref>: 118–19)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While Barthes’s demystification of the Tour uses references spanning the Bible, ancient Gaul and myths including that of Sisyphus, the physical challenges of Chomet’s Tour de France are occluded by pervasive television and radio commentary and heavily branded commercial activities. Barthes describes how the most punishing <italic>étapes</italic> of the Tour are fashioned into an epic narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957155812443178">Barthes, 1957</xref>: 112). The Tour de France commentary in <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> echoes these descriptions by describing the improbably muscled cyclists as ‘prédateurs des montagnes’, and appears to rationalise their toiling, ‘en attendant l’auréole de la victoire, celle de la sueur’. Yet the disjunction between Chomet’s hyperbolic commentary and his visual representation of pointless pedalling and dodgy dealing underpins how the event is a cynical commercial cycle, and so can no longer be consumed as a feat of superhuman endurance. Indeed the obese spectators are more interested in the <italic>caravane promotionnel</italic> (or in watching it on television as the cyclists speed by) than in the race itself. Champion is trapped in the endless cycles of consumerism which create desires, which are constantly renewed but never fulfilled. He may display Sisyphean acceptance, but it is impossible to imagine the paradoxically named Champion happy. Indeed, Chomet’s Tour has no heroic end, and his demystification of the race involves not demigods, but three rank-and-file <italic>coureurs</italic>, who are kidnapped and become unthinking cogs in the wheels of a French-run but implicitly global criminal economy.</p>
<p>What is more, within the exaggerated media commentary there is a snatch of de Gaulle lauding Pou-Pou, the 1960s cyclist Raymond Poulidor. Since the president was accused of financing the transport for Pou-Pou’s arch-rival Jacques Anquetil, this suggests a nationally sanctioned corruption of the Tour. Indeed Floquet identifies the yellow jersey of <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> as Anquetil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957155812443178">Floquet, 2006</xref>), a <italic>courseur célèbre</italic> who serially pipped Pou-pou, ‘l’éternel second’, into second place, openly admitting to using performance-enhancing drugs and being in the race purely for the money.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0957155812443178">8</xref></sup> This would chime with Chomet’s focus on the Tour turned corrupt media circus. As global market economics began to have their influence on France, then, there was much more to be revealed than met Barthes’s eyes.</p>
<p>Indeed, Chomet’s depiction of the Tour de France provides new perspectives on what Guy Debord might have described as the spectacularisation of sport. Although <italic>La Société du spectacle</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957155812443178">Debord, 1967</xref>) and <italic>Commentaire sur la société du spectacle</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957155812443178">Debord, 1988</xref>) do not feature sport, in the latter Debord glumly identifies how ‘spectacular’ society has become the <italic>spectaculaire intégré</italic>, impervious to situationist <italic>détournements</italic>. Here he claims that the integrated spectacle perpetuates its hegemony through television, the commodification of voices of dissent, and institutionalised Mafia-type activities. The increasingly negative implications of Debord’s thought are echoed in <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic>, such that Chomet’s Tour de France reanimates Debord’s description of the integrated spectacle. The event is suffused with dirty Mafia dealings, and dominated by television. And if the exaggerated commentary reflects the impact of television in France in the early 1960s, Mafia-type activities proliferate both in France and in ‘North American’ Belleville. So Chomet suggests a global economy to which the French cyclists contribute, in thrall to the big screen and peddling unquestioningly to keep the integrated spectacle going.</p>
<p>The film also invites comparison with Baudrillard’s evocation of Disneyland in his figuring of the hyperreal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957155812443178">Baudrillard, 1981</xref>). Chomet’s Belleville, recalling Disney’s Magic Mountain, found in all the corporation’s theme parks at the end of Main Street (and therefore, of course, at Disneyland Paris), thus echoes Baudrillard’s exemplification of Main Street as the epitome of the hyperreal, a simulacrum, a copy adrift from any original:
<disp-quote>
<p>panégyrique des valeurs américaines, transposition idéalisée d’une réalité contradictoire. Mais ceci cache autre chose et cette trame ‘idéologique’ sert elle-même de couverture à une simulation de troisième ordre: Disneyland est là pour cacher que c’est le pays ‘réel’ qui est Disneyland (un peu comme les prisons sont là pour cacher que c’est le social tout entier, dans son omniprésence banale, qui est carcéral). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957155812443178">Baudrillard, 1981</xref>: 25–6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, Baudrillard goes on to equate Disneyland with the proliferation of toxic, hypperreal waste: ‘la première grande déjection toxique d’une civilisation hyperréelle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957155812443178">Baudrillard, 1981</xref>: 27). Yet, in a telling contrast with Baudrillard’s epitomising of hyperreality, Chomet’s toxic, wasteful phantasmatic city is represented to audiences as the grim ‘reality’ of ‘real’ metropolises. Belleville also offers intertextual links to the Wachowski brothers’ <italic>Matrix</italic> trilogy (including, perhaps, Morpheus’s own Baudrillardian intertext in <italic>The Matrix</italic>, ‘Welcome to the desert of the real’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0957155812443178">9</xref></sup> The Mafia boss and his heavies, who are black-suited and wear identical dark glasses, replicate in the bowels of the French Wine Center, recalling Agent Smith, who reproduces infinitely across all three <italic>Matrix</italic> films. What is more, Chomet’s Mafia boss’s resemblance to SuperDupont may remind French viewers that Dupont is the French equivalent of Smith.</p>
<p>More positively, perhaps, the film appears to be a potentially productive site of Derridean <italic>différance</italic>, revealing the weaving of layers and traces, interlinking and simultaneously blurring past and present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957155812443178">Derrida, 1972</xref>). Indeed <italic>différance</italic> is inscribed in the film’s very title, <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic>. Threes simultaneously disrupt binaries and evoke linguistic <italic>différance</italic>: in French ‘triplette’ simultaneously signifies triplets, three-seater bicycles and the first three horses in a race to pass the finishing line. The canny harnessing of consumer products by Mme Souza and the Triplettes, together with the emphasis on co-implication and intertextuality, also seem to evoke Derrida’s development of Lévi-Strauss’s notion of <italic>bricolage</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155812443178">Lévi-Strauss, 1962</xref>). While for the structuralist, <italic>bricolage</italic> applied to universal systems of mythical thought, Derrida extends the concept to any discourse, countering the false Western premise of a text having a heritage or a stable coherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957155812443178">Derrida, 1967</xref>). Instead, for Derrida cultural production is necessarily <italic>bricoleur</italic>, part of a tissue of texts, made up of provisional, differing and deferring meanings. Perhaps, therefore, Chomet intends his own <italic>bricolage</italic>, his recycling of intertexts and the Triplettes’ and Mme Souza’s ingenious recycling of household appliances, to figure a potential means of putting a spoke in the wheels of the totalising cycles of global capitalism.</p>
<p>However, Chomet’s intertextual play demonstrates that the impossibility of escaping the recycling of images is always already a filmic – and textual – condition. Furthermore, if the film foregrounds threes rather than binary oppositions, its trios still go round in circles. <italic>Bricolage</italic> does not enable the Triplettes to break out of exploitative cycles, or to liberate Champion from them. Whilst the Triplettes’ domestic appliance stage act suggests the enduring creative potential of cultural production, their inventiveness is a nostalgic one not demonstrated by the generation of Champion and the French Mafia, who are both victims and motors of the mass media and the global market. So Chomet at once rides with and puts spokes in the wheels of late capitalism and the critical discourses that seek to challenge them. Yet even if the animated reality of Belleville is worse than Baudrillard’s simulated cities, and Belleville chimes with Debord’s <italic>spectaculaire intégré</italic>, Chomet nonetheless explores how cinema may yet be able to challenge late capitalist aesthetics and discourses.</p>

<title>The aesthetics and the ethics of recycling</title>
<p>Chomet’s uses of the motifs of cycles and recycling suggest a self-reflexive awareness of how filmmaking is itself a cog in the wheels of the global market. Indeed <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> simultaneously explores the enduring critical potential of film, and of filmic recycling. The witty use of the tropes of <italic>film noir</italic>, with its car chases (here with stretch 2CVs blighted by the poor suspension for which these iconic French vehicles are famed) and villains (here the French Mafia) draws attention to French collusion in exploitative economic cycles and entertainment networks. In one ‘film within a film’, ‘real’ black-and-white footage of a road is projected on a loop to keep the static cyclists pedalling in the gambling den. Thus ‘real’ footage is revealed as credible artifice, suggesting by comparison the potential of animated film to offer a critical perspective in a world anaesthetised by the audio-visual output of Hollywood and television. Meanwhile, the Triplettes, stars of the first animated ‘film within a film’, watch the cycle chase sequence from Tati’s 1949 <italic>Jour de Fête</italic> on television. By creating animations watching ‘real’ films within an animated film, Chomet underpins how the protagonists – and, by implication, filmmakers and spectators – are co-implicated in the vicious cycles represented. And the ‘reality’ of the exploitative cycles is represented here in a deliberately paradoxically ‘unreal’ blend of hand-drawn cells and CGI.</p>
<p>Yet all the while the film draws attention to its own artificial status, to the techniques that create cinematic (hyper)’reality’ and to the structures underpinning the visual language of film. Bruno the dog dreams in black-and-white footage, the ‘camera’ ‘zooms’ in and out and there are classic filmic transitions. Self-reflexivity is structurally inscribed within the film: for example, in the sequence where we watch obese animated holidaymakers watching the Tour de France on television as ‘real’ animated cyclists speed past behind their backs. Perhaps, then, Chomet intends <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> to be a questioning of both its own critical potential and that of film in general.</p>
<p>Certainly, given Chomet’s combination of hand-drawn cells, CGI and feature film techniques, this filmmaker cannot be accused of making a movie which seeks to conflate filmic narrative with social reality. And he certainly avoids the dominant Hollywood animated aesthetic of hyperrealism, whereby imaginary creatures are presented complete with ‘real’-looking skin, fur and scales. By using techniques more or less abandoned as waste by global entertainment networks, Chomet knowingly situates his own film outside the commercial battles between Disney and Pixar striving for CGI supremacy in animated realism in films in which spectators are being led, paradoxically, to expect both mimesis from animation and the hyperreal creation of images with no link with an original, yet more often than not voiced by, and in many cases resembling, caricatures of recognisable stars. Clearly, <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> is deliberately different. The film disrupts aesthetic expectations and, drawing on images and techniques of past and present, avoids any prevailing sense of nostalgia, or for that matter of cutting-edge simulation technology. Indeed, in its reverence and irreverence for cinematic predecessors and contemporaries and other influences from the visual arts, <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> puts spokes in the wheels of aesthetic and economic cycles rather than oiling them.</p>
<p>Thus Chomet invites questions of the potential of cinema in perpetuating or even challenging such cycles. His artful cinematic recycling in all its exuberant intertextual play exceeds the notion of a ludic postmodern celebration of textuality. And his exploration of the potential of recycling and waste goes beyond images, intertexts and plot devices. It also has an implicitly political challenge often evidenced in apparently ancillary images. In addition to its circular track, Champion’s train set has accessories including an oil drum with ‘Toxaco’ (instead of Texaco) on it, referencing the negative potential of the late-capitalist oil economy. The Triplettes’ admittedly hilarious grenade bombing of frogs parallels the devastation caused by dynamite fishing. And the politics of waste – together with questions of individual responsibility – are, of course, inscribed in the resourceful recycling of domestic appliances.</p> <p>Yet <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> also tentatively performs some of the potential positives of our present-day phase of globalisation. A French, Belgian and Canadian co-production, Chomet’s team of animators worked on-line as a virtual team.</p> <p>So this is an international collaborative creation, drawing on and paying tribute to global inspirations including early Disney, Japanese <italic>anime</italic> by Hiyao Maiyazaki and the studio Ghibli, Hollywood, French cinema, Monty Python, music hall and many, many more. Nonetheless, for all its wealth of intertexts from cinematic and visual culture, for all its witty representations of Madame Souza’s and the Triplettes’ ingenious repurposing of domestic appliances, <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> cannot be described as a celebration of recycling. Moreover the film does not avoid feeding into vicious cycles itself. Certainly, the intertextual reference to Dubout’s obese, controlling bourgeois women in the opening sequence counterproductively recycles misogynist images of women, adding to the representation of Madame Souza and the Triplettes as wittily resourceful when it comes to the use of domestic appliances, but as physically grotesque. What is more, the film ends as it began with Champion glumly glued to the television, but now ageing and solitary and implicitly somewhere – or nowhere – in the ‘North American’ county of Belleville. Clearly not mentally liberated, and without the resourcefulness of his grandmother’s generation, Champion seems to end up where he started – in front of an anaesthetising television screen. Indeed things come full circle, as Champion responds to the now presumably long-dead Madame Souza’s question at the beginning of the film: ‘Il est fini le film?’ with ‘C’est fini le film.’</p>
<p>A downbeat end to a circular film, then, offering a bleak prognosis for the critical potential of cinema amidst the exploitative cycles of the global market? Certainly, in <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> Chomet focuses on what is left out – political and economic immigrants, marginalised Others, cogs in the wheels of global capitalism – and on exposing how French cultural and economic collusion helps to keep them circulating. The film foregrounds the human consequences of a novelty-led entertainment industry, revealing the grim reality concealed by cinematic dreams of ‘bright-lights, big city’ so often evoked by Hollywood (and French) filmmakers. If Disney is brought into question, so are certain iconic images of French visual culture. French thinkers who seek to challenge late capitalist ideology are referenced, but likewise – implicitly – the failure of their work to change the status quo.</p>
<p>However, by contrast with <italic>The Illusionist</italic> (dir. S. Chomet, 2010), Chomet’s subsequent animated feature based on an unmade 1956 Tati script, which features a French music-hall performer eclipsed by the advent of mass-mediatised forms of entertainment, <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> is neither nostalgic nor pessimistic. Indeed while Chomet’s 2003 film cannot stop global cycles from turning, unlike its future anterior intertext, <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> does put some spokes in the wheels of global mechanisms of exploitation and marginalisation (and France’s and the filmmaker’s co-implication in them). The film’s timescale – whereby a 1960s Tour de France seems to co-exist with a present-day city that is at once North American and French – destabilises dominant narratives of globalisation which tend to focus on present and future issues, and instead recalls how they are predicated on earlier cycles of global and economic exploitation. The hegemony of English on the global market is challenged, since there is little dialogue but no problems of comprehension. What is more, in its reverence and irreverence for cinematic predecessors and contemporaries and other influences from the visual arts, <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> performs a way of countering the in-built obsolescence that keeps the wheels of late capitalism turning, and consumers going round in circles. And those final words, ‘C’est fini le film’ (all the more emphatic given the rarity of dialogue), are surely a recycling of that famous Loony Tunes sign-off: ‘That’s all folks!’ Less a statement, then, than a definite articulation of Chomet’s ethics of recycling. Or even a recycling of responsibility directed at the audience: ‘Over to you folks!’? Certainly, Chomet’s film performs the need for the animated show to go on, self-reflexively recycling to bring exploitation and exceptionalism into question. Indeed, <italic>Les Triplettes de Belleville</italic> with its exuberant recycling of filmic and visual culture suggests that cinema may yet have both aesthetic and critical potential.</p>

<p>Originally a farmer from the Aveyron, Bové was spokesperson for the Confédération paysanne, hero of the French anti-American campaign against ‘la malbouffe’, and representative of the movement to resist the effects of globalisation on small national producers and the spread of multinationals in France. In 1995, Bové was founder member of the <italic>altermondialiste</italic> pressure group ATTAC, which, articulating French fears of being subsumed by perceived American cultural and economic imperialism, seeks to oppose global market economics with an ‘other’ vision of a globalised world based on democracy, protection of the environment and human rights. Bové was among five protesters campaigning against US bans on the importation of Roquefort who were incarcerated for obstructing the building of a new McDonald’s in Millau on 12 August 1999.

<p><bold>Ruth Cruickshank</bold> is Senior Lecturer in French in the School of Modern Languages, Literatures and Cultures at Royal Holloway, University of London. A specialist in post-war French fiction, film and thought with particular interests in consumerism and globalisation, she is author of <italic>Fin de millénaire French Fiction: The Aesthetics of Crisis</italic> (2009) and of articles on the cinema of the <italic>Trente Glorieuses</italic>, filmic images of Paris, Claire Denis, Annie Ernaux, Michel Houellebecq, Marie Redonnet and Agnès Varda. Her current work harnesses the untapped critical potential of food, and she is writing a monograph which uses the fiction of the <italic>Trente Glorieuses</italic> as a case study to establish how critical analyses of representations of food offer a multivalent conceptual tool usable across genres, periods and places for the analysis and reassessment of literature and film in their contexts of production.</p>
