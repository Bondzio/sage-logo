<abstract>
<p>School principals experience high levels of stress that hamper their self-efficacy and inhibit their executive control capacities. The main stressors that school principals encounter, their reactions to stress and the influence of controlled breathing on their stress relief were investigated by means of a mixed-methods research approach. With a structured questionnaire, participants’ levels of stress were compared before and after attendance of a workshop based on controlled breathing. Participants’ main stressors, their reaction to stress and the influence of controlled breathing on their stress relief were investigated through individual interviewing. It was found that school principals’ main stressors related to extensive workloads carried out in an environment of resource constraints. The regular practising of controlled breathing resulted in a decrease of the levels of stress experienced with main improvements related to revitalized energy levels, restored clarity of thinking and improved interpersonal relationships. The findings contribute to research on school principals’ main stressors and constructive ways of stress relief within the school environment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Excessive stress influences job satisfaction, productivity, and turnover at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611429249">Dierendonck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909611429249">Kinman and Jones, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611429249">Spangenberg and Orpen-Lyall, 2000</xref>). Stress is also felt in the school environment where it is mainly associated with the pressures caused by the rate of change in society and the magnitude of added responsibilities due to school-based management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611429249">Tucker, 2010</xref>: 70). Within the South African context, with major politically- and socially-motivated transformations in education, school principals are expected to contribute to social reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611429249">Berkhout, 2007</xref>: 405) carried out in environments characterized by increased levels of family disintegration, substance abuse and violent crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021909611429249">Bloch, 2009</xref>: 124; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611429249">Olivier and Venter, 2003</xref>: 186).</p>
<p>For school principals to manage their schools effectively, it is important that they operate without the debilitating effects resulting from excessive stress. School principals do not only need to manage their own stress, but they also have a responsibility to manage the school as a whole in such a way that stress levels are reduced for all staff so as to counteract undesirable influences on learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611429249">Yong and Yue, 2007</xref>: 79).</p>
<p>As a stress alleviation strategy that is economically and readily available, the role of controlled breathing within a holistic approach of life skills development is scientifically recognized with designated organizations focussing on developing individuals’ stress-coping abilities through controlled breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611429249">Nagel and Brown, 2003</xref>: 256; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909611429249">Trampuz et al., 2002</xref>: 57). The Art of Living Foundation is such an organization. Founded in Bangalore, India in 1981, the organization presents workshops to improve individuals’ sense of well-being through stress relief that is based on meditation and controlled breathing so as to restore energy and equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611429249">Balasubramanyam, 2010</xref>: 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611429249">Bhatia, 2002</xref>: 23).</p>
<p>Although many studies have been conducted on stressors and stress alleviation strategies within the teaching profession, few have included the value of controlled breathing on stress relief. In this regard, and to the researchers’ knowledge, no study has been conducted in South Africa on the influence of controlled breathing as a stress alleviator for school principals. The pivotal role that school principals fulfill in day-to-day school effectiveness and the potential stress accompanying such intense involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611429249">Yong and Yue, 2007</xref>: 80) demands a readily-available stress alleviation strategy. The aim of the research was to understand what school principals’ main stressors are, what the reaction of these stressors are on their general well-being, and how stress effect is alleviated through a holistic approach of life skills development which includes controlled breathing. The researchers assume that school principals will always encounter stressors and that controlled breathing as a readily-available coping strategy can alleviate their stressors effectively and can eventually be applied across schools to contribute to the alleviation of stress encountered by all stakeholders, thus contributing to school success.</p>

<title>Self-Efficacy and Stress Encounter</title>
<p>In order to understand school principals’ main stressors, their reaction to stress and the influence of controlled breathing on their stress relief, self-efficacy theory is used as point of departure, as a sense of self-efficacy determines the individual’s reaction to stress and is also affected by stress. As the effect of unrelieved tension caused by an imbalance between the encountered stressors and the resources available for dealing with those stressors, an individual’s experience of stress is subjective and contingent on the specific appraisal of a situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611429249">Brown et al., 2002</xref>: 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611429249">Spangenberg and Orpen-Lyall, 2000</xref>: 6). Such an appraisal is closely related to self-efficacy as a job-specific disposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611429249">Schwarzer and Hallum, 2008</xref>: 153).</p>
<p>Self-efficacy theory as a core aspect of social-cognitive theory determines the extent of initiated actions, expended effort and sustainability with regard to obstacles in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611429249">Bandura, 1997</xref>: 38). Self-efficacy determines how individuals think, feel, and act on stressors. A low sense of self-efficacy results in feelings of anxiety and helplessness and in the harbouring of pessimistic thoughts about accomplishment. A strong sense of self-efficacy facilitates cognitive processes and performance in a variety of settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611429249">Bandura, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611429249">Betoret, 2006</xref>: 523; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611429249">Schwarzer and Hallum, 2008</xref>: 153). Known as executive control, cognitive processes underlie voluntary, but effortful, regulation of perception and motor processes in order to deal adaptively with changing task demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611429249">Van der Linden et al., 2005</xref>: 24). Sustained attention that is needed for qualitative decision-making and response inhibition that ensures healthy work relationships are two major aspects of executive control. Self-efficacy is, however, negatively affected by high levels of stress.</p>
<p>Intense involvement with people in the work situation could cause chronic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611429249">Schwarzer and Hallum, 2008</xref>: 154; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611429249">Yong and Yue, 2007</xref>: 79). As the disposition to determine such chronic occupational stress, burnout is defined as a psychological syndrome of exhaustion, cynicism and inefficacy experienced in response to chronic work stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611429249">Leiter and Maslach, 2004</xref>: 93; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611429249">Maslach and Jackson, 1981</xref>: 1). Of the three dimensions of burnout, the emotional exhaustion component represents the individual’s stress experience of being overextended and depleted of emotional and physical resources, reflected in low levels of energy. The depersonalization component represents the interpersonal context dimension of burnout that refers to a callous, excessively-detached response to various aspects of the work, including interaction with colleagues. As the self-evaluation component, inefficacy as a lack of personal accomplishment represents the third category of burnout and includes feelings of incompetence and reduced achievement and productivity, leading to low morale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611429249">Maslach and Jackson, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611429249">Schwarzer and Hallum, 2008</xref>: 155). With regard to self-efficacy and employee competence, burnout, as work stress, chronically experienced and which manifests as exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy, represents the one pole. At the other pole an energetic, involved and effective state of work engagement represents the ideal work condition for a high sense of self-efficacy.</p>
<p>Apart from the effects of chronic work stress on the psychological (job dissatisfaction), physiological (high blood pressure) and behavioural (absenteeism) dimensions of employee existence, burnout also impacts on the cognitive. This causes impaired executive control in that deficits occur in the ability to sustain logical thinking and to inhibit pre-potent but inappropriate behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611429249">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>: 170; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611429249">Van der Linden et al., 2005</xref>: 24).</p>

<sec id="section3-0021909611429249">
<title>Stressors within the School Context</title>
<p>The demand for change associated with the dynamism of science and technology developments and the impact thereof on organizational calibrating efforts manifests as a major reason for work stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611429249">Armstrong, 2005</xref>: 3). Due to the challenges to survive within a competitive socio-economic environment and because government anticipates them to be instruments for the creation of economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611429249">Berkhout, 2007</xref>: 408), education systems are also prone to change. The increased emphasis on school principals’ management tasks alongside their functional tasks manifests as an answer to the ‘doing better’ discourse of global competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611429249">Kokkinos, 2007</xref>: 230; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611429249">Kruger, 2003</xref>: 246; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611429249">Tucker, 2010</xref>: 71). Major stressors resulting from this situation relate to heavy workloads, conflict with stakeholders, lack of a multiplicity of resources, lack of support from authorities, and time pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909611429249">Bachkirova, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611429249">Brown et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611429249">Tatar and Horenczyk, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611429249">Yong and Yue, 2007</xref>). For South African school principals challenged to contribute to social reconstruction, a major stressor pertains to conflict with the state that is interfering in the authority of school-level governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611429249">Berkhout, 2007</xref>: 405; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021909611429249">Prinsloo, 2006</xref>: 355). The chronic stress caused by such intensive conflict demands effective coping strategies in order to sustain constructive decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021909611429249">Mertzger, 2003</xref>: 656).</p>

<sec id="section4-0021909611429249">
<title>Coping Strategies</title>
<p>Coping resources and coping strategies enhance self-efficacy to cope with stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611429249">Bandura, 1997</xref>: 478; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611429249">Betoret, 2006</xref>: 522). With regard to the school environment, coping resources include physical (classrooms), human (teachers), support service (school psychologists) and didactic resources (learning materials) which enable school principals to arrange for quality teaching and learning events, thus alleviating potential stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611429249">Betoret, 2006</xref>: 524; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611429249">Kruger, 2003</xref>: 250). Considered holistically, stress-coping strategies encapsulate the physical, socio-psychological and mental spheres of human existence. Physically, the stress effect can be alleviated by healthy eating and sleeping habits and regular exercise. Socio-psychologically speaking, self-efficacy to cope with stress is enhanced by family and friends’ support networks, creative hobbies, appreciating nature, and not comparing oneself to others. In terms of mental well-being, prioritizing, compartmentalizing, and considering stressors in perspective, alleviate stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611429249">Cartwright and Whatmore, 2005</xref>: 169; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611429249">Yong and Yue, 2007</xref>: 82).</p>
<p>Serving as a basis for a holistic approach to stress relief, the practising of controlled breathing is inspired by the fact that the mind and body automatically resort to breathing in stressful situations. Breathing responses manifest as if controlled by a sensor to ensure a corresponding rhythm in the breath for every emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021909611429249">Papworth, 2003</xref>:24). The cornerstone for workshops presented by the Art of Living Foundation is a breathing technique known as <italic>Sudarshan Kriya</italic>. Departing from the premise that toxins accumulate in the human system at a cellular level, practising <italic>Sudarshan Kriya</italic> removes stress and toxins through oxygenating and revitalizing bodily cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611429249">Bhatia, 2002</xref>: 23; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909611429249">Trampuz et al., 2002</xref>: 57).</p>
<p>The <italic>Sudarshan Kriya</italic> breathing technique is practised while sitting erect to enable a hindrance-free movement of attention between the brain and the spinal cord, engaging the neck and shoulder muscles to relieve stress-related pressure. The breathing technique comprises four sequential breathing stages with 20 cycles of inhalation and exhalation at each stage, executed slowly and rhythmically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611429249">Balasubramanyam, 2010</xref>: 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611429249">Gangadhar and Janakiramaiah, 2002</xref>: 26). In the first stage, equally long and deep inhalations and exhalations expand the lobes of the lungs to maximize the absorption of oxygenated energy. The second stage involves normal inhalations followed by deep and longer exhalations. In the third stage, deep and longer inhalations are followed by normal exhalations. The fourth stage is a repetition of the first stage with equally long and deep inhalations and exhalations. <italic>Sudarshan Kriya</italic> ends with 20 cycles in which normal breathing is gradually restored to rhythmic inhalations and exhalations. Sufficient proficiency gained through regular application demands that the <italic>Sudarshan Kriya</italic> breathing technique be applied whenever needed, but at least twice daily, morning and evening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611429249">Balasubramanyam, 2010</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>In order to determine school principals’ main stressors, their reaction to stress, and the influence of the <italic>Sudarshan Kriya</italic> breathing technique on the alleviation of their stress, an empirical investigation was conducted. The research is discussed next.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0021909611429249" sec-type="methods">
<title>Research Design and Research Methodology</title>
<p>As the researchers wanted to understand the existence, nature and way of expression of the phenomenon being studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611429249">Henning et al., 2004</xref>: 20), an interpretive paradigm employing a mixed-methods research approach was used. This approach was selected to arrange for increased insight in that the results of the quantitative inquiry were supplemented with the findings of the qualitative investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611429249">Creswell, 2003</xref>: 16). The result was a deeper understanding of stressors experienced by school principals, their reaction to those stressors and the influence of controlled breathing as a stress alleviator.</p>
<sec id="section6-0021909611429249">
<title>Data Collection Instruments</title>
<p>The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) questionnaire as developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611429249">Maslach and Jackson (1981)</xref> determines the intensity of chronic work stress by assessing the three aspects of burnout: namely emotional exhaustion, personal accomplishment and depersonalization. With this study, the MBI questionnaire was used to compare participants’ levels of stress before and after they attended the Art of Living workshop on controlled breathing.</p>
<p>The MBI questionnaire consisted of 22 items ordered into the three categories of burnout, namely emotional exhaustion, personal accomplishment and depersonalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611429249">Maslach and Jackson, 1981</xref>: 14). Statements about personal feelings were evaluated by means of a 7-point Likert-type scale (never = 0; every day = 6). Participant responses were interpreted according to the template of the Maslach Burnout Inventory Manual for assessing category responses as low, moderate or high degrees of burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611429249">Maslach and Jackson, 1981</xref>: 2). According to this template, higher scores in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and lower scores in personal accomplishment reflect burnout.</p>
<p>To understand the participants’ main stressors, their reactions to stress and the way in which controlled breathing alleviated their encountered stress, individual in-depth interviews were conducted six weeks after participants had attended the Art of Living workshop. The reason for the six-week span was that participants needed to internalize the practising of the breathing technique and its influence on stress relief. Questions included in an interview schedule pertained to comprehending participants’ main stressors, their reactions to stress, the coping strategies they employed to alleviate stress, and the influence of controlled breathing on their stress levels. Participants were also questioned about the ease and consistency of their application of the breathing technique.</p>
<p>Qualitative content analysis, based on Tesch’s model, was used to ensure that all the perspectives and issues that arose from the interview data were considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611429249">Poggenpoel, 1998</xref>: 343). Guba’s trustworthiness model was used to establish the validity and reliability of the qualitative research in terms of truth value, applicability, consistency and neutrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611429249">Poggenpoel, 1998</xref>: 348–50). The participants’ anonymity and the confidentiality of their disclosures were ensured at all times during the research.</p>

<sec id="section7-0021909611429249">
<title>Selection of Participants</title>
<p>Based on convenience and purposeful selection, the research sample consisted of six primary school principals selected from a total of 49 primary schools in the Phoenix circuit, KwaZulu-Natal. With a consideration of age, experience and gender, purposeful selection was steered by school principals’ voluntary attendance of the Art of Living workshop offered to people in managerial positions. It was anticipated that voluntary attendance indicated a need for stress relief. Selection took place after enrolment for the workshop, which was three weeks before the start of the workshop. The workshop was conducted by a teacher of the Art of Living Foundation who had been trained in Bangalore, India, by the founder of the Art of Living Foundation, Sri Sri Ravi Shanker. The workshop consisted of five three-hour sessions presented after hours, over five consecutive days. The six participants, five males and one female, were of varying ages and years of experience with the youngest participant 37 and the oldest 59 years of age. Their experiences as school principals varied between six and 17 years. With regard to the sample size, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611429249">Rossman and Rallis (2003</xref>: 138) note that, with phenomenological studies, three to five in-depth interviews with information-rich participants provide intensive coverage of the data. The researchers experienced saturation of information when they realized that nothing new was learned after the sixth interview was conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021909611429249">Greeff, 2005</xref>: 294).</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The presentation of findings includes a discussion of the perceptions of participants regarding their major stressors and the value of controlled breathing for stress relief. This is followed by a comparison of the stress levels of participants interpreted as the degree of burnout experienced before and after attending the stress intervention programme. The comparison serves to confirm the positive influence of controlled breathing on stress relief.</p>
<p>For an understanding of the ways in which controlled breathing alleviated encountered stress, the data from the interviews that emerged as categories from an inductive selection of codes are discussed next. The discussion follows the structure of the interview schedule, namely participants’ main stressors, their reactions to stress, the coping strategies they employed to alleviate stress, and their evaluation of the value of controlled breathing for stress relief. Where discussions are substantiated by verbatim excerpts from the interviews, the six participants are distinguished as principal P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 and P6.</p>
<sec id="section9-0021909611429249">
<title>Main stressors of school principals</title>
<p>The following categories emerged as stressors encountered by participants:</p>
<list id="list1-0021909611429249" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Lack of resources</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Learner discipline</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lack of parent involvement</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Teacher misconduct</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Multiplicity of tasks</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Conflict with stakeholders</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lack of departmental support</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The need for improvising due to a lack of resources across the broad spectrum of source provisioning was encountered as a serious stressor. Teaching and learning material shortages pertained to ‘books, stationery’ (P6); ‘desks, chairs, duplicating machines, library resources, computers, sports equipment’ (P4); and ‘textbooks not suitable to the new curriculum’ (P1). Teaching/learning material constraints were intensified by human resource deficiencies caused by low post provisioning norms resulting in a need to employ extra teachers appointed and funded by the school governing body. Participants determined stress due to human resource inadequacies as relating mainly to catering for specific subjects (‘to cater for computer studies’ (P4)), reducing large class sizes (‘limited staff leads to larger class sizes’ (P2)), and arranging for teacher replacements (‘recruiting staff becomes the direct responsibility of the principal’ (P3)).</p>
<p>School finance inadequacies related to the quintile ranking of schools that impacted on disparity and insufficiency with regard to ‘the monetary allocation from the department to meet the basic expenses’ (P3). Counteracting initiatives in the form of collecting school fees had to be implemented, but because ‘some parents who can afford school fees refuse to pay’ (P1), school funds had to be supplemented by fund-raising efforts to maintain solvency. Constant fund-raising initiatives were, however, time-consuming and ‘interfere[d] with curriculum delivery’ (P4). An additional stressor pertained to the accountability of the school principal to ensure that ‘finance [which] is a big bug-bear is managed with proper checks and balances to prevent fraud’ (P1). Maintenance of school buildings and school premises was exacerbated by the ‘mammoth task of maintaining school buildings that are old’ (P4). Out of control crime rates in the external environment intensified principals’ stress in that ‘the lack of proper school fencing [due to limited finances] leads to increased vandalism and burglaries, causing a snowball reaction of increased maintenance costs’ (P3).</p>
<p>A decline in the standard of discipline due to learner attitudes that related to general disobedience and a lack of work ethics contributed to principals’ stress. Dealing with incidences of ‘cheating, stealing, fighting, vandalism and truancy’ (P1) took up ‘most of [the principals’] valuable time’ (P1). Learners’ general attitude towards their schoolwork impacted negatively on their academic achievement because ‘their late-coming and not doing homework hampers their progress’ which made principals ‘stress even more!’ (P6). Learner discipline problems were compounded by a lack of parent involvement. The fact that the only contact with parents ‘is during enrolment’ (P6) was a challenging situation considering that ‘parents are a formidable partner in the pedagogic triangle’ (P3). Added to the stressor of indifferent parents was the phenomenon of parents who defended the wrong-doings of their children ‘claiming to be ignorant of the school code of conduct despite the distribution of the school rules at the beginning of every year’ (P3).</p>
<p>Teachers’ negative attitudes manifested as a stressor, especially when ‘the same teacher has to be dealt with on many occasions’ (P1). Unconstructive teacher attitudes relating to an unwillingness to take ownership of the classroom situation manifested in ‘teachers [who] send children to the office all the time for the principal to sort out’ (P1). This was worsened by teacher absenteeism in that ‘absenteeism and leave-taking [of staff] is a disaster for learner discipline and learner scholastic performance’ (P2).</p>
<p>With regard to their workloads, participants had consensus that their responsibilities had multiplied in that they ‘have to see to <italic>everything</italic>’ (P2). The result is that the magnitude and complexity of their job description related to being a ‘Jack of all trades and a master of <italic>all</italic>’ (P3), with ‘the hidden job overpowering the stipulated job description’ (P3). Such conditions signified increased stress encounters. Participants’ intense involvement with stakeholders comprised interacting ‘with the department, with unions, with the school governing body (SGB), with the community at large, with parents, with non-government organizations, with teachers, with learners’ (P5). Regarding liaising with the school governing body, participants were in agreement that ‘the principal carries the complete SGB’ because ‘parents have neither the time nor the capacity to carry out the SGB functions’ (P4).</p>
<p>Conflict situations involving learners, teachers, parents, the SGB and the department were cited as a major stressor. Principals agreed that conflict erupted often between learners, teachers and parents and ‘it all comes to the office’ (P2). There was consensus amongst participants that conflict resolution took more of their time ‘than general school improvements and school developments’ (P4). Some teachers’ lack of competencies, together with huge compensating egos, meant that ‘“shirkers” are the root cause of conflict, they instigate others’ (P4). Principals also identified the SGB as a creator of conflict relating mainly to incidences of ‘[the] school governing body’s interferences in professional matters’ which was worsened by the fact that ‘their [SGB] own role functions are not in order’ (P4).</p>
<p>A final stressor related to the lack of direction by the Department of Education in the face of constant changes. This caused uncertainty and conflict amongst teachers and school management teams in that ‘the department’s directives are often confusing [and] constant changes with National Curriculum Statements result in confusion which causes frustration and conflict’ (P4).</p>

<title>School Principals’ Reactions to Stress</title>
<p>In terms of their emotional state, participants identified a sustained inability to distance themselves from their stressors, mainly due to an extensive workload (‘too many issues cloud my mind (P2); I am always thinking about the problems’ (P4); ‘I think about unfinished tasks all the time’ (P6)). This caused anger and incompetence (‘I snap at little things, experience usual tasks as heavy and unmanageable’ (P1)) which developed into a detrimental circle of exhaustion and anxiety. Psychosocially, participants experienced a sense of hopelessness that was linked to their accountability for the total well-being of the school. In the face of stakeholders failing to do the duties they were tasked for, ‘it becomes your [the principal’s] responsibility to get everything completed satisfactorily’ (P5). Participants expressed their desire to withdraw as a result of excessive stress (‘I don’t want to do or hear any talking’ (P1)) whereas the urge to sleep rather than be in the company of others resulted in ‘restlessness at night’ (P2), ‘nightmares’ (P1) and a sensation of ‘yet not relaxed after sleep’ (P3). Physical reactions to stress entailed ‘higher temperatures when under stress’ (P1), ‘muscle tightness’ (P4), ‘stomach cramps’ (P6) and an ‘increase in acidity levels’ (P4). Of the most serious physical symptoms related to work stress were ‘chest pains and high cholesterol’ (P2). Cognitively, ‘a decrease in concentration levels’ (P4) and ‘inability to think logically’ (P5) were determined as stress-related reactions.</p>

<title>School Principals’ Coping Strategies to Alleviate Stress</title>
<p>Prior to participating in the stress intervention programme of controlled breathing, participants developed various coping mechanisms to deal with stress. Some engaged in physical exercises such as soccer, tennis and swimming (P2, P3), others kept to a healthy eating plan (P1, P3), and reading (P3, P6) and prayer and meditation (P1, P2, P6) were also applied as stress relievers. The soothing influence of humour was identified as a further mechanism to alleviate stress (‘I try to find humour in most situations’ (P5)).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0021909611429249">
<title>School Principals’ Evaluation of Controlled Breathing as a Stress Alleviator</title>
<p>Participants had consensus that controlled breathing was beneficial and they were all practising the breathing technique at least twice a day. At a socio-psychological level, the ability to relax and remain calm was a common response. Practising controlled breathing resulted in ‘calming the mind and body’ (P1), which contributed to ‘functioning more effectively’ (P5), ‘accepting people and situations better’ (P5) and ‘focussing on the moment again’ (P3). Linked to cognition and the possibility of creating for oneself an inner atmosphere of serenity through controlled breathing, participants were enabled to ‘talk about problems and fears and cast them away’ (P2), to ‘see situations in perspective’ (P5), to ‘become more objective’ (P1) and to ‘apply logic in a much calmer mental state’ (P5). Participants agreed that applying controlled breathing readily calmed and energized them: ‘If stress is getting to me during the day, I take a small break and do my breathing exercises which calms me down immediately and gives me renewed energy’ (P2).</p>
<p>With regard to the socio-physical aspect, participants acknowledged a perceived connection between controlled breathing and improved sleeping. Some identified specific improvements that related to ‘the sleeping disorder of apnoea’ (P3) and ‘no disturbing in the middle of the night’ (P2). Improved sleeping effected restored energy levels which enhanced participants’ alertness (‘I feel more energized and alert’ (P3)), their enthusiasm (‘I feel more vibrant’ (P4)) and their ability to work for longer periods of time (‘controlled breathing energizes me throughout the day’ (P6)). Linked to higher energy levels was the ability to stay positive (‘being positive and cultivating ideal human values’ (P4)) and have good human relationships (‘seeing the good and positive in everyone and in every situation’ (P3)). Controlled breathing also restored feelings of control (‘avoid being on an emotional roller coaster’ (P5)) and to think rationally (‘accept the conditions which cannot be changed’ (P3)). Considered holistically, practising controlled breathing regularly for stress relief (‘I start and end every day with my breathing exercises’ (P2)) resulted in the fostering of a wholesome discipline of constructive routines. These routines included physical exercise (‘I try to swim once a week’ (P3)), healthy eating habits (‘I focus on eating more fruit and vegetables’ (P4)), serene introspection (‘I sit quietly, reflect on all that has happened, feel satisfied that I tried my best’ (P6)) and being alert to the aesthetic (‘I hear the birds singing’ (P2)).</p>
<p>The fact that controlled breathing alleviated participants encountered stress was confirmed by the results from the Maslach Burnout Inventory questionnaire. These results are discussed next.</p>

<p>It is clear from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021909611429249">Table 1</xref> that, with each item included in the MBI questionnaire, the level of burnout (chronic work stress) decreased after attendance of the stress intervention programme. This is evident in the decreased scores for emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and the increased scores for personal accomplishment after practising controlled breathing. A comparison of the separate categories shows that the personal accomplishment category represents the highest dividends of stress alleviation followed by the category of emotional exhaustion and the category of depersonalization. As the best improvement, the mean for personal accomplishment increased with 1.56 (from 5.00 to 6.56). Means for emotional exhaustion and depersonalization decreased with 1.49 (from 3.53 to 2.04) and 0.98 (from 2.72 to 1.74) respectively. It is clear that controlled breathing influenced feelings of accomplishment particularly positively, thus restoring self-efficacy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As a result of the pivotal role that school principals fulfill in managing inevitable change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611429249">Berkhout, 2007</xref>), their intense involvement with stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611429249">Yong and Yue, 2007</xref>), and their taking accountability for all on-site decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611429249">Kokkinos, 2007</xref>), participants experienced high levels of work stress. This was evident in higher scores for the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization categories of burnout and lower scores for personal accomplishment before attending the stress alleviation workshop based on controlled breathing. In agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021909611429249">Prinsloo (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611429249">Tucker (2010)</xref>, participants’ main stressors related to inefficient resources across the broad spectrum of resource provisioning and the challenges of a multiplied job description carried out within the constraints of a lack of governmental support. Stress effect manifested in a decrease in the levels of self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611429249">Bandura, 1997</xref>) which affected participants’ physical and emotional well-being, and their executive control capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611429249">Van der Linden et al., 2005</xref>). They suffered from an inability to distance themselves from their work, which affected their ability to think logically. Sustained anxiety caused incidences of inappropriate response that triggered outbursts and the urge to be left alone. Considering the intensive involvement in school affairs required from school principals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611429249">Yong and Yue, 2007</xref>), these responses constituted unconstructive behaviour.</p>
<p>As a holistic approach to alleviating stress in all spheres of human existence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611429249">Betoret, 2006</xref>), the practising of controlled breathing according to the <italic>Sudarshan Kriya</italic> breathing technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611429249">Balasubramanyam, 2010</xref>) served as a constructive strategy for stress relief. This was confirmed by a comparison of the scores for the MBI questionnaire completed before and after participants attended the workshop on controlled breathing. The alleviation of stress was reflected in scores that decreased for each item in the category of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and scores that increased for each item in the category of personal accomplishment. The influence of controlled breathing was especially notable with regard to improvements in the category of personal accomplishment.</p>
<p>Feelings of restored accomplishment were accompanied by a renewed emphasis on healthy eating habits, physical exercise and appreciation of nature. The increase in personal accomplishment scores represented restored self-efficacy levels which, in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611429249">Schwarzer and Hallum (2008)</xref>, enabled participants to prioritize tasks again, compartmentalize problems and relate responsively to stakeholders. Participants’ executive control capacities were reinstated and they were able to calmly and accommodatingly sustain logical thinking in their decision-making responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611429249">Van der Linden et al., 2005</xref>). As a readily-available coping mechanism practised consistently at least twice a day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611429249">Balasubramanyam, 2010</xref>), controlled breathing re-empowered self-efficacious school principals to improve their own levels of excellence and those of their schools. This was made possible through a reinstated clear cognition and attentiveness to the positive aspects residing in every person and every situation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The aim of the research on which this article is based was to investigate school principals’ main stressors, their reaction to stress, and the alleviation of their stress through a holistic approach of life skills development that includes controlled breathing. It can be concluded that controlled breathing is an effective mechanism for stress relief. Participating principals experienced high levels of burnout due to stressors that were related to the magnitude and multiplicity of their job description within a school-based management dispensation of close involvement with all stakeholders and all initiatives. Their stress was exacerbated by resource constraints across the broad spectrum of resource provisioning. Participants’ high levels of chronic work stress, interpreted as burnout, inhibited their self-efficacy in terms of accomplishment and impaired their executive control capacities to sustain logical thinking and inappropriate behaviour inhibition. The practising of controlled breathing improved participants’ health and restored their executive control capacities. This had a ripple influence on improved school functioning in that decision-making and stakeholder relationships were positively influenced.</p>
<p>Due to the mainly qualitative nature of the study, findings cannot be generalized. Trends can, however, be noted in terms of what school principals’ main stressors are and the utilizing of breathing as a mechanism for stress relief and for restoring personal well-being and productivity at work. In that regard, and against the backdrop of the ‘doing better’ discourse of global competitiveness, a study on the influence of controlled breathing as stress alleviator could be extended to include teachers and learners. Positive findings could realize in a concerted fostering of self-efficacy through the practising of controlled breathing as an instinctive, readily-available and economic technique for stress relief. This could contribute to the improved well-being of all stakeholders and to increased school effectiveness.</p>
