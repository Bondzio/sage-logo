<p><italic>Objectives</italic>. Classically, presence of fever ≥38.0°C is used to distinguish pyelonephritis from cystitis. We analyzed whether this is an appropriate marker to initiate further workup and whether temperature is correlated with urological abnormalities and further surgical or pharmacological intervention. <italic>Methods</italic>. Children who presented for their first workup of urinary tract infection between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2009 were retrospectively selected from our institution. Demographics and clinical details were correlated with the diagnosis of urological abnormalities and requirement for intervention. <italic>Results</italic>. Age was the most important variable to predict urological abnormalities. The temperature value of 38.3°C maximized the balance between sensitivity (90%) and specificity (46%) for predicting the need to intervene and the presence of anatomical urological abnormalities. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. Young age (≤2 years) and temperature are the best factors to predict further intervention and urological abnormalities, with a temperature value of 38.3°C being a better predictive value than the currently used 38.0°C.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) result in more than 6 million office visits per year in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813485284">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813485284">2</xref></sup> Traditionally, UTIs may be differentiated into lower-tract (bladder and urethra) and/or upper-tract infections (kidneys, renal pelvis, and ureter). This clinical distinction is important because upper-tract infections are associated with urological abnormalities, require longer therapy, and can evolve into renal scarring and loss of function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813485284">3</xref></sup> Differentiating these 2 clinical entities by exam alone can be difficult in pediatric patients. Because of this, fever has long been considered a marker of upper-tract involvement and a marker of pyelonephritis, with a minimum cutoff value of 38°C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813485284">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813485284"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813485284"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813485284">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The presence of fever is known to increase the probability of renal involvement, but there is no clear understanding of this association.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813485284">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813485284"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813485284">10</xref></sup> The value of fever as a good marker of pyelonephritis has been questioned,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813485284">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813485284"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813485284"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813485284">14</xref></sup> and there is little data to support 38°C as a cutoff value to predict patient outcome. Therefore, we sought to analyze outcomes after UTI in pediatric patients based on initial presenting temperature. Our goal is to clearly define whether temperature can help differentiate lower UTI from pyelonephritis and which presenting factors are associated with the diagnosis of an anatomical urological abnormality (AUA) and the need for surgical or medical intervention.</p>

<title>Patient Selection</title>
<p>We performed a retrospective review of all patients up to 20 years of age who presented to our institution with a first UTI between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2009, and subsequently had further urological imaging or follow-up with a urologist or nephrologist. Patients were selected using billing codes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922813485284">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The exclusion criteria included incomplete records, loss of follow-up, previous diagnosis of urological abnormality, complex urological conditions (ie, bladder extrophy), and a prior history of UTI. In the event that a patient was diagnosed with multiple urological abnormalities, whichever one was considered more severe by the caregiver was used for analysis. In the event that a patient was diagnosed with multiple urological abnormalities, whichever one lead to intervention or was considered more severe by the caregiver was used for analysis.</p>
<p>Fever was defined as temperature &gt;38°C, with maximum rectal or adjusted tympanic temperatures recorded, as well as physician-reported fever if no numerical value was recorded. Clinical symptoms at presentation were stratified into nonspecific symptoms, lower–urinary tract symptoms (dysuria, frequency, or suprapubic pain), upper-tract symptoms (flank pain, back pain, rigors, or nausea/vomiting), or both. Urine culture results were considered negative at &lt;10000 colony-forming units (CFUs), suggestive if 10 000 to 100 000 CFUs, and positive if &gt;100 000 CFUs. Transurethral catheterization was considered positive for growth &gt;50 000 CFUs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813485284">5</xref></sup>) If detailed information was not available, the physician interpretation was used. Workup with imaging of the urinary tract was recorded for voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), renal ultrasound, and 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy. Further diagnosis and treatment as indicated by clinic notes were recorded when available.</p>
<p>Patient outcome was assessed for final urological diagnosis and intervention. The patients were categorized as having a functional diagnosis (dysfunctional voiding and behavioral or hygiene issues) or an AUA (vesicoureteral reflux [VUR], obstructive processes, and pathological phimosis). With regard to intervention, the patients were classified as those requiring surgical or pharmacological intervention (SPI; requiring drugs, other than antibiotic therapy) and those requiring behavioral treatment (improved hygiene and regular timed voiding schedules) or no intervention at all.</p>

<title>Data and Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data were captured through the REDCAP online instrument.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813485284">15</xref></sup> Patient demographics and clinical data were analyzed to identify factors associated with the 2 established outcomes: diagnosis of an AUA or the necessity of active SPI using SAS version 9.2 and SPSS version 18.0. To examine for the existence of the association between the proposed outcomes with demographics and clinical data related to the patient’s first workup, each outcome was correlated with the variables of interest, using absolute and relative frequency data. The χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to verify the association, and when the sample was insufficient to allow the χ<sup>2</sup> test, Fisher’s exact test (for 2 × 2 tables) or the likelihood ratio test (for greater than 2 variables) were used. After bivariate analysis, variables that presented statistical significance below 0.2 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .2) were used to perform multiple logistic regression analysis to assess for any relationship with the 2 outcomes of interest. The maximum temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>) values during the visit were compared between the types of intervention or diagnosis using the Student’s <italic>t</italic> test or ANOVA for more than 2 categories followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created to determine numerical temperature as a function of the binary outcomes. Tests were performed with 5% value as a statistical threshold.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In all, 2708 patients were identified using the diagnosis code. The following patients were excluded: 1377 had a prior history of UTI; 702 had incomplete records; 271 were lost to follow-up; and 38 had previous diagnoses of urological conditions (VUR or urinary tract obstruction) or complex urological conditions (2 patients with bladder exstrophy, 1 patient with thin basement membrane disease, and 1 patient with solitary kidney and urostomy) that contributed to the UTI. Also, 4 patients were diagnosed with multiple urological abnormalities.</p>
<p>A total of 320 patients met inclusion criteria, and their demographics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922813485284">Table 1</xref>. The male to female ratio was 1:4 (22.3% and 77.7%) and mean patient age was 5 years. Of these patients, 231 (72%) were diagnosed with a fever by a direct temperature measurement, and 89 (28%) were diagnosed by a physician’s subjective determination. Also, 83.4% of patients presented directly to our institution for evaluation, whereas 16.6% were referred from an outside facility. Urine culture reports were available in 89.4% of patients and the specimen source in 83.1%. The standard of care in our institution is to obtain a urine culture in all patients who are suspected of having a UTI. Patients seen for the first time at our institution had a proportionally lower number of missing collected specimens (3.9%) than referred patients (17.3%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>In all, 22.2% of the patients were diagnosed with VUR, 4.4% had an obstructive process (ie, meatal stenosis, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and others), and 2.8% had pathological phimosis. Two patients were diagnosed with neurological conditions and one with kidney stones. It was found that 137 patients (43%) underwent SPI intervention. The number of patients who underwent SPI was higher than the number with AUAs because some of those with voiding dysfunction and recurrent UTIs but without an anatomical cause were treated with antibiotics.</p>
<p>The frequency of the AUA diagnosis and SPI with respect to patient demographics and clinical findings are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922813485284">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922813485284">3</xref>, respectively. In bivariate analysis, the diagnosis of AUA was associated with male gender, young age, referred patients, absence of sexual activity, absence of UTI symptoms, and fever. Patients presenting with upper- or lower-urinary tract symptoms had approximately the same proportion of AUA diagnosis—around 23%. The multivariate analysis of variables related to diagnosis demonstrated that when not considering whether the patient was referred, age is the only variable correlated with AUA. Patients between 0 and 2 years of age were 3 times more likely to have an AUA diagnosed on first urinary tract workup when compared with older patients (odds ratio [OR] = 3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.62-5.57). Similarly, patients between 2 and 5 years had 2.25 times greater odds of being diagnosed with an AUA than the oldest group (OR = 2.25; 95% CI = 1.13-4.89).</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922813485284">Table 3</xref>, we display the clinical characteristics of patients who underwent any active management and patients who were followed conservatively. Male patients, patients who were not sexually active, febrile patients, and referred patients were associated with receiving SPI. The multivariate analysis of those variables demonstrated that febrile patients had a nearly 2-fold higher odds (OR = 1.84; 95% CI = 1.06-3.19) of undergoing any intervention than afebrile patients, and if the patient was referred to our institution, the odds of intervention were 7.42-fold higher (OR = 7.42; 95% CI = 4.13-13.34; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) than for patients initially diagnosed here. When excluding referral as a variable, only the absence of sexual activity significantly correlated with the likelihood of intervention, with a 6.59-fold increase in the odds (OR = 6.59; 95% CI = 1.93-22.42; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .003) when compared with sexually active patients with first UTI.</p>
<p>We analyzed the absolute values of temperature, excluding patients without a numerical temperature report. Mean temperatures for different outcomes are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0009922813485284">Table 4</xref>. Patients diagnosed with AUA had a mean <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> of 39.12°C (range = 36.2-40.56), compared with 38.34°C (range = 35.5-41.67; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) for other patients. The receiver operating characteristic curve analyzing temperature gradation as a predictor of AUA had an area under the curve of 0.66 (<italic>P</italic> = .002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922813485284">Figure 1</xref>). This curve was based on all patients in our study who had an identified AUA. The cutoff of 38°C had a sensitivity of 91.9% and specificity of 34.3% for the diagnosis of AUA. We identified a change in the slope of the curve corresponding to a temperature of 38.3°C, with 90% sensitivity and 46% specificity. Below this inflection point, specificity increases but sensitivity plunges disproportionately. The same trend was found when analyzing management by temperature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0009922813485284">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922813485284">Figure 2</xref>), with an average <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> of 39.12°C (range 35.8°C-41.67°C), whereas patients with conservative management outcomes, such as behavioral recommendations or observation, presented with a mean temperature of 38.34°C (range 35.5°C-41.67°C; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). A similar inflection point in the slope of the SPI curve was noted for 38.3°C, which had an 82.3% sensitivity and 47% specificity, with an area under the curve of 0.64 (<italic>P</italic> = .002). This curve was based on all patients in our study who required intervention.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we observed that young patients (&lt;5 years old) were approximately twice as likely to be diagnosed with an AUA than older patients, with age being the significant predictor of anatomical abnormalities in the evaluation of a first UTI. Both male gender and referral to our institution were also related to AUA and the need for SPI. The association with referral is likely related to our position as a tertiary care institution because patients are more likely to be sent to our institution if their primary provider has a high suspicion for urological abnormality. The association with gender is similar to that found in prior studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813485284">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813485284">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813485284"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813485284">18</xref></sup> Although a negative history for sexual activity and absence of specific UTI symptomatology were also related to the diagnosis of AUA, these variables corresponded to the age of the patient and were not independent predictors.</p>
<p>Within our patient population, fever (defined as a temperature of 38°C or above) was independently associated with diagnosis of an AUA in patients with UTI and with the eventual need for SPI. The average <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> of patients with a diagnosis of AUA and/or receiving SPI was 0.7°C higher than that in patients without any diagnosis or active intervention. We observed that 38.3°C as a cutoff value has the best balance of sensitivity and specificity. The generally accepted value of 38°C to define fever was shown to have a sensitivity of 91.9% for diagnosis of AUA and 86.1% for requiring SPI; however, both these groups had very low specificities (34.3% and 30.9%, respectively), limiting its clinical usefulness. When comparing the temperature cutoff value of 38.3°C to the more traditionally accepted 38.0°C, a clinician can gain 11.7% specificity for a loss of 1.9% sensitivity. When examining the chance for SPI, 38.3°C has a gain of 16.1% specificity for a loss of 3.8% sensitivity when compared with 38.0°C.</p>
<p>These findings may provide a clinician with an objective measurement to aid in the decision to pursue further workup for a child presenting with his or her first UTI. Our data can help a clinician in the difficult decision to subject a young child to invasive imaging, such as VCUG or cystoscopy, by providing objective metrics to determine patients at risk of AUA. Furthermore, it can aid the clinician in treatment decisions and parental consultation by helping predict outcomes (need for SPI or not) based on objective measurements. Consequently, more specific workup could be tailored based on patients’ characteristics to avoid unnecessary tests and costs.</p>
<p>Despite extensive literature on UTIs, there are few studies correlating clinical findings with outcome, and the existing data are controversial. As an example, the 2011 American Academy of Pediatric Clinical Practice Guideline for Diagnosis and Management of UTI in Febrile Infants and Children 2-24 Months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813485284">19</xref></sup> reviewed relevant literature for the past 10 years. That publication continued to use 38°C as its definition for febrile illness, listing it as the generally accepted value for fever as the reason. Only 1 of its reviewed papers discussed any other temperature values. Gorelick and Shaw<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813485284">20</xref></sup> and Shaw et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813485284">21</xref></sup> used 39.0°C as a factor to help diagnose UTI in children with a fever of unknown origin, but they did not correlate temperature with AUAs or outcomes. There is not much literature examining methods to help determine which children were at increased risk of having an AUA in those guidelines. This lack of published data illustrates the need to examine useful clinical variables to help a wide range of physicians (not just specialists) to identify which children are at higher risk for having an AUA or will require SPI.</p>
<p>Our analysis shows that temperature greater than 38°C during UTI has good sensitivity to predict urological abnormalities and the eventual need for further intervention, supporting long-standing clinical practices. Our conclusions are similar to those of prior studies that correlated febrile UTI with DMSA scintigraphy or 99m-Tc glucoheptonate findings, which found sensitivities for diagnosing upper-tract involvement ranging from 53% to 84% and specificities from 44% to 92% at 38°C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813485284">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813485284">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813485284">22</xref></sup> Elevated temperature was also predictive of the need for further treatment in our population. Fever was the only clinical variable analyzed that was related to medical or surgical interventions among all patients. The cutoff value of 38°C and clinical evaluation of fever raised the probability of intervention by 84%. It is interesting to note that differentiation of symptoms into those of upper or lower tract was not a good predictor of AUA or SPI.</p>
<p>We recognize that our study has several limitations. First, there was the large number of patients lost to follow-up in our study. However, we believe that these patients would be less likely to have clinically significant AUA or require SPI because they would have returned with further symptoms. Second, there is a limitation inherent in collecting data at a tertiary care center because included patients were more likely to have significant illness or to have been referred by a primary care center as a result of high concern for their symptoms. We have attempted to minimize these effects with our choice to include only patients presenting with their first UTI and excluding those previous diagnoses of urological conditions that contribute to UTI. Third, another limitation is our use of imaging or physician interpretation to define outcome in our patients. Although DMSA scintigraphy, VCUG, and other imaging modalities are the current gold standard to diagnose pyelonephritis, VUR, and other AUA, the role of these imaging modalities in clinical management is still debated, and long-term outcomes have not been well established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813485284">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922813485284">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813485284">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922813485284">25</xref></sup> We chose not to include further analysis of VUR by grade because the clinical implications and treatment practices for VUR are varied and controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813485284">9</xref></sup> Fourth, we are unable to perform subgroup analysis as a result of the small sample size. Consequently, the correlation with a specific diagnosis such as VUR or obstructive uropathy could not be separately defined in this study. In addition, because of the small sample size, we could not correlate specific age range with temperature. Fifth, different radiological methods were used to diagnose AUA, and the lack of uniformity in modality and radiologist introduces added variability to our study. This may also have the effect of underestimating the number of patients with AUAs; however, different AUAs require different studies to best diagnose them, so we were unable to standardize the imaging modality across our study population. Sixth, some debate exists as to whether the natural variance in thermometers will allow for such small differences in measurement to be significant. Although this is a valid concern, modern thermometers in medical use have errors as small as 0.1°C, and we believe that they can still provide useful information and that any temperature above 38.0°C is a significant finding. Seventh, there is a possibility for selection bias, with younger children with higher temperatures being studied more often. Indeed, our study found age of presentation to be a significant factor, but this potential bias still exists. Eighth, there is an inherent variability in how various clinicians diagnose and treat UTIs, which was not controllable in this retrospective review. Finally, all retrospective reviews involve inherent sampling and observer bias.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study, we identified some objective factors that can help identify which children who presented with a first-time UTI are more likely to have an anatomical urological anomaly and require surgical or pharmaceutical intervention. Age and temperature greater than 38.3°C are good predictors of our outcomes. The ability to predict which patients are at risk will help tailor workup in order to avoid unnecessary tests and cost. Larger studies will help further define these associations and provide more accurate predictors of these outcomes.</p>
