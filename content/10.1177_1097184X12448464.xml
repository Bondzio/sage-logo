<abstract>
<p>Prisons are social communities where people commonly conform to normative institutional and cultural values and ideologies. Conforming as a man in prison may involve performing or projecting prison masculinities to ensure emotional, psychological, and social survival, employing strategies to mask self-perceived weaknesses or vulnerability and to attain status and legitimacy. While few men are likely to subscribe to archetypal masculine roles or stereotypes, ethnographic research with adult male prisoners revealed that individuals endeavored to fit in and become socially accepted into the prison community, commonly aligning themselves with normative values, attitudes, and behaviors of prison life, and striving for social legitimacy. “Front management” strategies were employed by individuals to convey “masculine” personas consistent with the prison code, a system of values based on aggression, violence, control, and exploitation—or “dog eat dog” and “divide and rule”—where individuals would become situated within the hegemonic social hierarchy. Participants equated emotional, psychological, and social survival with health and well-being, which was in turn dependent in part on their social status and legitimacy. Paradoxically, this disempowering and divisive hegemony could lay vulnerable individuals open to exploitation and harm, while also undermining prisoners' personal efforts to improve themselves, physically, emotionally, intellectually, and vocationally. Prisoners' efforts to fit into an excessively performance-orientated masculine culture are therefore likely to work against criminal justice goals to reintegrate offenders back into society.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prison social environments tend to represent or reflect the cultural and normative character of their host societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1097184X12448464">Cohen and Taylor 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1097184X12448464">Ditchfield 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1097184X12448464">Hughes and Huby 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1097184X12448464">Irwin 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1097184X12448464">Irwin and Cressey 1962</xref>). However, they can be very different from free communities, given their regimented regimes and compulsory single sex membership. Human social environments essentially constitute social relationships and cultural milieus where defined groups of people function and interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1097184X12448464">Barnett and Casper 2001</xref>). Power relations are an important dimension and, within institutional contexts, can, over time, manifest as relationships of dependency, interdependency, and hegemonic differentiation. Imprisonment in a state-sponsored institution ordinarily means learning to live alongside other people under what can be tense, testing, and sometimes brutal conditions, where individuals can lose their autonomy, independence, responsibilities, and dignity, and take on a new prison identity. Entering prison means having to join a compulsory social community that is commonly hierarchical and likely to be underpinned by core institutional and group values linked to gender, class, ethnicity, and age, sometimes referred to as a normative prison code. Under such conditions, individuals can feel compelled to conform through performing roles and adapting socially to fit in with others. In the male prison context, this may mean actively reconfiguring one’s public persona and learning to integrate socially with what can be perceived as an excessively performance-orientated masculine culture.</p>
<p>This article reports on findings of an ethnography that revealed how male prisoners and prison staff identified with a normative prison code. This provided a social “benchmark” against which behavior was informally monitored by self and others via self-subjectification and through objectification of and by others (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1097184X12448464">Foucault 1978</xref>). The ensuing narrative endeavors to represent the diversity of viewpoints across prisoners and prison officers involved in the research, illustrating men’s strategies of compliance and resistance to what may be perceived as traditional normative masculine behavioral norms. The research was undertaken between 1999 and 2004, involving adult male prisoners and male prison officers in an English category-C training prison. An ethnographic approach was used to seek to make sense of issues of social and psychological survival, and of the role of masculinity within the prison setting in terms of its relationship with health and well-being. It emerged that men involved in the study deployed a range of “fronts,” often presenting themselves in ways they deemed acceptable to others as well as to themselves.</p>

<title>Prison Masculinities</title>
<p>Many public institutions are ideologically and historically underpinned by patriarchal, heterosexual, hegemonic masculine values, which perpetuate a normative gender system that is essentialist and dualistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1097184X12448464">Connell 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1097184X12448464">Sumner 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1097184X12448464">Messerschmidt 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1097184X12448464">Collier 1997</xref>). Gender differentiation between males and females is socialized and becomes progressively culturally embedded such that individuals learn to conform to established gender norms, rituals, roles, and responsibilities. These are reinforced through efforts by boys and girls, and later as men and women, to be recognized for their gender, which confers particular legitimacy, identity, and status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1097184X12448464">Collier 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1097184X12448464">Connell (1987)</xref> argued that males may earn legitimacy and status via a normative masculine hegemonic order, where, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1097184X12448464">Messerschmidt (1993)</xref> further argued, masculinities are indicative of identity and social status, and correspondingly produced, performed, and reproduced depending upon the social context. Masculinities and femininities therefore reflect conventional, historized hegemonic values. Moreover, in aspiring for social status and legitimacy, individuals strive to regulate their own and others' conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1097184X12448464">Messerschmidt 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1097184X12448464">Foucault 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>Prisons are essentially microcosms of wider society where individuals perform their gender within the “rules” of the social group. In this sense, gender is therefore a key factor in explaining prison social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1097184X12448464">Sim 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1097184X12448464">Sabo, Kupers, and London (2001)</xref> described prison life for men in terms of intermale dominance and subordination, where relationships are constructed around the performance and reproduction of multiple masculinities that reflect the expectations, norms, and peer relations within prison communities. The issue of conformity is explored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1097184X12448464">Jewkes (2002)</xref> in relation to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1097184X12448464">Goffman’s (1959)</xref> thesis on the presentation of self. Prisoners will, to differing degrees and in different ways, use “front management” tactics to protect themselves from potential exploitation by others. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1097184X12448464">Goffman (1959</xref>, 23) proposed that individuals would present their “front-stage selves” and conceal their “backstage selves” in social situations. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1097184X12448464">Jewkes (2002</xref>, 211) has argued that male prisoners will endeavor to mask their private, preprison sense of self, and present a public persona of “bodily, gestural and verbal codes,” demanded by the overtly masculine prison environment. Front management—or self-presentation—is therefore a survival strategy for prisoners, with a “masculine” front providing legitimate social attire for coping with prison social life.</p>
<p>A considerable volume of sociological research has emphasized that customs, codes, and social norms within prison settings tend to reinforce normative, dominant values strongly relating to male gender power, identity, and morality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1097184X12448464">Clemmer 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1097184X12448464">Sykes 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1097184X12448464">Goffman 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1097184X12448464">Morris and Morris 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1097184X12448464">King and Elliott 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1097184X12448464">Cohen and Taylor 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1097184X12448464">Fitzgerald and Sim 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1097184X12448464">Mathiesen 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1097184X12448464">Newton 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1097184X12448464">Sim 1994</xref>). “Prison code” is still commonly recognized as a normative value system, where individuals learn to conform to survive or, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1097184X12448464">Toch (1998)</xref> has suggested, conceal their vulnerabilities and avoid exploitation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1097184X12448464">Cohen and Taylor (1981)</xref> first described the code as a value system denoting conformity, loyalty, and toughness, where prisoners learn to identify with the social group but become progressively controlled and dependent, effectively repressing their individuality: “There is one set of characters and one stage… There is little role segregation, little opportunity for the presentation of different selves in different contexts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1097184X12448464">Cohen and Taylor 1981</xref>, 86). More recent studies have described a “pecking order” or “con culture” in male and female prisons, often featuring violent or exploitative individuals toward the top of the social hierarchy, while the majority will actively distance or distinguish themselves from those considered to be at the bottom of the hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1097184X12448464">Wooden and Parker 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1097184X12448464">Sim 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1097184X12448464">Sabo, Kupers, and London 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1097184X12448464">Sabo, Kupers, and London (2001</xref>, 5–10) recognized this hierarchy to be based on core values of patriarchy and heterosexuality, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1097184X12448464">Wooden and Parker (1982)</xref> suggested this manifestation through prisoners' efforts to conceal their emotions and adopt overtly stereotypical masculine attitudes and behaviors; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1097184X12448464">Messerschmidt (1993)</xref> identified aggression, competitiveness, violence, and controlling behaviors as typical, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1097184X12448464">Sim (1994</xref>, 102) identified violence as the central catalyst that sustains the social order by placing prisoners in fear of one another. Victims become situated toward the bottom of the social hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1097184X12448464">Ireland 2000</xref>) and may struggle to raise their status relative to others, acquiring a reputation as vulnerable, which attracts further victimization (Edgar and O’Donnell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1097184X12448464">1998</xref>). Violence, victimization, and bullying are therefore routine and representative of an institutionalized, symbolic, and ritualistic prison life. Prison authorities can, moreover, reinforce a hegemonic social system through measures to control behavior and instil order and discipline. In this regard, prisons may not recognize their culpability in reinforcing exploitation and social inequality.</p>
<p>Several studies have made links between imprisonment and health, albeit indirectly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1097184X12448464">Sykes (1958</xref>, xv) concluded that imprisonment operated as a pathological process, whereby prisoners (referring to men) underwent “figurative castration” through repression and deprivation. This was referred to by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1097184X12448464">Miller (2000</xref>, 4) as “a castrating and infantilising process” with individuals (men) undergoing “psychological disintegration” of their manhood through loss of masculine role and status. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1097184X12448464">Newton (1994</xref>, 198) argued that a man’s masculine identity is “besieged” in prison through sexual deprivation, loss of autonomy and independence, submission to authority and lack of access to material goods/possessions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1097184X12448464">Jewkes (2002</xref>, 221) has suggested that loss of autonomy, choice, and personal responsibility can erode a male prisoner’s sense of manhood, which may be central to his sense of identity. She argued that this may bring health consequences, where individuals endeavor to either conform to or to reject the values of the prison community.</p>
<p>A key focus for this research was to try to make sense of social relations among prisoners and prison staff, and to explore whether or how prison masculinities were produced, performed, and reproduced, and if indeed they had a bearing on health. “Front management” emerged as a key theme, perceived as necessary for survival and viewed as a logical consequence of living under the tense and testing conditions of a compulsory male community. As one prisoner explained, “… as soon as that door’s open, everyone puts a front up. It’s like trying to be something you’re not.” My central argument is that these findings have important implications for health and well-being, since prison environments can facilitate pathological attitudes and behaviors—or <italic>unhealthy prison masculinities</italic>—that operate contrary to public health and criminal justice objectives to improve health and rehabilitate offenders. This negative impact of prison is reinforced by an authoritarian and paternalistic system of criminal justice that contains, controls, normalizes, and disciplines offenders. Moreover, such effects probably apply as much to women as to men, implying that gender performances, roles, and ideologies are not exclusive to one or other sex.</p>

<sec id="section3-1097184X12448464">
<title>Research Methodology</title>
<p>Epistemologically, masculinity and health are ambiguous concepts and therefore preliminary discussions with prisoners revealed different views of what it meant to them to be a man, a prisoner, or to be healthy or unhealthy while in prison. What became very evident during the course of the research was that individuals had a range of different responses and exhibited varied attitudes, opinions, beliefs, and behaviors relating to their experiences of prison; in this regard, the research elicited multiple accounts and perspectives on imprisonment.</p>
<p>Research ethics approval was granted by the University of Bristol and Her Majesty’s (HM) Prison Service, along with permission from the governor of the prison. The research was conducted on a single wing of an English category-C adult male training prison. As the researcher, I was granted access to prisoners and staff on an enhanced wing where prisoners were considered to be at low security risk, which therefore gave me more freedom to move around the wing. This meant I was able to come and go on a daily basis for a period of around six months, during which time I spent many hours on the wing but also used the opportunity to visit other wings and departments, talk with a range of staff, and become familiar with the institution and its processes. Key elements of familiarization and orientation included making sense of the system, understanding the language, and becoming accepted and known to people. Having earned enhanced status, it also seemed logical to conclude that the prisoners I would be engaging with would have reasonable experience and knowledge of the prison system and regime.</p>
<p>The research took a reflexive, “subtle realist,” ethnographic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1097184X12448464">Hammersley 1992</xref>), which involved becoming progressively immersed in the prison community with the aim of eliciting prisoners' accounts of their experiences of the prison social world. Thirty-five prisoners and four prison officers were selected purposively, through establishing trust and rapport with people on the enhanced wing over an extended period of time, usually whole days including weekends when it was possible to interact directly with participants in association areas and in cells. Initial participants were selected opportunistically and, with time, snowball and theoretical sampling approaches were possible.</p>
<p>The research combined three data collection techniques—participant observation, focus group interviewing, and one-to-one, unstructured, and semi-structured interviewing. The wing accommodated forty prisoners at any one time, employed six full-time prison officers, and had a continuous turnover of prisoners, some there for a few weeks, others for more than a year. This made it difficult to track interviewees, as discharge and transfer decisions were commonly made at short notice; so participants did not tend to constitute a cohesive group.</p>
<p>Throughout the fieldwork, I maintained a field diary, which involved recording observations and reflections, making illustrations (e.g., the layout of the wing, group dynamics, flowcharts of processes) and summarizing conversations and anecdotes, using a small notebook. At times when prisoners were on free association on the wing, I would try to be there as well to listen in on conversations, join in where appropriate and observe social interactions; this was important in terms of attempting to build trust and rapport with prisoners and gradually recruit participants for interview. Thus, initial informal conversations during association periods led to more prolonged unstructured and, later, semistructured interviews with prisoners in their cells, which was facilitated through being permitted free movement about the wing at association times. Over the course of nearly a year, I interviewed thirty-five prisoners on the wing, seven of whom also participated in an early focus group seven weeks into the fieldwork. Four interviews were carried out with prison officers based on the wing. The data reported here is lifted primarily from one-to-one audio-recorded interviews, while ongoing observation and involvement in the daily activities of prisoners enabled me to reflect on and validate information gleaned from interviews, and to check out emerging themes with participants as an ongoing process.</p>
<p>Themes and subthemes that arose through open and axial coding of interview data generally fell into five key data categories, relating to the regime, occupation/purposeful activity, prisoner–staff relations, prisoner social relations, and relations beyond prison. In this article, the “prisoner social relations” category is discussed, where the key theme relating to “front management” strategies is explored. Where verbatim quotations are cited, pseudonyms are used, those marked “PO’”denoting a Prison Officer. Abridged citations are marked with […], with the intention of reducing density whilst not losing the essential meanings of participants' expressions. The remainder of the thematic analysis is published elsewhere (de Viggiani 2003; de Viggiani 2006a; de Viggiani 2006b).</p>

<title>Trying to be Something You Are Not: Putting up a Front</title>
<p>Relationships among prisoners are, for the most part, temporary and superficial, which was how the research participants described them. Many were conscious of how they came across to others and would therefore use front management tactics to strive to present an acceptable persona, especially when in more public spaces of the prison. Prisoners spoke of the pressure to balance an outward “public” appearance with their more genuine or private selves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1097184X12448464">Fielding (1993)</xref> identified front management as an ethnographic research technique—similar to the phenomenological notion of “bracketing”—a tactic of self-protection, where researchers may “veneer” their personality or identity. Such a strategy was observed among these participants, some describing the “wearing of a mask,” “imitation,” “mimicking” behavior, or “only seeing the shell of a person.” A range of “fronts” were described that, at one level, represented individual efforts to fit into the prison community and avoid exploitation, and, at another, were perceived as one-upmanship or assertion of legitimacy, status, and superiority: “Everybody’s trying to prove that they’re somebody […] There’s all this striving to be noticed, you know, just to be an individual. It’s just one big competition to be noticed.” (Nigel)</p>
<p>A range of subthemes emerged under the theme of front management, which are now discussed.</p>
<sec id="section5-1097184X12448464">
<title>Prison Banter</title>
<p>Commonly referred to as “prison talk,” public banter among prisoners was illustrative of how some engaged in degrees of one-upmanship with others; this had a humorous side to it: “You do it for a laugh […]. If we didn’t take the piss out of each other and have a laugh, then there’d be nothing… You can’t talk about what you did last night, so all you do is take the piss out of each other…” (Derek). It was a superficial, public mode of communication that fostered camaraderie but that could also be offensive and provocative. Ribbing, barracking, and use of crude humor enabled some to project a positive, stable identity, while concealing their vulnerabilities. Paul admitted, “I’m a different person on the out, we all are,” and several suggested that the humor of prison talk indeed helped them to suppress or conceal negative emotions. I observed many occasions where prisoners and prison officers used pretentious language or narrated wildly exaggerated stories, while others strove to outwit or impress others, for example, stating that they had served in the armed forces or been in a notorious prison, when it emerged later that they had not. Likewise, some proudly claimed they had been acquainted with, or were related to, millionaires, famous gangsters, or notorious criminals. One particular excerpt from my field notes captures the level of camaraderie and masculine jostling that occurred on the wing during association periods:<disp-quote>
<p>Gradually the pool room began to fill up with prisoners who had come from their rooms for association. After a while, Dan [an experienced and renowned prisoner described by others as an ‘old lag’] started goading a tall muscular looking prisoner—shaved head, tattoos, tanned and quiet—pressing him to do his “special fart.” He goaded him and pressed him, but the other prisoner wouldn’t yield. Dan kept offering him two Mars Bars to do his special trick. Eventually the two of them left the room—presumably to hand over the Mars Bars. They returned, closed the door and set another prisoner to guard it. Then they turned off the lights. I felt like I was involved in a naughty school boy prank. The tall prisoner then got down onto his hands and knees under a table in the corner of the room, and then spent what seemed like several minutes letting out very loud, offensive farts, one after another. Everyone in the room was in hysterics—we all fell about laughing. While feeling uncomfortable at being in the room while the prank was performed, I also felt somewhat flattered to have been accepted in the room, and a little puzzled at the secrecy.</p>
</disp-quote>Although most prisoners participated in the banter to some degree, most claimed to be equally irritated by it because it became incessant during association periods. A few were irritated by some of the values expressed by individuals during these public “contests.” Stuart found the “white van man, <italic>Sun</italic> mentality” particularly annoying, Trevor viewed most other prisoners as “moronic… not even semi-intelligent,” and Bill felt his values were at odds with those of the majority: “I don’t feel that I fit in at all. You’re forced into […] living with people that you wouldn’t normally live with, like, and, I mean, a lot of the talk I hear is just idle fucking chat, you know, just talking for the sake of talking.”</p>
<p>Banter was nonetheless an important medium for many prisoners to interact socially and compete for acceptance, notoriety, or status. Some were irritated by it, though most readily participated in degrees of one-upmanship and “point-scoring” as a means to securing social legitimacy.</p>

<sec id="section6-1097184X12448464">
<title>Body Image</title>
<p>Competitive one-upmanship extended to use of the prison gym. Although a wide range of sports were available, only a minority of prisoners used the facilities on a regular basis, most of these seemingly preoccupied with the use of weights to build muscle bulk. When individuals spoke of the “gym,” they were usually referring to the weights room. Descriptive terminology was used to describe the gym; Ewan referred to it as “very, very macho… everybody trying to outdo everybody else,” while Stuart described it as a “tense, testosterone-fired” place; likewise, Trevor said the gym “bred testosterone”: “… you get people coming back all hyped up, and that just breeds violent people.” Those who were not regular users of the gym tended to view those who did as macho exhibitionists; Tommy, for instance, declared: “You sees people come in skinny as fuck, then six months later you sees ‘em looking like Jeff Capes, know what I mean? And their attitude changes with it.” Also referring to the gym, Ken said: “They go up there, like, to prove theirselves. They do it to pose. They will do one exercise and then they’re in the mirror, checking out their muscles.”</p>
<p>Prisoners' impressions of the gym were confirmed for me when I visited the weights room myself:<disp-quote>
<p>It was a converted garage formerly used as a car mechanics workshop. The atmosphere was intimidating. The room was crude, industrial with a distinctly macho atmosphere. The weights appeared to be uncalibrated and well-used. There were around twenty inmates all lifting weights, most pushing themselves hard. There was a fit-looking, well-built prison officer in charge. The room smelled of sweat and echoed with loud pounding heavy rock music. I’d never seen anywhere like it.</p>
</disp-quote>Some regular users of the gym would brag about the maximum they could lift or the number of bench presses they could complete. Lance, an ex-paratrooper, proudly admitted he had shattered the bones in his lower leg by overexercising his calf muscles through doing heavy-weight “squats.” Injuries from inappropriate and poorly supervised exercise regimes were not uncommon, particularly among compulsive weight trainers who did not attend to their general cardiovascular fitness or diet. As Harry suggested, “They’re building up their bodies trying to look good and eating all the garbage under the sun… They’re trying to portray a healthy, fit person, who’s not going to be messed with. But, really, they’re not projecting a healthy image at all, they’re projecting an image of masculinity.”</p>
<p>A certain level of peer pressure prevailed on the wing to use the gym, particularly given gym access was a privilege for enhanced prisoners. Stuart admitted, though, that the one time he had used the gym he had been put off by the highly tense and competitive atmosphere and the poor level of supervision. Others admitted that embarrassment or fear of ridicule had prevented them from using it.</p>
<p>Pressure to participate in team sports was also stressful for some prisoners. Trevor had been coerced into playing in a softball competition against prisoners on another wing, despite having angina, and found himself cajoled by fellow prisoners when he joined in: “It was, ‘Come on you old fart! You’re not gonna get anywhere!’… and the lads on my team were yelling, ‘yeah, yeah, go on pops!’… It’s not so bad now they’ve stopped taking the mickey.” Frank had been persuaded to play five-a-side football, despite his reservations: “Why should I join in and then get people saying, ‘Look at that fat cunt’?… I went over to play football last week, and the screw came up to me and said, ‘Oh, fucking hell, what’ve we got here, then?’” On one occasion, I watched a football match between prisoners from two wings (adults vs young offenders). Throughout the game, the adult spectators provoked and cajoled one overweight young offender—a good footballer—with taunts of “come on piggy!”</p>
<p>Team sports provided an outlet for friendly aggression and rivalry, which could make them intensely competitive and humiliating. Weight training, on the other hand, enabled prisoners to bolster their image or self-concept, which others would view as pretentious or macho. Many spoke about others' competitive or macho behavior, though they rarely acknowledged their own possible culpability.</p>

<title>Toughness/Machismo</title>
<p>A common trait among new arrivals, particularly younger men, was to project a tough, “don’t mess with me” front, what some termed strutting. In this regard, Harry suggested: “You’ve got to sort of build yourself up, you’ve got to pump yourself up, like, and make yourself look a big guy. It’s not necessarily all about muscles and all that. It’s a man thing.” And Bill, likewise, summed up how he saw it: “Some of ‘em walk about with carpets under their arms…, pushing each other about, and fucking jousting and shadow boxing, and all that fucking nonsense.” This kind of inflated, egotistical behavior usually subsided as prisoners settled into the routine and got to know each other better, though a small minority still exhibited a macho, tough, aggressive façade, even though this was generally viewed as an unpopular among adult prisoners.</p>
<p>Lance, for instance, the ex-paratrooper mentioned previously, was heavily built and preferred to distance himself from other prisoners; he spoke patronizingly of others and I found him to be aggressive and intimidating. Harry spoke about Lance: “We’ve got a guy on here who thinks he’s really big, really macho, like. And I don’t think he’s liked by many on here, even the screws, like. He thinks everybody in here’s a prat or an idiot. I mean, even if he walks past the pool room, it’s like he’s looking in and saying, ‘Fucking bunch of idiots!’ You know? There’s no need for that. You need friends in prison, not enemies, like… They all know what he’s like.” Bill also referred to Lance: “I had a fella in here the other day, an ex-squaddie, and the fucking nonsense he was coming out with! I thought, shall I start arguing with him and giving him my view, but I thought, No, he’s too far fucking immersed in it. He was talking about the stuff he wants to do when he gets out, how he wants to die in combat. And I thought, Fucking hell!… There was this barrier he was putting up, like. I could feel it, like. I felt that if I said the wrong word, I was going to get fucking floored, like.” Lance evidently used his bulk and intimidating manner to assert his superiority, a strategy described by Harry as “projecting one’s masculinity,” and one which tended to be unpopular and provocative.</p>

<sec id="section8-1097184X12448464">
<title>Reputation</title>
<p>Respect earned either through criminal notoriety or prison experience represented an important symbol of status, though such individuals tended not to overtly exploit this quality themselves. Rather, less experienced prisoners—and even prison officers—would publicly fraternize with more dominant characters displaying a marked level of respect for them.</p>
<p>Dan, for instance, was known across the prison and referred to as an “old lag” on account of his twenty-five years prison experience reflecting over seventy convictions involving violence. His experience meant he would offer advice and protection to less experienced prisoners, and the officers had labeled him the “daddy of the wing”: “When the younger ones have problems, they’ll always go to him for help. Someone will come into the office with a black eye and we’ll say, ‘Oh, so what happened to you?’, ‘Oh, I fell over’. And Dan will come down later and say, ‘It’s all right, boss, I’ve sorted it, enough said’. I mean, to be perfectly honest, we know what’s going on, but we let it go because we know Dan will calm the wing down. You can turn a blind eye to it. And if we want something sorted, we’ll let him go ahead and sort it, so long as he don’t assault no-one…” (Len-PO). Moreover, Tom (PO) suggested that less experienced prisoners would strive for social recognition from such individuals to improve their own social standing: “If they can be seen as close to him, then their status is that much improved, ‘cos that’s what prison’s all about, where you are in the pecking order.”</p>
<p>Several older prisoners admitted that age and experience brought them increased respect from younger prisoners. Trevor had thirty years of prison experience and described himself as one of the “old brigade”; and Jake said he received greater respect from prison staff having known some of them for many years. Nonetheless, respect and status were sometimes accrued by younger prisoners serving longer than average sentences, or with extensive experience of custody.</p>
<p>Criminal notoriety also drew respect and status. Frank felt his involvement in armed robbery had raised his status with his peers and made him feel important and more attractive to women. Further time in prison further enhanced his reputation and status: “You’re walking down the road, you’ve got your prison badge in your hand, you’re sticking your chest out—‘I’ve been to prison, don’t fuck with me’…” Offence type was also thought to yield particular status. Trevor’s involvement in “corporate theft” was, in his view, more respectable than petty theft.</p>
<p>However, a reputation for violence could also bring costs; Dan said he had been targeted by others, including officers, who had tried to test him. Moreover, a prisoner with a reputation for violence provoked displays of loyalty driven by fear. Referring to Dan, Chris said, “He’s very unpredictable. That’s why people respect him, ‘cos they don’t want to get on the wrong side of him. He’s got respect ‘cos of his age, but I think it’s ‘cos of who he is as well. He’s a nice bloke and all, but he has got a temper on him. So if you’re a bit of a tasty person like Dan, and you’re unpredictable, and people are a bit wary of you, they’re gonna be nice and polite. People might think he’s a wanker, but they won’t say it to his face.”</p>
<p>Thus, for some prisoners, reputation was a measure of status but not necessarily popularity. Allegiance with such individuals could enable those with lesser status to raise their profiles or glean protection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1097184X12448464">
<title>Legitimacy</title>
<p>Some prisoners strove to legitimize their offence by contrasting it with what they viewed as more heinous or unacceptable offence types, and presenting theirs in a favorable light; as Tom (PO) implied, “… the gangster who blows another gangster’s head away and kills him is given higher regard than the lad who knocks over an old woman and grabs her handbag.” In this sense, prisoners could take the moral high ground. Drug-related offences were castigated by nondrug related offenders, and “petty theft” that exploited vulnerable victims was viewed more negatively than that defined as “corporate theft.” Across the board, most—including prison officers—viewed sexual offences, especially those against children, as a separate, unacceptable category of offence. These offenders were referred to as “nonces” (Not of Normal Criminal Ethos), a label that could be applied to anyone who was suspected of such an offence. Ian, for instance, referred to child sex offenders specifically as “a separate class of prisoner” who should be incarcerated separately to other prisoners, and Harry, convicted for raping and assaulting his wife, stressed: “The real low-lifes in here are the fucking dirty kiddie fiddlers.” He admitted constructing for himself a “defensive shield” when talking about his own offence, particularly as he was on the sex offender register. Dan’s words illustrate this attempt to draw a line between acceptable and unacceptable sexual offences: “Anyone can get done for rape. There’s one on this wing, for instance, who had a row with his missus, and she yelled “Rape!” It’s so easily done, isn’t it? So I don’t believe that rape is so bad. But when it comes to indecently assaulting children, that’s bad then, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Most prisoners endeavored to portray their own offences in a positive light as a protective strategy, sometimes using a cover story: “You might have assaulted and robbed an old woman in her home, which in here makes you scum… There’s fucking loads of them who’ve done that in here, who go to the elderly because they’re easy pickings. But then they’ll say they’re in for burglary or something like that…” (Harry). It was common to keep written proof of one’s offence, such as a newspaper clipping or printout of one’s conviction history. Ewan felt fortunate that his manslaughter conviction for death by dangerous driving had attracted the interest of local media: “… mine definitely wasn’t seen as that bad, though it was bad enough, like.” Trevor said that being older (50) and having a middle-class accent evoked suspicion: “You don’t go round saying what you’ve done. So, then they’ll say, ‘So, what are you in for?’ and I’ll say, ‘Theft’. And ‘cos I’m older, then I’m hearing comments like, ‘I’m sure he’s a nonce’. And then somebody else has picked up on it, so you’ve got a problem.”</p>
<p>Striving to present one’s offence as “acceptable”—sometimes even as honorable or respectable—therefore represented a strategy aimed at projecting a legitimate, socially acceptable front; being labeled a nonce increased one’s vulnerability and likelihood of exploitation and bullying.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1097184X12448464">
<title>Heterosexism</title>
<p>Sex was a preoccupation for many, reflected in occasional overtly crude, sexual, sometimes sexist and misogynistic comments about women from prisoners and male prison officers. Len (PO) suggested that this was reinforced through employment of female staff: “We’ve had female staff shagging prisoners. One was suspended and one got the sack about three years ago, a nurse. I mean, even the teachers have done it as well. It’s happening all over the place. It happens in all the prisons. That’s why I don’t agree with female staff at a male prison.”</p>
<p>Steve had a tattoo on his bicep depicting a woman’s open crotch; when asked about this, he replied: “Let’s be honest, that little fur box they’ve got will draw you further than dynamite can blow you!” Several prisoners referred to their prison sentence as a period of sexual abstinence, expressing the view that their partners were experiencing a level of sexual deprivation similar to themselves: “A lot of birds want to know when you’re getting out, because they know you ain’t had none for a while, and that you’re really up for it…” (Chris).</p>
<p>Women tended to be viewed primarily as sexual beings, which was reinforced through display of pornographic images on nearly all the prisoners' cell walls. Pornographic material was also evident in the staff office on the wing. Most prisoners viewed it as the norm to have such images on their cell wall; Sam admitted that this was essentially to conform: “They’re there purely and simply because of people coming in here saying, ‘It’s about time you got some pictures up’. It’s not actually through choice.” Vince had several images of topless women in his cell, but admitted that he had never had a sexual relationship with a woman.</p>
<p>Sexism and use of misogynist banter was an irritation for some, generally the few who chose not to decorate their cells with pornographic images. Balli, a married Muslim, admitted he found the sexist wing culture difficult to cope with, and Bill, who described himself as a Pagan, argued: “I’ve listened to conversations about women and some of them are bordering on rape. They look at them as a piece of meat, and that’s it. A woman to them is from the neck down… I never really experienced that sort of attitude until I came here.”</p>
<p>Against this general heterosexist undercurrent, there was a degree of low level homophobic banter, not directed in any malicious way but more evident in light-hearted cajoling among individuals. When asked about this, most interviewees tended to steer away from this to reflect on specific stories of homosexual activity. Jim, for example, spoke about two prisoners who had been caught having sex: “One guy was giving the other bloke one, with a picture of his missus stuck to the back of his head! And they used to swap around, once a week!” When probed about the issue of same sex relations, the prevailing view was that gay prisoners were generally invisible, should remain invisible, should keep their sexuality private, and should never make sexual advances toward heterosexual prisoners. Indeed, Warren remarked, “There’s no queers or nothing like that running around. It’s just not the done thing, you know. You’d get battered, you’d get proper battered. So there’s none of that goes on.” Harry described an altercation with another prisoner in the shower: “… this guy came in. He was about 6’3” and quite stocky. And I told him, “You just wait till I’ve finished.” “Why’s that, then?” he said. And I said, “‘Cos you’re fucking gay! Now just wait!” I had to tell him, and he respected it, like. ‘Cos, straight away, you’re thinking to yourself: “They’re looking at you,” you know? I just made sure from that day onwards I never went near him, and if he did what he did, then I fucking let him get on with it, like.”</p>
<p>It was evident that some individuals held strong beliefs about sexuality and gender, and some used correspondingly crude and derogatory language. Sexist, predominantly heterosexual attitudes and values were expressed through banter, which partly reflected efforts to front manage in order to fit in socially and attempt to present an uncontroversial, heterosexual persona.</p>

<sec id="section11-1097184X12448464">
<title>Vulnerability</title>
<p>As suggested within the previous sections, a key survival strategy was to avoid exploitation by other prisoners, and this was commonly pursued through striving to present a socially acceptable, “legitimate” front that would serve to mask weakness, vulnerability, and emotional expression. It was the perception of most participants that weak or vulnerable prisoners tended to stand out, and appearing weak or vulnerable invited bullying or exploitation. The broad consensus among prisoners and prison officers was that one should stand up for oneself if ever challenged. Jim suggested that unless one did this one was likely to be picked on or, as Pat put it, be seen as a “push over.”</p>
<p>Chris had been bullied while in a Young Offender Institution, which he said had taught him to stand up for himself. Individuals who tended to display low self-esteem, who lacked confidence, who were weak-willed, or who appeared nervous or shy, were liable to be challenged. Those who displayed supportive or caring qualities could also become targets for exploitation. Tony had endeavored to keep it quiet that he was a Listener for fear of being labeled a “grass,” and Nige said his conversion to Christianity had drawn ridicule from other prisoners. As Len (PO) suggested, it was important not to be labeled a “grass” or viewed as “the bad apple in the cart”; prisoners would therefore strive to maintain a respectable social distance from staff, which meant that victims of bullying or exploitation would be reluctant to approach staff for help: “You’ll get an inmate with a black eye who comes to the office and says he’s being bullied. And when you ask him who’s been doing it, he goes, “I’m not a grass. I won’t grass on ‘em.” It’s partly fear, but it’s also the culture that they have here. Grassing is the lowest of the low, even though you try and explain to him that he’s protecting the one who’s robbed from his own. They’ll still protect the bullies because of the code…” (Doug-PO).</p>
<p>This tactic of emotional repression meant prisoners would try to masquerade as strong-willed, confident, and in control. Even individuals who had experienced significant life events while in prison admitted that they had felt compelled to suppress their feelings. When Lance suffered his leg injury in the gym, he had refused help from other prisoners for fear of showing weakness: “I’m walking on it, but that’s just through sheer stubbornness, because I don’t want to rely on no one here. I wouldn’t want to do it for anyone else… I like doing things for myself. I was on crutches but I couldn’t get my meals myself, so I decided to just throw them away and start walking about myself.”</p>
<p>Emotional repression arose principally from fear of exploitation. Chris explained how when he first came to prison he was fearful of everyone and was regularly verbally insulted: “I’d be shouted at through the windows, and I was in a pretty bad way. I was weak mentally and I was scared. But I wouldn’t show it. I <italic>couldn’t</italic> show it. I was frightened.” Others admitted that they had become well practiced in concealing their emotions: “Most of these, I think, would cope much better if they faced their problems and had a good cry. Some of them must be really hurting inside, but they won’t show it…” (Kieran). Likewise, Ian said, “I’ll guarantee you that 80% of this jail have cried when they’re behind that cell door. Every man’s had a cry. I’ve had a cry or two, and I’m not ashamed to admit it. If having a cry’s the way you can relieve some tension, pressures, hassles, fucking heartache, whatever, you know, that’s what you should do, like, if it helps.” Conversely, Tony’s view was that men should not appear emotional or show their feelings publicly: “I’ve never talked, never shown my emotions, never shown my feelings. I don’t know how to. Men naturally keep a lot in, know what I mean? You have to otherwise you’d be losing it here, there and everywhere, you know?”</p>
<p>For most individuals, emotional repression and concealing one’s vulnerabilities was a necessary tactic to prevent exploitation by manipulative prisoners. While viewed by some as acceptable, normal masculine conduct, it was actively viewed by many as an essential survival strategy while in prison.</p>
<p>Reports of physical bullying were rare, though some had experienced or witnessed occurrences where vulnerable prisoners had been assaulted, and gave vivid accounts of scaldings, slashings, beatings, and sexual assault. Physical bullying was generally considered unacceptable though and rare among adult prisoners: “Bullying isn’t tolerated. If people are getting bullied, and people see it, a couple of boys are going to get together and sort it out, like…” (Derek). Psychological bullying, on the other hand, was more common, particularly in the form of cajoling, teasing, and public ridicule; while it was generally considered that those who took provocation too seriously invited further provocation, there were instances where a clear bully–victim relationship prevailed. Victims would be “branded,” as Jim put it. Steve, for instance, had developed a reputation as “… the laughing stock of the wing” (Jim). Others said they had been victimized like this in the past, Kieren admitting he had attempted suicide as he had been too scared to leave his cell.</p>
<p>Another form of exploitation was extortion and indebtedness, which could result from “double bubble,” the situation where the debtor is expected to repay double the loan or may have a social debt to pay on account of gleaning protection or support from an exploitative, unscrupulous individual. The consequence of nonpayment of a financial, material of social debt could be very serious: “Out there, if someone owed you £2 you wouldn’t go and throw a jug of hot water in his face because of it. But it happens in here. If someone owes you £4, and he was supposed to pay you last week but can only pay you half this week and half next week, you wouldn’t go up and cut him now, would you? But I’ve seen it done in here…” (Warren). Debtors might be pressured into trafficking drugs or other ‘contraband’ items, or taking risks on behalf of exploitative prisoners. For instance, Kieran said he had been forced to steal syringes and needles while working as a health care centre orderly. Several had witnessed other prisoners being “ghosted” (transferred unexpectedly to another prison) following this kind of victimization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1097184X12448464">
<title>Letting the Front Down</title>
<p>Social life on the wings was, nonetheless, generally congenial, prisoners, and prison officers together striving for a degree of camaraderie. Individuals who erred from this by “rocking the boat” or causing trouble tended to become unpopular with the majority. Social relations were superficial, though, characterized by banter and individuals acting up various fronts or façades to get along. There were nonetheless occasions when individuals said they were able to “unmask” and let the front down, some admitting they had managed to forge quite deep, lasting allegiances with individuals they considered to be close friends. These were sometimes individuals they had known before prison or new acquaintances with whom they had developed trust and rapport over time, perhaps having shared a cell. Participants concurred that it was important to choose one’s friends carefully and not become over-friendly with everyone. Close friendship then provided valuable companionship and support, and an important emotional outlet.</p>
<p>Dan spoke about his friendship with Jake: “There’s a lot of things you don’t like to speak to other people about… But, talking to Jake, like, you then find he’s been thinking the same sorts of things as me, like… when I was thinking that it was only me thinking like that. And you feel better then, knowing you’re not the only one thinking it.” Ian likewise spoke about Sean: “He was having stress and I was having stress, so you find you help each other out, like. I’ll sit and talk to him and he’ll do the same. And when I’m sat in here all quiet and that, he can tell when I can’t be fucked with anybody, and he’ll check if I’m all right and that, and he’ll just leave me alone then, like. So me and him’s helped each other quite a bit, like, and in that way it helps having a best mate, somebody you can speak to.”</p>
<p>Such relationships tended to be quite intense and loyal but could precipitate a profound sense of loss when a friend was discharged or transferred: “They’re all gone now. So […] I thought, ‘Fuck all that’, getting in with people and all that… So I don’t no more. I mean I do talk to people, I talk to people all the time, but I’m not close with people, ‘cos they leave and… you don’t want that. I’m better off on my own…” (Vinny).</p>
<p>Evidently, beneath the “public” level of banter and camaraderie, deeper friendships prevailed among some prisoners that, as well as providing an important source of emotional and social support, enabled individuals to “unmask.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1097184X12448464">
<title>The Sick Role</title>
<p>By contrast, some prisoners would no longer appear to conform to these somewhat pervasive normative front management tactics, on account of becoming socially withdrawn or even depressed. Warren, for instance, said he had become increasingly passive and withdrawn and would spend a lot of time alone in his cell, despite having the opportunity to leave his cell for most of the day. He would avoid other prisoners and preferred to sleep and eat: “I sleep all the way through the day, now, ‘cos I just think, ‘fuck it all’.” Likewise, Stuart admitted: “There’s nothing to get up for in the morning […] every day’s the same and nothing changes.” Others recognized individuals who appeared to them to be depressed or withdrawn, adopting a kind of “sick role,” Sam describing this as a “mask”: “Some of the masks I’ve seen in here are extremely depressing… You get the almost ‘autistic’ mask, where people don’t show any emotion, and then you’ve got those who wear a ‘constantly pissed-off’ mask.”</p>
<p>Some individuals displayed signs of physical neglect and loss of self-respect. Len had shared a cell with a young man whom he considered to be severely depressed as he had seemed socially withdrawn and detached and refused to leave the cell or to wash: “It was murder. He smelt so bad that I was getting headaches… Even the screws were commenting on it.”</p>
<p>Some prisoners evidently adopted this “sick role,” which could suggest that prison life was having a damaging effect on their mental health, possibly as a consequence of not coping well with prison and likely exacerbated through pressures to conform and fit into prison social life.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1097184X12448464">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The themes discussed here illustrate how prison social relations can serve to forge new—albeit temporary—prison identities for some individuals, where they endeavor to simultaneously separate their public and private façades. At the public level, individuals would engage in varying front management tactics to achieve social acceptance and legitimacy. In private, some would drop this public façade, sometimes with others with whom they had bonded closely—sometimes a former cell mate. Others displayed loss of interest or motivation to conform, which in some cases signaled they had become psychologically and socially withdrawn, and emotionally detached. Overall, participants perceived that it was necessary to project a legitimate and confident public front as a strategy to avoid being exploited, and language and behavior played an important role in this regard. However, sustaining this public persona could be a strain.</p>
<p>To “handle one’s bird” meant compelling oneself to display a physically and emotionally robust character, evident in the way individuals engaged in banter, participated in gym activities, concealed weakness, asserted their reputation, or projected their heterosexuality. Front management tactics tended to reflect preexisting (imported) values and beliefs as well as those of the prison code, which included respect, toughness, control, loyalty, competitiveness, heterosexism, and homophobia. Conformity was considered necessary to prevent exploitation and maintain some semblance of respected status within the prison social order. Thus, the performance of prison masculinities enabled participants to avoid subordination within the existing hegemonic social order: “You’re either up there with the boys or you’re down there with the more timid weaker people. You’re either popular or you’re not. And if you’re not, you’re in for a hard time, you’re in for a rough ride. You’re either one of the boys or you ain’t.” (Chris). Or, as Doug (PO) put it: “The strongest rule, and the one at the bottom just lies down and they wipe their feet on him.”</p>
<p>As with former studies of prison social life, this research revealed that prisoners adapted to prison by aligning themselves to the norms, mores, and customs of the dominant institutional culture, adopting traditionally masculine “alienative modes” of behavior. This enabled individuals to strive for social acceptance in a strongly heterosexist, male-dominated environment. The transient prisoner population made the social environment tense and stressful, front management therefore becoming a necessary survival strategy, despite the fact that this could further alienate individuals from themselves and from others. Prison banter and other pressures to conform, including competitive one-upmanship, tough or macho conduct, sexism, homophobia, asserting one’s reputation or legitimacy, and exploiting vulnerable prisoners, may all be interpreted as techniques of validating “safe” traditional masculine identities. Compulsion to conform indeed stifled individuals' willingness to express themselves openly, be emotionally expressive and develop trusting relationships. Self-censorship balanced against allegiance to the values of the prison hegemonic social order provided the conditions for individuals to play out what to them were legitimate prison masculinities, within a somewhat excessively controlling, divisive and competitive, “dog-eat-dog” masculine culture.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1097184X12448464">Sabo, Kupers, and London (2001)</xref> have argued that conformity among male prisoners may be interpreted as performances or projections of prison masculinity, and thus as tactics to shield or mask self-perceived weakness or vulnerability and assert status and legitimacy as a member of the prison community. On commencing this research, I was skeptical of the notion of male prisoners or staff engaging in gendered “masculine” behaviors, as it could equally be argued that few men actually represent or conform to the archetypal masculine role or stereotype. However, what emerged from the research findings were certainly efforts by individuals to fit in, become accepted and not “rock the boat.” In this regard, individuals publicly displayed values, attitudes, and behaviors to earn respect, acceptance, and legitimacy from others, as a means toward ensuring their physical, psychological, and social survival. This research did not set out to explicitly measure health and illness in a systematic way. However, health issues did arise in the accounts of participants. In speaking about survival and getting by, participants connected health issues with their experiences of prison social life. In general, there was a sense that the disempowering and divisive institutional and social culture worked against prisoners' desires to improve themselves, physically, emotionally, intellectually, and vocationally. Effective health promotion is based on core principles of equity, empowerment, and participation, where the underlying determinants of health are enmeshed in the fabric of the social system (World Health Organization [WHO] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1097184X12448464">1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1097184X12448464">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1097184X12448464">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1097184X12448464">Naidoo and Wills 2000</xref>). As with schools, key to health improvement are efforts to influence and shape the hidden cultural curriculum to enable people to respond positively and in meaningful ways to institutional environments, to grow and to make positive inroads into society. In this regard, becoming a good citizen is about taking personal responsibility, but this requires an equitable and just system to enable those in greatest need to step onto the ladder.</p>
