<p><italic>Background</italic>: Indirect calorimetry is the criterion method for assessment of energy expenditure in critically ill patients but is decidedly uncommon. Thus, calculation methods proliferate. Even if indirect calorimetry is available, it usually is not repeated more than weekly on the same patient, creating potential for error. The purpose of the current study was to quantify estimation errors against indirect calorimetry measurements in critically ill patients over time. <italic>Methods</italic>: In mechanically ventilated, critical care patients, indirect calorimetry was used to measure resting metabolic rate for 7 days. Three estimation methods were compared with the cumulative measurement: the Penn State equations, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) standard (25 kcal/kg body weight), and an extrapolated value based on the first measurement multiplied by 7 days. <italic>Results</italic>: The cumulative difference between measured resting metabolic rate and the rate predicted by the Penn State equations was −468 ± 642 kcal (–3.7% ± 5.1% of the measured value). The difference for the ACCP was smaller, but variation was much wider (–387 ± 1597 kcal or −2.2% ± 11.9% of the measured value). The extrapolated value was −684 ± 1731 kcal (–4.1% ± 11.4% of measured expenditure). <italic>Conclusion</italic>: On average, the Penn State equations predict resting metabolic rate over time within 5% of the measured value. This performance is similar to the practice of making 1 measurement and extrapolating it over 1 week. The ACCP method has an unacceptably wide limit of agreement.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>In this article, the Penn State equations for predicting resting metabolic rate in critically ill patients are evaluated longitudinally over 7 days. In addition, a cumulative estimate for resting metabolic rate based on a single indirect calorimetry measurement is compared. The data show that for indirect calorimetry to be preferable to estimation by equation, it must be conducted more than weekly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0148607112446702" sec-type="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Because of cost, time, and technical considerations, energy intake goals of most nutrition support regimens are based on estimation rather than measurement of energy expenditure. Even if measurement with indirect calorimetry is available, the operational cost in time and manpower usually limits how often the measurement is repeated. In critically ill patients, the Penn State equation is one of many methods available for estimating resting metabolic rate. This equation has been validated in a cross-sectional manner in more than 200 mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112446702">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112446702">2</xref></sup> However, the equation has not been tested longitudinally. The primary purpose of the current study, then, was to determine the cumulative error of the Penn State equation over 7 days compared with daily measurement. Two secondary goals were to test the validity of a more commonly used static equation (25 kcal/kg body weight) and to compare the cumulative error of a single indirect calorimetry measurement extrapolated over 7 days with the sum of 7 daily measurements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0148607112446702" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The current study was approved by the institutional review board at the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. Informed consent was waived because the study was of minimal risk, using measurements commonly performed in clinical settings. All rules of ethics and confidentiality were followed in the conduct of the study. The basic procedure of this study was to measure patients daily for 7 days and to estimate daily resting metabolic rate over the same time period, comparing the difference in cumulative expenditure between methods.</p>
<sec id="section4-0148607112446702">
<title>Patient Selection</title>
<p>The study was conducted in surgical/trauma, neuroscience, and medical critical care units of the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. Patients were evaluated based on their potential for remaining mechanically ventilated for at least 7 days and to remain in a resting state during the measurements. All patients had to be at least 18 years old, but no upper limit was placed on age, and no upper or lower limit was placed on body weight or body mass index. Patients were excluded if there was a known air leak anywhere in the ventilator circuit (chest tubes, endotracheal cuffs, etc). Fraction of inspired oxygen had to be 60% or less.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0148607112446702">
<title>Measurement Protocol</title>
<p>The Deltatrac MB-101 open-circuit indirect calorimeter (Yorba Linda, Ca) was used throughout the current study. Indirect calorimetry was conducted early in the morning, between 5:00 and 7:30 <sc>am</sc>. Measurement duties were shared by 2 of the investigators (D.C.F. and C.M.A.). A standard protocol for conducting the measurement was followed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112446702">3</xref></sup> The indirect calorimeter was warmed up and calibrated according to manufacturer’s instructions. Testing periods lasted for 30 minutes, with the first 5 minutes automatically discarded. The coefficient of variation on the remaining 25 minutes of data for oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production had to be 10% or less.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112446702">3</xref></sup> Patients had to be observed in a resting state during the test, without being disturbed by caregivers and with minimal movement. If such interruptions in resting state occurred, then shorter steady-state periods were accepted. These were either 10 minutes of data with a coefficient of variation of 10%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112446702">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112446702">4</xref></sup> or 5 minutes of data with a coefficient of variation of 5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112446702">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112446702">5</xref></sup> If resting and steady-state conditions did not prevail on a given day, that day was skipped and the protocol prolonged to obtain a total of 7 days of data.</p>
<sec id="section6-0148607112446702">
<title>Equations</title>
<p>Two versions of the Penn State equation have been validated in cross-sectional studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112446702">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112446702">2</xref></sup> Both equations use the Mifflin–St Jeor calculated value of resting metabolic rate for healthy people, the maximum body temperature, and minute ventilation. The standard equation has been found to be inaccurate in patients 60 years or older with a body mass index 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or higher.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112446702">1</xref></sup> Thus, a modified equation was developed and validated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112446702">2</xref></sup></p>

<p>where RMR is resting metabolic rate; Mifflin is the Mifflin–St Jeor equation calculated from actual body weight, height, age, and sex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112446702">6</xref></sup>; Tmax is maximum body temperature in degrees Centigrade; and Ve is expired minute ventilation in L/min.</p>
<p>A commonly used static equation was also included for comparison. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) standard of 25 kcal/kg was calculated using actual body weight for patients with body mass index less than 30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Adjusted body weight was used for patients with body mass index ≥30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (25% of the difference between actual weight and ideal weight added to the ideal weight).</p>
<p>Estimated resting metabolic rate was recalculated daily using these equations, and the 7-day sum of those values was compared with the sum of the 7 measurements. Cumulative error was calculated as the sum of the equation values minus the sum of the 7 daily measures so that a positive cumulative difference represented an overestimation and a negative cumulative difference represented an underestimation.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0148607112446702">
<title>Extrapolated Measures</title>
<p>In another method for predicting resting metabolic rate over time, the first indirect calorimetry measurement of each patient was multiplied by the number of study days (7) to compute the energy goal that would result by the practice of measuring once and using that value to determine the energy content of nutrition support for a week. Cumulative error was calculated as the extrapolated value minus the sum of the 7 daily measurements. As above for the equation data, this produced a positive value if the cumulative error was an overestimation and a negative value if the cumulative error was an underestimation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0148607112446702">
<title>Other Data</title>
<p>At the conclusion of a successful indirect calorimetry study, clinical data were collected. These data included the variables necessary to calculate the Penn State equation (minute ventilation and maximum body temperature), ventilator settings, and laboratory, culture, and radiologic data for the purpose of describing changes in the patient’s condition over the course of the protocol (ie, development of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, infection, sepsis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112446702">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112446702">8</xref></sup> All surgical procedures were noted. Height was obtained from family when available and confirmed by the researchers. If height was not available, then the researchers measured it if the patient was lying straight in bed or estimated if not. All estimates by one researcher were confirmed by another researcher. The weight used for calculations was the lower of either admission weight or weight at the time of study entry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0148607112446702">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Cumulative energy expenditure was the primary end point of this study. Student paired <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare the difference between the cumulative measured expenditure against the calculated value by the Penn State equation and the extrapolated cumulative value. Bias was calculated as the 95% confidence interval of the difference between measured and estimated or extrapolated expenditure values. Bland-Altman principles were also applied, examining for proportional bias (correlation between difference and mean cumulative energy expenditure) and limits of agreement (mean difference ±1.96 standard deviations from the mean) in the pooled group of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112446702">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Prior to beginning the study, a power analysis was attempted for the primary variable cumulative difference between measured and estimated resting metabolic rate. The process was hampered by a lack of population data for this variable. However, from earlier studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112446702">1</xref></sup> a population value for daily resting metabolic rate was available. The target difference to detect was 10%. From the measured daily resting metabolic rate and the targeted 10% difference, we were able to construct a table of β-values at a range of population standard deviations using a single-sample <italic>t</italic> test (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112446702">Table 1</xref>). This analysis indicated that a sample of 6 or 7 patients would be sufficient to detect a 10% cumulative difference between measured and predicted metabolic rate as long as the population standard deviation is not more than 1000 kcal. Minitab Release 13 (Minitab, Inc, State College, PA) was used to conduct all statistical analyses.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Over a 14-month period from September 2010 to November 2011, 32 critically ill patients were evaluated and determined to have the potential to require mechanical ventilation for at least 7 days. Of these, 2 were removed from the study after 1 measurement because of irregularities in gas exchange (eg, respiratory quotient &lt;0.60). Other reasons for early exit from the study were death (n = 1), withdrawal of support (n = 3), agitation that prevented a resting steady state (n = 7), and liberation from mechanical ventilation before the seventh day (n = 6). The end result was 7 patients for the standard Penn State equation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112446702">Table 2</xref>, referred to as group 1) and 6 patients for the modified equation for older obese individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607112446702">Table 3</xref>, referred to as group 2). With one exception, all 13 patients completed the protocol in the planned 7 days. In 1 patient, there was 1 day in which a steady state was not reached and the protocol extended to an eighth day. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148607112446702">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0148607112446702">5</xref> show changes in clinical events along with changes in body temperature, minute ventilation, and metabolic rate data over the 7 days of study.

<title>Standard Penn State Equation</title>
<p>With 7 patients completing 7 days of measurement, the study had a power of 0.867 to detect a 10% difference between cumulative measured and estimated expenditure as long as the population standard deviation was not more than 1000 kcal. The actual mean 7-day cumulative difference of the sample was −618 kcal with a standard deviation of 774 kcal. This difference was equivalent to −4.7% ± 6.2% of the cumulative measured value over 7 days. The difference between measured and estimated cumulative resting metabolic rate was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .079). Although there was a tendency for the estimated cumulative metabolic rate to be lower than measured, the trend did not translate to statistically significant bias (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0148607112446702">Table 6</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112446702">Figure 1</xref> shows the mean daily measured and predicted resting expenditure, body temperature, and minute ventilation.

<title>Post Hoc Comparisons</title>
<p>After inspection of the results of the main data analysis, the investigators determined that 2 other analyses might be useful to fully explore the utility of estimation methods. These were first to use the original equation in the group 2 patients and second to extrapolate the cumulative energy expenditure from 2 measurements instead of 1 (ie, the first measurement × 3 days + the fourth measurement × 4 days). Among the 6 patients in group 2, the original Penn State equation predicted closer to the measured value than did the Penn State equation modified specifically for this group. The cumulative predicted value was different from measured by 287 ± 375 kcal over 7 days, representing 2.0% ± 2.8% of the cumulative measurement (overestimation) (<italic>P</italic> = .120). The 95% confidence interval of the difference was −107 to 681 kcal. Combining all 13 patients and using the standard Penn State equation for all patients, the mean cumulative difference was −201 ± 760 kcal over 7 days (95% confidence interval, −660 to 259 kcal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0148607112446702">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>All 13 patients completing the study were combined for analysis of data using the methods of Bland and Altman (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0148607112446702">Table 7</xref>). There was fixed bias for the Penn State equation when both the standard and modified equations were used but not when the standard equation was used for all patients. There was no proportional bias for any of the estimation methods, but there was a trend when the modified equation was used. Limits of agreement were widest for the estimates extrapolated from a single measurement and for the ACCP estimate and lowest for the Penn State equations and the estimates extrapolated from 2 measurements. Use of the standard Penn State equation for all patients resulted in a tighter limit of agreement than use of the modified equation in the older obese patients and the standard equation in everyone else.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Indirect calorimetry is not widely available due to high cost to purchase and large time commitment to conduct measurements. For example, to conduct daily measurements in a small intensive care unit of 10 patients would require about 5 hours every day. Prediction equations fill the void, offering simple but less reliable estimates of the measured resting metabolic rate. In a set of prospective validation studies, the Penn State equations have been shown to be accurate about 75% of the time. These equations, however, have not been tested longitudinally. The current study is the first to do this, and the results indicate that the cumulative error is usually small, amounting to an average of about 5% over 7 days. The cumulative errors of the Penn State equations tend to be negative, and the 95% confidence intervals of the differences just barely include zero, indicating a tendency for the equations to underpredict true resting metabolic rate. However, the errors generated by the Penn State equation compare favorably with cumulative errors created by extrapolating single measurements over the same time period of 7 days. Extrapolating a single measurement over 7 days resulted in a 4.1% underestimation in the combined group of 13 patients compared with a 3.7% underestimation when the Penn State equations were used.</p>
<p>There are as yet no studies that directly link measurement of energy expenditure to improved outcome in the critically ill patient. Several studies indicate that achievement of energy balance (along with protein) improves outcomes in critically ill patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112446702">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112446702"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112446702">12</xref></sup> These results are not a direct endorsement for indirect calorimetry in clinical care for two reasons. The first is that although indirect calorimetry was used to guide intake, there was no group in which calculation guided intake,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112446702">12</xref></sup> or the calculation method used in the control groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112446702">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112446702">11</xref></sup> was a static method known to be inaccurate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112446702">1</xref></sup> The second reason is that measurement of energy expenditure is not the only factor in the studies leading to energy balance in the group with a favorable outcome (namely, the indirect calorimetry group was assigned a study coordinator to ensure that target volumes were infused; the calculation group had no coordinator).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112446702">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the current study, group 1 can be contrasted with group 2 as having a higher degree of hypermetabolism (21% above Mifflin–St Jeor) and a greater excursion in metabolic rate from baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112446702">Figure 1</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0148607112446702">Figure 2</xref>). The Penn State equation gave better results than extrapolation from a single measurement. Group 2, in contrast, was less hypermetabolic (16% above Mifflin–St Jeor), with a steadier metabolic rate over time, and extrapolation over 7 days from a single measurement worked better than the modified Penn State equation.</p>
<p>The main feature of error in the Penn State equations is the tendency to underestimate. Although technically unbiased as assessed by 95% confidence intervals, the intervals were decidedly oriented toward the negative (–1334 to 97 kcal for group 1 and −821 to 159 kcal for group 2). In the 13 patients in this study, there were 91 pairs of estimates and measurements, of which 60 of the estimates were lower than the measurements.</p>
<p>In group 1, there was 1 patient with a much greater error than the others (17% vs a mean of 2.6% ± 2.8% among the remaining 6 patients in the group). This was patient 4, who was injured in the same motor vehicle crash as patient 3. Both patients were measured over the same 7 days, one after the other, using the same equipment operated by the same operators. Both achieved steady state, both were sedated and at rest, but the cumulative error over 7 days was &lt;5% for patient 3 vs 17% for patient 4. It is very unlikely that the difference could have been due to equipment or operator error. Patient 4 simply had a higher resting metabolic rate than that explained by body temperature and minute ventilation. The next highest cumulative error in the sample was 5%.</p>
<p>The utility of the modified Penn State equation is uncertain. Its development was prompted by poor performance in the original validation work (53% accuracy rate in a subgroup of patients aged ≥60 years with a body mass index ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112446702">1</xref></sup> The modification was developed from the 52 patients from that study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112446702">1</xref></sup> In a follow-up validation study of 50 patients, the modified equation accurately predicted metabolic rate in 70% of cases, but the original equation also worked better in this sample, predicting accurately 66% of the time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112446702">2</xref></sup> Only when patients from both studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112446702">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112446702">2</xref></sup> were combined did the modified equation clearly outperform the original equation (74% accuracy vs 58% accuracy), and even so the modified equation was biased toward underestimation. The results from the current longitudinal study cast some doubt as to whether the modified equation is preferable in older obese patients.</p>
<p>The ACCP standard appears superficially to be a reasonable estimate of measured resting metabolic rate over time, based on mean difference. However, the 95% confidence interval of the differences was twice as wide as the interval for the Penn State equation, with the limit of agreement even wider (2.5 times wider for ACCP than the Penn State equation).</p>
<p>Limited work has been previously published on the longitudinal error of equations in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112446702">13</xref></sup> This work indicated that there is little agreement between measurements and estimates. However, there are important differences between the previously published work and the current study. The salient difference is that previously, only static equations were tested (Harris Benedict, Schofield, Ireton-Jones, ACCP), whereas in the current study, the focus was on an equation with variables whose values could change daily and therefore track with measured resting metabolic rate. The only equation common to both studies was the ACCP, and there was a small difference in the results between the 2 studies. In the Reid study, the ACCP equation was biased (fixed and proportional) with wide limits of agreement (–533 to 971 kcal/day), whereas in the current study, the ACCP equation was unbiased but did have unacceptably wide limits of agreement (–3513 to 2739 kcal over 7 days).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The ACCP method of estimating resting metabolic rate in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients is not satisfactory because of wide limits of agreement between estimated and measured cumulative values. The Penn State equations for predicting resting metabolic rate in critically ill patients tend toward underestimation, but the cumulative error over 7 days is within 5% on average, and the limits of agreement are more than twice as narrow compared with other estimation methods. This error compares favorably with a single measurement extrapolated over the same time period. Therefore, the Penn State equations are predictive of cumulative resting metabolic rate. For indirect calorimetry to be the preferred method for guiding nutrition support, the measurements must be repeated at a frequency greater than weekly.</p>
