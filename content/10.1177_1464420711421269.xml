<p>Gibbsite scaling on surfaces such as tanks, pipe-work or measuring equipment is the source of many difficulties in the Bayer process. The study presented here investigates the role of surface roughness of steel in aiding gibbsite scale build-up. Steel surfaces of different temperature roughnesses (<italic>r<sub>a</sub></italic> = 0.01–1.44 µm) were prepared and tested for gibbsite scaling rates in real Bayer process conditions in pregnant liquor in a filtrate tank. The roughness of the steel samples influenced the scale nucleation time and the strength of adhesion of the scale. The smoother the steel sample, the longer it took to form a complete layer of scale and the lower the adhesion strength. Once a complete layer of scale had formed then the rate of scale-on-scale growth was similar for all samples, as expected. The scale growth rate under the conditions tested was found to be an average of 22.63 mm/year.</p>

<p>The Bayer process is the industrial means of extracting Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> from raw bauxite ore. In the process, bauxite is digested with a solution of sodium hydroxide (or caustic soda) under high temperature and pressure conditions, so that a supersaturation is achieved when the liquor is cooled, and the pressure is reduced to facilitate precipitation. The supersaturation, with respect to the gibbsite (or aluminium tri-hydrate, Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>), is stable under digestion conditions but in the latter stages of the process, the driving force for the crystallization of the dissolved gibbsite is increased: surfaces that come in contact with the liquor will therefore be subject to gibbsite scaling [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464420711421269">1</xref></bold>]. These surfaces include pipe-work, tanks or measuring equipment. This not only constitutes a loss of product, but it can also lead to many process difficulties. For example, scale build-up in pipes can lead to flow restrictions, scale detachment from tanks can cause blockages or equipment damage, and scale formation may result in losses in heat transfer efficiencies. In addition, there are production losses when equipment is taken off-line for de-scaling purposes. Methods of reducing scale build-up would undoubtedly lead to large savings for the alumina industry through reduced de-scaling costs and increased process efficiencies.</p>
<p>Scale formation emanating from the precipitation of calcium carbonate from water has been widely studied as this constitutes an expensive and persistent problem for a wide range of industries [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464420711421269">2</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464420711421269">4</xref></bold>]. In the Bayer process, the presence of different species in pregnant liquor was shown to be an important factor governing sodium aluminosilicate scale formation in conditions found downstream of the alumina precipitation step [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464420711421269">5</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464420711421269">6</xref></bold>]. Gibbsite precipitation in red mud during the clarification step can also constitute a product loss, and the presence of iron species is reported to promote this precipitation [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464420711421269">7</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>Nawrath <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464420711421269">8</xref></bold>] reported on gibbsite scale growth on the walls of the precipitator tank and investigated the possibility of reducing scale formation by increasing the flow velocity near the tank walls. They concluded that a flow of 2.9 m/s near the walls would prevent scale build-up. However, the energy required to facilitate such a flow was found to be uneconomical and impractical. The addition of chemicals, such as sodium gluconate and hydroxamated polyacrylamide, to control gibbsite scale growth has been reported [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464420711421269">9</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464420711421269">10</xref></bold>]; however, the continuous addition of these chemicals can be expensive. A preliminary study on gibbsite scale growth on polymer surfaces was investigated by Enright <italic>et al</italic>., and it was found some polymers offered promise regarding reduced scale growth [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464420711421269">11</xref></bold>]. However, the stability of these polymers in the harsh conditions experienced in the Bayer process needs to be further investigated.</p>
<p>There has been some work reported on the mechanism of gibbsite scale formation on steel surfaces. These reports primarily involve the use of synthetic Bayer liquor. The nature of the iron oxide/oxyhydroxide layer on the steel is reported to be important [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464420711421269">12</xref></bold>]. In more recent studies, the growth of goethite (α-FeOOH) seeded gibbsite precipitation from synthetic pregnant Bayer liquor was investigated using <italic>in situ</italic> X-ray diffraction (XRD) [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464420711421269">13</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464420711421269">14</xref></bold>]. This technique allowed the identification of the mineralogy of the scale itself in the early stage of formation. Different Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> polymorphs were observed, each appearing at different stages of the precipitating process.</p>
<p>The study presented here investigates the role of surface roughness of steel in aiding gibbsite scale build-up in real process conditions. The strength of scale attachment to the surface is also reported.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1464420711421269"><title>2 EXPERIMENTAL</title>
<sec id="sec3-1464420711421269"><title>2.1 Sample preparation</title>
<p>Low carbon steel samples, supplied by Premier Washer Limited, were exposed to Bayer liquor and the gibbsite scale growth was monitored with time. These samples were chosen since the majority of the pipes, tanks, and equipment in a typical Bayer process plant are composed of such steel. The steel samples used in the study were washer shaped, similar to that presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464420711421269">Fig. 1(a)</xref>, with an outside diameter of 30 mm, an inside diameter of 4 mm, and a thickness of 2 mm. For comparison purposes, some polymer samples were also exposed to the pregnant Bayer liquor. These samples included high-density polyethylene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (from Bay Plastics), and polytetrafluoroethylene (from Fluorocarbon). These polymer samples were used as received.

<p>Before exposure, the surfaces of the steel samples were ground with a series of silicon carbide (SiC) papers to prepare samples with different surface roughnesses, as given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464420711421269">Table 1</xref>, and cleaned thoroughly.

<p>A highly polished sample was also prepared. For this sample, a pre-prepared P600 sample was treated using a P1200 paper and then polished. Polishing was conducted in two stages, initial polishing using a 6 µm diamond slurry on a napped cloth for 20 min. The sample was then washed thoroughly using water, and final polishing was achieved using a 1-µm diamond slurry on a napped cloth. The sample was then cleaned and dried.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1464420711421269"><title>2.2 Sample testing</title>
<p>The sample holder used to secure the steel samples during exposure to the Bayer liquor in a real operating plant is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464420711421269">Fig. 1(b)</xref>. It consisted of a grid-type arrangement capable of holding a large number of samples to ensure statistical relevance of measurements. The steel samples were arranged onto the holder by threading them onto the thin rods and placing polymeric spacers between each sample. The spacer material was perfluoroalkoxy tubing, as this was shown to have reasonably good scaling resistance. The samples were then secured in position using an end nut.</p>
<p>The supported samples were exposed to pregnant Bayer liquor in a filtrate tank. The filtrate tanks are situated directly after sand filtration and are surge tanks for the cleaned liquor before it is sent to the precipitation stage of the plant. The filtrate tank contained a supersaturated solution of sodium aluminate at 104 °C with an iron level of 16 mg/L. The low level of iron is indicative of the low solid content [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464420711421269">15</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>A wire rope was attached to the supporting rod of the sample holder. The other end of the wire rope was attached to a winch, which was designed to lower the samples into the liquor. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464420711421269">Figure 1(c)</xref> presents a schema of this arrangement. Using this set-up, samples could be easily removed after pre-determined exposure times. In total, 24 of each of the samples, P60, P120, P240, and P600 were exposed to the filtrate tank liquor in this way. Four samples of each were removed after 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 14 days and an average of their mass gain with time recorded. Because of the effort required in preparing the polished samples, only two of these were prepared and exposed to the liquor for 2 and 7 days.</p>
<p>Some samples were also exposed to Bayer liquor in the overflow stream of the decanter tank. This liquor, which was composed of a supersaturated solution of sodium aluminate with an iron level of 70 mg/L, was at a temperature of 105 °C.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1464420711421269"><title>2.3 Sample characterization</title>
<p>A variety of techniques were used to characterize the samples following exposure to the Bayer liquor. All samples were weighed before and after exposure to the liquor using a Saratorius CP2242S balance. Before recording, exposed samples were rinsed with deionized water to remove caustic and were subsequently dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 24 h. The mass gain recorded for samples of a particular roughness was an average of four samples.</p>
<p>Scanning electron microscopical (SEM) analysis and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of samples was carried out using a JEOL JSM5600 (JEOL (UK) Limited, Herts., UK). Samples were sputter coated with gold prior to examination as gibbsite is non-conducting. Analysis of some of the images from SEM was carried out using image analysis software (Buehler Limited, Illinois, USA). Five images per exposure time were analysed. The optical microscopy images were taken using an Olympus BX40 microscope with an Olympus OLY220 camera.</p>
<p>XRD characterization of phase content of scales was taken using a Philips XPert X-ray diffractometer using Cu-K<sub><italic>α</italic></sub> radiation (<italic>λ</italic> = 1.542 Å) in the range 15–70 ° 2<italic>θ</italic>. A voltage of 40 kV and a current of 35 mA were used. Prior to analysis, all samples were ground in a gyro-mill into a fine powder, which was then compressed uniaxially into discs of appropriate size for the diffractometer.</p>
<p>Adhesion tests were carried using samples that were exposed to liquor in the decanter tank. The tests were carried out on an Instron 8501 using a 1-kN load cell with a cross head speed of 0.5 mm/min. A jig was designed and built based on the ASTM standard D6465-99 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464420711421269">16</xref></bold>]. The jig consisted of a gripping plate that was glued to the surface (the scale) of a sample, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1464420711421269">Fig. 2</xref>. The plate and sample were then supported by a cylinder resting on the base of the tensile testing machine. A rod was then inserted through the centre hole of the sample. A force was applied by the load cell to the rod. The force acting on the plate caused the scale to detach from the sample surface. Stress–strain graphs were plotted and the values of adhesion strength determined by the maximum stress value.

<p>Surface roughness measurements were made using a Veeco NT1100 optical surface profilometer with a vertical resolution of 0.1 nm and a vertical scanning range of 1 mm. For rougher samples, a Microfocus Measurement System laser profilometer of UBM Messtechnik GmbH was used.</p></sec></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464420711421269">Table 2</xref> presents the average surface roughness (<italic>r<sub>a</sub></italic>) of each of the steel samples tested. The P60 was the roughest sample, presenting a roughness of 1.44 µm, while the P600 sample presented an average roughness of 0.205 µm. It may also be seen that the roughness values for the P600 and P240 finishes are quite similar, but it should be remembered that <italic>r<sub>a</sub></italic> is simply the arithmetic mean value of the asperity height and depth about a centre line and while it is a useful indication of the surface finish, it cannot capture the true nature of the surface topography: two samples may have the same <italic>r<sub>a</sub></italic> value, but their surface profiles may actually be quite different [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464420711421269">17</xref></bold>].

<p>The growth of the scale was visually inspected by examining the photographs of the samples at various exposure times. These can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1464420711421269">Fig. 3</xref>, which presents the degree of scaling for the various samples over the testing period shown. After 1-day exposure to the liquor, there are some differences between the samples. The roughest sample, P60, has a light scale and this scaling is less on the P120 sample. Very little scaling is observed on the P240 and P600 samples. Hence, it is clear, even at these early exposure times, that the rougher samples promote scale formation. After 2 days, the samples are almost completely covered with a thin layer of scale. Some small areas clear of scale can be seen indicated by the reflection of the shiny steel surface through the more opaque scale. There are more of these reflective areas in the smoother sample (P600). It should be noted that scale may not be obvious after 2 days in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1464420711421269">Fig. 3</xref> and that the loss of reflectivity is due to oxidation or other effects. However, a scale is present in the less reflective areas and this may be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1464420711421269">Fig. 9</xref> when the electron microscopy data are presented. After 3 days of exposure, all the samples are fully scaled.

<p>Scale from a steel sample that had been exposed in the filtrate tank for 14 days was crushed and subjected to XRD analysis. The pattern matched that of gibbsite (JCPDS card no. 07-0324). The scale colour (brownish/red) indicated the presence of small amounts of iron in the sample and this was confirmed by EDX analysis.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1464420711421269">Figure 4</xref> presents the mass gain with exposure time for the steel samples of different roughness levels. The mass gain values are averages of four samples. There is an initial slow rate of scale growth for all samples consistent with an initial nucleation and growth of crystals. After approximately 1–2 days, the mass gain increases significantly as a solid layer of scale is formed. After 2–2.5 days, a linear increase in mass is observed with exposure time. This is indicative of scale-on-scale growth, i.e. a complete layer of gibbsite has covered the surface of the steel and the gibbsite crystals are free to grow at an equilibrium rate. It is clear from the figure that the smoother the sample, the longer it takes to form a layer of scale. The P600 has the lowest mass gain throughout the testing period and also has the smoothest surface. The roughest sample, P60, has the highest mass gain of the samples and is the quickest to scale. However, under normal plant operating conditions and maintenance schedules, this induction period (~1 day) is relatively short. Once a scale has fully formed, all the samples present almost the same rate of mass gain with time. The rate of scale growth was calculated from the slopes of the linear regions of these mass gain plots and was found to be 22.63 mm/year.
<fig id="fig4-1464420711421269" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Mass gain with time in the filtrate tank for the indicated steel samples</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711421269-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1464420711421269">Figure 5</xref> presents the scale nucleation time for each of the steel samples. This was calculated by extrapolating the linear part of the mass gain plot for each sample. The point at which this line intersected the time-axis was taken to be the scale induction time. A clear relationship exists between scale induction time and the surface roughness. The surface of the roughest sample took approximately 0.8 days to become covered, while the smoothest samples require almost 1.6 days.
<fig id="fig5-1464420711421269" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Scale nucleation time for the indicated steel samples exposed to the Bayer liquor in the filtrate tank</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711421269-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It is worth reflecting that while the scale nucleation time (0.8–1.6 days) is short relative to normal plant maintenance procedures (which would be in the order of several months), these data were obtained from a tank with a high degree of supersaturation. For heterogeneous nucleation from solution, the rate of nucleation <italic>J</italic> has been related to the supersaturation <italic>S</italic> by an Arrhenius equation of the form</p>

It may be seen, then, that as the degree of supersaturation decreases, the rate of nucleation will decrease exponentially also. This would consequently lead to an increase in the induction time.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1464420711421269">Figure 6</xref> shows typical SEM images of samples that have been exposed to the filtrate tank liquor for 1 day. Gibbsite crystals can be clearly observed on all samples, and the number of these crystals decreases with surface smoothness. For example, the smoothest sample, P600, clearly shows a lower population of crystals than the P60 and P120 samples. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1464420711421269">Figure 7</xref> shows that there is a clear relationship between surface roughness and object count, or number of crystals per unit area, as determined using image analysis. This confirms that an increase in the surface roughness of a sample results in an increase in the nucleation rate of crystals on the surface. A gibbsite crystal can thus nucleate more easily on a rougher sample.

<p>The size of the crystals found on samples after 1 day exposure vary from 5 to 40 µm and are generally smaller on the smoother samples. However, it should be noted that there are also some large crystals present: this is indicative of the fact that while nucleation is more difficult, once a viable crystal has formed then it can grow without difficulty. There is also a tendency of preferred crystal nucleation along scratches on the surface. This is more clearly observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1464420711421269">Fig. 8(a)</xref>, which presents the P600 sample after 1-day exposure at relatively low magnification. This image shows several straight lines of crystals and more magnified view of one of these lines is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1464420711421269">Fig. 8(b)</xref>. These gibbsite crystals clearly have grown to form a tightly packed arrangement indicating crystal growth once nucleation has commenced. Formation of these oriented clusters due to secondary nucleation is highly unlikely as this is not an orientation-specific phenomenon in supersaturated gibbsite liquors. Furthermore, sequential secondary nucleation would be unlikely to proceed in exactly the same orientation as the observed surface scratches or yield crystals that had all grown to be roughly equal in size as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1464420711421269">Fig. 8(b)</xref>.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1464420711421269">Figure 9</xref> shows typical SEM images of the different scaled steel samples that have been exposed to the filtrate tank liquor for 2 days. All samples are relatively similar, showing a dense gibbsite scale with crystals ranging from 40 to 100 µm in diameter. The size of the crystals has increased in comparison to the scale observed after 1-day exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1464420711421269">Fig. 6</xref>), indicating that as scale-on-scale growth proceeds, some crystals are lost by impingement leaving fewer larger crystals whose main growth direction is normal to the surface.</p>
<p>Samples of steel were prepared to a very high surface finish using a 1-µm diamond suspension on a polishing wheel resulting in a surface finish of <italic>r<sub>a</sub></italic> = 0.01 µm. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1464420711421269">Figure 10</xref> shows an optical image of a P600 and the polished steel sample after 2-day exposure in the filtrate tank liquor. Both samples possess a uniform layer of scale indicating that polishing the samples to 0.01 µm does not have significant effect on the scale initiation time. This would indicate that there are two or more effects influencing the initiation time. One of these is surface roughness and the second could be surface specific interactions, for example surface energy, which would be a common property of all the samples analysed and related to the chemical properties of the steel. Indeed for calcium sulphate deposition from aqueous solutions, it is reported that low surface energy materials such polycarbonate results in less scaling than stainless steel surfaces under similar conditions [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464420711421269">19</xref></bold>].

<p>For the polished samples, the scale detached very easily from the surface of the sample once removed from the testing system, indicating a very weak adhesion. Of course, this result will primarily be of academic value as it would be impractical in the extreme to use and maintain such surface finish in an operating alumina refinery.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1464420711421269">Figure 11</xref> presents the SEM images of the scaling observed on the polished sample after 2-day exposure in the liquor of the filtrate tank. A dense scale is observed with crystals sizes ranging from 40 to 80 µm. The scaling characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1464420711421269">Fig. 11(a)</xref>) are similar to those observed for the P60, P120, P240, and P600 samples after 2-day exposure. As mentioned above, a feature of the scale on the polished sample was the ease of scale detachment and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1464420711421269">Fig. 11(b)</xref> shows an image of where the steel surface is exposed following scale detachment (after the sample was removed from the liquor).

Only very small traces of the gibbsite particles (&lt;3 µm) remain following scale detachment.

<p>The adhesion strength of the scale to the surface of the various steel samples was measured and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1464420711421269">Fig. 12</xref> shows the delamination stress (or adhesion strength) for a variety of samples. These samples were all exposed to liquor in the decanter tank. The conditions in this tank are slightly different to those experienced in the filtrate tank, but scale build-up characteristics were similar once scale-on-scale growth had initiated. It was not possible to measure the adhesion strength of the scale to the polished sample since the scale detached too easily from the sample.
<fig id="fig12-1464420711421269" position="float"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption><p>Adhesion strength of the given samples after 21-day exposure in the decanter tank.

<p>The adhesion strengths of the scale to samples of steel are also compared to polymer-based samples under the same exposure conditions. The polymer samples in this test were used as received and presented different surface roughnesses as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1464420711421269">Fig. 12</xref>. There is a relationship between the roughness of the steel samples and the scale adhesion strength with rougher samples producing a scale which strongly adheres to the surface. There is a significant fall in scale adhesion strength as surface roughness decreased to 0.68 µm. The adhesion strength of the scale to polymer samples was low and resembled that of the smoothest steel sample tested. This suggests that the use of polymers as anti-scaling materials in applications such as this would be attractive as there would be a greater likelihood that the scale would shed at regular intervals by detaching under its own weight. Providing that this detachment would not cause blockages, it may mean that pipes, tanks, and storage vessels would not have to be taken off-line as regularly for dangerous and costly removal of large volumes of scale.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1464420711421269" sec-type="conclusion"><title>4 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>Under the conditions found in the filtrate tank, it is clear there is rapid gibbsite scale growth on the surface of the steel samples. The scale growth rate was found to be an average of 22.63 mm/year or 52 kg/m<sup>2</sup> of surface per year. The roughness of the steel samples influenced the scale nucleation time and the strength of adhesion. The smoother the sample the longer it took to form a complete layer of scale and the less the adhesion strength. Once a complete layer of scale had formed, then the rate of scale growth was similar for all samples. The sizes of the gibbsite crystals increased with scaling time. At low exposure time (1-day exposure), gibbsite crystals &lt;10 µm were observed particularly on the smoother sample (P600). Common nucleation sites for these crystals were along scratches on the surface. With time the general apparent surface diameters of these crystals increased significantly with time growing up to 100 µm after 2-day exposure.</p></sec>
