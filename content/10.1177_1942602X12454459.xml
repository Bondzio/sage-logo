<abstract>
<p>Suicide is a major public health problem. Nationally, suicide is the third leading cause of death for adolescents. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to initiate and evaluate a gatekeeper suicide-prevention program within a local school system targeting faculty and staff without a medical or psychology background who interact regularly with middle- and high-school students. Following the implementation of this program, evaluation of increased knowledge related to adolescent suicide prevention was completed. All participants completed a pretest and posttest, and results indicate that the staff members’ knowledge about identification of risk factors, behavioral responses to suicidal students, and knowledge of community resources were increased. This project highlights the need for planned and sustainable education and training for faculty and school staff who regularly interact with adolescents. Additionally, the importance of continued monitoring, training, and advocating for suicide prevention programming is noted.</p>

<p>Adolescent suicide prevention within the school setting presents  many challenges and opportunities for intervention by school nurses. Many students perceive the school environment as a safe and stable area with multiple support systems. It is within this safe and stable environment that school nurses and school staff members have a substantial amount of interaction with students and are able to develop meaningful, significant relationships with them. These relationships offer a window of opportunity for staff to identify and intervene with students who have significant health issues, including suicide.</p>
<p>A variety of faculty and staff without a medical or psychology background come into contact with suicidal students in the school setting. These staff members have regular interactions with students and many know the students well, and these relationships enable them to note or observe changes in student behavior. These frontline staff members are natural gatekeepers for mental health problems in the community and could serve a vital role in the recognition of suicidal behaviors, provision of initial support, and facilitation of access to the appropriate health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942602X12454459">Cross, Matthieu, Cerel, &amp; Knox, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942602X12454459">Isaac et al., 2009</xref>). Suicide in a school community is tremendously devastating, often unexpected, and leaves the school and surrounding community with much confusion and many questions. Most people are uncomfortable with the topic of death by suicide, and too often victims are blamed and their families and friends are left stigmatized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942602X12454459">Quinnett, 2009</xref>). As a result, many people within the school environment do not communicate openly about suicide. Thus, an important public health problem is left shrouded in secrecy, which limits the potential opportunities to address and prevent future deaths by suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942602X12454459">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Suicide is a major public health problem and has the potential to be prevented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1942602X12454459">National Institute of Mental Health, 2010</xref>). In 2009, suicide accounted for more than 36,000 deaths in the United States, making it the tenth leading cause of death for all ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942602X12454459">Kochanek, Xu, Murphy, Miniño, &amp; Kung, 2011</xref>). Suicide is a growing public health concern and one of the most common causes of death among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1942602X12454459">Whetstone, Morrissey, &amp; Cummings, 2007</xref>). It is the third leading cause of death for people ages 15 to 24, surpassed only by homicide and accidents, and results in approximately 4,500 lives lost each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942602X12454459">CDC, 2010</xref>). Among young people 15 to 24 years old, for every death by suicide the rate of suicide attempts is estimated to be from one hundred to two hundred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942602X12454459">Quinett, 2009</xref>). Nationally, in 2009, 13.8% of high school students reported that they had seriously contemplated attempting suicide during the previous year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942602X12454459">CDC, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The U.S. Surgeon General has introduced a blueprint for addressing suicide and has called for national strategies to prevent suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1942602X12454459">U.S. Public Health Service, 2001</xref>). One important aspect of these strategies includes addressing the problem of undetected risk factors as a method to intervene with and prevent deaths by suicide. The Surgeon General emphasizes that these strategies should be used to implement programs that are best suited for individual communities.</p>
<p>The problem of suicide cannot be adequately understood without the realization that suicide is generally associated with other risk factors including biopsychosocial, environmental, and sociocultural factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942602X12454459">American Association of Suicidology, 2008</xref>). The French social scientist Emile Durkheim developed a method of study that became the foundation for scientific research about suicide. Durkheim based his conclusions on commonalities among people known to have died by suicide and sociological characteristics among these population groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1942602X12454459">World Health Organization [WHO], 2010</xref>). Comparing groups with high rates of suicide with those experiencing low rates of suicide became the process by which risk and protective factors for suicide have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1942602X12454459">WHO, 2010</xref>). A risk factor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1942602X12454459">Table 1</xref>) may be an indicator of an individual at greater risk of attempting or completing death by suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1942602X12454459">Waldvogel, Rueter, &amp; Oberg, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>Additional risk factors for adolescents include academic difficulties, significant conflict with the adolescent’s parent or caretaker, gay or bisexual orientation, relational or romantic difficulties, severe anger or agitation, and a history of suicidal ideation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942602X12454459">Joe, Canetto, &amp; Romer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942602X12454459">Shropshire &amp; Thornton, 2011</xref>). Each additional risk factor makes it more likely that an adolescent may attempt or complete death by suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1942602X12454459">Waldvogel et al., 2008</xref>). The understanding and use of these identified risk factors provides the basis for identification and referral of potentially suicidal students.</p>
<p>Adolescent suicide prevention within the setting of the school environment may be conceptualized using a population-focused public health approach. This framework, initially used by Florence Nightingale, incorporates both research and the role of the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942602X12454459">Polit &amp; Beck, 2008</xref>). Nightingale identified factors that promoted physical and emotional well-being and used this analysis to effect changes in nursing care and in public health. School nurses are in a prime position to implement population-focused health care in providing care to potentially suicidal students.</p>
<sec id="section1-1942602X12454459">
<title>Suicide Prevention Strategies</title>
<p>The majority of suicide prevention strategies are aimed at either reducing risk factors for suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942602X12454459">Ali, Dwyer, &amp; Rizzo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1942602X12454459">Peña, Matthieu, Zayas, Masyn, &amp; Caine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1942602X12454459">Lubin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942602X12454459">Thompson, Kuruwita, &amp; Foster, 2009</xref>) or screening and case finding potential suicidal people for referral and treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942602X12454459">Isaac et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942602X12454459">Shropshire &amp; Thornton, 2011</xref>). Public awareness and education programs are a popular and widely used public health intervention to reduce death by suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942602X12454459">Inman, van Bakergem, LaRosa, &amp; Garr, 2011</xref>). Currently, there are specific education strategies that are aimed at adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942602X12454459">Inman et al., 2011</xref>) and school-based programs that support positive aspects of educational interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942602X12454459">Brown &amp; Grumet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1942602X12454459">Freedenthal, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942602X12454459">Inman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942602X12454459">Klimes-Dougan, Yuan, Lee, &amp; Houri, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1942602X12454459">Stein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1942602X12454459">Swartz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1942602X12454459">Wyman et al., 2010</xref>) but these programs are not evidence-based or have not been found to prevent suicidal behavior. While curriculum-based programs increased knowledge related to mental illness and suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942602X12454459">Klimes-Dougan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942602X12454459">Sawyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1942602X12454459">Walker, Ashby, Hoskins, &amp; Greene, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1942602X12454459">Wyman et al., 2010</xref>), there is insufficient evidence that this increase in knowledge translates to prevention of death by suicide or results in referrals for appropriate intervention and care.</p>
<p>The <italic>Question Persuade Refer (QPR) Gatekeeper Program</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1942602X12454459">Quinnett, 2007</xref>) is identified through the <italic>Best Practices Registry</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1942602X12454459">Suicide Prevention Resource Center, 2011</xref>) as a program that is believed to be effective but has not undergone rigorous evaluation. One study evaluated the effectiveness of implementing the <italic>QPR Program</italic> in a school setting and found that participants gained knowledge related to suicide prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1942602X12454459">Tompkins, Witt, &amp; Abraibesh, 2010</xref>). In another study specific to the <italic>QPR Program</italic> within a population of a secondary school staff, <italic>QPR</italic> was found to be very successful and participants reported that they were more prepared to identify potential suicidal students and reported a greater understanding of services available to students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1942602X12454459">Wyman et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The goal of this quality improvement project was to implement and evaluate the <italic>QPR Suicide Prevention Program</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1942602X12454459">Quinnett, 2007</xref>) in a suburban school district in the Midwest with approximately 3,000 students and 400 staff members. The student population includes over 50% low-income, single-parent households and greater than 40% Hispanic and Black youth.</p>
<p>After training to become a certified QPR instructor, the school nurse supervisor provided an overview of the <italic>QPR Program</italic> and a plan for staff development implementation and evaluation to the school administration and the school board members. Next, the nurse supervisor conducted three 90-minute teaching sessions to the school staff within the district’s middle school and high school. All high-school and middle-school staff members were invited to participate in the program, including administrators, teachers, educational paraprofessionals, transportation staff, custodial staff, and food service staff. The staff members were informed of the program through e-mail postings and fliers in high-traffic staff areas. Participation in the program was voluntary; if the staff members participated in the program, they were allowed to participate during their normal work hours or were compensated at their normal hourly wage if the program was outside of their normal work hours.</p>
<p>The in-service consisted of providing the <italic>QPR Gatekeeper Suicide Prevention Program</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1942602X12454459">Quinnett, 2007</xref>) to staff and providing additional support after the teaching in the form of an online conference work group via the school district’s informational technology system. The core QPR training content included basic information about suicide, a review of evidence-based suicide warning signs, and information on how to work with potentially suicidal students. Following the presentations, time was allotted for participants to role-play potential situations and to ask questions. Role-plays included scenarios pertaining to asking the suicide question, persuading the suicidal student to accept help, and making referrals to the school counselor. A QPR take-home booklet and a youth suicide prevention wallet card was provided to all participants. The QPR booklet contained the basic information on suicide prevention, a summary of the key points, and national resource information on suicide prevention. The youth suicide prevention wallet card provided suicide prevention information and local resource information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1942602X12454459" sec-type="results">
<title>Data Analysis and Results</title>
<p>A total of 36 staff members representing 18% of the middle-school and high-school staff were trained. The method of evaluation of knowledge gained was a 9-question pretest and posttest. A paired test (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test) was run using the data from the pretest and posttest. For all questions, results were significant at .05 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1942602X12454459">Table 2</xref>). All 9 posttest questions showed a significantly higher mean than that of the pretest questions, indicating an increase in knowledge about suicide. To determine if use of the QPR intervention had occurred, a monthly e-mail questionnaire was distributed for a 3-month time period following the training. The e-mail included questions about contact with potentially suicidal students and additional information about preventing suicide. The e-mail questionnaire response identified that one staff member implemented the QPR protocol using the question, persuasion, and referral technique in managing a potentially suicidal student. The remaining 35 staff members had not implemented the <italic>QPR Program</italic> due to the belief that they had not encountered a student whom they believed was suicidal. There were no identified suicide attempts in these schools during this timeframe.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This quality improvement program demonstrated that the <italic>QPR Training Program</italic> increased knowledge related to adolescent suicide prevention for school personnel. Additionally, within a 3-month time period following the training, one staff member reported using the QPR response with a suicidal student. These results are consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1942602X12454459">Tompkins et al. (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1942602X12454459">Wyman et al. (2008)</xref>. With continued interactions between staff and students, additional use of the QPR response by school staff would be anticipated. In addition, the need for continued periodic evaluation would need to be completed to determine if staff retained knowledge related to adolescent suicide prevention.</p>
<p>Because most school personnel do not receive training regarding mental health issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1942602X12454459">Walter, Gouze, &amp; Lim, 2006</xref>) or identifying and responding to students with these issues, including suicide should be a training priority for school district staff. School nurses are in a prime position to articulate this need and coordinate this training for their school communities. Continued training may be a challenge for local school districts to sustain; however, the benefit of intervening and responding cannot be understated and every front-line staff member should know how to intervene with this potentially lifesaving response. Additionally, staff members need to be supported by school boards and policy makers. This support would include the time to participate in suicide prevention training. School nurses should work to develop relationships with school district administrators and school board members to be in a position to advocate for suicide prevention programming. Finally, more research needs to be done on prevention strategies for adolescent suicide and the role that school staff members could take in identifying and referring at-risk students—and ultimately preventing suicide. ■</p>
