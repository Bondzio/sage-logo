<p>Married men and women (<italic>N</italic> = 1,899 couples) reported readiness to eat a healthier diet, lose weight, and get more exercise (stage of change) and indicated whether they were confident to make these changes (self-efficacy). Husbands’ and wives’ reports of readiness to change each health behavior were positively associated. Furthermore, women who indicated readiness to eat a healthier diet and get more exercise (contemplation or preparation stages) were less likely to endorse confidence to change when their husbands were in a lower stage than they were relative to those whose husbands shared the same stage of change. Similarly, men who indicated readiness to lose weight were less likely to endorse being confident in their ability to lose weight when their wives were in a lower stage than they were relative to those who shared the same stage. Consideration of interpersonal factors in the behavior change process may enhance behavioral interventions that include married partners together rather than either individual alone.</p>

<body>
<p>Lifestyle choices including diet habits and physical activity are widely recognized as daily behaviors that promote health and reduce risk for chronic illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. When individuals’ lifestyle behaviors place their health in jeopardy, adoption of healthful behaviors and avoidance of risk behaviors frequently are recommended to prevent the onset of disease or to manage existing conditions. Although behavior change generally is conceptualized as an individual process, health-related decisions, including maintaining and modifying health behaviors, often are made with consideration of, or in collaboration with, others who share our lives and lifestyles (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111402824">Lewis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111402824">Meyler, Stimpson, &amp; Peek, 2007</xref>). In our dyadic investigation of health behavior change, we examined husbands’ and wives’ readiness to adopt healthful behaviors (i.e., healthy diet, exercise, and losing weight). Our primary aim in this study was to determine the extent to which each partner’s confidence that she or he can make a desired health behavior change (self-efficacy) was associated not only with her or his own readiness to change but also with the readiness of her or his spouse to make a change in the same behavior.</p>
<sec id="section1-1090198111402824">
<title>Health Behaviors of Married Partners</title>
<p>A large body of evidence supports a health advantage of marriage whereby married individuals live healthier, longer lives than do those who are not married (see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198111402824">Kiecolt-Glaser &amp; Newton, 2001</xref>). One explanation for the health advantage associated with marriage is that married men and women engage in health-promoting behaviors and avoid health risk behaviors more often than do their unmarried counterparts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198111402824">Umberson, 1992</xref>). Notably, married partners’ reports of their individual health behaviors consistently are similar to one another, and detected similarity in spouses’ behaviors has been demonstrated across a variety of health lifestyle behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111402824">Meyler et al., 2007</xref>), including exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111402824">Wilson, 2002</xref>), smoking behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111402824">Hippisley-Cox, Coupland, Pringle, Crown, &amp; Hammersley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111402824">Wilson, 2002</xref>), alcohol use (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111402824">Graham &amp; Braun, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111402824">Stimpson, Masel, Rudkin, &amp; Peek, 2006</xref>), caffeine consumption (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111402824">Graham &amp; Braun, 1999</xref>), and healthy and unhealthy eating habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111402824">Brummett, Siegler, Day, &amp; Costa, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111402824">Homish &amp; Leonard, 2008</xref>). In addition, correspondence in body mass also has been found between married partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111402824">Hippisley-Cox et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111402824">Stimpson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111402824">Wilson, 2002</xref>) and is posited to represent similarities in their dietary preferences and consumption.</p>
<p>The similarity of partners’ health behaviors has been attributed to assortative mating, to their shared environment, and to convergence in their health behaviors over the course of their lives together (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111402824">Lewis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111402824">Meyler et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with these explanations, a change in one partner’s health behavior (e.g., smoking, drinking) often corresponds with a change in the health behavior of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111402824">Falba &amp; Sindelar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198111402824">Franks, Pienta, &amp; Wray, 2002</xref>). Likewise, when one spouse becomes obese, the likelihood of the other becoming obese is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198111402824">Christakis &amp; Fowler, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the detected similarity in health behaviors and correspondence in behavior changes of married partners, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111402824">Lewis et al. (2006)</xref> posit that changes in individual health behaviors are, in part, the result of interpersonal health-promoting processes within marriage (e.g., communication and decision making). To the extent that married partners hold similar attitudes about living a healthy lifestyle and make health-related decisions together, it is reasonable to expect that one partner’s plans to adopt a given lifestyle behavior may coincide with the other’s plans for a corresponding behavior change. Consistent with this dyadic approach to health behavior change, we conceptualized similarity in partners’ readiness to change a health behavior as an interpersonal factor in the behavior change process for each partner and examined the interplay of this similarity in readiness to change behavior with each partner’s confidence in their ability to achieve a desired behavior change (i.e., self-efficacy).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1090198111402824">
<title>Self-Efficacy and Partners’ Health Behavior Change</title>
<p>Adopting healthful lifestyle behaviors often is conceptualized as a staged process, and five distinctive stages of change are core components of the transtheoretical model (TTM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111402824">Prochaska et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111402824">Prochaska, Wright, &amp; Velicer, 2008</xref>). According to the TTM, individuals’ readiness to change a health behavior can range from being unaware or unwilling to change a given behavior (precontemplation stage) to adopting and maintaining a change in that behavior (maintenance stage). Additionally, individuals’ readiness to change is characterized as reflecting the contemplation stage when they are considering adopting a healthful behavior (or ceasing an unhealthy one) within the next 6 months and as the preparation stage when they are planning to change their behavior in the next 30 days. Newly adopted behaviors, begun within the past 6 months, are representative of the action stage of behavior change.</p>
<p>Individuals’ initiation of a behavior change is closely tied to their perceptions of self-efficacy to carry out the desired behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198111402824">Baldwin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111402824">Bandura, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198111402824">Findorff, Stock, Gross, &amp; Wyman, 2007</xref>). Self-efficacy is a central tenet of social cognitive theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111402824">Bandura, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111402824">2004</xref>) and also is a core construct in TTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111402824">Prochaska et al., 2008</xref>). Self-efficacy consistently is higher among individuals identified in later stages of behavior change than among those in earlier stages of behavior change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198111402824">Findorff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111402824">Prochaska, Velicer, Guadagnoli, Rossi, &amp; DiClemente, 1991</xref>). Most simply, an abundant research literature has established that those with high efficacy perceptions for a given behavior persevere longer and use more strategies to obtain their goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111402824">Bandura, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111402824">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111402824">DeVellis &amp; DeVellis, 2001</xref>). Those who lack confidence in their ability to enact a health behavior are more easily deterred by obstacles and setbacks relative to those who possess such confidence.</p>
<p>In the context of marriage, perceptions of efficacy to change a given health behavior may be associated not only with one’s own readiness to adopt a healthful behavior but may also be associated with a partner’s readiness to make the same change. Through shared communication about strategies and plans for enacting their decisions to engage in healthful behaviors, married partners may gain confidence in their own ability to make desired changes in their lifestyle when initiating changes together with their partner (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111402824">Lewis et al., 2006</xref>). Conversely, confidence in one’s ability to make a desired change in health behavior may be curtailed when one partner attempts to alter established habits and routines in the household without the cooperation of the other.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1090198111402824">
<title>Study Aims and Hypotheses</title>
<p>The aims of our investigation were twofold. We first explored similarity in readiness to adopt health behaviors between married partners. We further examined whether correspondence in partners’ readiness to change a given health behavior was associated with each partner’s confidence in their ability to make that change. Importantly, the necessity of examining readiness to change health behaviors from the perspective of both marital partners is easily apparent. Reliance on either individual’s perspective alone limits the understanding of correspondence in spouses’ readiness to adopt healthful behaviors and the association with partners’ confidence in their ability to enact desired health behaviors.</p>
<p>We explored similarity in married partners’ stage of health behavior change for each of three health-promoting behaviors: eating a healthy diet, losing weight, and getting more exercise. Based on a dyadic framework emphasizing interpersonal health-promoting processes within marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111402824">Lewis et al., 2006</xref>), we contend that similarity in health behaviors of married partners occurs, in part, through partners’ correspondence in planning changes to their health behaviors (i.e., shared environment and convergence in their health behavior). Thus, we hypothesized that married partners commonly would occupy the same stage of change (readiness) for each of these health behaviors.</p>
<p>Among those participants who reported that they planned to make a behavior change (those in the contemplation or preparation stage of change), we investigated the association of each partner’s own stage of change and her or his spouse being in a higher or lower stage of change (vs. being in the same stage) with confidence in the ability to enact a desired behavior change (i.e., self-efficacy). We explored self-efficacy to make a desired change in each of the targeted health behaviors separately for married men and women. We expected that self-efficacy to modify a given lifestyle behavior would be greater among individuals in a later stage of change (i.e., preparation vs. contemplation). In addition, we expected that partners’ self-efficacy to engage in a given health-promoting behavior would be lower when their spouses were in a lower or a higher stage of behavior change compared with those whose spouses were in the same stage of behavior change.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>Data for this investigation were taken from a wellness data repository including a health questionnaire completed by participants. Participants were provided a monetary incentive for voluntary completion of this questionnaire. Participants’ age was calculated from self-reports of date of birth. Participants’ employment status was determined from a single item (“Which one category best describes your job function? Mark only one”). Participants who endorsed homemaker, student, or retired were coded as not employed, and those who endorsed any other category (e.g., clerical/office) were coded as employed. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from participants’ height (in feet and inches) and weight (in pounds). Participants’ height and weight were measured by trained health care professionals, and these measurements were provided to participants to enter into the self-administered health questionnaire.</p>
<sec id="section7-1090198111402824">
<title>Health behaviors</title>
<p>Participants reported their current patterns of health-promoting behaviors. <italic>Diet</italic> choices were assessed with three items: Servings of fruits and vegetables (including juices) each were assessed as “About how many <italic>servings</italic> of each of the following types of food do you eat in a <italic>normal day</italic>?” Response options ranged from “0” (<italic>less than 1 serving</italic>) to “6” (<italic>6 or more servings</italic>). A serving size chart was provided as a reference. Participants also endorsed whether “avoided fried and high-fat foods, including high-fat snacks” was true of their “eating or nutritional habits.” <italic>Physical activity</italic> was assessed with two items on a scale ranging from “1” day to “7” days:</p>
<list id="list1-1090198111402824" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>“How many days per week do you get a total of 30 minutes or more of <italic>moderate-intensity</italic> physical activity? Combine the time you spend on all activities during the day?” Examples include walking, dancing, mowing, slow cycling, softball, or golf.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“How many days per week do you participate in 20 minutes or more of <italic>vigorous</italic> exercise?” Examples include brisk walking, running, fast cycling, swimming, or aerobics.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1090198111402824">
<title>Stage of behavior change</title>
<p>Stage of change was assessed separately for each of three behaviors: eat a healthier diet, lose weight, and get more exercise. For each behavior, respondents indicated whether they had “no plans to make this change,” “plan to start in next 6 months,” “plan to start in next 30 days,” “started doing it in last 6 months,” or “made this change over 6 months ago.” These response options correspond with the TTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111402824">Prochaska et al., 1994</xref>) stages of precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance, respectively.</p>
<p>Participants were instructed to select the first response option representing no plan to change if they “have never needed to make the change” for a given behavior. For greater conceptual consistency with TTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111402824">Prochaska et al., 1994</xref>), however, we recoded participants’ stage of change from “no plan to make this change” (precontemplation stage) to “made this change over 6 months ago” (maintenance stage) if they endorsed currently engaging in the given behavior. We recognize that some participants may have been engaging in a given behavior for less than 6 months and, thus, may have been misclassified as being in the maintenance stage rather than the action stage for that behavior. Data on duration of engagement in health behaviors were not available to aid in distinguishing between the action and maintenance stages of behavior change.</p>
<p>Specifically, in regard to their plans to eat a healthier diet, participants who endorsed no plans to change were recoded to “made this change” if they reported that they ate five or more servings of fruits and vegetables (combined) or that they avoided fried and high-fat foods (15% of husbands and 12% of wives). Likewise, for getting more exercise, participants’ responses were recoded to “made this change” if they indicated that they either engaged in 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise 6 or 7 days a week or they engaged in 20 minutes of vigorous exercise 3 or more days a week (9% of husbands and 5% of wives). For losing weight, participants’ responses were recoded if their BMI was less than 25 (15% of husbands and 15% of wives).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1090198111402824">
<title>Self-efficacy</title>
<p>Self-efficacy also was assessed separately for each health behavior. Participants indicated which health behavior changes they were “very confident” they could make from a list of health behaviors including the following: eat a healthier diet, lose weight, and get more exercise. For each behavior indicated, participants’ responses were coded as very confident they could make the given change, and for each behavior not indicated, participants’ responses were coded as not very confident they could make the given change.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1090198111402824">
<title>Analysis Plan</title>
<p>To address our first hypothesis that partners commonly report being in the same stage of change for each of these health behaviors, we computed intraclass correlations to address our expectations of association. Next, we used logistic regression analyses to address our main study hypotheses that, among those planning to make a change in each health behavior, their own stage of change for a given behavior and the stage of change reported by the spouse for the same behavior would be associated with their self-efficacy to make a change in that health behavior. In each logistic regression analysis, the dichotomous indicator of confidence to engage in a given behavior (self-efficacy) was regressed on participants’ own stage of change (contemplation vs. preparation) and on a trichotomous variable representing their spouses’ stage of change relative to their own (spouse was in a higher stage or a lower stage with spouse in the same stage as the reference category). Separate logistic regression analyses were conducted for married women and men and for each of the three health behaviors. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.1 software.</p>

<p>Looking first at partners’ reports of stage of behavior change (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090198111402824">Table 2</xref>), roughly one half of the married men and women reported being in action stages of change (action or maintenance) for each of the health-promoting behaviors (eat a healthier diet, get more exercise, and lose weight). Turning next to correspondence in partners’ reports of stage of change, one third or more of the couples comprised husbands and wives who shared the same stage of change for each behavior. Specifically, 40% of husbands and wives were in the same stage of change for eating a healthier diet and 34% were in the same stage of change for both getting more exercise and losing weight. Furthermore, stage of change reported by husbands was similar to that reported by their wives for each of the three health behaviors (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = .29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 for eating a healthier diet; ICC = .12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 for losing weight; and ICC = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 for getting more exercise). These ICCs indicate that husbands’ and wives’ stage of change were more similar to one another than to other men and women in the sample for each behavior. Additional analyses (not shown) explored whether partners’ similarity in readiness to change these health behaviors differed by age or work status. Our findings of similarity in partners’ readiness to change each health behavior largely were consistent across three age groups (couples where wives were 34 years and younger, 35-49 years, and 50 years and older) and two categories of employment status (both partners currently employed vs. one or both partners not employed).</p>

<title>Stage of Change and Self-Efficacy for Behavior Change</title>
<p>We then examined the association of each partner’s own stage of change and that of their spouses with individual self-efficacy to change each health behavior among married men and women planning to make a behavior change (those in the contemplation or preparation stages). Analyses were conducted separately for married men and for married women who were in the contemplation and preparation stages of change (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090198111402824">Table 3</xref>). Additional analyses included age of men and women, respectively, as a covariate in each model. Including this covariate did not substantially change the pattern of significance of associations and, thus, models including age are not reported.</p>

<p>For all three health behaviors, married men and women who were in the contemplation stage were less likely to endorse being very confident that they could modify their health behavior than were those who were in the preparation stage. Next, we examined the association of spouses’ stage of change (relative to own stage of change) with each behavior, controlling for partners’ own stage of change for each behavior. Among married men planning to eat a healthier diet, being in a higher or lower stage of change than their wives for this behavior (relative to being in the same stage) was not associated with their self-efficacy to change their diet behavior (controlling for their own stage of change). Likewise, being in a higher or lower stage of change than their wives (relative to being in the same stage) was not associated with men’s confidence that they could make a desired change to exercise more. For plans to lose weight, however, men were less likely to endorse confidence that they could make this change when they were in a higher stage than their wives (relative to men whose wives were in the same stage; odds ratio [OR] = 0.49).</p>
<p>For married women, their self-efficacy to make a behavior change was associated with their husbands’ stage of change (relative to their own stage of change) for two of the three health behaviors. Women whose husbands were in a lower stage than themselves were less likely to endorse being very confident that they could eat a healthier diet (OR = 0.63) and get more exercise (OR = 0.64) relative to women whose husbands were in the same stage as themselves. For these health behaviors, husbands being in a higher stage (relative to being in the same stage) was not associated with women’s self-efficacy to make a behavior change. Furthermore, no association between women’s self-efficacy and husband’s stage of change was detected for women’s confidence that they could lose weight.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Readiness to change health behaviors was found to be similar between husbands and wives for each of the three health behaviors investigated in this study, that is, eat a healthier diet, get more exercise, and lose weight. Moreover, married partners’ similarity in their readiness to change these health behaviors was linked to a key mechanism in the process of behavior change, self-efficacy. After controlling for own readiness to change a given health behavior, similarity with partners’ readiness to change that behavior was associated with self-efficacy for two health behaviors among married women and one health behavior among married men.</p>
<p>Our findings indicate that married partners are similar in their readiness to eat a healthier diet, get more exercise, and lose weight as we anticipated. Notably, the detected similarity in partners’ stage of behavior change included more than one third of couples where partners were in the exact same stage of change. The detection of similarity in married partners’ stage of behavior change is consistent with an amassing body of evidence, indicating correspondence in married partners’ engagement in health-promoting and health risk behaviors (see reviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111402824">Di Castelnuovo, Quacquaruccio, Benedetta Donati, de Gaetano, &amp; Iacoviello, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111402824">Meyler et al., 2007</xref>). Our findings also are consistent with a recent longitudinal study of older, married partners that demonstrated association of one partner’s health behavior change with a related change by the other partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111402824">Falba &amp; Sindelar, 2008</xref>). In our search of the literature, however, we could find no other published studies describing spouses’ similarity in readiness to initiate health behavior changes. Thus, our findings contribute to further understanding of correspondence in married partners’ engagement in health behaviors by revealing that some married partners appear to strive to make changes in their lifestyles that are beneficial to their physical health and well-being in tandem, thereby emphasizing the relevance of the social environment in the process of initiating individual health behavior change.</p>
<sec id="section14-1090198111402824">
<title>Partners’ Stage of Change and Self-Efficacy</title>
<p>We explored a key determinant in the process of behavior change, individual perceptions of self-efficacy to make a desired behavior change (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111402824">Bandura, 2004</xref>). Consistent with prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198111402824">Findorff et al., 2007</xref>), individuals with more proximate plans to adopt health behaviors (i.e., those in the preparation stage of change) reported greater self-efficacy to engage in desired health behaviors than did those whose plans for a desired change were more distant (i.e., those in the contemplation stage of change). This finding held for both men and women and was detected across all three health behaviors.</p>
<p>Our findings extend earlier work by revealing that, after controlling for own stage of health behavior change, perceptions of self-efficacy to engage in a desired health behavior was associated with the relative stage of behavior change of the other partner (higher than own stage, lower than own stage, or same as own stage of change). To be more specific, perceptions of efficacy often were greater among those whose spouse was equally as ready to change a given behavior compared with those whose spouse had less immediate or no plans to change his or her health behavior. Contrary to our expectation, however, perceptions of self-efficacy were not greater among men and women in the same stage of health behavior change with their partner when compared with those whose spouse was in a higher stage of behavior change.</p>
<p>Similarity of husbands and wives in their readiness to change health behaviors may facilitate each partner’s self-efficacy to make changes through supportive marital interactions. For instance, spouses may be more effective in communicating health-related support to one another when they are jointly pursuing healthful lifestyle changes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111402824">Hong et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, spouses who are similar to one another in their desire to engage in health-promoting behaviors may create an environment in which cues to health behaviors are increased such as through making healthy foods more available in the home and being more thoughtful about setting aside time for physical activity. Similarly, these marital interactions and behavioral cues may facilitate behavior change of one partner when the other already has adopted a healthful behavior (partner in higher stage than own stage). Conversely, discontinuity in partners’ plans to make health behavior changes (spouse in lower stage than own stage) may limit frequency and effectiveness of health-related support exchanges and reduce the likelihood that cues to health-promoting behaviors will be increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111402824">Lewis et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>It merits mention that the expected association of partners’ stage of behavior change with individuals’ perceptions of self-efficacy was found for two health behaviors, namely, eat a healthier diet and get more exercise (and this association approached significance for the third behavior, lose weight) among married women. The expected association of self-efficacy with partners’ stage of change was detected for only one health behavior (lose weight) among married men, however. Because women more often assume the role of gatekeeper for their families’ health, married women may be more aware of the discordance in their own and their spouses’ plans to adopt new, health behaviors, and the potential barriers to their own behavior change as a consequence of this discordance, than are married men. In this way, married women may have greater confidence in their ability to carry out a desired behavior change when their husbands are making similar plans for behavior change than when their husbands report more distal or no plans to change their health behavior. Other studies have found no gender difference in the detected association of one spouse’s positive behavior change on the other’s behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111402824">Falba &amp; Sindelar, 2008</xref>) or have found wives’ characteristics (e.g., personality) to be associated with husbands’ healthful diet choices more so than husbands’ characteristics were associated with wives’ healthful diet choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111402824">Brummett et al., 2008</xref>). Clearly, additional work is needed to clarify the respective roles of husbands and wives in influencing one another’s plans for engaging in health-promoting behaviors.</p>

<sec id="section15-1090198111402824">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Our study examined the relationships between husbands’ and wives’ readiness to change specific health risk behaviors and their confidence in their ability to do so. The cross-sectional nature of our study limits our work, however, in that it is not possible to determine the process through which some married partners came to share the same stage of change in adopting health-promoting behaviors. We cannot know who began to make a behavior change first or whether the behavior change was a joint decision at the outset. Moreover, we were not able to address whether desired behavior change takes place. Furthermore, although our findings reveal an association of partners’ similarity in stage of change with their individual perceptions of self-efficacy to make a desired behavior change as we anticipated, it is not possible to know the true causal direction of this association. Additional research is warranted to uncover how married partners’ communicate their readiness to adopt healthful lifestyle behaviors with one another and, importantly, whether they carry out their intentions to do so.</p>
<p>Notably, our sample of married men and women had slightly higher rates of obesity (BMI ≥ 30; 33.4% for men and 30.9% for women) than rates reported in the United States (26.4% for men and 24.8% for women) and in the Midwest region (27.6% for men and 25.3% for women; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111402824">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008</xref>). Thus, our sample may include more husbands and wives who indicate their readiness to change their health behaviors (eat a healthier diet, get more exercise, and lose weight) than would a sample that is more representative of national or regional rates of obesity. Nonetheless, it is important to investigate health behavior change among these individuals who may be at risk for health burdens associated with obesity.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications</title>
<p>Shared lifestyle behaviors of married partners, including diet and exercise, are posited to contribute to a robust association in their health status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111402824">Wilson, 2002</xref>) and to influence detected shared disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111402824">Hippisley-Cox et al., 2002</xref>). As such, it is important to identify the mechanisms that underlie this correspondence in health behaviors of married partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111402824">Lewis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111402824">Meyler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111402824">Rohrbaugh, Shoham, Butler, Hasler, &amp; Berman, 2009</xref>). Our findings underscore emerging conceptualizations of health behavior change as an interpersonal, dyadic process within marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111402824">Lewis et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings suggest the potential utility of incorporating interpersonal factors into behavior change interventions. Most notably, correspondence in married partners’ readiness to change health behaviors was associated with greater confidence in each partner’s ability to do so, an established correlate of perseverance in sustaining desired behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111402824">Bandura, 2004</xref>). Thus, consideration of the health behaviors of both married partners has the potential to inform disease-prevention interventions, which generally pay limited attention to social and contextual factors that facilitate or impede behavior change. Specifically, research and practice interventions that recognize and maximize the role of the social environment in the adoption and maintenance of health behaviors may be more effective than those that focus solely on individuals alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111402824">Falba &amp; Sindelar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111402824">Homish &amp; Leonard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111402824">Markey, Markey, &amp; Birch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111402824">Rohrbaugh et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
