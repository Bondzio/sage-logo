<abstract>
<p>Piracy in the coastal waters of Somalia has received significant attention from the news media and international political community, both of which have been major actors in defining the issue of piracy in and around the waters of Somalia. Drawing on the thematic frames of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811432812">Cohen (1972)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811432812">Goode and Ben-Yehuda (1994)</xref>, this work provides an analysis of the media and political depictions and international responses to Somali piracy, to evaluate if the phenomenon is reflective of normal societal concern or constitutes a case of ‘moral panic’. The results indicate that the media presentation and the international political community’s discourse on piracy in the Somali coastal waters have led to increased levels of fear and panic and over-reaction, resulting in an excess of militarized response to piracy. This then has negated attention being paid to the underlying causes of Somali piracy; the extant structural conditions in Somalia that have continued to facilitate increased instances of piracy. The findings suggest that a moral panic failed to materialize with the general public, rather, the reaction of the international political community, the international shipping industry, and the media’s actions correspond with the theoretical perspective of agenda-setting.</p>

<p>The problem of piracy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0004865811432812">1</xref></sup> is not a new one; rather it has plagued the world’s seas for almost 2000 years, dating back to the Greeks and Romans. Historically, many states have been involved in acts of piracy, with the period 1620–1720 being coined the golden era of piracy. Both European states and the US have authorized the looting and pillaging of enemy ships in return for a share in the profits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004865811432812">Chambliss, 1989</xref>). However, the signing of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0004865811432812">Declaration of Paris (1856)</xref> brought the era of state sanctioned piracy to an end. Yet, this did not end piracy. A quick perusing of current media headlines confirms that it has not disappeared from social and political discourse.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular romanticized Hollywood depictions of pirates as loveable rogues (e.g. Captain Jack Sparrow of the blockbuster film <italic>Pirates of the Caribbean</italic>), Somali pirates are portrayed as dangerous actors, armed with weapons, ready to commit violent acts against unsuspecting seafarers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0004865811432812">Rice, 2008</xref>). Somali pirates have been termed ‘guerrillas and gangsters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811432812">Watson, 1992</xref>: A3), ‘gruesome characters, using high speed boats, AK-47s and rocket launchers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0004865811432812">O’Sullivan, 1999</xref>: 3), and are said to be linked to ‘Islamic terrorist’ organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004865811432812">Ali and Murad, 2009</xref>). Additionally, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004865811432812">Ali and Murad (2009)</xref>, in a 2008 BBC news report, Somali pirates are accused of forming an ‘unholy high seas alliance’ with Islamist insurgents. With such political discourse and media depictions of piracy, one is left to wonder whether such characterizations and definitions of the problem of piracy is reflective of normal societal concern, or a case of moral panic.</p>
<p>Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811432812">Cohen’s (1972)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811432812">Goode and Ben-Yehuda’s (1994)</xref> models of moral panic, an assessment of the media presentations of Somali piracy as well as the international discourse on the issue of piracy will be used to test whether <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811432812">Goode and Ben-Yehuda’s (1994)</xref> criteria for moral panic are met, or whether this can be better explained by the agenda-setting perspective. Adopting the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0004865811432812">Rothe and Muzzatti (2011)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811432812">Cohen’s (1972)</xref> criteria will be coupled with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811432812">Goode and Ben-Yehuda’s (1994)</xref> to test whether coverage of piracy off the coast of Somalia constitutes a moral panic, or is better explained by the agenda-setting perspective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0004865811432812"><title>Moral panic</title>
<p>The term moral panic originated with Jock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0004865811432812">Young’s (1971)</xref> work that addressed the public condemnation of a ‘hippie commune’ involved in drug abuse. Young revealed that the moral panic that ensued was not about the drug use, but instead was about the drug users whose ‘hippie culture’ and pleasure seeking values were in direct opposition with larger societal values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0004865811432812">Young, 2009</xref>: 5). Young asserted that the media acts as both condemner and amplifier of the problem, providing consensual social imagery of the problem, further amplifying the deviance. This then leads to heightened fear, and increased pressure on public agents of social control to counter the problem by exercising greater controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0004865811432812">Young, 2009</xref>). This process can escalate to moral panic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811432812">Cohen (1972)</xref> furthers this model of moral panic by providing a more comprehensive definition, as well as systematically outlining the actors involved in creating them. A moral panic occurs when:
<disp-quote>
<p>A condition, episode, person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values or interests; its nature is presented in a stylized and stereotypical fashion by the mass media; the moral barricades are manned by editors, bishops, politicians or right-thinking people … Sometimes the subject of the panic is quite novel and at other times it is something which has been in existence long enough, but suddenly appears in the limelight. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811432812">Cohen, 1972</xref>: 9)</p></disp-quote>The public reaction to the media depictions of certain phenomena can influence the enactment and enforcement of social policy, law, and social perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811432812">Cohen, 1972</xref>). In fact, objectivity is significantly outweighed by the threat presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865811432812">Bonn, 2010</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811432812">Cohen’s (1972)</xref> original formulation of moral panic, five sets of actors are needed: (1) folk devils; (2) rule enforcers; (3) the media; (4) politicians; and (5) the public. The person or people responsible for the deviance or criminal acts are called folk devils. These individuals become the embodiment of ‘visible reminders of what we should not be’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811432812">Cohen, 1972</xref>: 10) as they take on representations of evil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0004865811432812">Rothe and Muzzatti, 2004</xref>). Rule enforcers are an essential component of a moral panic. The societal expectation of rule enforcers calls for action to curtail the problem. This occurs through the process of identifying the folk devils, apprehending them, and punishing them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811432812">Cohen, 1972</xref>). The agencies frame the issue as one that is infringing on the social order, placing themselves in the role of protector of society, and preventing the breakdown of society into chaos, anarchy, and mayhem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0004865811432812">Rothe and Muzzatti, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The media are also responsible for generating moral panic as the media publicizes the concerns of particular interest groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811432812">Cohen, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0004865811432812">Jenkins, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0004865811432812">Rothe and Muzzatti, 2004</xref>). In fact, the media are considered influential, if not <italic>the</italic> most influential, generators of moral panic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811432812">Goode and Ben-Yehuda, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865811432812">Bonn, 2010</xref>). Journalistic hyperbole therefore increases public anxiety and concern.</p>
<p>Politicians are also vital to a moral panic. As actors that operate in the court of public opinion, especially as elected officials, politicians align themselves with those that enforce rules to protect the public against the threat posed by folk devils to social order and morality. Politicians respond by taking the moral high ground, adopting reactionary, no-nonsense, punitive policies to counter the perceived threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811432812">Cohen, 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0004865811432812">2002</xref>). By framing an issue in a certain manner, politicians are able to provide a social construction of reality greatly influencing the public’s understanding of the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865811432812">Bonn, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, and more importantly, the public reaction to the efforts of the media, politicians, and rule enforcers, determines whether a moral panic occurs. Support for the rule enforcers is garnered from the public through the generation of fear, which is instilled in the public by disproportionate presentations of the problem which compounds contempt and hostility towards the folk devils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0004865811432812">Welch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865811432812">Bonn 2010</xref>). There is a dissemination through the media of the politician’s socially constructed perception that a real threat to society exists, as well as the belief that future harm is both imminent and great (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0004865811432812">Rothe and Muzzatti, 2011</xref>). The public are then dependent on the politicians for direction as to the next and most appropriate cause of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0004865811432812">Rothe and Muzzatti, 2004</xref>). Politicians and individuals in power positions can then provide the outlet for public concern generated through the moral panic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811432812">Goode and Ben-Yehuda, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865811432812">Bonn, 2010</xref>). Beyond the actors involved in a moral panic, further research has focused on other defining elements of a moral panic.</p>
<p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811432812">Goode and Ben-Yehuda (1994)</xref> assert that media campaigns are used to reinforce stereotypes, and perpetuate existing divisions, both societal and global, while simultaneously inciting fear. This is a feat not readily accomplished; rather it is dependent on the presence of certain criteria. First, there must be a focus on a certain behavior, either real or imagined, committed by a particular group. This group are transformed into ‘folk devils’ by the media, and are ‘stripped of all favorable characteristics and imparted with exclusively negative ones’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811432812">Goode and Ben-Yehuda, 1994</xref>: 28). These negative characteristics become defining, and are repeatedly disseminated to the public through the vehicles of enhanced media coverage generating heightened public concern. Media representations of the <italic>folk devils</italic> and their behavior, increases the already present societal concern for crime and deviance. As societal concern for deviant and criminal behavior is arguably always present in society at some level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0004865811432812">Rothe and Muzzatti, 2011</xref>), the public are increasingly dismayed by the injurious impact of the group and their behaviors, and become increasingly intolerant of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811432812">Goode and Ben-Yehuda, 1994</xref>). Secondly, there is a disparity between the actual threat (i.e. the likelihood of harm occurring) that the behavior of the group poses, and the perceived threat resulting from the presentation by the mass media. Lastly, the level of concern is not stable, rather it fluctuates over time. In many instances, the process begins with a behavior being noticed and framed as a threat. This leads to a rapid escalation in public concern for the problem, and in many instances this concern abruptly subsides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865811432812">Bonn, 2010</xref>). What is often of significance is that the increased concern over the problem (real or perceived) leads to the enactment of highly punitive legislation, which is often unnecessary, and serves to justify the agendas of individuals in positions of power and authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0004865811432812">Simon and Feeley, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811432812">Goode and Ben-Yehuda (1994)</xref> also provide a differentiation between moral panic and normal societal concern.</p>
<p>The difference between moral panic and normal societal concern has been assessed using five criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811432812">Goode and Ben-Yehuda, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0004865811432812">Cohen, 2002</xref>). These criteria include: (1) heightened concern (not fear) over the perceived threat; (2) hostility characterized as moral outrage towards the <italic>folk devils</italic> who commit the act and the responsible agencies; (3) a societal consensus (not necessarily total agreement) over the threat being real and serious; (4) the threat must be resolved disproportionately with regards to the reaction to the problem (this includes an overreaction to the potential risk if ignored, and the level of moral offensiveness); and (5) volatility which makes reference to the sudden eruption of a moral panic followed by its dissipation. General societal concern, not necessarily fear, can constitute moral panic. This concern is indicative of the social issue being perceived by the society as a problem. The hostility criteria references increased intolerance towards a particular group of individuals, coupled with disdain and contempt for those actors deemed responsible. Consensus is a considerably widespread belief in this intolerance by societal members. This consensus should be generally shared among those in positions of power and influence, including the media. There must also be a disproportionate reaction to the frequency, and severity of the problem. This can be characterized as an over-reaction based on the belief that the issue places society under threat of imminent harm. Lastly, volatility refers to the fleeting nature of moral panics, as they materialize quickly, before vanishing in a similar vein. This lack of permanence screens the social, cultural, historical, and extant structural conditions that intersect with the complex power relations that underlie moral panic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0004865811432812">Rothe and Muzzatti, 2011</xref>). For a moral panic to occur, all of the above stages have to be completed.</p>
<p>Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811432812">Cohen (1972)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811432812">Goode and Ben-Yehuda (1994)</xref>, the concept of moral panic has been applied to a broad array of phenomena, including but not limited to, youth gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0004865811432812">Zatz, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0004865811432812">McCorkle and Miethe, 1998</xref>), child abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004865811432812">Best, 1994</xref>), flag burning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0004865811432812">Welch, 2000</xref>), group sexual violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0004865811432812">Welch et al., 2002</xref>), terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0004865811432812">Rothe and Muzzatti, 2004</xref>), white collar criminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0004865811432812">Levi, 2009</xref>), single mothers on welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865811432812">Ajzenstadt, 2009</xref>), and swine flu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0004865811432812">Rothe and Muzzatti, 2011</xref>). These works emphasize the utility of applying the framework of moral panics to understanding the contextual social reactions to certain events and happenings, perceived or real (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0004865811432812">Levi, 2009</xref>). In other words, they examine whether a specific ‘issue’ constitutes a ‘real’ threat or is a moral panic: an exaggerated political and public response to a distorted societal threat posed by alleged dangerous or threatening individuals or groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865811432812">Bonn, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0004865811432812"><title>The agenda-setting perspective</title>
<p>Also of importance to understanding the influence of media on public opinion, is the agenda-setting perspective. The agenda-setting hypothesis asserts that the media has the ability to establish issues of importance for the public, a process termed <italic>transfer of salience</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0004865811432812">McCombs and Shaw, 1972</xref>). Through focusing coverage on one issue and neglecting to cover other issues, the media sets the agenda for public discourse. This has been termed first-level agenda-setting. It has also been asserted that attributes assigned to individuals and issues are translated to the public and consequently become the central aspects of public perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0004865811432812">Wanta et al., 2004</xref>). This is referred to as the second-level agenda-setting hypothesis, which is closely linked to the processes of <italic>framing.</italic> Framing is the process of the media presenting an issue to the public in a certain way. This involves focusing on certain aspects of the issue, while neglecting or ignoring other aspects, giving the issue a particular slant or meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0004865811432812">Tuchman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865811432812">Altheide, 1997</xref>). The media therefore, does not provide an objective depiction of the issue, but rather a subjective and contested representation of the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0004865811432812">Entman, 1993</xref>). By focusing on a particular issue, the media increases its importance in the public discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0004865811432812">Lowery and DeFleur, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865811432812">Altheide, 1997</xref>). Both framing and agenda setting are related to, and factors of, the actors involved in creating or sustaining a moral panic: namely the media and political discourse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0004865811432812"><title>Present study</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0004865811432812">Rothe and Muzzatti (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0004865811432812">2011</xref>) did in their analyses of the swine flu pandemic and the ‘war on terror’ immediately following September 11, 2001, this study adopts both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811432812">Cohen’s (1972)</xref> criteria for actors and situations, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811432812">Goode and Ben-Yehuda’s (1994)</xref> criteria for establishing whether the media reporting on the piracy in the coastal waters of Somalia does constitute a moral panic or whether it is better explained by the agenda-setting perspective. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811432812">Goode and Ben-Yehuda’s (1994)</xref> criteria is applied to establish whether the case of Somali piracy constitutes a moral panic. This analysis will be a test of the moral panic criteria; whether the media, reinforced by the international shipping industry and then subsequently by the international political community, created a heightened level of public fear to legitimize the overly militarized response to piracy off the coast of Somalia. The media will be examined to determine whether they portray acts of piracy, as well as pirates, <italic>as folk devils</italic>, heightening the public fear and concern that serve to justify disproportionate responses to the problem, based on the shipping industry and international political communities’ need and desire to protect global shipping routes and trade at the expense of addressing the underlying conditions within Somalia, that, I suggest, facilitate the ongoing cases of piracy (e.g. illegal fishing of the Somali waters).</p>

<sec id="sec5-0004865811432812" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>Data came from the Lexis-Nexis Academic databases. Lexis-Nexis Academic provides access to full text news sources from around the world. This includes some of the world’s major newspapers, magazines, and trade publications. There were 399 world newspapers, 247 different newsletters, 10 trade and industry publications, and 10 news magazines included in the search. Only those publications that were available in English were used for analysis. Publications came from, but were not limited to, the following countries; UK, the US, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Russia, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Canada, South Africa, and China. Search terms were truncated and entered into the search engine with the word Somalia. The two search terms were pirate*, and terrorism*.</p>
<p>Both headlines and stories specifically covering the issue of Somali piracy were included in the analysis. As the focus of the analysis was to determine whether the media reinforced the political agenda of the shipping community and the international political community, op-ed pieces, commentaries, and letters to the editors were not included in the analysis. The headlines, bylines and content of the articles were read and included in the results if the issue of Somali piracy was discussed, provided the article contained more than a brief mention of the issue, i.e. Somalia is a hotspot for piracy. There were some instances where media articles shared the same title but had different content, and some shared the same content but had different titles. The latter were excluded from the analysis so as not to duplicate numbers and create an illusion of disproportionate coverage if one story was picked up from a news service and repeated in other news outlets. The former were included as they represented distinct articles. The timeframe 1992–2010 was chosen as there were very few media reports of piracy prior to 1992, with no media reports for piracy for the years 1990, 1991, and 1989. It was therefore, decided that 1992 would serve as a good starting point. In addition, 1992 marks the year in which Somalia entered a nearly two-decade-long economic and political struggle where the country was without a fully functioning government. The year 2010 was limited to the first five months as further news articles were not yet available.</p>
<p>During the coding and subsequent analysis process themes and frames began to emerge. Early on in this process, it became apparent that despite variations in the content of the articles, there were dominant frames that were used repeatedly. The framing of the media articles centered around one dominant theme. Although there were subthemes, they were not replicated as often and varied considerably; therefore just the most dominant themes were carried over into the analysis. The content analysis resulted in a total of 2752 articles, which were grouped according to five dominant themes. These themes comprised, firstly, of media articles that framed the discussion of piracy around an individual instance of piracy, where the perpetrators were depicted as rogue actors, or groups (n = 379). This thematic category was termed <italic>individual actors</italic>. Media articles that focused on the threat to global trade that Somali piracy posed, fell in the category <italic>threat to trade</italic> (n = 1285). Articles that focused on the need for, call for, or commented on, a militarized response to piracy were categorized under the heading <italic>militarized issue</italic> (n = 829). Articles where piracy was framed as terrorism fell in a category labeled <italic>terrorism</italic> (n = 82). The last category that emerged was the framing of Somali piracy as being a symptom of the structural conditions in Somalia. This category was labeled <italic>structural</italic> (n = 177)<italic>.</italic> When articles included more than one theme, the article was coded based on the dominant theme. This was determined by the overall content of the article, taking into consideration the focus of the article, the amount of space dedicated to the theme, and how this related to the other themes. For example, if the media article focused on the rise in piracy attacks on trade vessels, but then in the concluding paragraph called for a military response to curtail the problem, then the dominant theme would be threat to trade. It was a rare occurrence for two frames to be equally addressed in the media article, with only nine articles falling into this category. As this category was so small, these articles were omitted from the analysis.</p>
<p>This research also included collecting primary and secondary data sources to inform the overall analysis in regards to the underlying and historical conditions within Somalia. This was collected from several international organizations, including the United Nations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, as well as data from the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), and interviews contained in other scholarly work. Secondary data included interviews that were collected and reprinted by the BBC, the IMB and IMO, and other scholarly and media outlets. All secondary sources were triangulated to serve as verification of accuracy.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0004865811432812"><title>Findings</title>
<p>Rather than providing a detailed summary of the statistics for each year, which are set out clearly in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0004865811432812">Table 1</xref>, the following discussion will focus on the most noteworthy findings. The data indicate that from 1992 to 1999 the coverage of the issue of Somali piracy was relatively minimal. The majority of the articles for these years were framed using two of the dominant themes: piracy as a threat to trade, and as the product of individual rogue actors. In 1999 there was a spike in coverage, with 86 newspaper articles covering Somali piracy. Of the 86 newspaper articles, the majority of the coverage framed the issue as a product of individual actors, with 65 articles framing the issue in this manner (75.6%).

<p>Examining the data up until this point, of the 198 articles covering the issue of piracy in Somalia from 1992 through 1999, 54 percent (n = 107) framed the issue as the product of individual actors, 18.7 percent (n = 37) as a threat to global trade, 6.6 percent (n = 13) as a military issue, 1 percent (n = 2) as terrorism, and 2.5 percent (n = 5) as a symptom of the structural conditions in Somalia. The data indicate that in the early 1990s piracy was not a major story, in fact in 1992 there were as few as five news reports focusing on acts of piracy in the coastal waters of Somalia. The years from 1993 to 1998 showed little increase in coverage. Small spikes in coverage, such as those that happened in 1995 and 1999, can be attributed to individual incidences that had wide and repeated coverage. For example, in 1995, there were 38 media reports of piracy off the coast of Somalia, a small peak in coverage. This can be attributed to the attempted hijacking of the <italic>Longo Barda</italic>, a British-Canadian yacht which was subsequently saved by a Canadian warship that scared the pirates into abandoning the attack. This was the focus in 16 (42.1%) of the 38 articles providing coverage of this attack. In addition, the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) reported an increase in the number of attacks that year, jumping from one attack in 1994 to 14 attacks in 1995. The IMB, a nonprofit organization established in 1981 by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), provides for the exchange of information for maritime crime in an effort to provide information to combat crime and fraud at sea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865811432812">IMB, 2005</xref>). The services provided by the IMB include a reporting system for maritime robbery and hijackings, as well as the provision of annual reports of the number of piracy incidents reported to them by the shipping community. The IMB warning system identifies regions that are prone to piracy attacks, and notifies vessels which are traveling in the vicinity of the area when they should avoid approaching the coastline.</p>
<p>In addition, there was another peak in coverage in 2000 where there were 34 media reports of piracy incidences in Somalia, with 73.5 percent of the articles focusing on individual actors. This can be attributed to the alleged killing of British national Alan McLean whose disappearance from his yacht was attributed to his murder by Somali pirates. The data suggest that prior to 2000 much of the media coverage framed the issue of Somali piracy as the product of acts perpetrated by individual actors such as small groups of rogue, dangerous individuals.</p>
<p>From 2001 until 2003 there was not any substantial change in the number of articles dedicated to the issue of piracy in Somalia, in fact, the number of articles closely represents the number of actual attacks reported to the IMB for the same years (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0004865811432812">Table 2</xref>). The majority of the articles during this time period framed the issue as one resulting from individual rogue actors. In 2004 there was an apparent increase in the number of articles covering the issue of Somali piracy, with a total of 37 articles. There was a shift in the framing of the issue, with much of the coverage from 2004 focusing on the issue as it related to a threat to global trade. For example, of the 37 articles covering piracy in 2004 the majority framed the issue as a threat to global trade (n = 20), and then as the product of the behavior of individual actors (n = 10). In 2005 there was another marked increase in newspaper coverage of the issue, with 230 articles covering the topic. Of these, 43 percent of the articles covered the threat that Somali piracy poses to trade, and 24.8 percent focused on individual actors. The increased coverage was maintained in 2006 and 2007 with the majority of articles framing the issue as a threat to global trade. There was a large increase in the number of article for 2008, with a total of 676 reporting on Somali piracy, and, of these, 52.8 percent framing piracy as a threat to global trade. This may be reflecting the actual increase in attacks that were reported to the IMB, with a total of 111 being recorded for 2008, more than double the number of attacks of the year before. In addition, there was considerable media coverage of two high-profile hijackings; the 15 November hijacking of the Saudi Arabian Tanker <italic>Sirius Star</italic>, and the Ukrainian ship <italic>Faina</italic>. The <italic>Sirius Star</italic> was carrying two million barrels of crude oil, and the Ukrainian ship had a cargo of weaponry including T-72 tanks and rifles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0004865811432812">Rice, 2008</xref>). In fact, of the 676 media articles covering Somali piracy in 2008, 46.9 percent (n = 317) made mention of the <italic>Sirius Star</italic>, and 32 percent (n = 216) made reference to the Ukranian vessel Faina. The cargo of both vessels plus the pirate’s demand for ‘$US25 million for the Saudi super-tanker’ (Somali pirates, 2008: 10) led to increased media attention.

<p>In 2009, there was a slight decline in the number of newspaper articles, with a total of 663 articles covering piracy in Somalia. Although, the amount of media coverage decreased slightly, the framing of the articles changed, with the largest single group of the media articles, 48.9 percent, being framed around the militarized response to piracy. This can be explained by the increased naval presence in the Gulf of Aden that occurred during the early months of 2009. In January 2009, <italic>The Korea Times</italic> reported that ‘currently around 20 warships from 14 different countries are patrolling the area and have foiled a string of pirate attacks in recent weeks, raising hopes that the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean shipping lanes can be made safer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004865811432812">Ha, 2009</xref>). Additionally, this change in framing could be compounded by the April 7 attack of the US vessel MV <italic>Maersk Alabama</italic>. The crew and the American captain were ‘held hostage in a pirate skiff for five days before Navy SEALs killed three of his four captors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0004865811432812">Martin, 2009</xref>) while rescuing the crew. The coverage of this particular attack, plus the military rescue of the ship’s crew explains the shift in coverage. The increased coverage was maintained during the first five months with the majority of articles again focusing on the threat to maritime trade.</p>
<p>The findings also indicate that although there were 177 media articles that framed the issue of piracy around the structural problems faced within the state of Somalia, this represented only 6.4 percent of the total coverage. When structural issues were mentioned there was considerable variation in focus. Some centered on ships providing food aid to the people in Somalia, for example in August 1992 the <italic>Toronto Star</italic> featured a story about food aid ships being attacked by pirates on their way to deliver food to refugee camps in Mogadishu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811432812">Watson, 1992</xref>). Additionally, other media coverage centered on poverty and conflict in Somalia, which leads to ‘no substantial government capacity and the result is that people are running roughshod, on and off the coast’ (Richard Bethell, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0004865811432812">Lacey, 2001</xref>: 2). Few articles provided coverage of the decades of conflict that has plagued the country and which can be traced back to colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0004865811432812">Rothe and Collins, 2011</xref>). Surprisingly there was little coverage of the substantial illegal foreign fishing off the Somali coast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004865811432812">Hari, 2009</xref>). In November 2008, an article in the <italic>Sydney Morning Herald</italic> surmised that ‘there are now warships from India, Malaysia, Britain, the US, France, Russia, Spain, and South Korea in the region shepherding merchant shipping and pursuing pirates, but largely ignoring the illegal foreign fishers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0004865811432812">Levett, 2008</xref>: 8). In comparison to the other themes that emerged, there was relatively little coverage of the structural and economic issues facing Somalia.</p>
<p>The beginning of the spike in media coverage began in 2004 and continued until the first half of 2010. To determine whether the marked increase is in fact a cause for concern, it is necessary to determine whether there was an actual increase in Somali piracy attacks. Although it is evident from the IMB reports that incidents did in fact increase (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0004865811432812">Table 2</xref>), with 101 reported attacks in 2008 and 196 in 2009, the amount of media coverage is disproportionately greater than the actual incident rates. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0004865811432812">Figure 1</xref> provides a direct comparison of the number of reported instances of piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia with the media reporting of the issue during the same time period. It becomes evident that the media coverage mirrors the number of attacks, as there is increased media attention when there are increased instances of piracy. Following 2004, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0004865811432812">Figure 1</xref> illustrates that there is a large increase in media coverage, again following the increase in actual piracy attacks, but the media attention is exaggerated. Therefore, although the amount of media coverage is consistent with the number of actual attacks, the coverage is inflated. Not only is there inflated coverage but there is a change in the dominant framing of the issue, moving from attributing acts of piracy to individual rogue actors prior to 2004, to afterwards framing it as a threat to trade. To establish whether a moral panic has truly been created, each stage of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811432812">Goode and Ben-Yehuda’s (1994)</xref> stages of a moral panic will be considered as they relate to the data.

</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0004865811432812"><title>Stage one of a moral panic: Piracy and pirates defined as a threat to values or interests</title>
<p>Media articles depicting the problem of piracy off the coast of Somalia have progressively increased from 1992 to 2010, with a total of five articles covering the topic in 1992, and 532 articles addressing the topic in the first five months of 2010 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0004865811432812">Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0004865811432812">Figure 1</xref> clearly shows a rise in media coverage of the issue of piracy. Additionally, media accounts began to increasingly present the issue of piracy as a threat to global shipping lanes by focusing on the increased number of attacks. This is evident in the headlines and bylines of media articles. For example, a February 1996 headline in the <italic>Hobart Mercury</italic> stated ‘Pirate attacks almost double’, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0004865811432812"><italic>New Straits Times</italic> in February 1997</xref> reported ‘Pirate attacks rose to record high last year’, an <italic>Africa News</italic> headline in June 1999 stated that ‘Somalia; Ransoms to Somalia militias increasing piracy, say sailors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0004865811432812">Mayoyo, 1999</xref>), and in February 1999, <italic>The New York Times</italic> reported ‘Murderous pirate attacks are on the rise’. The choice of language and intensification of the tone of reporting, depicting pirates as ‘murderous’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0004865811432812"><italic>The New York Times</italic>, 1999</xref>: 5), and ‘international terrorists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004865811432812">Darling, 2004: 13</xref>), also supports idea of the danger pirates pose to shipping routes. Despite the media depiction of pirates as murdering individuals threatening global shipping lanes, reports from the IMB indicate that there was little change in the number of people killed by pirates in Somali waters until 2008 and then the number increases to four victims (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0004865811432812">Table 3</xref>).

</table-wrap></p>
<p>Media articles addressing the issue also reported on the increasing pressure on the international community to address the issue. This is illustrated by the headlines ‘Plea for Somalia ship patrol’ and ‘Somali piracy triggers an international alert’ in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004865811432812"><italic>Africa News</italic> in May 1998</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0004865811432812">Redfern, 1998</xref>), and May 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0004865811432812">Redfern, 1999</xref>) respectively. This is reinforced by calls from the private shipping industry to the international political community to act to counter piracy.</p>
<p>In 1997, the International Shipping Federation (ISF) and the International Confederation of Free Trade urged the International Maritime Organization (IMO)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0004865811432812">2</xref></sup> to act to prevent further piracy attacks against merchant vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0004865811432812">International Shipping Federation/International Chamber of Shipping, 2004</xref>). In 1998 two influential lobbyist groups, the International Chamber of Shipping and the Seamen’s Church Group, called for UN action to address piracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0004865811432812">Rothe and Collins, 2011</xref>). They also called for the IMO to institute ‘new mechanisms to eradicate piracy, and for the issue to be kept prominently on the agenda of the United Nations’ (UN Secretary General Report to the General Assembly, 1998). In 1998, the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC), a technical committee of the IMO, in their 69th session, expressed concern over the increases in piracy and supported IMO plans to send expert missions to different countries to discuss the issue (MSC, 1998). In 1999, during several workshops and seminars sponsored by the IMO, participants strongly recommended that the IMO should create an international code for the investigation and prosecution of piracy. As a direct result, the MSC was assigned the task of preparing a preliminary instrument detailing procedure for investigating and prosecuting acts of piracy and armed robbery against ships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0004865811432812">MSC, 1999</xref>). This international code was approved and adopted by the IMO in November 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0004865811432812">MSC, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Further calls for action were advocated by NUMAST, (the National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers), representing 19,000 shipmasters, officers, and shipping industry staff. In 2000, NUMAST called for intervention from the British Royal Navy in the form of patrolling in waters where Somali piracy was prevalent (Lloyd’s List, 2000). In September 2001, the <italic>Africa News</italic> reported that ‘British shipping union NUMAST was calling for international action against piracy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004865811432812"><italic>Africa News</italic>, 2001</xref>). In fact, NUMAST, in 2004, presented a 24-page report at the IMB’s Security Conference in Malaysia, which stated ‘the absence of any concerted and coordinated international action to tackle the problem means that merchant shipping is becoming an increasingly attractive target not only to traditional “pirates” but also to terrorists’ (NUMAST, 2004: 2). By calling attention to piracy, the private shipping companies are providing primary definitions of piracy as being a serious threat. These primary definitions serve to protect the interests of the shipping companies by calling for action to protect their own interests; that of capital accumulation without the threat of robbery at sea. These definitions are then adopted and circulated by the media, creating a dominant framing of the issue and inflating the seriousness of the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0004865811432812">Welch et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Piracy also began to be more frequently linked to terrorism. Again, as a primary definer of the issue of piracy, in 1999 the IMO, in a recommendation to Governments for preventing piracy, indicated there was a need for a piracy incident command system that would include maritime security issues such as ‘smuggling, drug trafficking and terrorism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004865811432812">IMO, 1999</xref>). Further, the IMB annual report for 2002 urged the maritime community to take the issue of maritime terrorism seriously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004865811432812">IMB, 2002</xref>), and in 2003 Singapore’s Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng directly equated pirates to terrorists, saying ‘there should be no distinction between pirates operating for personal gain and terrorists with political motives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865811432812">IMB, 2003</xref>). In addition, further alarm was generated by the IMB in their issuance of warnings, beginning in 2004, to mariners to be cautious when traveling off the coast of Somalia. The IMB warning for Somalia stated that ‘ships passing Somali waters should remain at least 50 miles off the coast’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0004865811432812">IMB, 2004</xref>). The IMB have been reportedly actively monitoring the situation in Somalia since 2005. The IMB reports and the media coverage of the issue of piracy suggests that Somali pirates have been identified as folk devils, and identified by primary definers of the issue as posing a threat to innocent seafarers, as well as to global shipping routes, meeting stage one of the criteria for moral panic.</p>
<p>The continued depiction of pirates as folk devils continues into stage two of the moral panic criteria through the media and political actors’ reframing of the issue as a recognizable threat. This is established through the continued re-enforcement of pirates as ‘bad’ and ‘evil’, and threatening global trade interests. The shipping industry, by stressing the threat that piracy poses, as well as the danger, violence, and potential for death caused by piracy, are drawing attention to pirates’ actions, and making the threat of piracy more serious than it is for the purposes of protecting their own financial interests. This is demonstrated by <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0004865811432812">Table 3</xref>, which shows that the actual threat of violence to ships and crews has changed little, with the number of actual killings attributed to Somali pirates peaking in 2009, at four people. These early definitions then continue to dominate the social construction of the issue, and provide the terms of reference from which all future discussions of the issue of piracy are derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0004865811432812">Welch et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0004865811432812"><title>Stage two of a moral panic: Piracy is depicted as a recognizable threat by the media</title>
<p>The language adopted by the media to describe Somali pirates depicts them as a recognizable threat, and frames the issue in a similar manner as does the shipping industry. The pirates are portrayed as dangerous actors, as ‘guerillas and gangsters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0004865811432812">Watson, 1992</xref>: A3), ‘gunmen’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004865811432812"><italic>Africa News</italic>, 1998</xref>), and ‘the faces of world evil’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004865811432812">Gankin, 1996</xref>). In addition, despite the increased concern from the shipping industry, as seen, for example, in the warnings issued to seafarers by the IMB, NUMAST, and IMO, the focus of the media articles are the potential danger the pirates pose if they were to hijack dangerous cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0004865811432812">Wallen et al., 1995</xref>), the weaponry they use to take ships by force, such as machine guns and mortars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0004865811432812">Fairhill, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0004865811432812">McKinnon, 1995</xref>), as well as the deception they employ to get ships to comply with their demands, such as posing as members of the coastguard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0004865811432812">Saberi, 1995</xref>). The media focus is predominantly on the pirates themselves, as opposed to the individuals and shipping crews choosing to sail in waters that have been deemed dangerous by the IMB. When ships and vessels are discussed, they are done so in a manner that portrays their vulnerability. For example, in July 1995, <italic>The Business Times (Singapore)</italic> provided a discussion of the marked increase in acts of piracy in the coastal waters of Somalia, emphasizing that all types of vessels are vulnerable to such attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004865811432812">Elias, 1995</xref>). Additionally, when non-commercial vessels are attacked, there is considerable focus on the fear and victimization experienced by the crew as opposed to their disregard for the piracy warnings issued by the IMB. This is evident in the 1995 attack of the British yacht the <italic>Longo Barda</italic> that received considerable media coverage, with 16 of the 38 media articles dedicating some space to this particular incident. Many of these articles framed the account from the perspective of the victims, recounting their ordeal: ‘I was hiding in the watertight bulk head where there was little chance of them finding me’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0004865811432812">Woods, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the media framing of the issue of piracy as a terroristic act changes after September 11, 2001, with an increase in the framing of the issue as terrorism. Before September 11, 2001 there were 15 articles framing it in this manner and 814 articles in the years following the attack (2001–2010). This is also supported by the choice of wording used in the headlines and bylines. For example, the <italic>Independent</italic> in London reported in 2004 that ‘there is an emerging strain of terrorist piracy which desperately needs to be addressed. These people have replaced their cutlasses with Kalashnikovs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0004865811432812"><italic>The Independent</italic>, 2004: 24</xref>). In November 2003, a headline in the <italic>South China Morning Post</italic> read ‘Terrorism at sea poses new threat’, and in March 2003 the <italic>Africa News</italic> reported that 160 vessels had been investigated over their links to crime, in an effort to fight global terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865811432812"><italic>Africa News</italic>, 2003</xref>). In a similar vein, the 2005 failed hijacking of a luxury American cruiser was framed as being linked to al Qaida terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004865811432812">Doyle, 2005</xref>). Additionally, media coverage also introduced the possibility that terrorist cells could hijack vessels, turning ‘supertankers into floating bombs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0004865811432812"><italic>South China Morning Post</italic>, 2003</xref>: 12). This coincides with the shipping industry’s equating of piracy with terrorism, and the subsequent warning to the maritime community to take the issue of maritime terrorism seriously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004865811432812">IMB, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865811432812">2003</xref>). By perpetuating this message, the media framed the current policies in place to combat piracy as being inadequate. This is illustrated by a 2004 report in the <italic>Independent</italic> which asserted that ‘In the post-September 11 world, it is completely unacceptable that no real action is being taken against attacks that have the potential to cause massive loss of life and huge environmental damage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0004865811432812"><italic>The Independent</italic>, 2004</xref>: 27). The issue of piracy, therefore, becomes more often framed as being connected to terrorism both by the media and the shipping community, with pirates and incidences of piracy being portrayed as being linked to terroristic groups such as al Qaeda in Africa, South East Asia, and the Middle East (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004865811432812">Abhyankar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0004865811432812">Ong, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0004865811432812">Murphy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865811432812">Chalk, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Coupled with the media portrayals linking piracy to terrorism, following 2001 there was increased framing of the issue of piracy as a threat to global trade. The data indicate that prior to 2001 there were 42 articles framing the issue in this manner, and after 2001 there were 1241 articles framing it as a threat to global trade. Again, this is reflected in the choice of language included in many media headlines, and bylines, as well as in the content of the articles. For example, in Montreal in October 2005, <italic>The Gazette</italic> reported ‘Plagued by pirates, Somalia asks its neighbors for help: Plea follows latest hijacking of food aid ship; shipping lanes among world's most dangerous’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865811432812">Edwards, 2005</xref>: A21). Similar headlines appeared in <italic>The Washington Post</italic> in August 2005; ‘Somali pirates to free crew of hijacked tanker’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811432812">Cawthorne, 2005</xref>: A17), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0004865811432812"><italic>The Independent</italic> in March 2004</xref>; ‘Piracy poses threat to world trade as maritime attacks hit record levels’, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0004865811432812"><italic>The Daily Telegraph</italic> in Sydney Australia in August 2002</xref>; ‘Pirates hijack oil tanker’. Much of the story content also focused on the need to protect world trade from the threat of piracy, for example <italic>The Herald</italic> (Glasgow) in December 2001, reported that ‘shipping is wide open in terms of security’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0004865811432812">Tinning, 2001</xref>: 2), and many other articles focused on the worth of the various cargoes that were hijacked. In December 2001, <italic>The Herald</italic> (Glasgow) provided coverage of the hijacking of the MV <italic>Nisha</italic> carrying 26,000 tons of raw sugar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0004865811432812">Tinning, 2001</xref>: 2), the <italic>New Straits Times</italic> (Malaysia) reported on the hijacking of MV <italic>Panagia</italic> carrying a multimillion dollar cargo of fertilizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004865811432812">David, 2002</xref>: 15), and <italic>The Guardian</italic> (London) reported on the hijacking of a British oil tanker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0004865811432812">Morris, 2002</xref>: 9). The media framing of piracy therefore transitioned from focusing on individual actors to that of a threat to global trade and security.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0004865811432812"><title>Stage three of a moral panic: Increased concern leading to hostility</title>
<p>The data indicate that after 2001 there was an increased framing of the issue as needing a military response, with only 15 articles framing it in this manner before 2001, and 814 articles post-2001. For example, in 2008 over 50 percent of the articles framed the issue of piracy as a threat to global trade, and one-third focused on the need for a militarized response. In addition, this is further supported by the headlines, bylines, and content of these articles. The <italic>Australian Sunday Herald</italic> reported that ‘The Royal Navy has vowed to hunt and pursue gangs of pirates in Somalian waters who have brought terror to the area in the past nine months’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0004865811432812">Mackay, 2005</xref>: 1). There was also media coverage reinforcing the link between piracy and terrorism and calling for a militarized response. For example, in 2002 <italic>The Observer</italic> reported that ‘vessels passing close to, or docking within states suspected of containing al Qaeda cells, such as Indonesia and Somalia, will be offered military protection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0004865811432812">Townsend, 2002: 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0004865811432812">Table 2</xref> indicates that there were increased reports to the IMB of piracy in 2008, and 2009; this however, coincides with the increased attention on the issue by the international political community, and the sanctioning of state intervention for the purposes of protecting shipping lanes and consequently the interests of global trade – that of financial profit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0004865811432812">European Affairs, 2010</xref>). In 2008, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in their report to the Secretary-General called for the establishment of a maritime taskforce that would ‘be required to support the arms embargo, conduct anti-piracy operations and protect supply shipping’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0004865811432812">UNSC, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0004865811432812">2008d</xref>). This call for military response is justified based on the threat of violence posed by pirates to innocent seafarers, however, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0004865811432812">Table 3</xref> clearly illustrates that the level of violence used in piracy attacks and the number of ships fired on, did not increase until after the increased military presence in the Gulf of Aden. Therefore, it could be posited that the increased military response has been instrumental in increasing the number of violent exchanges between pirates and shipping vessels, rather than being there in response to an increased threat of violence.</p>
<p>The increase in incidences of piracy has also led to a hike in insurance premiums for shipping companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811432812">Costello, 2008</xref>). Both media and shipping companies frame the problem in a similar manner. A media article in <italic>The Times</italic> in 2005 reported that ‘Insurer Lloyd’s of London is changing shipping insurance policies due the increase in piracy off the coast of Somalia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0004865811432812">Seib, 2005</xref>: 61). The increase in piracy has led to growing costs associated with kidnappings and ransoms, with the average kidnapping settlement being $1 million (US) and negotiations lasting an average of 100 days. In fact, an article in <italic>The Sunday Times</italic> in September 2008 reported that ‘Insurance companies have increased premiums for sending a cargo shipment through the Gulf of Aden to about $9,000 from $900 a year ago’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811432812">Costello, 2008</xref>). In 2008, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) reported that there has been a ‘tenfold increase in insurance premiums for sending cargo shipments through the Gulf of Aden’. This gives the shipping industry further reason to promote the idea that piracy is a legitimate threat to global trade by promoting the dangerousness of pirates in the media.</p>
<p>The use of private security companies for the purpose of handling kidnapping ransoms has also become more common. These firms employ mostly ex-special forces to handle the financial transaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865811432812">Borger, 2008</xref>). Further, there were increased calls from the shipping community to implement effective prosecutions of pirates. In 2005, the IMB asserted that piracy attacks could be considerably reduced by the arrest and prosecution of individuals committing acts of piracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0004865811432812">Mukundan, 2005</xref>). In addition, IMB Director Captain Mukundan stated ‘It is vital that regions in Somalia such as Puntland continue to take firm action in investigating and prosecuting the pirates. This will be a far better deterrent against Somali pirates than prosecution and punishment in a foreign country’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004865811432812">ICC, 2009</xref>). Although many pirates have been captured, private shipping companies, the European Union, and NATO forces have lobbied for an appropriate venue to prosecute pirates. Suggested initiatives have included the strengthening of regional courts and jails that could then effectively try and punish pirates, something that some states are reluctant to do, such as Spain and the US, because of antiquated laws where piracy is punishable by death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0004865811432812">European Affairs, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The increased framing of the issue as requiring a military presence in the Gulf of Aden, as well as the call for more punitive policies, demonstrates the increased hostility towards Somali pirates as promoted by the shipping industry and disseminated by the media. However, the analysis has demonstrated that the increased hostility is not because of heightened public concern, but rather that the concern is focused in the shipping community. Although framing the issue as needing a militarized response for its resolution provides the basis for the next stage of moral panic – that of disproportionate responses to the problem, whether it is perceived or real – the previous criteria for a moral panic has not fully been demonstrated. The call for a militarized response provides an opportunity for the international community to step in and provide policies that protect their own interests – that of continued capital accumulation through global trade. This is achieved while simultaneously ignoring the structural issues in Somalia that have resulted because of centuries of conflict, leaving the country and its people with a lack of permanent governance, and basic infrastructure. All of which have been argued to be at the root of Somali piracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865811432812">Eichstaedt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0004865811432812">Rothe and Collins, 2011</xref>). Therefore, the media, by centering on certain aspects of the issue, while neglecting or ignoring other aspects, gives the issue a particular slant or meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0004865811432812">Tuchman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865811432812">Altheide, 1997</xref>). This is more consistent with the framing component of the agenda-setting perspective, than that of a moral panic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0004865811432812"><title>The ignored conditions</title>
<p>As this stage of the analysis, it should be noted that the underlying conditions that facilitate the instances of piracy have not only been ignored, but are a result of historical, political and economic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004865811432812">Ali and Murad, 2009</xref>). Although the internecine violence and the political instability can be traced back to colonial rule, the ongoing border wars with Ethiopia, as well as internal fighting between warring factions, has left the people of Somalia to deal with political oppression, unrest, and corruption. The ousting of then President Siad Barre in 1991 left the country with no central government, a condition that remains to this day. Despite efforts to unify the region, the poor living conditions of the Somali people remain unchanged, with high levels of poverty, disorder, violence, inequality, and corruption. The country lacks a basic infrastructure, with Somali people experiencing increased levels of despair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0004865811432812">Rothe and Collins, 2011</xref>). In addition, compounding the conditions within Somalia are the toxic dumping and foreign ships trawling the Somalia waters for fish that threaten the only source of livelihood available to many Somalis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865811432812">Eichstaedt, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0004865811432812"><title>Stage four of a moral panic: Response from rule enforcers: Disproportionate reaction</title>
<p>The increased media coverage, beginning in 2000, coincided with a change in the international discourse on the problem of piracy. In fact, piracy had received attention from the international political community<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0004865811432812">3</xref></sup> prior to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The goal of the international political community being to become more proactive and militaristic in response to piracy being a perceived threat to international global security. It was not until after 2001, however, that piracy became more strongly linked to terrorism. For example, in 2005, the UN Secretary General’s Report to the General Assembly equated piracy to a greater risk of terrorism (UN Secretary General Annual Report to the General Assembly, 2005: 28), and in 2006 the United Nations Security Council began passing resolutions related to the issue of Somali piracy. Resolution 1772, adopted in 2007, encouraged member states to take ‘appropriate action to protect merchant shipping’ (United Nations Security Council [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0004865811432812">UNSC], 2007</xref>), and in 2008, the UNSC adopted six Resolutions (1801, 1816, 1838, 1844, 1846, 1851) where piracy was said to be a threat to international peace and security. These resolutions gave UN forces unprecedented legal authority to pursue pirates. Interestingly, four of the UNSC resolutions (1801, 1816, 1838, 1846) acknowledge the IMO’s concern over the threat of piracy to global shipping. In addition, the 2008 UNSC report contains statistics on piracy prepared by the IMB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0004865811432812">UNSC, 2008b</xref>). Consequently, to combat piracy member states are encouraged to adopt a proactive response and ‘to take part actively in fighting piracy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0004865811432812">UNSC, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>This change in framing also included the IMB purposely monitoring the situation in Somalia since 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865811432812">IMB, 2005</xref>). This concern is evident in the large variety of security devices designed to deter piracy being recommended by the IMB as necessary measures to ensure both vessel and crew security. Until 2002 the IMB endorsed only ShipLoc, a satellite tracking device that not only tracks the position of the vessel, but provides an alert system if the ship is hijacked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0004865811432812">ShipLoc.com, 2010</xref>). In 2002, the range of security devices available and endorsed by the IMB increased. These devices include satellite tracking devices, electrifying fences that use 9000 volt electrical pulses to deter unauthorized boarding, and unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with cameras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865811432812">IMB, 2005</xref>). In addition, the use of private security and armed escorts became common practice for British shipping company NUMAST. Additionally, the International Transport Workers Federation and the IMB launched a campaign in which ships coming to the port and to the other Southern destinations were to travel under armed escort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0004865811432812"><italic>Africa News</italic>, 2005</xref>). In 2008 media reports framed shipping security in a similar way, with media reports including coverage of some instances of private security forces, such as Blackwater (XE), being utilized to protect vessels from piracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865811432812">Cole, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0004865811432812"><title>Stage five of a moral panic: Panic leads to social change</title>
<p>Social change and volatility are the features of the last stage of moral panic. As piracy in Somalia is an ongoing and current issue, with the International Maritime Bureau reporting 33 attacks in the first five months of 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0004865811432812">IMB, 2010</xref>), it is difficult to fully assess whether social change will or will not occur. The number of attacks reported to the IMB clearly demonstrates there have been an increasing number of attacks from 1992 to 2009, however the data for 2010 indicate the number of attacks may be slowing (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0004865811432812">Table 2</xref>). This suggests that social concern for piracy in Somali waters could dissipate as quickly as it emerged, further supporting piracy as a moral panic. As piracy remains a current social issue this has yet to be fully established. Despite this, the considerable media coverage of the phenomenon remains, with 532 articles covering the topic in the first five months of 2010. Piracy is still considered a problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0004865811432812">IMB, 2010</xref>), and disproportionate policies are still in place. Media coverage indicates that:

<p>More than 20 countries are now taking part in an international naval force, and the membership of the Contact Group on Piracy off the coast of Somalia, formed at the height of successful vessel hijackings last year, has grown from 24 to 47. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0004865811432812">Kralev, 2010</xref>: 10)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0004865811432812">4</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>This coverage reflects the international political discourse that has resulted in a policy that calls for the deployment of naval forces to combat the issue of piracy by ‘all means necessary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0004865811432812">UNSC, 2008f</xref>). Indicators of social change include the UNSC granting permission to all regional organizations that are in cooperation with the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to utilize ‘all means necessary’ to combat piracy in Somali waters. This includes permitting the deployment of naval vessels and military aircraft to combat, seize, and dispose of boats, vessels, arms, and any equipment used in the commission of acts of piracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0004865811432812">UNSC, 2008f</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, there has been an increasingly militarized response, with the authorization of NATO missions in the Gulf of Aden with the goal of ‘disrupting and deterring piracy’. Historically, international law restricted the use of military force within sovereign waters and territory. On March 24, 2009 Operation Allied Protector led to the dispatch of five NATO ships being dispatched to the Gulf of Aden with the object of deterring piracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0004865811432812">NATO, 2010</xref>). The justification offered for the NATO presence, is the importance of the Gulf of Aden as a route for trade with ‘22,000 ships per year transiting through there on their way to countries all over the globe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0004865811432812">NATO, 2010</xref>: 1). As of February 2010, media reports indicate that warships from more than nine different countries have been operating in the Somali coastal waters ready to respond to incidences of piracy. These policies have led to media praise of international military efforts that have foiled attempted piracy attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004865811432812">Ha, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0004865811432812">Martin, 2009</xref>). Such praise includes the February 19, 2010 <italic>Washington Times</italic> headline ‘Multinational policing curbs piracy off Somalia’, and stories covering the ‘daring rescue of [<italic>Maersk Alabama</italic>’s] American captain, held hostage in a pirate skiff for five days’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0004865811432812">Martin, 2009</xref>: 1P). However, the long-term curtailment of Somali piracy seems to be dependent on the willingness of the international community to address the existing structural conditions in Somalia.</p>
<p>In November 2010, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) formally recognized that the ongoing structural conditions within Somalia are contributing to the problem of piracy in the state’s coastal waters. The UNSC then stressed the need for a more comprehensive response to the issue of piracy as well as its underlying causes, they emphasized that:
<disp-quote>
<p>peace and stability within Somalia, the strengthening of State institutions, economic and social development and respect for human rights and the rule of law are necessary to create the conditions for a durable eradication of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0004865811432812">UNSC, 2010</xref>: 3)</p></disp-quote>It appears that despite the preferred solution to the problem of piracy being that of over-militarization, a change in discourse and consequently focus, may lead to a more comprehensive international response to the problem of piracy in Somalia. Although it must be noted that, despite this seeming change in discourse, there is still little acknowledgement of the long history of internecine violence, warring factions, and poor living conditions that have faced Somalia and its people since colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865811432812">Eichstaedt, 2010</xref>). It has been demonstrated that although social change and volatility cannot yet be fully assessed, piracy remains a current issue.</p>

<p>If a moral panic had occurred then all of the stages of a moral panic would have had to have been completed. The findings suggest a moral panic did not occur; rather, the actions of the shipping industry, international political community, and media support the agenda-setting perspective. Although there is an increase in piracy off the coast of Somalia, a media reaction to the issue, and subsequent policies have been enacted in response which have been inflated and disproportionate, not all of the stages of a moral panic have been completed. The private shipping companies together with the media provided primary definitions of piracy as being a legitimate threat to the shipping industry, resulting in a dominant ideology that framed piracy and pirates as both bad and evil. The second criteria of hostility has been demonstrated by the media’s portrayal of pirates as being bad, dangerous and terrorists as well as creating fear and intolerance within the international political community, while simultaneously neglecting the underlying structural conditions within Somalia. This threat however, was not levied at the general public instead the target was global shipping and the mariners that traverse the waters off the coast of Somalia. Consequently, widespread public concern was not demonstrated. The large amount of media coverage of the issue, coupled with the framing of the issue as both a threat to global shipping, and being linked to al Qaeda, support the agenda-setting perspective. The framing of the issue to the public in a certain way, and focusing on certain aspects of the issue while neglecting or ignoring other aspects, has given the issue of Somali piracy a particular slant or meaning consistent with the first-level agenda-setting hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0004865811432812">Tuchman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865811432812">Altheide, 1997</xref>). Additionally, media presentations of the negative attributes of pirates, framing them as terroristic, bad, and evil, is consistent with the second-level agenda-setting hypothesis.</p>
<p>The international military response to the problem through the deployment of warships from numerous countries to the Gulf of Aden, was found to be a disproportionate reaction to the problem. This is illustrated by the severity and scope of the political decisions made, the carte blanche authority transferred to UN member states to utilize ‘all means necessary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0004865811432812">UNSC, 2008f</xref>) to combat piracy, including military force, and the inflated media coverage of the issue. Further, piracy, including state-sanctioned piracy, is not a new phenomenon, rather the revised focus on the issue is strongly related to the threat to global shipping and states’ self-interest in the global economic market. In fact, the level of violence demonstrated by modern-day Somali pirates is significantly less than that utilized by the pirates of history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0004865811432812">Rothe, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the deployment of the 20-plus warships in the Gulf of Aden directly resulting from the disproportionate responses of the international political community to the problem of piracy, little attention has been paid to the structural conditions faced by the Somali people. What is interesting to note, is that, despite the increased media coverage of Somali piracy, the underlying structural barriers faced by Somali people are often ignored. Of the 2752 media articles covering the issue of Somali piracy between 1992 and 2010, only 6.4 percent (n = 177) framed piracy as being directly related to the state’s extant structural conditions. Ali and Murad (2009) assert that media coverage of Somali piracy remains in ‘a historic and political vacuum’, and Somali pirates are:
<disp-quote>
<p>labeled as any number of things that all spring from an understanding of their existence only in relation to ourselves. As they are portrayed and understood through these ahistorical, acontextual channels they become, more and more, fairy-tale monsters capable of anything. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004865811432812">Ali and Murad, 2009</xref>: 4)</p></disp-quote>This is especially relevant to the primary definitions of piracy and pirates that came from the private shipping companies and the IMO. These primary definers, through their depiction of pirates as ‘bad, evil, and terrorist’ were able to create a dominant ideology that served to protect their vested interests – that is, protecting global shipping routes to ensure the continuance of trade. This dominant ideology neglects the underlying structural issues facing the people of Somalia. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0004865811432812">Rothe and Collins (2011)</xref>, media coverage of Somali piracy neglects to draw attention to the large amount of illegal foreign fishing that takes place in Somali coastal waters:
<disp-quote>
<p>European ships have been looting Somalia’s seas of the greatest resource: seafood. More than 300 million [USD] worth of tuna, shrimp and lobster are being stolen every year by illegal trawlers … We have destroyed our own fish stocks by overexploitation – and now we have moved on to theirs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004865811432812">Hari, 2009</xref>: 2)</p></disp-quote>The international political response to piracy of increased military deployment, therefore does not address the underlying structural problems that are driving the increased instances of piracy in Somalia.</p>
<p>The agenda-setting perspective by definition provides a one-dimensional frame of the issue at hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0004865811432812">McCombs and Shaw, 1972</xref>). This is the case with regards to Somali piracy since little social or historical context is provided as to the social, political, structural, and economic crisis that is ongoing in the state of Somalia. The media and political communities’ neglect of the internal strife within the state of Somalia, as well as the continued focus on the need for a militarized response, ignores the multifaceted motivations, and opportunities that contribute to the increased incidences of piracy in Somali coastal waters. If the international political community were serious in their endeavors to stop piracy in Somalia, they would divert some attention to the structural conditions within Somalia – the internecine violence, famine, economic crisis, political in-fighting, and lack of institutional control currently facing the people of Somalia. Without acknowledgment of Somalia being a weakened and failing state, the current response to piracy in Somalia will remain ineffective. After all, the 2010 report from the IMB has not indicated a tremendous decline in the number of pirate attacks and attempted attacks, despite the growing presence of warships patrolling that region. However, the agenda setting that falls short of meeting the criteria for a moral panic, has served to provide an international discourse that both simultaneously ignores the structural conditions in Somalia and reinforces an overly militarized response to piracy.</p>
