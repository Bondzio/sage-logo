<p>Nurses have long recognized the importance of including family in the care of their patients. Chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, not only affect individual patients but can also affect the entire family. Type 2 diabetes requires the patient to develop or change a number of health behaviors, including physical activity, nutrition, and medication adherence. These complex self-management activities can be especially stressful for patients as well as their families.</p>
<p>Recognizing the impact families have on our patients’ lives is becoming even more important as the composition of families continues to evolve. The family of today is highly dynamic with many more unmarried cohabiting couples, same-sex couples, single-parent households, and step or blended families than seen in the recent past. In addition, many people today include fictive kin in their family, or people other than those they live with or whom they are bound to by blood or legal ties, such as close friends or neighbors.</p>
<p>Each patient creates his or her own concept of family, including who is considered part of the family, as well as family roles, routines, responsibilities, and traditions. Family is a vital source of social support for patients. Family members can provide physical and emotional support to patients in terms of companionship, advice, and coping, as well as assistance with childcare, finances, and activities of daily living. On the other hand, family can also have negative effects on patients if they are not supportive of the type 2 diabetic family member in ways that the patient may need. Therefore, there is an increased need for valid and reliable instruments to assess positive and negative influences of the entire family on adult type 2 diabetic populations.</p>
<p>A number of family assessment measures have been developed for families of children with chronic conditions, such as type 1 diabetes. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945912471927">Song, Deatrick, Feetham, and Levin (2013)</xref>, these family assessment instruments aim to quantify many aspects of family, including conflict, responsibility, and support. More and more studies are recognizing the importance of assessing family in noninsulin dependent or type 2 diabetic populations. For example, Glasgow and Toobert modified the original Diabetes Family Behavior Checklist (DFBC), which measures family support and is intended for use with families of patients with type 1 diabetes, to the DFBC-II for use with families of patients with type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, other family assessment measures available for use with type 2 diabetic populations are not true family assessment measures as their unit of interest is at the individual level in assessing a family member’s perceptions of the diabetic patient’s self-care, illness representation, and complications.</p>
<p>To better assess the family of adult type 2 diabetic patients, new assessment instruments must be developed that measure outcomes on at least the dyadic level; however, to fully capture the dynamics of family, measures must include data from as many members of the family as possible. In addition, new data analysis techniques, such as structural equation modeling, are making it easier to evaluate group data, such as that of a family.</p>
<p>One of the major objectives of the Healthy People 2020 initiative is to increase the proportion of diabetics who maintain A1C levels below 7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945912471927">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2011</xref>). The immediate social environment, such as that of the family, could be a useful target for interventions to change health behaviors in adult type 2 diabetic populations to reach this goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945912471927">Chesla, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945912471927">Cole &amp; Chesla, 2006</xref>). Therefore, it is of utmost importance that researchers interested in studying adult type 2 diabetic populations are able to properly measure how family members, both traditional family such as spouses and children as well as more untraditional family such as fictive kin, assist with and/or hinder aspects of the patient’s diabetes self-management.</p>
