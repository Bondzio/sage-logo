<p>In recent years, there has been a growing body of knowledge and practice dedicated to the unique application of lifelong learning to the knowledge-based economic society. During the past decade, the importance of lifelong learning has been recognized as it related to social and economic issues in Korea. Since 2001, when the national lifelong learning policy and legal framework were established, the role of lifelong learning has been increasingly critical to the building of a lifelong learning society in Korea. As one of the many efforts to achieve the vision of Korea becoming a lifelong learning society, the Lifelong Learning City Project (LLCP) was launched in 2001 to promote the development of local learning communities across the nation. The project has focused on expanding lifelong learning opportunities to local citizens, on improving the quality of educational services, on creating a better link between the Department of Education and the communities, and on developing a lifelong learning community and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422312446057">Byun, Chae, &amp; Kim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422312446057">Byun, Ryu, &amp; Cervero, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312446057">Kim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422312446057">Lee, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>As of 2011, there are 82 lifelong learning cities throughout Korea that have been recognized and supported by the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology. Although every city is different and carries out unique and special educational programs that reflect its own regional characteristics, they all share the same goal: to enhance and provide learning opportunities for citizens by creating a network among educational and training institutions in the region. As citizens’ demands for a better life increase, more cities are eager to be designated as a lifelong learning city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422312446057">Byun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312446057">Kim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312446057">Ko, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422312446057">Lee, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the promises advanced by promoting the LLCP by the municipal governments are relevant to the development of regional human resources and the local community capacity, we know little about how or whether the project leads to substantive and sustainable changes. Assuming that organization development (OD) can coexist with the field of human resource development (HRD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422312446057">McLean, 2006</xref>), this study seeks to examine how the concept of HRD, especially OD can be linked with lifelong learning cities, how the development of human resources is being accomplished in the learning cities, and how residents contribute to local communities as well as how they bring about changes in their local communities. Specifically, this study discusses the practice of OD in the regional and community context and focuses on municipal governments that are concerned with creating sustainable changes in regional communities. Traditionally, OD’s primary emphasis has been on enhancing knowledge, expertise, productivity, relationships, and other desired outcomes in an organizational setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422312446057">McLean, 2006</xref>). However, relatively little research attention has been devoted especially to the topic of OD implementation in the community level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422312446057">Cummings &amp; Worley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422312446057">McLean, 2006</xref>). The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine how the LLCP has promoted the development of human resources and communities in Korea by using OD practices and interventions. Especially with respect to local HRD, this study explores the possibility of the community reinforcement through the manner in which residents of the local areas become leaders of a learning group or a community. After briefly introducing the LLCP in Korea, two major findings and implications for HRD are examined.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Qualitative content analysis was conducted for this study. To examine how changes in regional communities—in terms of the development of human resources and communities by the LLCP—occur, the researchers first examined each website of the lifelong learning cities. The websites offered information about the city, municipal government, and the lifelong learning centers and their educational programs. Then, the authors collected data including documents, statistical records, reports, and a variety of research papers that were related to the 76 lifelong learning cities. Comprehensive development plans and progress reports that were submitted by each lifelong learning city were also collected and analyzed by the authors.</p>
<p>To generate consistent and recurring themes, categories, or patterns, data were continually examined and contrasted with one another according to the areas of analysis. The areas of analysis on which this article focuses are (a) an understanding of lifelong learning, (b) lifelong learning programs, (c) networking, (d) professionalism, and (e) legal and institutional infrastructures based on sound implementation and management. In this study, the authors developed a set of criteria to guide society in assessing how the lifelong learning cities have changed over time. The primary criteria for the evaluation of an understanding of lifelong learning are (a) peoples’ understanding of lifelong learning and (b) the participation rate in lifelong learning. The second criteria for the evaluation of lifelong learning programs are (a) whether the city offers educational programs based on robust needs analysis and peoples’ demands, (b) whether the city provides educational programs for its residents based on the distinctive characteristics of the local area, and (c) whether the city encourages social integration by providing educational programs to the underprivileged. The third criteria, for networking, are (a) cooperation between municipal governments and local organizations and (b) efficient and effective operations resulting from exchanges of information, human resources, and other useful resources. The fourth criteria, for the evaluation of professionalism, are (a) whether the city offers training courses for its government personnel and adult educators and practitioners to help them understand the concepts, basic knowledge, and skills of lifelong learning and (b) any other professional development efforts on the part of the educators and practitioners. The fifth criteria, for the evaluation of legal and institutional infrastructures, are (a) whether the city has established an organizational agency that is fully responsible for promoting lifelong learning for its residents, (b) whether the city has established and runs local lifelong learning facilities, and (c) whether the city has properly proposed and implemented its own long-term lifelong learning promotion plans and policies.</p>

<title>The Lifelong Learning City Project in Korea</title>
<p>The fundamental direction of Korea’s lifelong education policy is based on the Lifelong Education Law promulgated in 1999. The purpose of the Lifelong Education Law is to provide everyone with suitable learning opportunities at anytime and anywhere, to improve the quality of life, and to contribute to social development. The Lifelong Education Law states that central and local governments should prepare their own facilities for lifelong education and continue to support all citizens with learning activities.</p>
<p>To expand lifelong learning opportunities for local citizens and to improve the quality of education services, educational, human, and material resources of the local governments and the department of education need to be efficiently and effectively linked within the community. Against this backdrop, the project has aimed to facilitate lifelong education by encouraging local governments to take a more active role in establishing a network connecting educational and general administrations. The LLCP by the Ministry of Education and HRD (currently, the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology) is a part of an effort to establish regional lifelong learning systems and to bring about a learning culture in Korea. The project is critical because it motivates regions to create human resources and social capital through innovative teaching organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422312446057">Longworth, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422312446057">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422312446057">Yang, 2004</xref>). The LLCP is a community-based development movement. The ultimate goal of the project is to solve community problems through the utilization and reorganization of regional education resources, to provide lifelong learning opportunities for residents, and to foster learning environments where residents can learn together.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1523422312446057">
<title>How the LLCP Has Changed People and Communities</title>
<p>The awareness of lifelong learning on the part of citizens and relevant personnel has been raised by holding ceremonies for the designation of a learning city and by conducting diverse lifelong learning programs. A designated lifelong learning city provides a diverse range of lifelong learning opportunities for residents. In the lifelong learning city, the participation rate is extremely high thanks to specialized projects and networks among communities, schools, local governments, the central government, and even military bases. Lifelong learning programs in communities can be recognized by the diversification of region-specific programs, improvement in the quality of programs, expansion of programs for the underprivileged, and systematization of literacy education.</p>
<p>First, lifelong learning programs for regional communities have been expanded. Various lifelong education activities have been promoted on the basis of local resident service centers, also known as community service centers (township offices), which took over the roles and functions of municipal governmental affairs working toward community development and social changes. Diversified educational programs have been offered and developed for local residents by renovating local centers in order that they might run various lifelong learning courses. Educational programs mainly consist of culture and leisure, citizenship education, public health, community development, personal development, and specialized regional services. The programs play an essential role in supporting the basis of the local community by building a sustainable environment, raising local residents’ awareness of social and community issues through communal discussion and decision making, and giving them responsibility for solving community problems. This implies that the role of the community centers has changed from a space for the civil service to a venue for learning and change efforts for a better community.</p>
<p>Second, the number of educational programs that are offered by the lifelong learning cities and the quality of programs has been expanded. The lifelong learning cities have been offering programs that meet the desire of residents by analyzing the residents’ educational demands. Chilgok County in Gyeongsangbuk Province, for example, created Chilgok Women’s Agricultural College, which operates under the Academic Credit Bank System. The Academic Credit Bank System offers degrees for people who take courses in accredited academic institutions anytime and anywhere. Since Chilgok County was selected as a lifelong learning city in 2004, the county has carried out the Academic Credit Bank System curriculum that was implemented by the central government. Chilgok County has offered this curriculum under the title of “Chilgok Women’s Agricultural College” in partnership with Kyungpook National University, which is close to the county, and established the first Women’s Agriculture Management course in Korea.</p>
<p>Third, the LLCP has created more opportunities for the underprivileged (people with low education and income) to receive education; especially, lifelong learning cities have gained fruitful results by developing programs that link learning, labor, and welfare through networks and partnerships. The concept of lifelong learning has been broadened to cover issues of social cohesion; it focuses on socioeconomic issues by highlighting education, labor, health, and welfare issues. Several lifelong learning cities addressed active partnership as an essential part of social cohesion in Korea. Gwangmyeong city, for example, began the “Business Start-Up” program for people who want to start their own businesses. The Gwangmyeong Lifelong Learning Center took charge of the program and four other organizations in the region joined together. The partnership was composed of the Gwangmyeong Lifelong Learning Center, the Social Solidarity Bank, the Social Welfare Center, and the division for social welfare within the municipal government in Gwangmyeong city. The lifelong education center took charge of the overall process of developing and operating programs. The Social Solidarity Bank took charge of technical training for start-ups and business management. The Social Welfare Center and the division for social welfare took care of the participants by consulting with them. To sum up, the lifelong center offered educational programs; the Social Solidarity Bank helped to start businesses; and the Social Welfare Center and the division of social welfare provided encouragement to participants who wished to start their own business. As a result of the program, some participants who had been homeless are now running their own businesses such as cleaning service companies and groceries. This program showed the possibility of a synergy effect that can be created through partnership among education, labor, and welfare.</p>
<p>Fourth, Korea’s literacy education became more systematized and localized through promotion of the LLCP. Especially, the partnership between private organizations and the central and local governments has become stronger, and the stronger partnership has brought changes in the development of Korean literacy education. Through this close partnership between related parties, considerable changes have occurred to the educational division within the municipal governments. The educational divisions were given more power and more flexible work settings in which they could directly plan and operate lifelong education programs and use public school facilities for adult literacy education. Since the Literacy Education Support Project was launched, the role and responsibility of local governments in literacy education and the lifelong learning city concept has increased. The role of local governments has become more important in rural areas where there were few educational activities and infrastructure available to them. The local governments found it difficult to develop ways to reach rural areas with limited human resources, access to educational institutions and programs, and education infrastructure; however, with the LLCP, the local governments found a way to help their people and rural communities.</p>

<title>After Learning, How Do the Developed Human Resources Work in the Regional Communities?</title>
<p>The LLCP has made significant progress within the past 10 year period. As the LLCP has been operated under national supervision, the project has expanded at a very rapid rate. The following describes four significant impacts on the regional communities.</p>
<p>First, there was ample and enriched networking and collaboration between organizations and governmental agencies that plan and implement lifelong learning programs and initiatives in the community. Collaboration between governmental organizations and agencies, and learning centers and educational institutions has been strengthened by the shared goal to create a lifelong learning city. In addition, to enhance the competency of the organizations that have a partnership, joint training programs were developed and shared. Through the development of joint training programs, information and various resources were shared among partnership organizations to operate lifelong learning cities more efficiently.</p>
<p>As a process for the promotion of community development, various lifelong learning activities have been conducted and used in public school facilities. Educational programs have been carried out by connecting and networking individual schools with distinctive facilities and sharing the diversified community facilities of different public schools. This trend in lifelong learning activities indicates that lifelong education programs have been especially customized for the local residents. The Haeundae-gu Bansong district, for example, is one of the underdeveloped areas in the metropolitan city of Busan. Despite its poor condition, some community members organized a group called “People Who Love Bansong,” a voluntary group that wanted to improve the living standard of the community. Their activities were introduced to the other lifelong learning cities. Benchmarking programs for understanding the Bansong community, and educational programs for self-sufficient living also began to operate. Furthermore, the residents who participated in the community building activities also organized a study group called “Learning about Our Town, Bansong,” so that community members could bring more pride to their community. This story is also a good example of a partnership between private and public sectors including the support and network of the municipal government of Haeundae-gu. The case of the Bansong district is, in fact, one of the best examples of the process of building a grassroots community through community members’ collaborative learning.</p>
<p>Second, the level of expertise of regional personnel who are assigned to lifelong education for their community has risen. When a city is designated as a lifelong learning city, the National Institute for Lifelong Education provides a special training program for public service personnel who will deal with lifelong learning in the local government and private organizations. Each lifelong learning city offers special training courses for the staff members who take charge of lifelong learning in their district. This helps the staff to become more expert at handling the learning city project, operating the lifelong education facilities, and attempting to reach social consensus by conducting various lifelong learning programs.</p>
<p>Job opportunities have also increased for lifelong educators. Lifelong educators are usually employed by public and regional lifelong education centers, libraries, public or private cultural and educational centers, lifelong education centers affiliated with higher educational institutes, and job training centers. As local governments encourage people to participate in lifelong learning programs through the LLCP, it is expected that more lifelong educators will be hired in the future. Currently, there are about one hundred lifelong educators working for the LLCP.</p>
<p>The city of Icheon, for example, was designated as a lifelong learning city in 2004. The mayor has shown great commitment to lifelong learning by organizing appropriate administrative bodies. The local residents have gained more opportunities for lifelong learning and increased autonomy as responsible citizens. Beyond this, after restoring its own identity, the city has shown comprehensive development and innovation for its rural areas. With the establishment of lifelong learning centers in Icheon, every community service center has offered educational programs as a lifelong learning center for residents. To make lifelong learning easily accessible and to avoid the alienation of any area from learning opportunities, each staff member was assigned to only one lifelong learning center and was given sole responsibility for the operation of that lifelong learning center. As lifelong learning staffs were placed even in every small village, more local-specific programs were developed and provided. The staff from the different places regularly gathered together to share their experiences and find ways to develop and enhance current programs; this became an additional learning opportunity for the staff members.</p>
<p>Third, the promotion of the LLCP has provided a solid foundation for local autonomous entities to be capable of promoting various activities: to set up organizations for administering lifelong learning tasks under their administrative systems; to establish and reorganize lifelong learning facilities; and to plan and implement local lifelong educational projects for establishing organizations such as lifelong learning centers. Furthermore, designated lifelong learning cities or candidates for the lifelong learning city concept have promoted related projects by formulating long-term lifelong learning development plans. Most learning cities have also formulated long-term investment plans for their lifelong education projects. The LLCP has made a significant contribution to the systematic construction and operation of comprehensive systems for community members’ lifelong learning at the local autonomous entities level in Korea.</p>
<p>Bucheon is a residential and industrial suburb of Seoul with a population of roughly 850,000. To build a foundation for promoting lifelong learning, Bucheon enacted an ordinance that served as a legal basis for the operation and support of lifelong learning councils and lifelong learning centers. In addition, through close cooperation with the municipal government and the local education office, Bucheon established a support system for lifelong education. The city has also improved the quality of lifelong education through regional networking. By networking among the private, government, academic, and industrial sectors, Bucheon has promoted a spirit of community within the city. Among the regional lifelong education institutions, the city designated a central organization that could contribute to creating lifelong learning villages and to directing the region’s educational agenda. Furthermore, through a learning city portal, the city offered comprehensive information on relevant lifelong learning organizations, programs, and instructors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422312446057">Byun, Chae, Yang, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422312446057">Choi, Yang, Kuan, Lee, &amp; Lee, 2004</xref>). Finally, Bucheon’s comprehensive development plan as a lifelong learning city is based on a central vision for the building of a society of lifelong learning.</p>
<p>In sum, the LLCP has made significant progress within the past 10-year period. As the LLCP has been operated under national supervision, the project has expanded at a very rapid rate. The project has also provided opportunities for many local autonomous entities to strengthen administrative organizations and their functions in citizen education. Moreover, residents in the lifelong learning cities play an important role by participating and voluntarily organizing study groups with the support of the local governments. The project takes the form of local autonomy to solve community problems through the residents’ collective efforts. It is only possible by making full use of local resident facilities and organizations dedicated to fostering lifelong learning.</p>

<sec id="section8-1523422312446057">
<title>Summary and Implications for Organization Development</title>
<p>This article has explored in detail the LLCP in Korea and how the project has promoted the development of human resources and communities by using OD practices and interventions. To examine the changes in regional communities, the researchers collected documents, statistical records, reports, and a variety of research papers that were related to the 76 lifelong learning cities.</p>
<p>Several findings emerged from the data that addressed the research purpose are as follows: (a) Lifelong learning programs for regional communities have been expanded; (b) the number of educational programs that are offered by the lifelong learning cities and the quality of the programs have been expanded; (c) the LLCP has created more opportunities for the underprivileged to receive education; (d) Korea’s literacy education has become more systematized and localized through the promotion of the LLCP; (e) there have been ample and enriched networking and collaboration between organizations and governmental agencies that plan and implement lifelong learning programs and initiatives in the community; (f) the level of expertise of the regional personnel who are assigned to lifelong education for their community has risen; and (g) the promotion of the LLCP has provided a solid foundation for local autonomous entities to be capable of promoting various activities.</p>
<p>This study has shown how the perspectives and practices of HRD broadly, and especially, OD are combined with Societal Development (SD). Although the findings of the study show an optimistic view of the use of HRD for SD, we must understand that HRD for SD is not practiced on a neutral stage but within a very political context; especially, OD interventions for SD cannot be neutral but necessarily operate with a particular social vision that shapes systems of power, race, gender, class, democracy, freedom, and social justice. The HRD practitioners, adult educators, and possibly policy makers who work for SD must understand the larger social system that almost always benefits some people and marginalizes others. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422312446057">Griffin (1988)</xref> argues the lack of an explicit social vision, claiming that
<disp-quote><p>critical thinking, perspective transformation, and andragogy can all be put to universal purposes, whether these be the reinvigoration of democracy, the struggles of oppressed groups, or the learning needs of managers of international corporations. This is because they lack any kind of social structural reference and are, apparently, of no ideological significance. (p. 178)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Therefore, asking and answering the ethical question, “Who should benefit from the SD efforts in HRD?” would make the fundamental link between HRD and SD more useful and valuable.</p>
<p>Traditionally, OD has been practiced within organizations to help organizations and members of organizations gain the organizational skills, knowledge, and techniques needed to effectively and efficiently operate their organizations through the better alignment of human resources and organizational systems and structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422312446057">Cummings &amp; Worley, 2001</xref>). OD has been focused largely on business organizations. Various OD interventions have been studied and applied to help business organizations become more efficient and more capable of enhancing themselves on a continuing basis. As this study has shown, however, the theoretical and practical aspects of OD can be applied to many other contexts: government organizations, planned change efforts for community, and societies.</p>
<p>First, because of the LLCP, the role of municipal governments has changed. The division of lifelong learning within the municipal government that has been designated a lifelong learning city is a governmental organization. The mission of the division is to resolve social and economic problems in its community by offering educational programs and educating people. Although the municipal government is typically concerned with administering its community, solving problems within the community and improving peoples’ lives by the development of a lifelong learning community has become one of the foremost issues in the community. The new role of the local government is to help communities and society address such important problems and issues as unemployment, poverty, homelessness, public health, quality of life, sustainable development, and more within the community. The planned change efforts by the local governments are a relatively new application of OD in community settings, but the application of OD is likely to find increased opportunities for local governmental organizations.</p>
<p>Second, as OD practitioners show what organizational members want the organization to look like or become, the LLCP has provided a direction for social development and change. The lifelong learning cities clearly understand and share the LLCP’s ultimate goal, that is, to help local residents to have a capacity for autonomous learning and to achieve self-realization, and to develop local human and social capital. Beyond the improved productivity and development of human resources, the LLCP benefits marginalized populations who come to be included in the local community and play the part of responsible citizens. The project has focused on how each city can strengthen the capacity of self-support. When learning becomes a typical feature of a society, both the local society and the nation as a whole can become lifelong learning societies. Social development and change thus involve stepping from the known to the unknown. For the lifelong learning cities, setting goals guides the local governments and people and helps them to envision a better future toward which change can be directed.</p>
<p>Third, the successful learning cities indicated above have built networks that include the central government, local organizations, and private companies with similar objectives and shared goals and visions within their communities. Consequently, the LLCP has created horizontal linkages to organizations in the community where the project takes place. The lifelong learning centers of the municipal government serve as a hub for the LLCP, and their ability to sustain themselves and establish networks with other organizations whose cooperation is critical to expanding their efforts is a key requirement for the success of the project. Future organizations will be more inclusively networked. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422312446057">Cummings and Worley (2001)</xref> suggest, organizations should recognize that networking can help organizations join together to produce goods and services more efficiently. They can learn how to assess whether their partners are compatible with them and whether their joint educational programs and services are useful and effective.</p>
<p>Fourth, as OD practitioners conduct various OD interventions and activities for organizational change, adult educators who work for the LLCP should carry out steward and bridging roles while working as a change agents. The role of the change agent is a relatively new application of knowledge, skill, and talent for adult educators in lifelong educational settings. The new role asks adult educators to be coparticipants in achieving social development through the LLCP. As a change agent for the community, adult educators should have networking skills that create conditions that enable diverse stakeholders to engage and collaborate with the LLCP. Adult educators who are involved in the LLCP and any other social development projects also need to possess adequate political acumen to enable them to be more effective within internal and external organizations.</p>
