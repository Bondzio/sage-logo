<p>I wish I had this book available to me during my residency and early practice years. Despite excellent teaching, experience, and available references on the otolaryngological/surgical aspects of pituitary surgery, we always had to struggle to search the literature for information on the endocrinologic, neuro-ophthalmologic, neurosurgical, and histologic information relevant to our role as pituitary co-surgeons. <italic>Endoscopic Pituitary Surgery: Endocrine, Neuro-Ophthalmologic, and Surgical Management</italic> is probably the answer. It is a clinical reference book written for physicians of all disciplines who care for patients with pituitary disorders. For otolaryngologists/rhinologists/skull base surgeons, it provides a comprehensive information source for all aspects of pituitary disorders, well beyond our surgical role.</p>
<p>The chapter on anatomy of the pituitary gland and parasellar region is very helpful as it describes the relevant structures from the endoscopic view. Chapter 3 on endoscopic equipment may appear long and redundant to the average rhinologist who usually becomes familiar with endoscopic instruments early in residency, but it can certainly serve as an excellent “crash course” for neurosurgeons. Chapter 5 on radiographic evaluation of pituitary tumors is dedicated almost exclusively to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). I would have liked to see more discussion on computed tomography, delineating the pathology as it correlates with the surgical approach through the nose and sinuses. I found Chapters 4 and 6 through 14 very helpful in expanding our knowledge about endocrinologic, histopathologic, neuro-ophthalmologic, and neurosurgical aspects of pituitary disorders management. The chapters on the surgical approach to the pituitary gland are excellent. Although written by different authors, they concentrate on the direct transnasal, trans-superior-meatal (or medial to the superior turbinate) approach. Other approaches, such as endoscopic transseptal, transethmoid, and transantral, are less emphasized except for their role in cavernous sinus surgery (Chapter 21).</p>
<p>In 2 areas, the editors provide a “pro and con” discussion that I found very educating. These are the chapters on microscopic vs endoscopic pituitary surgery (Chapters 22 and 23) and the role of intraoperative MRI (Chapters 27 and 28).</p>
<p>The chapters on radiosurgery, atypical lesions, chemotherapy, stereotactic navigation, and anesthesia consideration certainly augment and emphasize the educational role of this book as a multidisciplinary reference. The last 4 chapters discuss postoperative management and postoperative complications. I found them to be extremely helpful. For us rhinologic surgeons, Chapter 24 adds an excellent reference guide on postoperative endocrinologic and electrolyte disturbances.</p>
<p>The authors, both experienced skull base surgeons, clearly provide us with a comprehensive multidisciplinary resource book. I recommend it as an “everything and anything you need to know about pituitary disorders and surgery” tool for otolaryngology residents and practitioners who wish to embark in this exciting surgical field.</p>
