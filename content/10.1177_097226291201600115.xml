<p>The very first page, even before the title page, gives a sort of abstract of the book. The reader gets an idea that the book ‘updates and enhances the basic concepts surrounding the academic theory and practice of Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC)’. Since its introduction in the late 1980s, there have been dramatic changes in how IMC has developed over time and how it was initially envisioned. Authors, practitioners and customers have been equally responsible for these changes in the way they have written about IMC, or the way they have adopted and adapted the concept to suit their own market situations. The editors identify and discuss these changes, and suggest that IMC is essential in the twenty-first century organizations.</p>
<p>There are eight chapters, or papers, in all contributed by ten authors. The three editors, jointly, have the opening, theme paper; and, the two of them, Kitchen and Schultz, have the closing, concluding chapter. The rest of the chapters are fitted in-between the two as papers on different aspects of IMC.</p>
<p>All the contributors are well known experts in their fields. Their papers are also, therefore, in their core areas of knowledge. For example, Kevin Lane Keller has a paper on the theme of ‘Building Strong Brands’, and Christian Gronroos (co-authored with Ake Finne) on ‘Relationship Communication’. Thus, these papers also make interesting readings with useful insights. However, some of these papers do not connect with the main theme of the book. For example, ‘Apples, oranges, and fruit salad: A Delphi study of the IMC educational mix’ by Gayle Kerr; ‘Integrated marketing communications measurement and evaluation’ by Michael T. Ewing; ‘The primacy of the <italic>consumer</italic> in IMC: Espousing a <italic>personalist</italic> view and ethical implications’ by Jerry G. Kliatchko; and ‘Building strong brands in a modern marketing communications environment’ by Kevin Lane Keller. Each of them is of equal appeal by itself. Just about two of them give some idea of the ‘evolution of IMC’: ‘Integrated marketing communications: From media channels to digital connectivity’ by Frank Mulhern and ‘Rethinking marketing communication: From integrated marketing communication to relationship communication’ by Ake Finne and Christian Gronroos.</p>
<p>To the reviewer, this work seems to be an idea born out of the main paper of the three editors: ‘The evolution of IMC: IMC in a customer-driven marketplace’, which is also used as the title of the book. In fact, (even) in the title, the heading and the sub-heading seem disjointed: ‘The Evolution of Integrated Marketing Communications: The Customer-driven Marketplace’. The sub-heading, ‘The Customer-driven Marketplace’ is not required.</p>
<p>The reviewer also feels that the editors need to be very clear whether IMC stands for ‘Integrated Marketing Communications’ or ‘Integrated Marketing Communication’—as given in the opening remarks (Page i).</p>
<p>Finally, what would be the expectation of an Indian reader, especially a professor/researcher of IMC from the book? How exactly the various forms of marketing communication have evolved over time and become integrated! For example, how exactly Advertising, Public Relations, Publicity, Personal Selling, Sales Promotion, Event Marketing, Direct Marketing, Direct Selling, etc., are being used by marketers more-and-more synergistically today. The reader would benefit more if there were some real-life case studies also included.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the reviewer would like to submit that such a work is a bit premature in the Indian context as the field of IMC is still new and is trying hard for acceptance both by academics and practitioners. IMC is still ‘emerging’ in India; its ‘evolution’ will take some more time.</p>
