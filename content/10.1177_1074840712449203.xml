<abstract>
<p>Valid and reliable instruments are needed to measure how family members perceive support from nurses when a family member is experiencing serious illness. The purpose of this article is to describe the development and psychometric testing of a new instrument, the Iceland-Family Perceived Support Questionnaire (ICE-FPSQ). The concepts in the original version of the ICE-FPSQ (suggesting 24 items and 4 categories) were developed from the Calgary Family Intervention Model. In the first phase of the instrument construction, 179 family members answered the original ICE-FPSQ, and 236 answered the questionnaire in the second phase of testing. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduced the original questionnaire to 21 items. Cronbach’s α = .959 explained 68% of the total variance, with three factors emerging: (a) emotional support (α = .925), (b) recognition of families’ strengths (α = .926), and (c) cognitive support (α = .841). Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) resulted in a final version of the questionnaire containing 14 items with total alpha of .961 and two factors: (a) cognitive support (α = .881) and (b) emotional support (α = .952). The instrument measures family’s perceptions of support provided by nurses and will be helpful in examining the usefulness of family nursing interventions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The field of family nursing requires the development and validation of diverse instruments to measure the effectiveness and influence of family nursing interventions. Present measures focus heavily on the nurse’s perspectives about their own practice with families, for example, attitudes toward the importance of families in nursing care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840712449203">Benzein, Johansson, Årestedt, Berg, &amp; Saveman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1074840712449203">Saveman, Benzein, Engström, &amp; Årestedt, 2011</xref>), family nurse caring beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074840712449203">Meiers, Tomlinson, &amp; Peden-McAlpine, 2007</xref>), and the nurse’s perceptions of his or her family nursing practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712449203">Simpson &amp; Tarrant, 2006</xref>). Although the prerequisites for successful family nursing practice are nurses’ positive attitudes, curiosity, and interest in involving families in their care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1074840712449203">Sveinbjarnardottir, Svavarsdottir, &amp; Saveman, 2011</xref>), a shift is needed in the research emphasis from the nurse variables to family variables to measure the perceived benefit of family nursing interventions for the patient and his or her family.</p>
<p>There are several psychometrically tested instruments developed by family nursing scholars for measuring family functioning variables such as the Family Functioning, Health, and Social Support [FAFHES] questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840712449203">Åstedt-Kurki, Tarkka, Paavilainen, &amp; Lehti, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840712449203">Åstedt-Kurki, Tarkka, Rikala, Lehti, &amp; Paavilainen, 2009</xref>); the Family Management Measure [FaMM] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074840712449203">Knafl et al., 2011</xref>); and the Feetham Family Functioning Survey [FFFS] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1074840712449203">Roberts &amp; Feetham, 1982</xref>) along with a Japanese version of the FFFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074840712449203">Hohashi, Maeda, &amp; Sugishita, 2000</xref>) and a Chinese version of the FFFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840712449203">Hohashi, Honda, &amp; Kong, 2008</xref>). However, more instruments are needed that measure family members’ perceptions of support from nurses to make it possible to evaluate how patient and family members perceive family oriented health care service in acute and long term care settings.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to describe the development and psychometric testing of a new instrument measuring the concept “family perceived support”—a concept theoretically derived from the Calgary Family Intervention Model (CFIM). CFIM is an appropriate model to build an instrument from that measures family perceived support because the family interventions grounded in the model have been shown to be useful in a small but growing body of qualitative research studies without control groups (for more information see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840712449203">Bell &amp; Wright, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712449203">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1074840712449203">Wright &amp; Bell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1074840712449203">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Using the conceptual frame offered in CFIM, family nursing interventions, referred to here as <italic>family support</italic> offered by the nurse, is directed at three domains of family functioning: cognitive, affective, and behavioral. The patient and family members receive support from the nurse who promotes, improves, and sustains effective family functioning in these three domains. The nurse provides family support through therapeutic conversation to improve well-being, family functioning, and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1074840712449203">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). CFIM was used as the conceptual foundation to construct the preliminary version of the Iceland-Family Perceived Support Questionnaire (ICE-FPSQ) and the family functioning domains of the ICE-FPSQ originated from the three domains of CFIM. Following psychometric testing, the ICE-FPSQ instrument was found to measure only two domains of family functioning, that is, emotional and cognitive. Emotional support is defined as support that nurses offer families to handle the burden of emotions around the illness of a family member. Cognitive support is defined as support that nurses offer to inform or educate the family to help them handle the illness experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1074840712449203">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The present science of family interventions in health care, employing both qualitative and quantitative methods, offers beginning evidence that family interventions have a positive influence and significantly improve health outcomes of patients and their family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712449203">Bell &amp; Wright, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074840712449203">Chesla, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840712449203">Mattila, Leino, Paavilainen, &amp; Åstedt-Kurki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1074840712449203">Shields, Finley, Chawla, &amp; Meadors, 2012</xref>). It is believed that nurses can decrease illness suffering by helping patients and family members express new understandings and meanings of family member’s experience of an illness. Offering families the opportunity to reflect on their illness experience seems to be a large contributing factor in their perceived support, because of its possible healing effects. Therefore, the family’s perceived support from nurses is one of the elements in family nursing interventions that needs to be measured and examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840712449203">Duhamel, Dupuis, Reidy, &amp; Nadon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1074840712449203">Houger Limacher &amp; Wright, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1074840712449203">Moules, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1074840712449203">Wright &amp; Bell, 2009</xref>). This new instrument, the ICE-FPSQ, was developed and psychometrically tested in the context of the <italic>Landspitali University Hospital Family Nursing Implementation Project</italic> in Reykjavik, Iceland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Overview of the Research on Family Support</title>
<p>A systematic literature review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840712449203">Mattila and colleagues (2009)</xref> of nursing intervention studies with patients and families in Finland from 2001 to 2006, found that most of the studies evaluated some kind of support in the family interventions—emotional, informational, or concrete aid—but in most of the studies, emotional support was the concept that was most frequently reported. These findings confirm how important it is to measure family members’ perception of the support provided to them by nurses.</p>
<p>In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1074840712449203">Duhamel and Talbot (2004)</xref> that included family members of individuals with cardiovascular illnesses, family members reported nursing support was experienced within the following family nursing interventions: the attitude of the nurse, completing a family genogram, therapeutic questioning, educational information and normalization, and exploring the illness experience in the presence of other family members. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840712449203">Jonsdottir (2007)</xref> conducted a study where a participatory paradigm was used to develop interventions for family members of persons suffering from severe breathing difficulties. She also found positive changes in the behavior of family members as a result of the intervention. Through therapeutic conversation, the illness experience changed into something meaningful for family members, which helped them cope with the illness in daily life. These findings seem to be linked to the three domains of family functioning: cognitive, affective, and behavioral domains presented in CFIM, where the nurse educates and informs to help the family members discover new ways to live with the illness. According to the CFIM, the nurse also encourages family members to tell the story of the illness to increase emotional well-being, and family members are encouraged to keep a balance between caregiving and rest. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840712449203">Bell and Wright (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712449203">2011)</xref> describe Family Systems Nursing interventions and offer existing qualitative research findings that found positive outcomes for families in the three domains of family functioning. These authors urge that more research is needed about the usefulness of family nursing interventions. Interventions that have improved family functioning, well-being, and health in qualitative studies need to be tested in advanced research with control groups. Questions that need to be answered immediately for the nursing profession are questions such as what family nursing interventions are most effective for specific families, and what specific kind of a family nursing support improves family functioning, well-being, and health?</p>
<p>In a recent review of the meta-analysis studies that have examined the effectiveness of family-intervention research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074840712449203">Chesla (2010)</xref> summarized the findings involving adults and children with chronic illnesses. These studies documented a positive effect from family interventions. Although there was little to no involvement by family-nurse scholars in the design or conduct of these research studies, Chelsa raised several intriguing questions. First, would the content of family interventions be different if and when family nursing interventions were included in randomized control trial (RCT) studies? Second, what is the nature of the family interventions that have been studied and how might family nursing interventions emphasize relationship-focused interventions which may be different than the psycho-educational interventions that are frequently identified in the existing meta-analytic studies? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074840712449203">Chesla (2010)</xref> urged more involvement by family nurses in the planning and execution of family-intervention research. Toward this end, more well-developed instruments are needed to examine families’ perception of the nursing care offered to them.</p>

<title>Development of the Preliminary Questionnaire (ICE-FPSQ)</title>
<p>The English version of the preliminary questionnaire of the ICE-FPSQ was developed by one of the authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir, 2007</xref>). She generated 24 items from the conceptual foundation of CFIM as described in <italic>“Nurses and families: A guide to family assessment and intervention”</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1074840712449203">Wright and Leahey (2005)</xref>. Each item represented a supportive family nursing intervention statement from one general domain (uncategorized questions) and three family functioning domains of CFIM. The items in the preliminary questionnaire were from all of the domains presented in the CFIM. The numbers in following brackets represent how many total items were created in each domain generated from CFIM, and the following statements are samples of items from the preliminary ICE-FPSQ:</p>
<list id="list1-1074840712449203" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>General: “The nurses have been committed to my family” (5 items).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cognitive: “The nurses offered us information and their professional opinion” (10 items).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Affective: “The nurses helped family members recognize that our emotional response is valid and helped us to validate and/or normalize family members’ emotional response” (6 items).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Behavioral: “The nurses encouraged my family to take respite from caregiving” (3 items).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The preliminary version of the questionnaire was developed in English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir, 2007</xref>) which was then translated to Icelandic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2008</xref>). The Icelandic version of the preliminary questionnaire was tested with the help of the methods of cognitive interviewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840712449203">Drennan, 2003</xref>) for understanding, meaning, and language of the items. Adult family members of the authors, nurses belonging to the steering and implementation groups of the Landspitali University Hospital Family Nursing Implementation Project and doctoral students at the Faculty of Nursing at the University of Iceland participated in the cognitive interviewing of the instrument. Numerous minor changes in the wording of the items were recommended through the interviews but the process confirmed that family members and nurses understood the meaning of the items in the same way as the authors of the instrument. The Icelandic instrument was cross-translated again into English with professional assistance of a certified translator and compared with the original English instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1074840712449203">Orlygsdottir &amp; Svavarsdottir, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840712449203">Wild et al., 2005</xref>). The meaning of the concepts did not change through the translation process when the two English versions of the questionnaires were compared.</p>
<p>The preliminary questionnaire was composed of 24 items with 4 categories. A 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>almost never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>all of the time</italic>) was used. The instrument included demographic questions such as gender, age, and relationship to the patient. The perceived support domains are referred to as “categories” in the preliminary questionnaire but as “factors” following the statistical factor analysis.</p>

<sec id="section6-1074840712449203">
<title>Content Validity</title>
<p>Content validity is a professional judgment collected from a variety of sources and procedures. Content validity was established by in-depth analysis of experts in clinical and academic family nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840712449203">Friedenberg, 1995</xref>). The content experts were nurses belonging to the steering and implementation groups of the Landspitali University Hospital Family Nursing Implementation Project and academic nurses at the university setting all of whom were knowledgeable about the Calgary Family Nursing Models (CFAM and CFIM). They reviewed, disputed, and critiqued the instrument items to confirm that the items reflected their understanding of CFIM. They also refined the language and the meaning of each item. In addition, masters’ and doctoral students who were using the Calgary Nursing models in their studies reviewed the items of the instrument. Both nurses from the clinical and academic setting confirmed that the 24 items in the preliminary questionnaire reflected their conceptualization of CFIM and therefore did not add or remove any item. The experts determined representativeness and appropriateness of item contents and categories of the preliminary questionnaire. Dr. Lorraine Wright, who co-developed CFAM and CFIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1074840712449203">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>), made a valuable contribution by reviewing and confirming the items of the questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1074840712449203">
<title>Construct Validity</title>
<p>One technique of construct validation is factor analysis, in which one tests the internal structure of the questionnaire. The goal of construct validation was to test and support the theoretical hypothesis. There are two main purposes or applications of factor analysis: item reduction and confirmation of theoretical structure. In this study, PCA and CFA was used for both of those purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840712449203">Friedenberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1074840712449203">Waltz, Strickland &amp; Lenz, 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-1074840712449203">
<title>Study one</title>
<p>Data collection for the initial psychometric testing of the ICE-FPSQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2008</xref>) was conducted from December 2007 until April 2008. Nurses and clinical nurse specialists (CNS) asked family members who were visiting admitted patients at different units and divisions (medical, surgical, pediatric, geriatric and psychiatric) at LUH to complete the ICE-FPSQ instrument. Nurses provided information and obtained informed consent from patients and family members for the testing of the ICE-FPSQ instrument. Inclusion criteria in this phase of testing included the following: (a) the respondent (family member answering the questionnaire) had to have an illness experience of an immediate family member within the past year of answering the questionnaire, and the respondent wanted to share it by answering the questionnaire. (b) Respondents had to be 18 years of age or older and able to read and write Icelandic. The aim was to get a sufficient number of respondents to stay within recommended 3 to 5 respondents per item (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1074840712449203">Waltz, Strickland &amp; Lenz, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>PCA, the data-driven factor analysis, was used to explore the variance that is shared by the items (communalities) in the preliminary questionnaire of 24 items. The goal was to explain the most variance in the set of items with the fewest number of factors that was determined using a statistical criterion such as Eigenvalue greater than 1 (presented in a screeplot figure test), or the percent of variance explained by each factor. The number of factors is set equal to the number of Eigenvalues greater than 1. In areas where little is known about what builds the common factors, PCA can be valuable in suggesting the underlying structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1074840712449203">Waltz, Strickland &amp; Lenz, 2005</xref>). Several statistically proposed questionnaires were developed from the PCA before a decision was made on the final 21 items version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2009a</xref>)—decisions were made in relation to the “fit” to the theoretical background.</p>

<title>Study two and study three</title>
<p>The data collection for the validation of the 21-item instrument in study two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2009a</xref>) was conducted from August 2008 until November 2008. A nurse asked family members participating in different health nongovernmental organizations (NGO) because of an illness in the family to answer the ICE-FPSQ instrument. The health NGOs turned out to be a good environment in which to test the ICE-FPSQ instrument. In the fast pace of the hospital environment, it can be a challenge for the nurses to gather data from the family members visiting the patient.</p>
<p>In study three, data was gathered from 137 family members of psychiatric patients at discharge from four acute psychiatric units at LUH. Data collection was conducted from April 2008 until June 2009. The first author and a nurse from one of the acute units organized and collected the data at the time of discharge of the patient. The inclusion criteria and handling of the informed consent in study two and three followed the same procedures as in the data collection for the PCA (study one).</p>
<p>CFA, a theoretical-driven factor analysis, was used to confirm the model or factors that emerged from the PCA. CFA uses factor loadings to indicate which item “loads” on which factor. Factors should be independent, but the model shows if they are not, and then the researcher decides if he or she wants to modify the questionnaire. Chi-square/df (χ<sup>2</sup>) ratio was looked at in this study, but it is suggested to be less than 3 to be considered a good model fit (relative likelihood ratio) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1074840712449203">Waltz, Strickland &amp; Lenz, 2005</xref>). Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), also called the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis, is suggested to be .06 or less and a model with RMSEA .1 or more is considered not to have acceptable fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840712449203">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840712449203">Netemeyer, Bearden, &amp; Sharma, 2003</xref>). In addition to reporting the Chi-square ratio and RMSEA, which are sensitive to sample size, the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) where 0 is a poor fit and 1 is a good fit was used. Standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) was used as well which is suggested to have a cutoff value close to .08. Researchers are advised to report more than one fit example of their hypothesized model that is building up the questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840712449203">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1074840712449203">Waltz, Strickland, &amp; Lenz, 2005</xref>) because there is no agreement on consistent standards that exist for an acceptable model.</p>

<title>Internal consistency reliability</title>
<p>Cronbach’s alpha coefficient determined the internal consistency or average correlation of items in the instrument to measure its reliability. For a new instrument, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient is expected to be .70 or higher for each factor and for the total instrument if it is conceptually congruent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840712449203">Netemeyer et al., 2003</xref>). Items in the study were eliminated because of skewness in distribution of the scores and because of their small variance; when they were eliminated, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient increased due to the item’s removal.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18 statistical software was used for statistical analysis for the factor analysis and descriptive statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840712449203">SPSS, 2009</xref>). Frequencies, means, median, range and SDs were used to describe the demographic characteristics of the respondents. Testing of sampling adequacy and assessment of factorability was assessed before conducting PCA. PCA with varimax rotation with Kaiser Normalization was conducted on the responses to the preliminary 24 items ICE-FPSQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2008</xref>) to examine how the items would load to each category reflected from the Calgary Family Intervention Model. Acceptable factors were extracted from the following criteria, that is, factor loading cutoff of.40, Eigenvalues greater than 1 and having the total variance explained of the factors and the total instrument. Communalities were assessed which present the proportion of each variable’s variance that can be explained by the PCA and higher values are better represented in the principal component. Internal consistency was assessed by calculating Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for each factor and the overall instrument of the ICE-FPSQ. The three factors identified with the PCA were then evaluated through CFA with different data sets. CFA is a statistical method to verify a factor structure already established. A number of indices of model fit were used in the CFA analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840712449203">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>). The statistical program Linear Structural Relations (LISREL) was used for the statistical analysis conducting the CFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840712449203">Daniel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840712449203">Joreskog &amp; Sorbom, 1996</xref>).</p>

Family members participated on a voluntary basis with an approval from the patient, responses were anonymous, and the informed consent of participating was by filling out the ICE-FPSQ instrument and background questions on gender, age, and relation to the patient. Participants were provided with information explaining the testing from the nurse and they could refuse to participate at any time. Study three was conducted with approval from the Scientific Ethical Board at LUH (28/2008) and with the approval of the Chief Executive of Nursing and Medicine at LUH and it was reported to the Data Protection Authority in Iceland (S3861/2008).</p>

<title>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</title>
<p>In study one, a total of 179 family members answered the preliminary 24 items ICE-FPSQ instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2008</xref>) for the PCA. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1074840712449203">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1074840712449203">2</xref>, gender, age, and family relation to the patient are presented. In the PCA there were 7.5 respondents per item. Assessment for factor analysis suitability, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was.925 which was appropriate. Factorability of the correlation matrices, Bartlett’s tests of sphericity χ<sup>2</sup> (1680.128) = 231.000, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .000 was appropriate as well. After testing for suitability for factor analysis, the PCA was conducted on the data with varimax rotation with Kaiser Normalization to extract the statistical factors of the instrument.</p>
<p>The PCA reduced the ICE-FPSQ instrument from 24 items with 4 categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2008</xref>) proposed from CFIM to 21 items with 3 factors solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2009a</xref>) with Eigenvalues greater than 1 that explained 67.87 % of the total variance. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1074840712449203">Table 3</xref> shows item loadings, Eigenvalues, variance accounted for by each factor, item means, SDs and communalities. The values of the communalities are satisfactory, that is, not any of them are particularly low, the lowest being item no.15 of .447.</p>
<p>The emotional factor consisted of 11 items, recognizing strengths with family consisted of 6 items, and the cognitive factor had 4 items. Three items were eliminated from the 24 items ICE-FPSQ because each one did not get the recommended statistical distribution (were skewed) as required for items in an instrument. The three eliminated items are: the nurses on this unit “have been aware of the impact of the health problem on our family,” “showed my family interest,” and “used language that is relevant, clear and specific.” The first two items were from the general category of the preliminary version of the ICE-FPSQ instrument, and the third item was from the cognitive category.</p>

<sec id="section19-1074840712449203">
<title>Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)</title>
<p>In study two, a total of 99 family members answered the 21 item ICE-FPSQ instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2009a</xref>) for the CFA. Demographics of family members are in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1074840712449203">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1074840712449203">2</xref>. Almost 4.7 respondents per item answered the instrument. When CFA was conducted on the 21 item ICE-FPSQ, the best fit of the model resulted in 14 items with two factors emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2009b</xref>): emotional (9 items) and cognitive (5 items). The model of proposed three factor instrument did not get acceptable statistical fit as the two-factor model did. Seven items were eliminated from the PCA, and they are marked with “<sup>b”</sup> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1074840712449203">Table 3</xref>; four items were eliminated from the emotional factor, two items from the recognition of strength factor, and one item from the cognitive factor. The four items left in the recognition of families’ strengths factor were moved. Three of these items were moved to the emotional factor, that is, the nurses on this unit have “drawn out our family strengths,” “been aware of the impact family members can have on one another, on the patient’s well-being, and on the illness itself,” and “looked for the family’s strengths and opportunities to commend family members when their strengths have been revealed.” One item was moved to the cognitive factor, that is, the nurses on the unit “offered us information and their professional opinion.” One item was moved from the emotional factor to the cognitive factor, that is, the nurses “emphasized the use of family rituals to promote family members’ health.”</p>

<p>For the total instrument, the Chi-square/df (χ<sup>2</sup>) ratio was 1.14, for the cognitive factor, the same ratio was .63, and for the emotional factor, it was 1.15 thus the <italic>p</italic> values were &gt; .05 for the total instrument and both factors, indicating the model fits the data adequately well. RMSEA (Root Mean Square Error Approximation) was .042 for the total instrument, .00 for the cognitive factor, and .044 for the emotional factor. The RMSEA is supposed to be .06 or less to have acceptable fit to the model which it did in the two-factor model. The SRMR was .059 (cut off value close to.08) and CFI was 1.0 which is considered a good fit for the two-factor model.</p>
<p>In study three, the two-factor model was confirmed again: emotional support (9 items) where SRMR was .04 and CFI was .99 and cognitive support (4 items) where SRMR was .026 and CFI was 1.0.</p>

<sec id="section22-1074840712449203">
<title>Strengths and Limitations of the ICE-FPSQ</title>
<p>An important strength of the ICE-FPSQ instrument is that the development of items was grounded on a recommended conceptual model in family nursing reflecting family support measures where there was an illness in the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840712449203">International Council of Nurses, 2002</xref>). Another important strength is the inclusion criteria of the sample where the illness experience was essential to be able to answer the instrument in all of the three studies. In the third study the illness experience being very close in time at discharge of a family member from a psychiatric unit. The third important strength was that the factor structure was tested with robust statistical tests of PCA and CFA to increase reliability and validity where the respondents per item were within statistically satisfactory limits. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficients representing the internal consistency of the total instrument, in all of the studies, were very good; in the first study, the total alpha was .959, for the second study, the total alpha was .953 and for the third study the total alpha was .961.</p>
<p>Women comprised 63to 70% of the total sample, and the average age was around 45 to 50 years of age in all studies. Statistics on family members who are caregivers in the United States show that 59% to 75% of them are women and that the majority is middle-aged, from 35 to 64 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1074840712449203">HHS and ASPE, 2003</xref>). It is a coincidence that demographic characteristics of family members in the studies resemble these demographic statistics of caregivers in the United States. It is an advantage that the sample resembles other samples of caregivers of sick people, but it is a limitation that the gender is not equally represented in the samples. However, when tested there was not a significant difference in the answers of males and females in any of the ICE-FPSQ instrument 21 items which strengthens the instrument that men and women respond to the instrument in similar ways.</p>
<p>Although, when splitting the age group in two groups, older and younger than 50 years of age there was a significant difference in the answers to three items of the ICE-FPSQ instrument 21 items. Two of them belong to the 14 item final instrument, that is, the cognitive factor where the younger group had significantly lower mean scores than the older group:</p>
<p>Item no. 11(2) . . . provided accessible and easy-to-read literature about the problem (&lt; 50 years, mean = 2.89 and ≥ 50 years, mean = 3.60, <italic>p</italic> = .002).</p>
<p>Item no. 12(3) . . . informed my family about the resources available in the community that have proved to be helpful for families in similar situations (&lt; 50 years, mean = 2.62 and ≥ 50 years, mean = 3.08, <italic>p</italic> = .036).</p>
<p>The third item no 15<sup>b</sup> was eliminated in the CFA (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1074840712449203">Table 3</xref>)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to develop and construct a valid and reliable instrument to provide a measurement of how family members perceive support from nurses when a family member is experiencing a serious illness. Family members participating in the testing of the instrument were receiving services in various clinical settings within LUH. Therefore, the ICE-FPSQ instrument has validity within different clinical settings built on the belief that illness is a family affair, which is a relational phenomenon, rather than related to disease classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1074840712449203">Wright &amp; Bell, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Family support in the preliminary questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir, 2007</xref>) was categorized from the CFIM domains of cognitive, affective, and behavioral domains of family functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1074840712449203">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). Items were developed within these three categories which are grounded in qualitative narratives of family members’ illness experience. Each item addressed one element within the CFIM and was structured to obtain a valid response from patients and family members. The proposed ICE-FPSQ instrument went through in-depth expert content review to determine content validity and pretesting of meaning and language. The professionals who were experts in the Calgary Family Models confirmed the content validity of the ICE-FPSQ instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840712449203">Friedenberg, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Three different factor analyses were conducted—principal component and confirmatory—to establish construct validity of the FPSQ instrument. The original questionnaire of 24 items with the 3 categories of behavior, affective, and cognitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2008</xref>) changed into a 21-item questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2009a</xref>), with 3 questions not getting enough variance, with 3 statistical factors from the PCA of emotional, cognitive, and recognition of strengths. In the two CFAs, the best fit between the CFIM theory and the statistical model was a two-factor model of cognitive and emotional factors. It was of interest to see some of the items of the behavioral family functioning domain from the preliminary questionnaire integrating into the cognitive and emotional family functioning domains in the final ICE-FPSQ instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2009b</xref>). For example, with respect to two items belonging to the behavioral family functioning domain, the item on emphasizing rituals belongs to the cognitive domain and the item on encouraging respite belongs to the emotional domain; maybe the cognition of preparing for the ritual is as important as the actual performance of the ritual and the emotional balance is as important in the decision of allowing one’s self respite when a close family member is seriously ill. The ICE-FPSQ instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2009</xref>c) demonstrated internal consistency with adequate scores on the Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for the entire instruments as well as for both the cognitive and emotional factors. Nine items in the final questionnaire relate to the emotional factor, and five relate to the cognitive factor.</p>
<p>Family support and family nursing interventions are described to some degree in qualitative studies and narrative case reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840712449203">Bell &amp; Wright, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712449203">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840712449203">Duhamel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840712449203">Jonsdottir, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074840712449203">Marshall &amp; Harper-Jaques, 2008</xref>). These interventions can be categorized into cognitive and emotional interventions. Emotional support stands out in the qualitative studies as the main effective intervention without being related to the patient illness, physical or psychiatric, and listening to the patient and his/her family members telling their illness story in an engagement of connectedness to the family and in an atmosphere of trust. The emotional support was the factor that explained the largest part of the total variance in the ICE-FPSQ instrument, which seems to confirm a good fit between the qualitative illness narratives and the items and factors of the instrument.</p>
<p>The ICE-FPSQ instrument could be reliability tested and compared to the social support factor in The Family Functioning, Health, and Social Support (FAFHES) instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840712449203">Åstedt-Kurki et al., 2009</xref>). It is psychometrically tested for families of heart patients, not with different illness experiences used in the families used for testing the ICE-FPSQ instrument. Congruent and convergent validity of the ICE-FPSQ could be established as it could be hypothesized that a positive correlation between the family perceived support of the ICE-FPSQ and social support of the FAFHES with family members of the seriously ill would likely be documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840712449203">Friedenberg, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>What sets the ICE-FPSQ apart from other family instruments is, first, that the conceptual background of the ICE-FPSQ instrument is based on CFIM. This model is reflected in the constructed items and development of factors, measuring family members’ perceived support, from domains of family functioning presented in the CFIM, originally developed to account for family interventions offered to families experiencing chronic and acute illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1074840712449203">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). Second, the psychometric properties of the instrument were tested with a sample of family members who were experiencing several different medical diseases of a close family member. This is in accordance with the Illness Beliefs Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1074840712449203">Wright &amp; Bell, 2009</xref>), which argues that the illness experience of family members is not categorized by medical disease classification. Third, this instrument measures how family members perceive family nursing interventions provided by nurses in the cognitive and emotional family functioning domains.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The ICE-FPSQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2009b</xref>) will be useful within hospital and health care institutions as an instrument to evaluate the families’ perceived support from nurses and other professionals who provide family interventions in their therapeutic work with patients and families. The ICE-FPSQ instrument is easy to administer and use within clinical settings; it is a self-report questionnaire and takes approximately 5 to 10 minutes to answer. It is available in English and Icelandic.</p>
<p>The population living in Iceland is homogeneous, where reading level is high or well above fourth grade reading The ICE-FPSQ instrument needs to be tested in other cultures with different reading levels. The instrument can be used to measure the influences and effectiveness of family interventions in two domains of family functioning, that is, emotional and cognitive.</p>
<p>Clinicians and researchers share a large burden to translate new family nursing knowledge into practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840712449203">Duhamel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1074840712449203">Leahey &amp; Svavarsdottir, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1074840712449203">Svavarsdottir, Tryggvadottir, &amp; Sigurdardottir, 2012</xref>). The ICE-FPSQ has the potential to be one of the instruments nurses can use in the emerging translation research ahead.</p>
