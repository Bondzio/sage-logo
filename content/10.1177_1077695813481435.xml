<p>This absorbing book examines Indian mass media with an accent on cinema. In the past decade, India has emerged as a powerhouse among media businesses. Although Athique, who teaches at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, includes an elegant seventeen-page chapter on “the global dynamics of Indian media piracy” that implicates the murky world of Mumbai film financing and briefly touches on copyright, his subject is not intellectual property. Instead, his subject is broad-based dynamics of the Indian media industries. He takes a critical, globalization-theory approach to introduce economic structures, cultural dimensions, and historical and “neological”—emergent—topics.</p>
<p>India represents the second largest newspaper market (after China), with 2,337 “paid-for” print newspapers and an aggregate 110 million weekday circulation. It also has approximately 520 full-power broadcast television stations, 245 full-power radio stations, and more than 650 cable channels. In comparison, the United States has approximately 1,400 paid-for newspapers with total weekday circulation of more than 43 million, more than 1,700 full-power TV stations, 14,728 full-power radio stations, and some 1,000 cable channels. India and the United States have similar systems of freedom of expression with comparable constitutional or statutory guarantees of rights, principles, practices, and institutions. In Indian philosophy, freedom tends to be discussed as a libertarian concept with the individual as the unit of analysis. For example, in the Upanishads, freedom is defined as liberation <italic>from</italic> the senses, rather than any liberation <italic>of</italic> the senses from external infringement. Freedom is enabled by a regimen of intellectual self-discipline to allow the individual to identify and realize a pure self, removed from material dependency or sensual agency. On the other hand, in Western approaches, freedom tends to be defined, almost entirely, in shielding the individual from external political interference. The two conceptualizations are distinct but not competitive. The Upanishads, which represent an erudite metaphysical treatise on freedom, are of primitive antiquity relative to the Western positions, which date to seventeenth through twentieth-century England and America; both approaches offer a strong premise for press freedom. A foundational analysis of the nature of freedom—or of media content—is not Athique’s subject, but a positivistic examination of media is.</p>
<p>None of the challenges of the U.S. news industry, namely sharp declines in circulation, readership, investment, reinvestment, and public trust, corporate consolidation, and perceptions of bias and U.S.-centric coverage, have parallels in India. Instead, the Indian news industry hosts other challenges, including a lack of national codes of media ethics, government purchase of advertisements, corruptions of “paid news,” widespread political ownership of media corporations, vandalism of media properties by political workers, and relatively poorly educated journalists.</p>
<p>Athique offers a panoramic peek at many of those issues, often with a focus on the cinematic medium. In the first chapter, he takes a historical peek at colonial newspapers, primarily <italic>The Times of India</italic> (founded 1838), “in terms of the administrative and cultural politics of colonialism” (p. 27), and at the “cinema under occupation” led by cinematic pioneers Dadasaheb Phalke (<italic>Raja Harishchandra</italic>, 1913) and Dhirendranath Ganguly (<italic>England Returned</italic>, 1921). He suggests a dialectical tension in negotiating, on the one hand, the need to report events objectively, and to pursue, on the other hand, an agenda of freedom activism in the larger social interest. In that sense, it would seem that in colonial India the Upanishadic appreciation of freedom was sacrificed on a Western altar.</p>
<p>In the next chapter on “instituting the media in postcolonial India,” Athique traces the growth of the “diverse multi-language press and a viable film industry” in the eventful decades following independence. He introduces state-funded electronic media institutions such as All India Radio, the Films Division, and Doordarshan, all established by governments led by prime ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. Other chapters engage the rise of the Indian information technology industry and access to digital media; the soft power of Bollywood, the Hindi-language film industry based in Mumbai; and issues of ownership, “commercial culture,” and convergence evident in the Indian “leisure economy.”</p>
<p>Athique includes seven chapters in this book in addition to a succinct, ten-page afterword that concludes, “The Indian media industries will most likely play a substantive role in articulating the coming phase of globalization” (p. 160). He also includes thoughtful but broad suggestions of “further reading” at the end of every chapter, in addition to twenty-one pages of references toward the end.</p>
<p>The truest reason Athique’s work stands out is that it addresses one of the extensive, influential, and expanding systems of freedom of expression—India’s. For its subject, it is an important work that adds to relatively sparse literature, offering both an introduction and a commentary on contemporary Indian media—especially cinema—from a global-critical perspective. The book has been researched well, cited extensively, and organized in bite-size chapters to appeal to undergraduates. It could be an essential textbook in courses in international communication or global systems of media, especially those focused on Indian cinema or South Asian news media. To the extent that the study of a media system can help understand a society, it offers a quick introduction to India and thus, in addition, might also appeal to “study abroad” programs.</p>
