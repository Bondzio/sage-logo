<abstract>
<p>This article offers reflections arising from a recent colloquium at the Open University on the implications of the development of digital humanities for research in arts disciplines, and also for their interactions with computing and technology. Particular issues explored include the ways in which the digital turn in humanities research is also a spatial/visual one; the tension between analysis based on the extensive ‘hard’ data generated by digital methodologies and the more subtle evaluations of traditional humanities research; the advantages and disadvantages of online resources that distance the researcher from the actual archive, book, artefact or archaeological site under investigation; and the unrealized potential for applying to the humanities software tools designed for science and technology. Constructive responses to such challenges and opportunities require the full rigour of the critical thinking that is the essence of arts and humanities research.</p>

<p><sc>this article contains reflections</sc> from a one-day colloquium on digital humanities, hosted by the Open University, with distinguished external participants including John Corrigan, Florida State University. Widespread internal participation, with most faculties represented, reflected an awareness of the growing potential of digital humanities to build strong interdisciplinary links. This report, compiled by John Wolffe, delineates the main contours of some exciting discussions through views from three ‘humanities’ participants and two ‘technological’ ones. It is striking to note convergences of thinking from very different intellectual starting points.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474022211428311">1</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec1-1474022211428311"><title>A view from arts, or why digital humanities can be good to think with</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>(Elton Barker, Lorna Hardwick and Mia Ridge)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ask three academics for their opinion on a particular subject, and you are likely to get six different answers. This is particularly true when the subject is as contentious as digital humanities. Not only are humanities scholars wary of a discipline that seems to require an unfamiliar degree of technical expertise and academic openness; digital humanists themselves can scarcely agree on a definition of their subject, and no one quite knows whether it will even be around in a decade’s time (or whether it will have fallen foul of another dot.com burst bubble), let alone what form it will have taken. The fast-moving and ephemeral nature of the medium, in which whole worlds are now built in clouds, seems to reflect the discipline itself. Without a natural home in any one humanities discipline, it can appear to some as a cuckoo in the nest. What are the humanities to make of this newcomer in their midst, disrespectful of canonical divisions and traditional working methods, and, worse, demanding to be fed at the expense of its fellow occupants of the funding nest?</p>
<p>The problem of digital humanities was confronted head-on at the Open University’s (OU) one-day colloquium entitled ‘Digital Technologies: Help or Hindrance for the Humanities?’. What follows is an attempt to sketch out the views of three humanists who participated in that event, and who represent a broad spectrum of academic experience and technical expertise: Professor Emerita Lorna Hardwick has been heavily involved in the development of databases and electronic seminars for the Reception of Classical Texts project, but her research into reception is highly philological (and philosophical) in nature; Dr Elton Barker similarly has a text-based background in ancient Greek literature, but recently has acted as principal investigator on three digital projects, HESTIA, GAP and Pelagios;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474022211428311">2</xref></sup> Mia Ridge is the one digital expert of the triumvirate, having joined the OU with an MSc from the Science Museum as the Arts Faculty’s first PhD student in the digital humanities. It has not been the aim to use these participants’ views to present a synthesized ‘humanities’ response to the issues raised at the colloquium; we do not think that such a monological viewpoint is tenable, nor could we capture it even if it were. Rather, we see a virtue in encouraging differing, and sometimes contradictory, perspectives to emerge, which, we believe, can better represent the wide spectrum of views on offer.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that our responses are based on the memory of the event and the notes taken at the time: it has been impossible to do justice to the variety of contributions, and we would refer readers to the abstracts on the website. It is the response that argument has engendered for thinking about the place of digital activity within the humanities (and vice versa) which has been our main focus and interest. With this in mind, we have structured this short article around some key issues that emerged rather than on the format of the colloquium itself. What we want to consider briefly here are the issues raised by the following aspects that underpin the digital turn: its tools, methodology and adoption in the humanities; the broader politics and philosophy that lie behind it. In line with both the spirit and outcome of the colloquium, we hope that what follows can make a contribution to engaging the wider constituency of humanities scholars rather than (just) taking the enthusiasts on to ever greater heights.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1474022211428311"><title>Digital tools and methodology</title>
<p>The means by which many humanists first, or only, experience the digital humanities are the tools that are being developed to assist in philological research. In a way, this has to be the sine qua non of digital humanities: without the development and dissemination of tools that we can all use, no matter the degree of our technical expertise, the discipline has no future. Humanist scholars have to be able to see the value of a tool for their current research, before they can be willing to adopt it (and, thereafter, start to ask new questions). This in turn involves access to reliable equipment, technical support and training. New tools will struggle for widespread adoption without regular practice and use, meaning that training needs to be embedded in scholarly activity.</p>
<p>One primary means of exposing humanist scholars to the digital world is through visualization. Pioneers in the discipline have been extensively involved in the digitization of material, from putting classical texts on line in the original language and in translation, to creating a database of people’s reading experiences in the modern world. But, once digitized, data are of little use unless they can be surfaced and represented in digestible forms. Examples of tools designed to render data more easily consumable and visually arresting, particularly through manipulating space, abound, leading John Corrigan, in his opening keynote paper, ‘Digital technologies and the spatial humanities’, to remark that the digital turn may be better understood as the <italic>spatial</italic> turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474022211428311">Dear et al., 2011</xref>). Maps in particular, as we are all familiar with from Google’s suite of tools, are especially adept at bringing together massive and varied data in ways that enable users of all different kinds to grasp the bigger picture at a glance and drill down into the data. New visualization techniques clearly, then, have the power to influence people in their everyday lives and induce them to think more carefully about the relations between things. Visualization techniques afforded by digitization, as well as other digital tools, equally have the potential to change the way that we do research, thereby opening up the discipline of humanities to new and interesting questions.</p>
<p>Still, there are also a number of challenges to the use of digital tools in the humanities identified during the colloquium. Primary among these was the methodology that digital epistemologies favour: disambiguation, clearly defined measurement and organization, such as word counts and hard data, over interpretation. The joint paper by Katharina Rebay-Salisbury and Yi Hong, ‘Computer science vs. archaeology: a dialogue’, demonstrated this point well. They came to talk about their experience on the interdisciplinary and cross-institutional project Tracing Networks,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474022211428311">3</xref></sup> Katherina being an archaeologist, Yi a computer scientist. Their presentation defined two ways of expressing knowledge: the model adopted in computer science research that emphasizes formal specification (meaning machine readable and executable data, controlled vocabulary, and well-defined and highly uniform mathematical symbols) versus the more ad hoc approach practised by archaeologists (using natural language with little or no agreed terminology, with an emphasis on argumentation and interpretation). It was interesting to observe that, while the two presenters had called their talk a ‘dialogue’, they shared little of each discipline’s terminology or strategy. It remains to be seen whether, being part of the same project, the two disciplines will successfully cross-pollinate each other’s fields: there is certainly scope for archaeologists to use more robust and coherent schema for cataloguing their finds, as was conceded; moreover, embedding an IT specialist in the team does seem an improvement on having to seek specialist help from the university’s computing services. Still, the problem here, as with many digital projects, is the separation of technical and subject expertise: far better to have researchers who are both digital experts and subject specialists. But these so-called ‘hybrids’ are a rare breed, which in itself shows just how far digital humanities has to progress before we see projects of this kind successfully engaging researchers across the great divide.</p>
<p>Daniel Allington of the Open University’s Faculty of Education and Language Studies approached the issue of digital expertise and collaborative research from the rather different, but equally critical, perspective of funding. He placed the investigation into digital humanities in the context of a research culture that is increasingly being understood as the acquisition of external funding for the researcher’s employing institution. With research councils finding their budgets under pressure, their solution has been to offer fewer but larger grants, thereby cutting back on administration costs. It may be true, as Daniel Allington pointed out, that traditional humanities research tends to lose out on these terms because, ironically, by being for the most part extremely cheap, it is less attractive to funders. But the bigger point here is that funding councils across the board have got tired of investing in resources that only work for a small group of scholars; instead, they are increasingly looking for the kind of research culture (and accompanying infrastructure) which scientists have long taken for granted, and which implies both collaboration between scholars within a given domain and a concern for the public impact of research. Digital humanities is perhaps better placed than other fields within the broader discipline of humanities in responding to these concerns: it tends to involve large-scale collaboration between scholars of various expertise, using a medium that, by its very nature, is more oriented towards public engagement than a traditional scholarly print publication. Yet, if we are to use the digital humanities to think with, rather than simply engage in a flag waving exercise, we also need to be aware of the cost of this shift in funding model. Daniel Allington noted the general danger of research being distorted by having to chase the money: the humanities are not alone in facing this problem – how often do we hear prominent scientists insist on the importance of ‘blue skies’ research? – but it is perhaps particularly vulnerable, given the difficulty of quantifying what the humanities contribute to society. More practically, however, the hybrids so essential to successful digital humanities research run the risk of ending up as the IT specialists for the (tenured) humanist-managers, hired on short-term contracts and facing not inconsequential problems with career progression. Therefore, while collaborative research of the kind fostered by digital humanities is an extremely exciting prospect, those researchers lower down the food chain need their careers guiding like never before.</p>
<p>A problem specific to the digital humanities is the sheer size of the data now available to research, where the issue becomes ‘quick reading’ versus the more traditional ‘slow reading’ (to borrow the terms introduced by Ahuvia Kahane). As we adopt the scientific methods mentioned above to try to make sense of these data, we also need to be aware of what is at stake in using those digital tools: how the tools themselves can distort the research as much as any external funding agency. This point was brought home by Chris Bissell, who raised the question of the amount of research now being conducted in a virtual environment, such as the use of Google Earth by archaeologists to examine features hitherto unexplored, and pondered what was lost when users/students look at material on screen rather than go on an actual dig or consult the archives for themselves. This is an important question: the bottom line is that the research still needs to be done, that the digital tool is only a resource. It is also true that, without an awareness of what is at stake in setting up the search parameters, one is likely to be at the mercy of the proliferation of digital resources available at the end of a keyword search, a kind of faux-precise research that offers a shallow substitution for reading the actual document, for being immersed in the primary sources, whether that means physically turning over the dusty pages of a manuscript in situ or wading knee deep in mud surveying archaeological finds. On the other hand, it is also easy to fetishize the ‘real’ artefact and its physicality, whereas frequently it is the digital tool, particularly if one is handling it critically and self-reflexively, that can draw attention to the problem not only of the content being investigated but even the process of investigation itself. Moreover, there is also the potential for digital tools and techniques to revolutionize humanist methodology for the good: many investigations may well benefit from evidence that can be collated and analysed statistically, or results that can be reproduced – a key feature of scientific research. But the central motivating force behind humanistic research must remain interpretation, to which end digital tools ought to be applied.</p>
<p>As humanists, we need technologies that allow open-endedness, that preserve the ambiguity and nuance of our work, rather than render the data flat and colourless. The possibilities for the humanities to shape the technologies, such as by using data mining as an ongoing reflexive process, or to discover patterns that one is not looking for are recognized by powerful players such as Google, whose digital humanities Research Awards are aimed precisely at bringing humanistic research enquiries to bear on machine-aggregated data. It is a conversation, however, that humanities scholars need to get involved in, and not wait on the sidelines, where we will be far less able to influence the direction and purpose of digital development.</p>
<p>Above all, digital humanities has the capacity to reinvigorate the discipline of humanities by demanding a method of, to quote John Corrigan again, ‘productive unease’. In many ways, digital humanities is not a new discipline, but rather a means of connecting various strands of humanities research and integrating methods and data: go to any digital humanities conference, and you will be struck by the interdisciplinarity of the panels, which tend to be based around interconnectedness of methodology or technique, not subject matter, and hence do not always give a driving role to the research questions being asked. Moreover, digital humanities has the potential to be subversive of scholarship. It can bring together different scholarly spaces – the library, workspace, classroom and lecture-room – as well as lead the way in accessibility to and sharing of research. At a time when education budgets are being cut, engaging the public and making one’s research open is only going to become increasingly important.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1474022211428311"><title>The philosophy and politics of digital humanities</title>
<p>We are beginning to touch on some of the most interesting and intellectually challenging questions. A start has been made in identifying somewhat utilitarian issues about the extent to which the availability of digital technology (and promotion of its use by funding bodies) will determine not only which aspects of the Arts are the focus of research, but also the kind of research questions that are asked (and funded). But underlying this are more fundamental questions about shifts in the processes of research and the paradigms associated with them. In their awareness of such relationships, scientists seem to be ahead of arts researchers. The President of the Royal Society, Martin Rees, has initiated wider discussion about new ways in which large bodies of data might be used and the effect on the questions that might be asked and – even more important – what might count as answers.</p>
<p>The existence of significant collections of data allows comparative exercises in which different teams of researchers explore ‘what happens if’ the data are categorized and analysed in particular ways. Although allowance needs to be made for the fact that no collection of data has been assembled in a neutral way, there are surely rich possibilities for work that would speculate about paradigm shifts, both in constitutions of knowledge and in research methods and criteria. Interest in pattern construction and recognition might then be mined in order to look at key questions in the Arts and humanities, for example about disruptions of the received authority and hierarchy implicit in patterns of conceptualizing and reasoning.</p>
<p>For example, in the area of classical receptions, scholars investigate what the study of the ancient world of Greece and Rome involves and what is done with it, looking not for ‘lessons’ (not even from the disasters of history) but rather for stimulus to critical thinking. The justification of working with classical texts and contexts is that they are ‘good to think with’. Things that are ‘good to think with’ allow a metaphorical approach to relationships. They allow us to explore how figurative sites and tropes can be used in thinking. What might the symbiosis between metaphor and critical thinking imply for dialogue between digital humanities and the arts and humanities more widely? Two areas seem ripe for systematic critical examination. The first concerns constructions of knowledge and their relationship to deliberation.</p>
<p>The implications of digital technology for epistemology are beginning to be researched. The potential offered by technology for demolition and constant reconstruction of clusters and systems of knowledge opens sometimes startling associative possibilities. This is both threatening to academic authority and potentially liberating if – and only if – the students and other users are equipped to reflect on the new clusters that they create; that is, they do not merely accept these as reflecting a supposed ‘natural order’ of things but, like Plato in the <italic>Theaetetus</italic>, probe the definition of epistemology as ‘true belief together with an account’. Giving and tracing an account and comparing it with other accounts of shared experiences, texts, artefacts, etc. could well be one of the most valuable things that digital humanities can help us to develop.</p>
<p>A second urgent area is the examination of the Allure of Exceptionality. One of the major problems in all research (especially in the broad projects so beloved of the funding bodies) is how to select and research the particular and then link it to the meta question in such a way that the importance of the detailed research that has gone into it is preserved and critiqued: that is to say, it is in a dialogical relationship with the target research question.</p>
<p>However, specificities and their histories can harden into concepts of ‘exceptionality’ of various kinds, arising from the unexamined assumptions about the chronological, moral and cultural priority of, for example, historical and geographical traditions, languages, etc., often with dire political, social and intellectual consequences. The capacity of digital technology to map patterns across time, place and language and to present them for comparative purposes or to allow reconfiguration is potentially liberating. Nevertheless, there is a danger that digital approaches can themselves harden into a notion of exceptionality – almost a ‘whig view of progress’. Thus digital thinking could, in worst case, assimilate to the ‘vindicatory model’, a celebration of the modern that shades into complacency and repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474022211428311">Prendergast, 2011</xref>: 144–6). For example, it is too simplistic to create a map of progression (temporal and technological) from oral to print to digital. The overlaps and convergences are at least as important as the contrasts and provide good opportunities for further research.</p>
<p>Digital humanities provides spaces where constructions of exceptionality and the interactions between technologies and the thought patterns that underlie them can be brought into negotiation. Foucault developed the concept of <italic>heterotopia</italic> to suggest apparently foundational sites that can also serve as counter-sites for simultaneous representation, contestation and inversion of other sites within a culture and which are associated with systems of ‘opening’ and ‘closing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474022211428311">Foucault, 1986</xref>). The concept can be used as an abstract heuristic tool but it also offers materiality – in the case of digital humanities the opportunity for simultaneous representation and manipulation to simulate the ‘patterns’ that are embedded in situations of contest and exchange.</p>
<p>This can be a step in the re-examination of the positions of monism and plurality in thought patterns. It can correct the tendency in debased popular debate to collapse the concept of plurality into relativism, as well as leading to a much better informed approach to the relationship between ‘otherness’ and ‘commonality’ in thought and experience. Hannah Arendt pointed out ‘the most salient political features of human beings – that they are plural, that each of them is capable of new perspectives and new actions, and that they will not fit a tidy predictable model unless these political capacities are crushed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022211428311">Arendt, 1998</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>Digital technology and digital thinking could, of course, be hijacked in order to crush. One of the crucial roles of the arts and humanities is to shape digital research and the development and management of technology so that this does not happen. In gaining access to information and to debates as well as to more sophisticated patterning, human beings can engage with a range of material – texts and processes – that would simply be impossible in contexts confined to print. So the brain and the sensibility can learn to work self-reflexively with complex patterns of interaction and alternative ‘ways of seeing’ and ‘ways of thinking’ and then begin to grapple with issues of perspective, validity, compatibility and incommensurability; that is to say, there is no single uncontested organizing principle, whether in aesthetics, ethics, politics or religion. This is where Deleuze’s notion of ‘repetition’ (with a difference) is illuminating. In his 1968 work <italic>Différence et Répétition</italic>, he advances this as the basis for a world view that embraces both continuity and flux, replacing fixed identity and difference with a Heraclitean concept of repetition or return with a difference (you can’t put your foot into the same river twice …). Digital humanities can enable researchers and students to test out and compare the implications of different models of thinking. They can pick up the gaps and the silences as well as the ‘certainties’, and experiment with the challenges of ‘what if?’</p>
<p>For the arts and humanities now, digital technology and its use represent a ‘wake-up’ call. The choice is between a passive acceptance of digital – the equivalent of the deference culture in which ‘real’ arts research knows its place and waits to be spoken to – and, on the other hand, the vigorous exploitation of digital technology in the cause of critical thinking. That will involve not just hard work but intellectual risk taking, a willingness to re-examine revered paradigms and experiment with alternatives.</p>
<p>To end, here’s an image from Žižek. He explored the notion of a traumatic object – resulting from the organization of a community’s enjoyment of itself, an enjoyment that also involved terror at the prospect of being violated by The Other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474022211428311">Žižek, 1990</xref>). Žižek was thinking in terms of a particular kind of community, a nation. The image can, however, be applied metaphorically to our communities. On the one hand we have digital zealots who believe that everyone should use their toys but who do not engage with the scary threatening issues raised by critical thinking. On the other hand we have arts and humanities people who find pleasure in a self-centred existence but are in terror of … (You can fill in the end of the sentence for yourself; a prize for the best suggestion).</p>
<p>While it may be frustrating for digital humanities converts to see their non-specialist relatives plodding through the foothills through which they themselves have long since passed, we hope at least to have demonstrated the value of bringing humanities researchers into the debate and not leaving them behind. Of course, work still needs to be done to bridge the gaps in perception (in both directions). But we want to suggest that digital humanities should not inspire terror if we can make sure it is good to think with.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1474022211428311"><title>A view from ‘technology’</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>(Chris Bissell and Allan Jones)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We should like to begin by reflecting on a popular conception of technology, before looking specifically at ‘digital humanities’. In popular discussions, technology is often spoken of as though it were a ‘virtually autonomous agent of change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474022211428311">Smith and Marx (1994: xi)</xref>, or as ‘an independent power external to society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474022211428311">Feenberg, 2007</xref>: 57). In this view, technology evolves according to its own inner logic, and society takes the consequences. It is often associated with a millenarian belief that technology will usher in a new era of ‘community, decentralization, ecological balance, and social harmony’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474022211428311">Carey, 2009 [1970]</xref>: 88). As Carey and others have observed, this utopian view of technology has a long history – dating back at least to railways and steamships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474022211428311">Edgerton, 2006</xref>: xvi). The digital version is merely part of a continuing narrative:
<disp-quote>
<p>While the politicians struggle with the baggage of history, a new generation is emerging from the digital landscape free of many of the old prejudices. These kids are released from the limitation of geographic proximity as the sole basis of friendship, collaboration, play and neighbourhood. Digital technology can be a natural force drawing people into greater world harmony. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474022211428311">Negroponte, 1995</xref>: 230)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This view neglects much of what makes technology interesting as a field of study: that it unfolds in a world of unequal power and resources, that technology is not intrinsically benign, and that powerful interests are as capable of co-opting technology as ‘the kids’. It also ignores the history of technology itself. David Edgerton and other historians have pointed out that ‘technology’ is equated too often with progress, whereas what is often most interesting about technology is the perseverance of supposedly obsolete forms. The ‘old’ technologies of steam and coal power continued in widespread use – and continued to be economically and socially dominant – long after the introduction of newer technologies that were claimed to have superseded them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474022211428311">Edgerton, 2006</xref>: xiv–xviii). In a similar vein, sociologists of technology point out that technology and society are co-constructed: society certainly does not drive technology, but neither does technology drive society in the simplistic manner often assumed. It is well to bear in mind such critiques when looking at claims for the ‘new’ digital humanities.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1474022211428311"><title>The nature of digital scholarship</title>
<p>A question naturally arises as to whether ‘digital scholarship’ can be expected to have its own character, and, if so, how it will differ from more traditional scholarship. The preceding text suggests we should be sceptical of claims that there is a deterministic link between technology and the nature of a scholarship which uses it. Naturally we can expect scholarship and technology to be connected, but other factors will operate too.</p>
<p>Scholarship in the humanities is traditionally oriented towards evaluation. Humanities scholars seek, as an end point, to make claims about value, meaning or significance of a work, artefact or event; and they justify their claims with reference to evidence, to other scholarship, and to informed personal insight. This emphasis on evaluation contrasts with more scientifically oriented scholarship, where the emphasis is traditionally on arriving at facts about the natural world, or on making a contribution that moves scholarship in that direction. (Sometimes the latter process has, ironically, much in common with the humanities through the creation of spatial images, graphical maps, models and other representations as tools for contemplation and insight. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474022211428311">Bissell and Dillon (forthcoming, 2012</xref>).)</p>
<p>A natural concern in the humanities might be that the digital humanities could become less concerned with evaluation, and more concerned with the accumulation of quantified data, either for their own sake, or as a short-cut to evaluations based on, for example, an increasingly commoditized view of the humanities. We think this anxiety (which we share) can usefully be seen in a context of ‘managerialism’ – the belief that somewhat standardized managerial techniques can be applied to widely varying enterprises. A managerialist approach is likely to set a premium on quantifiable outputs of scholarship. Thus, although scholars might not assess each other’s work by the number of citations it gains or the number of publications it spawns, it is likely that their own work will be assessed managerially in precisely this way. What is more, digital technology is very well adapted to support this style of management. We suggest, therefore, that in thinking about the future of digital humanities, it is important to think about the role of digital technology in the way humanities projects are managed and assessed.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1474022211428311"><title>Archives</title>
<p>The digitization of, and online access to, archival collections offers an interesting case study of some of the practical issues relating to the digital humanities. The ability to access documents and images of artefacts remotely, and to carry out text searches, is clearly a great benefit to researchers; but any digitization is a representation, and any representation is an interpretation. At some point in the digitization process (or maybe at several points), decisions must be made about what needs to be captured and what is irrelevant. To give a trivial example, in the <italic>Times</italic> Digital Archive, images of the newspaper articles are what is technically known as ‘one-bit’. That is to say, the text is 100% black and the background paper is 100% white, and there is no shade of grey in between. A physical archive copy, however, would be grubby in places (to say nothing of being creased and torn). ‘One-bit’ representation eliminates the grubbiness, up to a point. Does this matter? Possibly not in the case of a newspaper, but possibly very much so with other types of documents, where something closer to a photographic image (that is, with many shades of grey or hue captured) might be preferred. In the latter case, decisions must then be made about how many shades to capture. The point we wish to make is that these decisions are intrinsic to digitization, and they have implications for cost, manageability and accessibility of the electronic archive that results. Digitization is not a neutral process, any more than photography is.</p>
<p>The transience of new media is frequently commented on. Whereas paper and vellum can last for hundreds of years, electronic forms seem destined to obsolescence. Many archivists are now resigned to the fact that every few years they will have to convert their electronic archives from format to format, as new ones come along and older ones become obsolete. As digital repositories increase massively in quantity and file size, choices are likely to have to be made about precisely which files to re-archive periodically. One of the authors of this article recalls being recently shown round an American university’s archive of film and videotape, some of it gradually becoming unusable, and hearing about the archivists’ periodic need to go cap-in-hand to benefactors and philanthropists in order to undertake further archival rescue work.</p>
<p>It is possible that with online digital archives there will be a change in the relationship between the researcher and the archivist. Many researchers will have benefited from the professional skills and experience of a human archivist, who is able to understand the researcher’s interests, and suggest avenues that might have been overlooked. If access becomes mainly online, what happens to the role of the archivist? Is it reduced to custody, without an advisory element? Email discussions between researcher and archivist seem to us a poor substitute for a developing face-to-face relationship of understanding and trust.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1474022211428311"><title>Intellectual property</title>
<p>Digital technology has proved somewhat problematic for existing intellectual property legislation. The ease with which identical, or near identical, digital copies can be made is well known. More subtle issues relate to areas where intellectual property legislation offers usage entitlements for which no permission is required from the rights-holder. Pre-eminent here is the notion of ‘fair dealing’ (or ‘fair use’ in the USA) in copyright law. Scholars and reviewers expect to be able to reproduce portions of a work under discussion without seeking permission. Increasingly, however, corporate producers of cultural artefacts impose ‘end-user agreements’ which make no allowance for fair dealing. In effect, through end-user agreements, producers are able to impose greater restrictions on users than law grants them; and they enforce these restrictions technologically through digital rights management (DRM) software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474022211428311">May, 2007</xref>). A somewhat similar issue relates to books in digital format. Buyers often find they do not have the rights they would expect to have if they had bought a paper copy, such as being able to give the book away or sell it.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1474022211428311"><title>‘Authentic’ software tools</title>
<p>By an ‘authentic’ software tool we mean a software tool not primarily intended for educational or research purposes. Classic examples would be video-, image- and sound-processing software. Such software is a ‘tool’ (or maybe ‘multipurpose tool’) in the sense that it is used by practitioners for executing well-defined tasks related to their field of practice. It is ‘authentic’ in the sense that practitioners actually use it – it is not a simulator.</p>
<p>We are struck by the way that using such tools successfully often requires a deep appreciation of high-level abstract concepts. Thus, although such software tools are not intended for educational use, we believe they can be used educationally in the exploration of these abstract concepts, and, indeed, have used them in this way in teaching material (Jones and Bissell, 2011). From an educational point of view, the particular benefits of using ‘authentic’ software tools in this way include: (i) fostering students’ understanding through ‘an active process of creating hypotheses and building new forms of understanding though activity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474022211428311">Mayes and de Freitas 2007</xref>: 17) – that is to say, constructivist learning; and (ii) providing an authentic context for learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022211428311">Brown et al. (1989)</xref> argue that ‘knowledge is situated, being in part a product of the activity, context and culture in which it is developed and used’. They liken conceptual knowledge to a set of tools. Only through mastery of tool use in authentic contexts does one come to a proper understanding of what the tool is for and how it is used.</p>
<p>We would encourage scholars in the humanities not to overlook this sort of tool. Many such tools can be usefully used to explore issues in the humanities, as well as in science and technology for which they were originally often designed.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1474022211428311" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The enormous power of digital tools for searching data, collating data, communication, and representation is generally understood, and some examples have been given here. The authors of the present article are as enthusiastic users of these tools as anyone for their own research. However, we wish to underline a few points.</p>
<p>Nothing is gained by perpetuating the utopian view of digital technology prevalent in popular discussion (and often eagerly seized on in managerial circles). Such a view of technology is not only naive, it is also unscholarly in relation to a growing body of excellent work in the history and sociology of technology.</p>
<p>A more sophisticated reading of technology recognizes that it unfolds in a world of norms and expectations which, although capable of change – partly as a result of technology – tend to change more slowly than the technology itself changes. The last few decades have seen an extraordinary growth of neo-liberal orthodoxy in politics and administration. Education has not escaped, as anyone working in the field will know. What this means for the humanities is not clear, though we suspect future historians may have much to say on the subject. For the present, we would wish to say that, as believers in a degree of social shaping where technology is concerned, technology surely carries an imprint of this prevailing ethos. Modern technology is conceived and produced in a world that often takes the neo-liberal perspective for granted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474022211428311">De Miranda, 2009</xref>). This is a world where evaluations based on other criteria than the utilitarian or economic can be hard to sustain. We suspect that, in this respect, the humanities and digital technology do not entirely point in the same direction.</p>
