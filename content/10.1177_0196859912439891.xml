<p>Do our contemporary technical images drive us toward a totalitarian, centrally programmed, discursive society? Or do such images shepherd us toward a more democratic, dialogic society? Is society hovering on the brink of automated, empty sameness? Or do our communication technologies perch society on the precipice of infinite human creativity? I begin with these questions because this is what author Vilém Flusser warns readers to expect from his essays: questions rather than answers; questions that “occasionally dress themselves up as answers” (p. 4).</p>
<p>In <italic>Into the Universe of Technical Images</italic>—originally published in German in 1985 and translated into English by Nancy Ann Roth—Flusser takes readers on a journey down a “twisting path through a thicket of problems” (p. 169) regarding the profound and fundamental changes brought about by the production and reproduction of technical images and the apparatuses that support them. These problems, presented in 20 brief and related essays, embody critical questions surrounding what Flusser deems a cultural revolution brought about by the proliferation of technical images—photographs, films, television and computer images—and away from the use of one-dimensional, linear texts, such as writing.</p>
<p>Each essay is its own chapter and focuses on one of these 20 problems; each chapter is titled with an infinitive (e.g., “To Imagine,” “To Interact,” “To Discuss,” “To Shrink”) to emphasize the outward momentum of these problems; each problem is dissected and illuminated with ample illustrations to move the reader toward careful reflection about the structure through which information is produced and reproduced in our media saturated culture. This assertion that the structure of information wields a strong influence on how we perceive and value the world around us situates Flusser as a media theorist in the tradition of Walter Benjamin, Marshall McLuhan, and Jean Baudrillard, though he is relatively lesser known among media studies scholars.</p>
<p>In his initial chapter, “To Abstract,” Flusser differentiates technical images (i.e., photographs) from traditional pictures (i.e., cave paintings) based on the dimensionless state of technical images as an assemblage of particles rather than two-dimensional structures. In this way, Flusser argues that technical images are completely new media, ultimately constituting a cultural revolution, changing the way we conceptualize and interact with the world. According to Flusser, before writing, people thought in prehistorical ways and pictures carried information; with the advent of writing, a linear medium, a historical consciousness unfolded.</p>
<p>With the explosion of technical images through such channels as computers, video telephones, and digital cameras Flusser contends that a posthistorical, structural way of thinking has emerged, and we occupy an “illusory world” (p. 38) in which we increasingly act as a function of these technical images. Here, Flusser makes the provocative statement that “history,” as reflected in linear texts, may merely have been a diversion between the worlds of traditional pictures and technical images.</p>
<p>Later, in the chapter, “To Interact,” he advances this notion with the statement:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The current interaction between images and human beings will lead to a loss of historical consciousness in those who receive the images and, as a result, also to a loss of any historical action that could result from the reception of the image. (p. 60)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to Flusser, technical images are not only an obstruction to history but also the source of destruction for traditional social groups. In the chapter, “To Scatter,” Flusser elucidates the paradox of people whose individuality may be stripped away by their complete socialization through technical images, but yet drift into the corners of society with limited social awareness through the isolation that such images bring. This complete socialization without social awareness is the product of what Flusser calls the “projective orientation” such images have toward people: Images are received, directed or thrust toward a person, more projectors than reflectors, a discursive feedback loop that turns even the unwilling into receivers (p. 52).</p>
<p>On a more optimistic note, in the chapter, “To Discuss,” Flusser balances this apprehension regarding history and meaningful social connectivity with the possibility that the discursive nature of technical images could give way to more dialogical uses of such technology. He posits that telematics (<italic>telecommunications</italic> and <italic>informatics</italic>) could be “powerful tools to oppose the discursive society” for people could turn to such technology to engage in dialogue through images, creating what Flusser calls a “society of artists” (p. 85). Later, in “To Celebrate,” he extrapolates this idea by saying that a dialogical programming of image-producing apparatuses would eradicate centralized senders and that each individual would be able to program his or her own apparatus, that each person will be able to program rather than be programmed.</p>
<p>Flusser fulfills his initial warning that each essay, each chapter, opens a host of questions regarding the present and future influence of technical images on how human beings interact with each other and the world. These “questions,” however, are often well disguised as fairly polemical statements: “The goal of the political demonstration is not to change the world but to be photographed” (p. 56); “the Che Guevaras and Khomeinis, and those who count as revolutionaries are really entertainers” (p. 66); “history is about to dry up, and this exactly because images are feeding on it, because they sit on historical threads like parasites, recoding them into circles” (p. 59).</p>
<p>Flusser’s essayistic, even paradoxical, way of asking questions by making bold proclamations is in itself a means of establishing a dialogue with the reader, inviting debate, critical reflection, seeing the structure of the production and distribution of information as central to the way we live and understand the world. In his final chapter, “Chamber Music”—the only title not an infinitive, but a noun—Flusser proposes a scenario:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>People will sit in separate cells, playing with their fingertips on keyboards, staring at tiny screens, receiving, changing, and sending images . . . People will be in contact with one another through their fingertips and so form a dialogical net, a global superbrain, whose function will be to calculate and compute improbable situations into pictures. (p. 161)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here, Flusser makes a very prescient statement regarding the future of technical images—or what was the future when he wrote this work in 1985, but is today our present. He focuses, too, on the technological shrinking of our information structures, forecasting that the “telematic superbrain will be enormous because it will be a mosaic composed entirely of tiny stones” (p. 132).</p>
<p>With the accuracy of such portents and the magnitude of the questions posed throughout each essay, media scholars would benefit from a close reading of <italic>Into the World of Technical Images</italic>. Though Flusser himself acknowledges the theoretical complexity of the subject matter, he nevertheless encourages readers to make the intellectual journey. In a world where such structurally complex systems are often functionally simple—think how easy it is to turn on your computer or TV—Flusser has provided a series of essays with functional complexity, essays that press scholars toward a close examination of transcendent issues of media ecology, created by the ever expanding presence of technical images in culture.</p>
