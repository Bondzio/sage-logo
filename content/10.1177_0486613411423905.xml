<p>Cogently written for the generally educated reader, Paul Davidson’s <italic>The Keynes Solution</italic> is, first, a critique of mainstream macroeconomics in the light of the financial panic of 2007 and the ensuing global economic crisis, and second, an argument for the reform of U.S. and global capitalism as prefigured in John Maynard Keynes’s works and policy initiatives.</p>
<p>Davidson deserves respect for his defense of the interpretive tradition of Keynes associated with the works of Robinson, Kalecki, and Kaldor, which sees Keynes’s <italic>opus</italic> as fundamentally incompatible with the approach of the classical school, an approach carried over to today’s dominant schools of macroeconomics in the English-speaking world, the New Classical and the New Keynesian schools, the former a more direct extension of the classical doctrines and the latter an outgrowth of the “neoclassical synthesis” attempted by Hicks, Samuelson, and Modigliani.</p>
<p>Editor of the <italic>Journal of Post-Keynesian Economics</italic>, regarded by many as an apt interpreter of Keynes’s economic doctrines and overall philosophical stance, Davidson is a professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and currently an invited professor at the New School for Social Research in New York City. One can hardly think of a more capable defender of the relevance of Keynes’s ideas in our times.</p>
<p>Much in the book is of great value to radicals. Generally speaking, if capitalism is to be overthrown, the collective agency to take up such an epoch-making task must develop itself through the struggles that working people—with the ideological and political resources at their disposal—immediately wage. Typically, the political horizon of these struggles is the reform of capitalism, not its subversion. Thus, to the extent Davidson’s proposals help advance equity and democracy in the world, they intersect with the radical agenda.</p>
<p>The flip side is that Davidson’s objections to actually existing capitalism, as technically sophisticated as they appear, are in essence superficial, since they accept as given the fundamental bases of capitalism: the private appropriation of productive wealth and the gaping inequities upon which the global social order, modern markets, and states are erected. Davidson’s critique is confined to the mode in which U.S. and global capitalism has been managed since the 1970s, i.e. the economic policies conducted by governments and central banks since then, especially by the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve, and the theories that rationalize such economic policies.</p>
<p>In fact, for Davidson, the theories have primacy. In his view, prevailing economic policies ultimately follow, not from the vested interest of conflicting social classes in particular historical contexts, but from the ideologies that percolate from academia into governing circles. After all, as Keynes quipped, “the ideas of economists and political philosophers … are more powerful than is commonly understood.” Consequently, what is required to transition to Keynes’s “civilized economic society” is not that the workers of the world appropriate and remake the conditions in which they work and live, but only that correct (Keynesian) ideas grip the minds of those in high positions of power.</p>
<p>Consequently, the book is an “essay in persuasion.” Its structure and style flow from Davidson’s neo-Platonic belief in the power of ideas, which he sketches in the first chapter. The second chapter aims at debunking the conventional account of recent U.S. economic history, especially of the Great Depression and its aftermath. Chapters 3 and 4 refute the notion that lower taxes, reduced public spending, and deregulation lead to short-run stability and long-term prosperity. Here, Davidson targets what he deems the foundations upon which the edifice of modern macroeconomics is erected, namely, <italic>ergodicity</italic> and—closely related—informational market efficiency.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 blasts the prevailing scaremongering on deficits, public debt, and inflation. Chapters 6 through 8 lay out in some detail Davidson’s proposals to go beyond recovery and onto the path to “global economic prosperity” via U.S. policy, regulatory, and institutional reform, along with the remaking of the international systems of trade and payments building on Keynes’s Bretton Woods initiatives. Chapter 9 argues the ethical case for a “civilized economic society,” i.e. a capitalist society with social democratic checks and balances. Chapter 10, a brief, elegiac biography of Keynes, concludes the book. A 19-page appendix describes why, according to Davidson, Keynes is still largely absent from and misunderstood in the U.S. academy.</p>
<p>A consequence of the author’s claim that ideas rule policymaking is that his entire book stands or falls not so much on the plausibility of its reform proposals as on the validity of its objections to economic orthodoxy, which Davidson contrasts with Keynes’s own views. This is why it is worth considering these objections in detail.</p>
<p>Take his critique of <italic>ergodicity</italic>. Plainly, this is the assumption that our economic future is, in some fundamental sense, a replica of the past and, hence, amenable to probabilistic estimation on the basis of historical data. This notion was, prominently, the target of chapter 12 of Keynes’s <italic>General Theory</italic>. To refute it, Keynes points to the fact that the choices of individuals purchasing durable goods in a capitalist society (more specifically, businesses acquiring fixed capital items) are bets whose ultimate success or failure hinge on the behavior of those individuals (and businesses) taken collectively. The ability of capitalists to derive returns from capital accumulation requires that the stars of their economic future align properly when these stars are not cosmic bodies on oblivious trajectories, but the very economic moves of all participants in the economy.</p>
<p>In fact, this argument on the paradoxical nature of social life can be generalized: since what keeps any society together is the cooperation among people (trading in markets being only a particular, rather perverse form of bridging the overall social division of labor), the choices individuals make are self-fulfilling in the sense that their outcome depends on whether they, collectively, engage in or withdraw from their communal or civic life, trade, etc.</p>
<p>In the narrow case that Keynes entertains, individuals choosing their spending levels do not face the regular objectivity of the physical world, indifferent to human pretence. The economic environment is not given but endogenous. And when social institutions fail, collective behavior subverts the <italic>status quo</italic>, or particular individuals (or institutions) are powerful enough to influence collective behavior or impose conditions on it, the paradoxes become apparent. From time to time, economists rediscover these chicken-and-egg “anomalies” under various guises. In microeconomics examples of them are increasing returns, monopolistic and oligopolistic behavior, and the economic effects of networks. In macroeconomics, there is endogenous growth, policy ineffectiveness, and the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu theorem (pulling the rug under the feet of the microfoundations approach). In econometrics, there are identification problems, simultaneity, etc.</p>
<p>Indeed, the objectivity of the social outcomes that individuals confront is <italic>self-referential</italic>. Such is the general nature of <italic>social</italic> objectivity. So, how can plain probabilistic calculation—say, of the kind used to determine disaster insurance premiums—help people pin down this shifting kind of objectivity? It is like trying to guess the outcome of a coin toss only to find that in its trajectory the coin mutated into dice or a deck of cards.</p>
<p>It is of note that in <italic>Capital</italic>, a book that predated Keynes’s <italic>General Theory</italic> by over six decades, a work Keynes dismissed as “scientifically erroneous” and “obsolete,” Karl Marx argued that the robustness of the capitalist social order, i.e. its superficial appearance as a hardened fact of nature, was not sheer illusion that a mere collective change of mind could dispel, but in the last analysis the result of the fragmentation and conformity of the producers to the <italic>status quo</italic>. Only when the producers, acting in concert, took direct control over social conditions that resulted from their cooperation, transforming at once their circumstances and themselves, would the ossified texture of social life under capitalism reveal itself to be a mirage.</p>
<p>Perhaps, to modern readers, Keynes’s narrower and elegantly stated case against the ergodic assumption would seem more compelling. Yet, one wonders why, three-quarters of a century later, his case proved so ineffective in influencing its intended audiences: economists and policymakers in the globally-hegemonic English-speaking societies. Davidson bemoans the “perversion” of Keynesianism after World War II, manifest in the fact that no U.S. president, from Roosevelt to Obama, has properly implemented Keynesian economics. Clearly, the power of Keynes’s ideas was no antidote to their alleged perversion, which the author traces to earth-shattering events such as Samuelson’s misappropriation of the “Keynesian” academic badge. The power of Keynes’s argument proved to be so flimsy as to allow for petty academic intrigues to blunt its edge.</p>
<p>It is not only that the appeal of Keynes’s ideas is trumped by the clout of vested interests. More fundamentally, there is no way around the ergodic assumption! However a society organizes its economic affairs, to the extent the productive power of their labor permits this, people will take action in anticipation of its outcome. It is tautological to say that forethought (however tentative) is at the core of all purposeful human activity, i.e. of human labor in general. And forethought can only be informed by past experience. As Søren Kierkegaard noted: “life must be lived forward, but can only be understood backwards.” Merely “knowing” in the abstract that the objectivity of social life is self-fulfilling provides no clue to individual behavior. People need to anticipate the concrete consequences of their actions to the extent possible. They only have their experiences to determine whether in the next instant everything solid will remain solid or melt into air. That their social life is frequently disrupted, that occasionally or frequently the disruptions include financial panics and crises, alters nothing fundamental: all people can do is update their “information sets,” learn to expect occasional or frequent disruptions, and keep going.</p>
<p>Consider also Keynes’s theory of “liquidity preference,” which Davidson paraphrases in his fourth chapter. Essentially, the idea is that, after they choose whether to save (as opposed to spend) out of their current income, people decide which part of their accumulated savings or wealth to keep in the form of money, a decision only partly made on the basis of predictable factors, e.g. their estimated needs for cash transactions. This “portfolio” decision is mostly driven by psychological whims, subject to collective contagion. And whether these individual decisions pan out financially, or not, depends on the state of the economy that emerges out of the aggregation of those very individual decisions. The swings of spenders from exuberance to gloom lead them, as a crowd, to shrink and expand suddenly their money holdings, in the latter case unraveling markets, causing unemployment and economic paralysis.</p>
<p>Davidson’s (and Keynes’s) notion of <italic>liquidity</italic> is key. Conventionally, “liquidity” refers to the “moneyness” of goods. More precisely, it is the probability of “liquidating” (converting into money, a generally acceptable good) a given piece of wealth in a given period of time within a given price range. In Davidson’s account (as in Keynes’s), “liquidity” in general—as opposed to the particular factors that drive people to prefer more or less of it (the level of economic activity, the interest rate, and the state of the “animal spirits”)—is a primitive category, along with the premise of capitalism (a “market oriented, entrepreneurial, monetary economy”).</p>
<p>Davidson conflates the <italic>legal</italic> fiction of fiat money with the <italic>economic</italic> basis for the existence of money in general: “Money,” writes Davidson, “is that thing that the government has decided will settle all legal contractual obligations” (48); indeed, in the same way in which the French language is “that thing that the Académie Française decides will allow French citizens to communicate with one another.”</p>
<p>Similarly, Davidson sees the “liquidity” of financial obligations in the markets as ruled by decree: “stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange,” while not money, argues Davidson, “are liquid because the exchange has rules and institutions that are designed to assure people that they can always buy or sell as much stock as they desire while also assuring them that the market price will always change in an orderly manner” (51). “Liquidity” flows from the rules governing markets and, ultimately, the government. If only.</p>
<p>Consider the financial panic that erupted in September 2008. Some called it a global “crisis of liquidity,” insofar as the trade of a widening array of financial assets was disrupted due to the conspicuous absence of buyers. Sellers offered their instruments for sale at prices on the low side of the normal range, with no takers for the time being. In Davidson’s view, an event of this type results from the lack of organization and regulation of these markets. With market makers, deep-pocketed financial institutions ready to enter any solicited transaction, buying when others sell or selling when others buy to ensure trade continuity in a market, the disorderliness can be averted. But, what if the market maker goes insolvent? Then, Davidson suggests, central banks should intervene by providing funds to restore market making. In turn, the solvency of the central bank is backed up by the full power of the state. The state is Davidson’s—and Keynes’s—<italic>deux ex machina</italic>.</p>
<p>But, probe in the other direction (as Davidson does not do): why does a market dry up in the first place? Say, why could Lehman Brothers not remain solvent by selling off its portfolio of subprime mortgage-backed securities at prices within the normal range? Clearly, because there were no immediate buyers at prices within range. Buyers feared default chances were higher than those justifying within-range prices. Under the (ergodic) assumption that, historically, prices and rental property income (or prices and personal income) tend to co-vary within a rather narrow interval, by 2006 there was an overstock of houses (a “bubble”) amounting to (according to Dean Baker’s estimate) 8 trillion dollars! The housing bubble, reinforced by a credit bubble, metastasized into a gigantic asset bubble, until buyers vanished.</p>
<p>In Davidson’s view, the crisis resulted from the absence of properly enforced regulation and liquidity guaranteed by the central bank or government: a consequence of the triumph of the doctrines of classical, free-market macroeconomics. In this institutional context, an ebb in “animal spirits”—after a bout of exuberance—led to a sudden shift in the individual allocation of wealth in favor of more money, which collectively backfired by crashing asset prices, credit flows, and the economy. Accordingly, the crisis can be overcome in the short run with a suitable management of the money supply, public spending, and prompt institutional reforms. In the long run, crises of this sort can be prevented by designing institutions to (partially) provide for social insurance, thus reducing systemic risk.</p>
<p>To Davidson, liquidity in financial markets flows entirely from the rules of an exchange and legal assurances given by market makers and, ultimately, by the state. No note that liquidity (or lack thereof) in, say, the credit default swap market is only symptomatic of disproportions down the food chain. No note that the ability of CDS holders to sell in an orderly fashion relied on working-class borrowers persuading creditors of their ability to service their contracts, which in turn hinged on the price of their houses and on their job and income prospects, all of which gambled on the overall state of the economy: the outcome of people’s economic behavior.</p>
<p>In fact, the crisis was the eruption of massive, cumulative, interlocking disproportions in various markets fostered—in the last analysis—by profit seeking, a drive inherent to capitalism. True, in Keynes’s conception of capitalism, sectoral imbalances, however severe, need not erupt into a massive widespread crisis. Markets have no inherent device to prevent the imbalances from growing bigger by feeding into themselves, to the point of fraying the cloth of capitalist society. And, once these disproportions get large, the “self-correcting mechanism of the markets” cannot be relied upon to fix them at a reasonable cost. Now, if the state regulates markets and is ready to intervene in them when they fail, the disproportions can be either kept from growing large or, when they grow large, can be resolved without triggering a generalized disruption. Social cooperation via markets imposes excessive costs on society if not complemented by social cooperation via the existing political institutions. However, a fact that Davidson does not examine is that the ability of the existing state to paper over massive sectoral disproportions is finite: constrained by its spending power, its taxing power, the state of the economy, its ability to enforce the law, in turn all bound by the productive power of labor and the conformity of the producers to the social order.</p>
<p>The “liquidity” of goods—including wealth, money, and labor power—lies in the proportionality of supplies and demands in their markets, and—since these markets depend on one another—on the overall ability of capital to reproduce itself, the process that Marx stylized with his formula M-C-M’. In other words, <italic>liquidity</italic> lies in the ability of the “invisible hand” of markets and the visible hand of the state to coordinate a smooth allocation of society’s economic resources, of assuring adequate proportions in market supplies and demands, in the correspondence between taxing power of the state and the payment disposition of the citizenry, etc. In the last analysis, liquidity depends on the acquiescence of workers to the social order.</p>
<p>The continuity of social life is premised on the recurrent unity of production and consumption. Private appropriation, trade, credit, and profit making do not alter this fact inherent to the human condition; all they do is fragment production and consumption without abolishing their necessary unity. Split into privately managed, for-gain affairs, production and consumption become turbulent organic processes that continuously reconfigure the economic environment behind the people’s backs. Still, they must reconcile socially, through markets or political coordination. As long as social life flows and disruptions are managed smoothly, a sense of normalcy and even exuberance prevails. Yet it is then that the centrifugal forces of private ownership pull each piece of the social whole apart from the rest to its snapping point. A <italic>crisis</italic>—as Marx noted—is the sudden and violent reassertion of the unity of the entire process of social reproduction under capitalism when its parts get dislocated beyond a limit.</p>
<p>The share of wealth individuals hold in monetary form, as opposed to alternative legal claims over future value, is a lagging indicator of the continuity of social life under capitalism, the smoothness or roughness with which existing markets coordinate the allocation of people’s economic resources. Keynes and Davidson do not clarify how money accomplishes this feat. In fact, as Marx noted, money—its currency—is not agency, but reflection of the social metabolism bridging the social division of labor. In Davidson’s account, liquidity flows from the power of the state while, in fact, liquidity is the appearance of fluidity in the reproduction of wealth and social life under capitalism adhered to an object—be it gold or fiat money issued by the state—as if it were physically inherent to it. The world upside down!</p>
<p>Davidson’s proposals to reform capitalism cannot supersede the ergodic assumption. Premised on the ergodicity of regulations, of legal and political institutions—ultimately, the state—they (partially) shift the ground away from markets and towards the legal and political sphere. Davidson does not note that, although in different ways, these spheres of capitalist social life are also subject to self-reference. The objectivity of state coercion is no less an illusion—and no less a hardened reality—than the objectivity of market phenomena. States also experience unexpected crises and meltdowns.</p>
<p>Perhaps, by shifting focus to the legal and political sphere, Davidson’s proposals make it easier for people to realize that, ultimately, the effective choices involved are not limited to individual transactions conducted via markets, but that, they are—by action or omission—direct collective choices involving a political <italic>class struggle</italic> to restructure society. One should note also that, historically in the United States (though not necessarily everywhere or internationally), the experience of Keynesianism—perverted or not—was accompanied by a relative reduction in inequality, while the reign of monetarism and New Classical macroeconomics (“neoliberalism”) correlated with an obscene dispersion in wealth distribution.</p>
<p>However, one should remain wary of Davidson’s reform proposals insofar as they are explicitly premised on the permanence of capitalism. The reforms themselves need not be a step forward in the overall social struggle. It all depends on whether or not, and to what extent, they relate to the concrete needs and political motion of working people. Because, insofar as the social divisions and inequities at the root of capitalism remain intact, collective choices aimed at altering the legal, regulatory framework of the system can only give expression to these divisions and inequities.</p>
<p>Davidson’s fetishization of the state vitiates his reform proposals. His “path to global prosperity” requires that, <italic>inter alia</italic>, international trade and capital imbalances be checked by an institutional arrangement whereby countries acquiesce not to run persistent surpluses or, if and when they do, to spend or have their excess reserves confiscated (the “last resort is the equivalent of a 100 percent tax on a nation’s excessive liquidity,” p. 139). Basically, Davidson proposes a contradiction in terms, namely that capital, the <italic>private</italic> command over productive wealth (including labor), be subordinated to the <italic>public</italic> good. In a divided society, especially in turbulent times, the notion of “public” good is an arena of the class struggle. Nowhere does Davidson evince an understanding of these implications.</p>
<p>In a global capitalist society, i.e. a society ruled by wealth owners, the only scenario under which the rulers would accept expropriation on any significant scale is under threat of a mass rebellion endangering not only their capitals, but the capital relation itself. Davidson conceives his proposal of a “civilized economic society” as consistent with capitalism. He does not realize that the only power capable of realizing his vision of a reformed capitalism is not the ability of his ideas to persuade, but a critical mass of organized, self-educated workers in political motion. But if working people are to rise politically, there is no necessary reason why they should content themselves with the reformed capitalism that Davidson prescribes. Potentially, their political motion carries along the impetus to abolish capital altogether and dispose consciously and democratically over all productive wealth.</p>
