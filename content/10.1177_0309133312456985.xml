<p>This short book comes from the same stable as a series of titles that offer concise introductions to subjects within the Earth and environmental sciences, including geology, palaeontology, and meteorology. All books in the series are produced well, with a smart design incorporating full colour.</p>
<p>
<italic>Introducing Geomorphology</italic> is not a textbook. As the blurb states, it ‘provides a structured, well illustrated and easily accessible introduction to the science of geomorphology for those with an adult curiosity about how the landscape was formed or for those contemplating a course of formal study in physical geography, geology or environmental sciences’. The content of <italic>Introducing Geomorphology</italic> follows a reasonably logical structure, and certainly a structure that conveys the basics of geomorphology to the novice. The book opens by examining the nature of geomorphology, focusing on what landforms are, the importance of scales of time and space, the basic forces driving geomorphic change, and approaches to the subject matter of geomorphology. It moves on to discuss in turn global-scale geomorphology (global plate tectonic and climate contexts and the interactions between them); regional-scale geomorphology (regional-scale structures and processes and landscape evolution), and local-scale geomorphology (as seen in weathering, slope, fluvial, aeolian, glacial and coastal systems). A fifth chapter probes timescales and landscape evolution in more detail, with examples of late Quaternary landscapes in Cumbria and longer-term landscape change in southeast Spain. A final chapter considers the connections of geomorphology with humans with sections on human impacts on geomorphic systems, applied geomorphology, and geomorphology in education and research. The author covers all this material in an appropriate amount of detail for the readership and conveys the basics of the subject in an accessible manner. A glossary provides careful definitions of important terms, which are highlighted in the main body of the text. This and other devices, such as boxes and a good number of tables and diagrams, aid understanding. A book of this size with its avowed aims cannot be comprehensive. Nonetheless, there are important topics that perhaps deserved a mention – tropical landscapes and long-term geomorphology (much longer than the timescales covered in the book) are cases in point.</p>
<p>Although the core of the book fulfils its aims, the short section on further reading, while listing some useful books, fails to point the reader to sources of information on 21st-century geomorphological teaching and research. The recommended school texts date from the 1970s and seem far too old to be of much use; there are more recent university-level texts than the two given; and the ‘specialist field’ books include just two from the 2000s. In addition, the three ‘classic’ books mentioned are indeed true classics in geomorphology, but perhaps the novice reader should be cautioned that they contain some very outdated ideas and that they are not all easy reading. I feel that the author could easily and usefully address these issues in a revised printing.</p>
<p>It is probably true to say that the average lay reader has no, or very little, understanding of geomorphology. Yet the success of the BBC’s <italic>Coast</italic> series in the UK attests to the appeal that landforms have in the public psyche. It is unquestionably difficult to write an introduction to the subject of geomorphology for the uninitiated, and several pitfalls need sidestepping: the book needs to be written in a compelling and engaging way; it needs to cover the basics without oversimplification; and it needs to avoid jargon without sacrificing too much of the language characterizing geomorphological discourse. With this in mind, I feel that <italic>Introducing Geomorphology</italic> compares unflatteringly in some respects with its only competitor – <italic>Landscapes and Geomorphology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309133312456985">Goudie and Viles, 2010</xref>) – which was also written to introduce geomorphology to a non-specialist audience. <italic>Introducing Geomorphology</italic> looks better, with plenty of colour plates and some colour diagrams, and unquestionably covers a good range of geomorphological terms and ideas; but <italic>Landscapes and Geomorphology</italic> is easier to read, is more engaging, and has less of a textbook feel to it. Nonetheless, they both have their strong points and I would advise anyone wishing to find out about geomorphology to buy and read both.</p>
