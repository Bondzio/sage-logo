<p>Effectiveness of four new silane coupling agents in solution styrene butadiene rubber–based silica tire tread compounds were evaluated with respect to two commercial silane coupling agents. The new silane coupling agents investigated were 1-[3-(octanoylthio) propyl]-1,1,3,3,3-pentaethoxy-1,3-disilapropane (S1), bis[3-(octanoylthio)-1-propyl]-diethoxysilane (S2), 5-(triethoxysilylpropylthia)-2-potassium-1,3,4-thiadiazolate (S3) and 2,5-(triethoxysilylpropylthia)-1,3,4-thiadiazole (S4), and the two commercial silanes used for the comparison were bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulphide (Si69) and 3-octanoylthio-1-propyltriethoxysilane (NXT). The chemical structure of S1 and S2 silanes was based on the NXT silane. S3 is a monofunctional silane, whereas S4 is a bifunctional silane based on the chemical structure of S3. The effectiveness of the coupling agents were found to be varying for different properties of the rubber compounds. The S3 and S4 silane compounds were having shorter cure time and higher maximum torque values compared with other compounds; however, the tensile strength and the tanδ values indicative of tire performance were lower than that of the other silane compounds. The NXT, S1 and S2 silane compounds showed higher tanδ at 0°C and lower tanδ at 60°C, compared with the other compounds, indicative of improved wet skid resistance and lowered rolling resistance of these compounds. The Si69 compound showed higher tensile properties and lower abrasion when compared with the other compounds; however, the tanδ values for the tire performance were slightly lower to the NXT, S1 and S2 silane compounds.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the introduction of silica-reinforced tire tread by European tire maker Michelin in 1992,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095244312439489">1</xref>
</sup> there has been a lot of research on silica-reinforced tire tread instead of the traditional carbon black-reinforced tire tread. Silica was found to be better in imparting low rolling resistance, improved wet traction, low heat buildup and improved abrasion resistance to tire tread when compared with carbon black. In addition, the basic raw material for precipitated silica is sand and the manufacturing process is associated with less environmental issues when compared with that of carbon black, which is manufactured by burning of petroleum resources and the process is not environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>Most of the studies on silica tire tread compounds have formulations consisting of a medium or high vinyl solution polymerized styrene-butadiene rubber (S-SBR) copolymer as the main elastomer, silica as the main filler and a silane coupling agent as the silica modifier.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095244312439489">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095244312439489">2</xref>

</sup> The S-SBR is preferred over emulsion polymerized-SBR in silica reinforced tire as it provides favorable balance of rolling resistance and wet skid resistance in combination with silica.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095244312439489">4</xref>
</sup> Precipitated grades of silica are used as the silica reinforcing filler, as the precipitation process of silica has the advantages such as better control of particle size, porosity and specific surface area and cost benefit. In case of coupling agents, bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulphide (Si69) is the most common.</p>
<p>The presence of silanol groups (hydroxyl groups) on the silica surface makes the surface polar and hinders good dispersion and wetting of silica in nonpolar rubber like S-SBR; therefore, the surface characteristics of silica has to be modified for using in rubber compounds. Silane coupling agents have been the efficient and widely used modifiers for silica in tire tread compounds.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095244312439489">1</xref>
</sup>
<sup>–6</sup> Sulfur-containing silanes are particularly desired in diene-based rubber compounds as the sulfur atom in silane can form chemical bond with rubber molecule during vulcanization. The Si69<sup>

</sup>
<sup>–6</sup> and 3-octanoylthio-1-propyltriethoxysilane (NXT)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095244312439489">7</xref>
</sup> are widely used sulfur-containing commercial silanes. Extensive research has been reported on Si69 coupling agents, the steps involved in the reaction between silica and Si69 were reported in a series of articles.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095244312439489">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095244312439489">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095244312439489">6</xref>
</sup> The application of the Si69 is also the key factor for silica being the successful replacement of carbon black as the main reinforcing filler in the tread compound of the “green tire.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095244312439489">1</xref>
</sup> The NXT silane is a blocked mercaptosilane, where the sulfur atom of the mercaptosilane part is blocked with an octanoyl group. The blocking of the mercaptosilane part by octanoyl group reduces premature release of sulfur from the coupling agent to cause some premature vulcanization of the compound. It has been reported that a natural rubber (NR) compound with NXT silane is more resistant to scorching before curing when compared with an NR compound with Si69 silane.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095244312439489">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In this article, we compare the effect of four new silane coupling agents in silica reinforced tire tread rubber compound against the two well-known commercial silanes Si69 and NXT. The four new silane coupling agents are 1-[3-(octanoylthio) propyl]-1,1,3,3,3-pentaethoxy-1,3-disilapropane (S1), bis[3-(octanoylthio)-1-propyl]-diethoxysilane (S2), 5-triethoxysilylpropylthia-2-potassium-1,3,4-thiadiazolate (S3) and 2,5-(triethoxysilylpropylthia)-1,3,4-thiadiazole (S4). The chemical structures of these coupling agents are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095244312439489">Figure 1</xref>. The chemical structure of S1 and S2 are related to NXT in such a way that the S1 contains one more Si atom and two more ethoxy groups compared with the NXT for improved bonding between the silane and silica, whereas in the case of S2 silane, one more 3-(octanoylthio) propyl group is attached with the Si atom in place of one of the ethoxy groups of the NXT silane, in an effort to increase the bonding between the silane and rubber molecule. The chemical structures of new silanes S3 and S4 are also related to each other as the S4 is a bifunctional or dipodal silane-containing similar functional groups as that of the monofunctional silane S3.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>The S-SBR used in this study was SOL-6360 S grade of Khumo Petrochemical Ltd (South Korea), with contents of styrene 29.50 wt%, vinyl 62.50 wt% and aromatic oil 37.5 phr. The molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the rubber determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) analysis were 576,393 g/mol and 1.787, respectively. The raw Moony viscosity (ML (1 + 4) at 100°C) of the rubber was 61.6 and glass transition temperature (<italic>T</italic>
<sub>g</sub> ) was −30°C. The amorphous precipitated silica used in this study was Zeosil<sup>®</sup> 115-GR obtained from Rhodia Korea Ltd (South Korea) and has a BET surface area of 115 m<sup>2</sup>/g. The new silane coupling agents, S1 and S2 were newly developed noncommercial samples supplied by JSI Silicone Co. (Korea) and the silanes, S3 and S4 were newly developed noncommercial samples supplied by Ischem Co. (Korea). The new silanes were developed by a collaborative research work involving the authors and the corresponding companies. The two commercial silane coupling agents used in this study were Si69 (Changzhou Wuzhou Chemical Co., Ltd, China) and NXT (Momentive Performance Materials Korea Co. Ltd, Korea). The other rubber additives used were <italic>N</italic>-isopropyl-<italic>N</italic>′-phenyl-1,4-phenylene diamine (antioxidant 3C), <italic>N</italic>-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazole sulphonamide (accelerator CZ), diphenyl guanidine (accelerator DPG), ZnO (an activator), stearic acid (an activator) and elemental sulfur (a curing agent), which were procured locally from Korea.</p>

<title>Mixing</title>
<p>Mixing of the rubber and additives according to the recipe given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095244312439489">Table 1</xref> were carried out in two stages in a B-type Banbury mixer (Mix-LABO of Moriyama Company Ltd, Hyogo, Japan). In the first stage, initial chamber temperature of the mixer was set at 130°C and the rotor speed at 60 r/min. The S-SBR is introduced first to the mixing chamber and then the other additives are added in a sequence as follows: ZnO and stearic acid (at 0.5 min), silica and coupling agent (at 1.5 min), antioxidant (at 4.5 min) and finally the compound was dumped out at 6 min at a temperature of around 150°C. In the second stage, the initial chamber temperature was set at 50°C and the compound from the first stage is introduced. The compound was sheared at 20 r/min rotor speed for 0.5 min, then after adding sulfur and accelerator, rotor speed increased to 50 r/min. The mix was dumped out after 3 min and by that time the chamber temperature rose to around 95°C. The compound is further rolled in a two-roll mill at 50°C for making sheets that are then cut into small pieces with a scissor and compression molded and cured at 160°C using a hot press. The rubber compounds containing Si69, NXT, S1, S2, 33 and S4 coupling agents were named as Si69, NXT, S1, S2, S3 and S4 compounds, respectively, in this study.</p>

<title>Testing</title>
<p>Mooney viscosity (ML (1 + 4)) was measured using moony viscometer (Mooney MV 2000 of Alpha Technologies, Akron, Ohio, USA) at 2 r/min and 100°C according to ASTM D1646 standard. Cure tests were conducted at 160°C using cure rheometer (RPA 2000 of Alpha Technologies, Akron, Ohio, USA) following ASTM D 2084 standard. Dynamic mechanical properties were measured using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis machine (DMTA V of Rheometric Scientific, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA). The dynamic mechanical testing was carried out in strain mode at strain amplitude of 0.02%, frequency of 10 Hz and temperature range from −100°C to 80°C with a heating rate of 3°C/min. Tensile tests were conducted using an Instron Universal Tensile Machine according to the ASTM D412 test at room temperature at constant crosshead speed of 500 mm/min using dumbbell-shaped specimens punched out from molded rubber sheets by a Type D die. The hardness measurements were carried out using a Durometer DPX-1000 apparatus (Rex Gauge Co., Carpentersville, Illinois, USA) following ASTM D2240 standard. Abrasion tests were conducted using DIN Abrasion Tester (Qualitest USA LC, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, USA) according to ASTM D5963 standard.</p>

<title>Mooney viscosity</title>
<p>Mooney viscosity of the rubber compounds are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0095244312439489">Figure 2</xref>. The Si69 and S4 compounds have higher Mooney viscosity compared with that of the other compounds. It probably indicates the release of some amount of sulfur from Si69 and S4 silanes compared with other silanes causing some vulcanization in Si69 and S4 compounds during compounding. The Mooney viscosity of NXT, S1 and S2 compounds is in the lower range, indicating the improved scorch resistance offered by the blocking or masking of the sulfur atom in these coupling agents by octanoyl groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095244312439489">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The tire tread compound has been shown to be a major contributor to both a tire rolling resistance and its wet traction.<sup>

</sup> there are often trade-offs between tire rolling resistance and tire wet traction. The tanδ at 60°C has been shown to be a predictor of a compound’s rolling resistance, while tanδ at 0°C of the tread compound has been shown to be a predictor of wet traction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095244312439489">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095244312439489"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095244312439489"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095244312439489">13</xref></sup> The tanδ is related to the tire performance in such a way that a high tanδ at 0°C is correlating with good traction or skid resistance in wet and cold road conditions and a low tanδ at 60°C correlating with  low rolling resistance. Generally, it is difficult to obtain a high tanδ at 0°C and at the same time a low tanδ at 60°C. Therefore, a balance of these two tanδ values may suggest the best suitable tire compound. The ratio of tanδ at 0°C to tanδ at 60°C is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0095244312439489">Figure 10</xref> for this purpose. The ratio is highest for the NXT compound followed by S1 and S2 and Si69 and S3 compounds, while the ratio is significantly lower for the S4 compound.</p>

<title>Structure property relation</title>
<p>The difference in the properties of different rubber compounds containing different silane coupling agents can be related to the difference in chemical structure of the compounds and the observed structure–property relations as summarized here.</p>
<p>The cure property, <italic>M</italic>
<sub>H</sub> –<italic>M</italic>
<sub>L</sub> , indicative of extend of cross-linking during curing was higher for the Si69- and S4-containing rubber compounds compared with the other silane compounds. This is attributed to the bifunctional chemical structure of the Si69 and S4 compounds compared with the monofunctional chemical structure of the other silanes. A bifunctional silane can form chemical links between two separate sites on the silica surface with two separate sites on the rubber molecules while a monofunctional silane can only link a single site on the silica surface with a single site on the rubber molecule. Therefore, the higher <italic>M</italic>
<sub>H</sub> -<italic>M</italic>
<sub>L</sub> values of Si69 and S4 silanes can be attributed to the higher number of cross-links formed in the compounds containing these silanes.</p>
<p>The compounds with silanes S3 and S4 are found to be having faster cure and shorter optimum cure time compared with the compounds with the other silanes, indicative of a cure accelerating effect for the silanes S3 and S4. These silanes have a distinctive chemical structure with nitrogen containing five-member ring structure as compared with the other silanes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095244312439489">Figure 1</xref>). The cure acceleration effect of these silanes may be related to the presence of nitrogen atom in these compounds as the most cure accelerators used in rubber industry are nitrogen-containing compounds, for examples, <italic>N</italic>-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide (accelerator CZ) and <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>′-diphenylguanidine (accelerator DPG), used in this study.</p>
<p>The chemical structures of NXT, S1 and S2 silanes are similar as the chemical structures of S1 and S2 and are based on the chemical structure of NXT; the S1 contains one more Si atom and two more ethoxy groups from that of NXT for improving the bonding between the silane and silica, whereas in the case of S2 silane one more 3-(octanoylthio) propyl group is attached with the Si atom in place of one of the ethoxy groups of the NXT silane for improving the bonding between the silane and rubber molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0095244312439489">Figure 1</xref>). However, the improvements made in the structure of S1 and S2 from that of NXT did not result in a significant improvement in the property of the rubber compounds with these silanes when compared with that of the rubber compound with NXT silane.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The effectiveness of four new silane coupling agents in S-SBR-silica tire tread compound was found to be varying for different properties of the rubber compounds. The S3 and S4 silane compounds were having shorter cure time and higher maximum torque values compared with other compounds; however, the tensile strength and the tanδ values indicative of tire performance were lower than that of the other silane compounds. The NXT, S1 and S2 silane compounds had higher tanδ at 0°C and lower tanδ at 60°C, indicative of improved wet skid resistance and lowered rolling resistance when compared with other silane compounds. The Si69 compound had higher tensile properties and less abrasion compared with other compounds; however, the tanδ values for tire performance were slightly lower to the NXT, S1 and S2 silane compounds.</p>
