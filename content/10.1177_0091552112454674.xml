<abstract>
<p>Two-year colleges have played an important role in providing postsecondary education for women in postwar Japan. More recently, a dwindling college-bound population in Japan has resulted in a drastic decrease in the number of and enrollment in 2-year colleges. This study explored the motivations and aspirations of 12 Japanese female students to understand the factors influencing their choice of a 2-year college. Findings suggest that 2-year college administrators and faculty members need to hear the voices of female students in today’s society. This will enhance the colleges’ role in community-based higher education and help them better serve the interests of prospective students and the needs of regional businesses and industries. Findings are discussed in the context of contemporary Japanese society.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091552112454674">Hossler, Braxton and Coopersmith (1989)</xref> describe student college choice as “a complex, multistage process during which an individual develops aspirations to continue formal education beyond high school, then later makes a decision to attend a specific college, university or institution of advanced vocational training” (p. 234). This developmental process is best described as a 3-stage process, including <italic>predisposition, search</italic>, and <italic>choice</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091552112454674">Cabrera &amp; La Nasa, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091552112454674">Hossler, Braxton, &amp; Coopersmith, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0091552112454674">Nora, 2004</xref>). Substantial research on student college choice has been conducted in the United States to examine factors influencing American students’ decision making at each of these stages. In Japan, by contrast, college choice has been a relatively untapped area of investigation.</p>
<p>However, the nation’s recent low birth rate and the consequent drastic drop in the college-age population are forcing colleges and universities to conduct research on the college-choice process, seeking to understand students’ personal aspirations and motivations as well as other possible factors that affect this process. The lack of comprehensive conceptual frameworks for college choice in Japan has been a challenge, along with the absence of a related literature on the college-choice process of Japanese students. The study described in this article attempts to address this gap, employing focus groups and individual interviews to capture in Japanese women’s own voices the dynamics of the decision-making process that ultimately led them to the 2-year college of their choice. The study drew upon the college-choice model developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091552112454674">Hossler and Gallagher (1987)</xref>. Although this model was developed decades ago, it continues to provide a jumping-off point for college-choice research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091552112454674">Haynes, Bush, &amp; Pasco, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0091552112454674">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Japanese 2-year colleges were established on a provisional basis in 1950 during the post World War II occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091552112454674">Harada, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091552112454674">Japan Association for Private Junior Colleges, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0091552112454674">Kambayashi, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0091552112454674">Walker, 2007</xref>). As part of a restructuring of the nation, Japan promulgated the School Education Law of 1947 and implemented a new education system with reference to the American education system. Prewar postsecondary institutions that met the new government standards were granted university status. Although most prewar postsecondary institutions became 4-year universities at this time, some failed to meet the standards and were given the temporary status of <italic>tanki-daigaku</italic> (short-term universities) offering 2-year programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0091552112454674">Nishimura, 2004</xref>). The 1965 School Education Law lifted this temporary status, and <italic>tanki-daigaku</italic> came to be officially recognized as a component of higher education, continuing to offer 2-year programs as alternatives to 4-year universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091552112454674">Japan Association for Private Junior Colleges, 2009</xref>) . The title of <italic>tanki-daigaku</italic> applies to these 2-year colleges yet today.</p>
<p>The number of 2-year colleges and the enrollment in these institutions have changed over time. Postwar educational reforms focused particularly on espousing an egalitarian idea of education for all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091552112454674">Fujimura-Fanselow, 1995</xref>). Traditionally, education had been for a select elite. This change resulted in a dramatic increase in postsecondary education enrollment, followed by an increase in the number of 2-year colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091552112454674">Fujimura-Fanselow, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0091552112454674">Yamada, 1995</xref>). In 1950, there were 149 2-year colleges with a total enrollment of 15,098 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091552112454674">Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, 2010a</xref>). Between the years 1959 and 1968 the number of 2-year colleges tripled, and enrollment increased by a factor of almost 17. By 1968, 468 2-year colleges were established, enrolling 255,262 students altogether. The number of 2-year colleges and the enrollment in these institutions steadily increased until 1993; by then, the number of 2-year colleges reached 525, with student enrollment doubling from 1968 to 530,294 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091552112454674">Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, 2010a</xref>). However, more recently, the numbers of 2-year colleges and the enrollment in these colleges have declined. In 2003, there were 525 2-year colleges, the same as in 1993, but enrollment was down to 250,062, more than 50%. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091552112454674">Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, 2010a</xref>). Many 2-year colleges ceased to exist over time. In 2010, the number of 2-year colleges was down to 395, and total enrollment was 155,273, more than a 60% drop from 2003.</p>
<p>A dwindling college-bound population and the choice of more and more female students to attend 4-year universities are two main reasons for this recent decline. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091552112454674">Japan Association for Private Junior Colleges, 2009</xref>). In 1996, the enrollment rate among women at 4-year universities surpassed the enrollment rate of women at 2-year institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091552112454674">Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, 2010a</xref>). Since that time, enrollment rates at 4-year universities have consistently outpaced those at 2-year colleges. In addition, more than 200 4-year colleges were newly established between 1992 and 2008 due to the 1991 deregulation of the Standards for the Establishment of Universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091552112454674">Amano, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091552112454674">Japan Association for Private Junior Colleges, 2009</xref>). Four-year colleges expanded their share of the higher education market and increasingly became a threat to competition for the shrinking pool of potential college applicants.</p>
<p>When 2-year colleges were originally established, male student enrollment at those institutions was nearly twice that of female students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091552112454674">Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, 2010a</xref>). The following decade saw a complete turnaround, with female student enrollment twice that of male students. Ideological changes in the postwar years and demand for skilled workers in the 1960s through the early 1990s paved the way for women to pursue postsecondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091552112454674">Fujimura-Fanselow, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091552112454674">Japan Association for Private Junior Colleges, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0091552112454674">Kambayashi, 1981</xref>). In subsequent years leading to the present day, female enrollment would dominate 2-year colleges. At the peak of 2-year college enrollment in 1993, female students constituted more than 90% of the total. In 2010, 89% of the 2-year college population was female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091552112454674">Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, 2010a</xref>)</p>
<p>Because of the heavy concentration of female enrollment, programs at 2-year colleges in the early years largely consisted of courses of study that supported and enhanced traditional women’s roles of <italic>ryosai kenbo</italic> (good wives and wise mothers). It was believed this was what women had in mind as an appropriate college education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091552112454674">Amano, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091552112454674">Japan Association for Private Junior Colleges, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0091552112454674">Starobin, 2002</xref>). <italic>Ryosai kenbo</italic> clearly defines women’s roles: Women take responsibility for everything in the household, including caring for husbands and children and attending to domestic affairs, including household finance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091552112454674">Fujimura-Fanselow, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0091552112454674">McVeigh, 1997</xref>). Home economics, literature, education, and some appreciation for <italic>kyoyo</italic> (general-cultural education) were common courses offered at 2-year colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091552112454674">Brinton, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091552112454674">Fujimura-Fanselow, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0091552112454674">McVeigh, 1997</xref>). Consequently, 2-year colleges in Japan became virtually synonymous with women’s education and earned the nickname <italic>hanayome gakko</italic> (bride-training schools) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091552112454674">Fujimura-Fanselow, 1995</xref>). However, rapid economic growth in the 1960’s prompted more females to join the work force, and subsequently 2-year colleges extended their role of <italic>ryosai kenbo kyoiku</italic> to include <italic>jitsumu kyoiku</italic> (practical-business education) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091552112454674">Japan Association for Private Junior Colleges, 2009</xref>). They began to offer programs in administrative assistance, early childhood education, and foreign languages in the hope that they would enhance employment opportunities for women.</p>
<p>Many 2-year colleges have tried to improve enrollment by developing consortium programs with other 2-year colleges, diversifying courses, improving their syllabi, changing teaching methods, adopting a semester system, instituting credit transfer to 4-year colleges, and opening new academic departments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091552112454674">Japan Association for Private Junior Colleges, 2009</xref>). Yet, 2-year colleges continue to struggle with low enrollment. In 2010, about 60% of 2-year colleges in Japan failed to enroll to capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0091552112454674">Promotion and Mutual Aid Cooperation for Private Schools of Japan, 2010</xref>). Faculty members and administrators of 2-year colleges are now seeking studies that provide insight into student aspirations and motivations leading to the choice of a 2-year college. Understanding students and providing an environment in which they can fulfill their potential while pursuing their goals is vital for the future success of 2-year colleges.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0091552112454674">
<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>The process of choosing whether and where to go to college is conceived of as a linear process in which students develop aspirations for college (even as they commence their search for potential colleges to attend) and finally choose a particular college in which they enroll (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091552112454674">Bergerson, 2009</xref>). This process consists of multiple stages, and three-, four-, five-, and seven-stage models have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091552112454674">Henrickson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091552112454674">Hossler, Braxton, &amp; Coopersmith, 1989</xref>). All multiple-stage models have three stages in common: the development of aspirations to attend college, the investigation of information about potential colleges to attend, and the process of actual application and enrollment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091552112454674">Henrickson, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091552112454674">Bergerson (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0091552112454674">Teranishi, Ceja, Antonio, Allen, and McDonough (2004)</xref> have noted that the most widely cited and used process model is the three-stage model developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091552112454674">Hossler and Gallagher (1987)</xref>. This model posits that student college choice is a developmental process, consisting of three developmental stages: predisposition, search, and choice. Predisposition, the first stage, refers to the period when students develop aspirations for college and decide whether to go to college or choose other alternatives, such as work or military service. Search is the second stage; students actively seek information on specific institutions and develop a list of colleges to which they intend to apply. Choice is the final stage in which students complete applications and choose a particular college to enter.</p>
<p>Past studies in the United States have identified several factors that are critical for each of the three stages. Factors identified for the predisposition stage are parental encouragement, socioeconomic status, student academic ability, support from high school counselors and teachers, and parents’ knowledge of or experience with college (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091552112454674">Braddock &amp; Dawkins, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091552112454674">Carpenter &amp; Fleishman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091552112454674">Conklin &amp; Dailey, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091552112454674">Conley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091552112454674">Gardner, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091552112454674">Hamrick &amp; Stage, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0091552112454674">Lillis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0091552112454674">McDonough, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0091552112454674">Muhammad, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0091552112454674">Stage &amp; Hossler, 1989</xref>). Factors important in the search stage are the academic ranking of potential institutions, tuition and fees associated with a college education, and students’ access to information about college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091552112454674">Cabrera &amp; La Nasa, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091552112454674">Cain &amp; McClintock, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091552112454674">DesJardins, Ahlburg, &amp; McCall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091552112454674">Espinoza, Bradshaw, &amp; Hausman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091552112454674">Galotti &amp; Mark, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0091552112454674">McDonough, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0091552112454674">Ramasubramanian, Gyure, &amp; Mursi, 2002</xref>). Factors potentially influencing the choice stage are available financial resources, institutional attributes, and parental advice (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091552112454674">Baksh &amp; Hoyt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091552112454674">Cabrera &amp; La Nasa, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091552112454674">DesJardins, Dundar, &amp; Hendel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091552112454674">Dynarski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091552112454674">Ganderton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0091552112454674">Hearn, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0091552112454674">Pratt &amp; Evans, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0091552112454674">Smith &amp; Matthews, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0091552112454674">Somers &amp; St. John, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Most college-choice research focuses on a single stage, depending on the needs and interests of institutions and researchers. For example, institutions have paid more attention to the choice stage to increase application numbers in competitive college marketplaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091552112454674">Bergerson, 2009</xref>). A notable exception is a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0091552112454674">Hossler, Schmit, and Vesper (1999)</xref>, which explored factors that influence students’ decisions in all three stages. Their study provided detailed accounts of how students undergo the college-choice process, showing that students do not choose a college on the spur of the moment and that college choice is a rather complex process in which “students realize their college-going aspirations through the process leading to enrollment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091552112454674">Bergerson, 2009</xref>, p. 21). Focusing on all three stages of college choice, rather than on a single stage of that process, thus makes sense as we examine the whole process through which students determine whether and where to go to college.</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>Employing the college-choice model developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091552112454674">Hossler and Gallagher (1987)</xref>, the purpose of the study was to explore factors influencing the 2-year college choice of Japanese female students. Twelve students attending a 2-year college were interviewed to capture, in their own voices, the dynamics of college choice. This study addressed the following questions: What motivated the 12 Japanese women to pursue postsecondary education? What motivated them to choose 2-year colleges? What factors were important for them in selecting 2-year colleges to apply to? What were the determining factors in the final choice of college?</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0091552112454674">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The researchers received assistance in finding a 2-year college willing to participate in this study from a Japanese <italic>kengi-kai gicho</italic> (secretary general of a prefecture assembly) who had been closely working with associations of both public and private junior colleges. The secretary general contacted several 2-year colleges, and one college agreed to participate. The college was in a prefecture that has seven colleges and universities, including one national university, three private 4-year colleges, and three private 2-year colleges. The researchers sent a letter to the president of the college, requesting that the college identify students willing to participate in focus-group and individual interviews. Faculty members read the letter of request in their classes and obtained 12 volunteers. All participants were single females. At the time of the interviews, 11 of the 12 participants were 19 years, and one was 20 years old.</p>
<p>The participating 2-year college was founded in the late 1960s as a women’s college and became coeducational in the late 1990s. The college offers programs in administrative assistance, early childhood education, and music. Of the approximately 270 students enrolled at the time of the study, 260 were female. The majority of students (about 90%) were in-state students, commuting to the college from home. Almost 98% of the students enrolled in the college right after completing high school, indicating that the majority of students were in the age group of 18-20. Some information, such as students’ family income and political affiliations, were not made available to the researcher because of provisions in the Privacy Act of Japan.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0091552112454674">
<title>Data Source and Analysis</title>
<p>Data were collected through two focus-group interviews, each consisting of six students, between July 2006 and April 2007. All interviews were conducted in Japanese, the participants’ and the researchers’ mother tongue. Each focus-group interview was approximately 90 min in length. The focus-group interviews were followed by private, individual interviews with each of the 12 participants. The individual interviews were one to two hours in length. Both the focus-group and individual interviews employed semi-structured formats. This allowed new questions to be introduced on the basis of interviewee responses, thereby encouraging students to express their perceptions and experiences of the college-choice process in their own words. Examples of questions included the following: Why did you decide to go to college after high school? What type of college did you consider when you decided to go to college? Would you explain the reasons why you considered that type of college? When you were considering colleges, what were important criteria? What characteristics were important that caused you to decide to apply to a particular college or to particular colleges?</p>
<p>All interviews were recorded with the consent of the participants. Recorded data were then transcribed by the researchers, and the transcripts were analyzed using qualitative induction, identifying patterns and themes emerging from the interviewees’ responses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091552112454674">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552112454674">Freeman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0091552112454674">Smith, 2007</xref>). As an initial step in this inductive process, transcripts were open-coded; this involved highlighting words and phrases, which provided literal codes taken directly from the actual language found in the data. Then, similar literal codes were grouped together to generate overarching conceptual themes. The researchers translated the conceptual themes and excerpts from the interviews into English. Pseudonyms were used to protect the participants’ identities.</p>

<title>Motivations to Pursue College Education</title>
<p>Students’ interview comments indicated that they decided to pursue college education for two reasons: because college is taken for granted as a life path, and because a college education enhances professional, economic, and social success.</p>
<p>All students stated that they had decided to pursue postsecondary education because their families and high school teachers assumed that everyone should go to college after high school. For these students, going to college was an obvious step to take after high school. The following interview excerpts from four students (Michiko, Yukiko, Sachiko, and Akiko) provide representative views of the students about college attendance.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Since I was a child, people around me, including my parents, believed that one should followed a certain educational path, starting with kindergarten through college. So I assumed that attending college was what I was supposed to do—finish high school and then go to college—as all my relatives did. (Michiko)</p>
<p>Well, you know, I have never thought about why I wanted to go to college before. Why not? Going to college was a kind of part of my life. I took it for granted, really. I never questioned it. Everyone in my family always said that I should go to college. My mom and siblings went to college. It is hard for me to explain, but I just believed that I would go to college after high school since everyone did and said so . . . .(Yukiko)</p>
<p>I went to a college-prep high school, so very few students get a job upon graduation. Everyone, including teachers and students, at my high school took college attendance for granted. We are like, “No option other than going to college.” (Sachiko)</p>
<p>In my high school, getting a job had never been an option. But college was. The high school I attended had teacher/parents meetings and discussed college attendance. There were also school-wide teacher/parent meetings. At the school-wide meetings, the teacher told parents what types of schools the students were admitted to in the past, how many students went to colleges and things like that. In addition to those meetings, at least three times a year there were opportunities for parents to observe classes and to hold an individual teacher/parent meeting after class observation to discuss post-high school plans. In my high school, students were expected to go to college. (Akiko)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Students in this study pointed out that they had decided to go to college to attain professional and social success. Most frequently, students mentioned that a college education enhanced potential employment opportunities and provided the opportunity for financial gain. Sachiko showed a strong professional aspiration in her response:
<disp-quote>
<p>High school graduates do not have a lot of options when it comes to finding a job. They find jobs in very limited areas, I think. If I want to get a more professional job and to apply for different types of jobs, I need to have some special skills and knowledge. I wanted to go to college to learn skills and knowledge; something specialized and practical.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For most students, potential financial gain was critical in their decision to go to college. Naomi spoke to this: “Everyone said that it would be better to go to college for the money. We always talked about a college graduate’s salary. My friends and parents were talking about how well college graduates are paid. So I thought I should go to college.”</p>
<p>Beyond professional motivation and financial gain, students said that they chose to go to college because they believed that a college education would enhance their social status. They stated that Japanese society did not think highly of high school graduates because they learned only basic academic skills and lacked the necessary social skills to be accepted in society. Hitomi had this to say:
<disp-quote>
<p>You know, people look down on high school graduates. If you go to a job interview, I’ve heard that interviewers respond to you with, “Oh, you did not go to college . . . ah . . . ” You know, people think that high school graduates cannot talk and behave properly socially with grace, nor carry on intellectual conversations.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Chihiro openly stated that she had decided to go to college to raise her status:
<disp-quote>
<p>People tend to look down on someone holding a high school diploma. I mean, high school graduates are not really respected. In Japan, it is very important to be equipped with manners, etiquette, and sophisticated language if you want to be respected by others. I mean, becoming a cultured person while in college makes a big difference in society. College, at least to me, is not a place to study only academic subjects. It is also a place to learn how to become a cultured person. People will treat a cultured person nicely and respectfully. In some sense, you may call it discrimination against high school graduates, but that is what my mother sees in her office every day. High school graduates and college graduates occupy a different position in society.</p>

<title>Reasons to Choose 2-Year College</title>
<p>Students in this study searched for their college opportunities exclusively in a 2-year college education. They preferred 2-year colleges, viewing a college education as an opportunity to prepare for becoming a responsible adult rather than to pursue academics. Most students said that they had given no consideration to applying to 4-year colleges. Throughout the interviews, they commented that college attendance meant “going to a 2-year college.” This preference was based on their perception that a 2-year college experience would help them gain confidence and skills to become a competent, responsible, and full-fledged adult in a relatively short period of time. Their perception is summed up in the following interview excerpts from three students: Kana, Saki, and Maki.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I know that 4-year college graduates, on average, earn more than 2-year college graduates. But going to college four years is a long time. I wanted to prepare socially, psychologically, and professionally to enter the real world quickly. High school graduates know very little or nothing about business and the real world, so I felt I needed some time before entering the real world. (Kana)</p>
<p>You know, getting a job is a very important decision in one’s life. The decision has life-long influence. People stay at the same company till their retirement once they are hired, so I wanted to have time to think carefully about my future career plan. In addition, I needed time to gain the practical skills and knowledge required for working in an office. What I studied in high school was “textbook” knowledge, so I have to acquire “practical” knowledge and skills to be immediately productive in the work place. I think that two years at college is the ideal length of time, not too long, not too short, to be ready for the adult world. I want to feel comfortable and confident when I start working in an office. (Saki)</p>
<p>It is unlikely that I will go to a 4-year college. I never expected to pursue academic knowledge in a 4-year college. My goal in going to college is to pursue my interests and learn, you know, nonacademic things, such as those human relationship abilities necessary for future employment . . . I think college is important so I can master proper speech and manners to become a truly mature and sophisticated adult. (Maki)</p>

<title>Criteria for Searching 2-Year Colleges</title>
<p>Two criteria, geographic location and program of study, were important for students in this study when identifying potential 2-year colleges to which they would apply. All interview participants stated that geographic distance from home was a very important consideration in deciding whether or not to apply to a particular college. Despite interest in moving away from home, the potential discomfort of being away discouraged them from considering out-of-state colleges. Saki expressed her anxiety about going to college away from home as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>I thought that an out-of state college might be good, but I decided to go to an in-state two-year college. I decided not to go to an out-of-state college because I was scared of going to a new place. I was scared to leave my home, you know, living alone away from my family in an unfamiliar place, and no friends.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For some students, safety concerns raised by parents affected their decision to consider colleges in proximity to their home. Ayumi explained that her parents’ opposition to applying to an out-of-state college was due to recent serious crimes:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I told my parents that I would like to attend an-out-of state college, they said that it would not happen. My sister went to an in-state 2-year college, too. They worried about my being a victim of crime—I mean, there were several crimes committed by phantom killers in several areas in Japan. They were really worried about the incidents, and said that I should stay with them.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Yumi was the only interview participant who came from outside the state. Although she is now attending a college away from home, she stated that closeness to home was very important for her when searching for potential colleges.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I looked into several out-of-state colleges. I wanted to go to a college in a big city like Tokyo or Osaka since most of my friends planned to apply to colleges in those areas. But I got scared of being away from my home, family and friends, thinking “Can I make good friends in a new place?” “What if I get sick?” “What if I get involved in accidents or crimes?” I asked myself a lot of “What if?” questions. Then, I limited my search to neighboring cities not too far from my home so that I can go home easily during breaks and even on weekends. Closeness to home gives me a great sense of security and comfort.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The geographic boundaries set by these students included three 2-year colleges they were considering. All the interviewees stated that the academic programs offered by each institution were important in their evaluation of those three colleges, although they primarily looked into the programs offered by the 2-year college they were attending. Specifically, their primary concern was the compatibility between their own interests and the programs that were available. The following three excerpts from Ayumi, Hitomi and Akiko represent the students’ perspectives.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I wanted to study early childhood education to be a kindergarten teacher. I like children and had an internship opportunity at a kindergarten when I was in high school. I checked whether or not a college offered early childhood education programs. (Ayumi)</p>
<p>I wanted to go to a college that offered programs and courses similar to those I took in high school. I wanted to gain more knowledge in the areas that I studied in high school. To me, college is an extension of high school. I wanted to continue studying the areas already familiar and interesting to me. (Hitomi)</p>
<p>It was important to find information on programs offered at a college. I was interested in information technology and the business field. I found that the 2-year college I am currently attending has a program that fits my interests, so I checked the school catalogue. I learned what courses were offered and what types of certificates I could acquire by taking the courses. I actually checked the course descriptions on the Internet and attended open campus to get more information about the courses. (Akiko)</p>

<title>Deciding on a 2-Year College to Attend</title>
<p>Two criteria were found to be important for students in this study when choosing a particular college: the college’s program of study and the job prospects after graduation. All the students indicated that they planned neither to transfer to 4-year college nor to advance to specialized higher-level courses after completing their 2-year college program. They considered a 2-year college education to be a means of enhancing their employment opportunities. Thus, academic programs that would prepare them for future employment were important when choosing a college. The students stated that the 2-year college they were attending was more appealing to them than others in the region because it offers courses fitting their interests. It is worth noting that they applied only to the college they were attending. All commented that they devoted little or no consideration to applying to other 2-year colleges in the region. Michiko stated that the college she is attending appealed to her because of its variety of professional certificate programs:
<disp-quote>
<p>I chose this college because the programs and courses are interesting to me. The college has a lot of elective courses. So, depending on what courses I take, I can earn different types of certificates. In addition, many classes teach us knowledge needed to pass the nationwide certificate examinations in different fields. The more certificates I have, the more opportunities for employment I have.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Kana pointed to the practical courses offered at this college as a reason for her choice:
<disp-quote>
<p>I did not know what I wanted to be when I was in high school. So I wanted to learn different kinds of subjects that are not really specialized in content but teach general skills we need to know to work. In that way, I thought I could apply for jobs in a wide range of fields. This college offers courses that teach practical skills, such as computer literacy, managing a filing system and foreign languages, as well as a wide range of knowledge, you know, such as current social and economic issues which a competent adult should know.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For some students, the college they were presently attending seemed the ideal place to receive an education, developing both practical skills and character traits needed for future employment. Chihiro explained this point:
<disp-quote>
<p>I chose this college because I was impressed with the educational goals and programs offered here. The college catalog says something like, “we foster a zest for living in students,” and “we teach manners and morals.” I believe that learning those qualities in college will be helpful to me when I am employed. In fact, in every class I am learning what I should do to become a responsible adult. I also liked the fact that this college offers courses in practical skills to prepare us for employment.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>All the students stated that they chose their college because they would have better employment opportunities than graduates of other 2-year colleges in the region. They indicated that the college had strong ties with local businesses that are actively hiring new graduates. The following three interview excerpts from Sachiko, Naomi, and Yukiko describe how job prospects after graduation played a part in their matriculation decision.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I visited my college with friends to learn about the school. I had a chance to speak with faculty and administrators of the college and was very impressed with the high employment rates among our alumni. Getting a job at a good company isn’t easy in the current economy, so I thought this college would be the one for me. (Sachiko)</p>
<p>I decided to attend this college since I want to get a job in this region. It is a customary practice for local businesses to hire new graduates in their communities. In fact, in the classified ads at the school’s job placement center, most recruiting companies are local. (Naomi)</p>
<p>The college I am attending has strong connections with local communities and holds various kinds of local activities. Students from this college, for example, participate in a summer festival to do a traditional Japanese dance. Courses offered at the college are also designed with local communities’ interests in mind; like “how can we attract more tourists to our communities?” and “how can we develop our community for future generations?” Such connections and knowledge will be of great help for job interviews with local businesses (Yukiko).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Employing interviews, this study explored factors influencing the college choice of 12 Japanese female students, starting from the time they contemplated going to college through the time they decided to go to a 2-year college, and finally through the time they chose the college they were enrolled in. As the findings revealed, these students had always known that they would go to college. Their parents and siblings were mostly college graduates. College for them was a natural course of action to follow after completing high school. The high schools they attended were mostly college-preparatory schools, and school counselors and instructors regarded them as college-bound students, guiding them accordingly. For them, college was not a question but a certitude. The students’ decisions to go to college stemmed from differences in Japanese societal attitudes toward college graduates as opposed to high school graduates. The students commented that high school graduates would receive little respect from society in general.</p>
<p>Japanese society places a tremendous emphasis on one’s academic credentials, and the tenet of <italic>gakureki shugi</italic> (educational credentialism) is ubiquitous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0091552112454674">Kondo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0091552112454674">Walker, 2007</xref>). Advanced degrees symbolize specialized knowledge and skills, better job opportunities, higher social status, and, more importantly, they draw respect and deference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091552112454674">Hurst, 2004</xref>). The title of college graduate is an important component of one’s successful social, professional, and public life. The students’ predisposition toward college reflected these social beliefs about college education.</p>
<p>For the students in the present study, college attendance meant going to a 2-year college. They viewed 2-year colleges as an optimal, albeit their only postsecondary institutional option. Their early predisposition toward 2-year colleges may have been influenced by institutional tracking common in Japanese high schools. Japanese high schools are ranked by the school’s successful placement of students into prestigious universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0091552112454674">Okano &amp; Tsuchiya, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0091552112454674">Ono, 2001</xref>). Those schools that are high in the order of academic ranking prepare students for university entrance examinations by providing rigorous academic programs, careful academic counseling, and better-qualified teachers who are often graduates of prestigious universities. These high schools set high standards and expectations for student academic performance, and the students in turn learn to identify the schools’ standards and expectations with their own goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0091552112454674">Oakes, 1986</xref>). Students in high schools lower in academic ranking generally do not have high hopes for school or themselves, and they tend to choose smaller, less-competitive colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0091552112454674">McDonough, 1997</xref>). The students in this study came from college-preparatory high schools with lower academic standings. Their experiences with high school may have shaped their beliefs about their academic potential, leading to the choice of a 2-year college as a realistic and sensible option for higher education.</p>
<p>The decision to choose a 2-year college by students in the present study was largely based upon their perceptions that 2-year colleges would give them time to prepare themselves to become full-fledged adults before entering the real-life workplace. This comment revealed a sense of inadequacy about entering the workplace as an adult. Japanese high schools generally are divided into two categories: college-preparatory high schools and vocational high schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0091552112454674">Okano &amp; Tsuchiya, 1999</xref>). Whereas vocational schools prepare students for immediate employment after graduation, college-preparatory high schools focus on preparation for <italic>juken</italic> (college entrance examinations). At college-preparatory high schools, students have little or no time to prepare themselves for the real world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0091552112454674">Okano &amp; Tsuchiya, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0091552112454674">Sugimoto, 2002</xref>). The students in the present study seemed very aware of a gap between school life and the real world, feeling hesitant to enter the workplace as adults.</p>
<p>The students’ admission that they needed more time before entering the real world is an acknowledgment of the harsh realities awaiting them. The Japanese workplace is highly structured, with meticulously prescribed individual roles within a system and high demands for efficiency and productivity in carrying out assigned tasks so as not to impede the productivity of the whole system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091552112454674">Matsunaga, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0091552112454674">Shire, 1999</xref>). New graduates must learn these norms of the workplace culture through intensive new employee training at a company, known as <italic>shinjin kenshu</italic>, lasting from several days to several months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0091552112454674">Stern, 1997</xref>). The transition from school to such a high-pressure work environment is not easy. College buys some time before one must face the real world. In this sense, 2-year colleges served as a temporary refuge for the students in this study.</p>
<p>The geographical location of the college was an important consideration for the students in this study when it came to searching for potential colleges. They preferred colleges close to home. Going away to college—moving to an unfamiliar place, making new friends, and being alone away from family—evokes uneasiness for college-goers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0091552112454674">McDonough, 1997</xref>). The students in this study were no exception. They were afraid of being away from home and set a boundary to their college search within a close distance from home. In addition to potential discomfort at the thought of being away from home, the issue of safety raised by parents influenced the students’ decision to stay close to home. The students commented that their parents wanted them to remain in-state for their safety. According to the 2010 <italic>White Paper on Crime</italic> by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0091552112454674">National Police Agency (2010)</xref>, most victims of violent crimes such as sexual assault, kidnapping, and robbery in Japan are young women under the age of 20. Of the students in this study, 11 were 19 years old, and one was 20. It is not surprising that parents were reluctant to send their daughters to a college away from home, worrying that they could be easy targets for crime.</p>
<p>In choosing potential 2-year colleges for application and eventually for enrollment, the students understandably looked at the programs offered by the colleges. It was important that they be in a college with programs that would match their interests and enhance their prospects of finding jobs that would increase their marketability upon graduation. It seems that they were very aware of a path leading to the next phase of life—work. The students’ keen interest in developing their professional capacity can be explained by the present Japanese social and economic climate.</p>
<p>The Japanese government passed the Equal Employment Opportunity Law in 1986 to secure equal employment opportunities for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091552112454674">Japan Association for Women’s Education, 2009</xref>). The 1986 law, revised in 1997, prohibits discrimination against women at all stages of employment, from recruitment to promotion and retirement. Complying with the law, both public-sector and private companies have gradually extended job offers to women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0091552112454674">Ogasawara, 1998</xref>). As employment opportunities for women have increased, social expectations that used to discourage women from pursuing their interests outside of home life have changed. Japanese society has begun to encourage women to become part of the regular work force, alongside men.</p>
<p>Young Japanese women feel entitled to pursue their own careers and personal interests unfettered by traditional gender roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0091552112454674">National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0091552112454674">Nomaguchi, 2006</xref>). According to a 2006 report from the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, almost 50% of single women between the ages of 18 and 34 indicated no intention of marrying within one year. The average age of first marriage for Japanese women has risen from 25.0 years in 1980 to 27.8 in 2005, and the average number of years from marriage to the birth of the first child after marriage increased from 1.61 in 1980, to 2.09 in 2005. The number of married women working outside the home increased from 49.4% in 1980 to 71.6% in 2005 for those between the ages of 25 and 29, and from 46.5% to 61.6% for those between the ages of 30 and 34. These trends among young Japanese women appear to hold true for the students of this study. The students felt strongly about finding and securing a job, wanting to invest their time in preparing for a future career.</p>
<p>In addition, the Japanese economy has been in a long recession since the economic bubble burst in the early 1990’s, and under ensuing economic constraints the importance of women’s economic contributions has increased. Japanese society has traditionally expected the man to be the primary or exclusive provider for his family. As the Japanese economy has continued to deteriorate, however, Japanese women have needed to take on more bread-winning responsibilities to supplement their husbands’ incomes, and thus they now often continue to remain in the labor force after their marriage. The number of two-income families surpassed the number of single-income families in 1992 and has been increasing since then (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091552112454674">Center for Gender Equal Society, 2011</xref>). Growing up in such a social and economic climate, students in this study seemed to want to empower themselves in their quest to become professionally and financially capable adults.</p>

<sec id="section14-0091552112454674" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The female students in this study aspired to continue their education beyond high school. They had clear goals and expectations about going to a 2-year college. They wanted to prepare for a great transition from school to real life and enhance their job prospects. They were career oriented and anxious to find jobs in the region. These findings have implications for administrators and faculty members in Japanese 2-year colleges as they build and rebuild their programs to entice more students to 2-year institutions.</p>
<p>Two-year colleges need to hear the voices of today’s young women. The 12 female students interviewed in the present study chose 2-year colleges for multiple reasons, including proximity to their homes, programs preparing them to launch careers, and a desire to enhance their social status as college graduates. Two-year colleges may want to first establish themselves as community-based higher education institutions serving the needs of students in the region while meeting the demands of local business and industries. Needs assessments in local and regional job markets, as well as direct contact with prospective employers to secure job opportunities for graduates, seem vital. Furthermore, internship programs coordinated with local businesses and industries will provide hands-on training, helping young women build confidence professionally and socially before entering the real world. According to the School Basic Survey of 2010, 94% of the entire 2-year-college female student population enrolled in 2-year colleges immediately after completing high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091552112454674">Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, 2010b</xref>). The female students in the present study did so with the fear that they were not ready to function successfully in the adult world. The transition from school to the real world will be made easier through the internship programs, gradually introducing students into work while in school.</p>
<p>Two-year colleges, particularly, need to keep abreast of the demands of a changing society. Japanese society is rapidly aging. The elderly population (65 years old and above) accounted for 23.1% of the entire Japanese population in 2010, and its size has almost doubled in two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0091552112454674">Ministry of Internal Affairs &amp; Communications, 2010</xref>). The number of elderly in need of special care at home and in nursing homes has increased accordingly. Workers with special knowledge and skills in elderly care are presently in great demand and will remain so in years to come. However, 2-year colleges today continue to adhere to their traditional curriculum consisting of home economics, early childhood education, and some humanities courses. Such courses account for 73% of all areas of study at 2-year colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091552112454674">Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, 2010b</xref>). Fields of study associated with elderly care, health and welfare, or medical assistance have yet to become regular programs at 2-year colleges. As of 2010, only 7.6% of all programs at 2-year colleges were in the field of health and nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091552112454674">Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, &amp; Technology, 2010b</xref>). Two-year colleges may offer courses to support career opportunities in this particular area, thus meeting the demands of both career-oriented students and the demands of the society.</p>
<p>Various philosophies of education exist around the world. Japanese society has traditionally associated education with academic elitism, that is, something to be looked up to and to be held sacred. In this tradition, education is a pursuit of knowledge and truth; knowledge is an end in itself, and truth has intrinsic value. In Japan, the term <italic>ivory tower</italic> is not necessarily a pejorative description of universities or intellectuals; rather, it denotes a castle where common people can enter only in a dream. The desire of female students in the present study to attain the status of college graduates may reflect a desire to be part of the academic elite. They seek not only practical knowledge and skills to be used in the real world but also long for elements of pure academics to set them apart from students of vocational schools. For this reason, 2-year colleges may want to keep general education courses such as philosophy and literature as electives in the curriculum to nurture and further develop students’ interests in these areas.</p>
<p>The college-choice model developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091552112454674">Hossler and Gallagher (1987)</xref> was of great use in identifying factors that were important at each stage of the college-choice process for the 12 Japanese female students interviewed in this study. We gained a reasonably clear understanding of the factors associated with their college choice. However, we saw an obvious cultural difference affecting their college choice. In Japan, types and ranks of high schools almost entirely determine if and to what type of colleges the students will apply. In the present study, their predisposition for 2-year colleges precluded the female students from seriously considering 4-year colleges. From the very beginning, they sought out 2-year colleges exclusively. Apparently, for them the predisposition stage and the search stage somewhat overlapped, with decisions made simultaneously on whether to go to college and what type of college to attend. However, this study is exploratory in nature, drawing upon a very small number of participants. More studies on the topic involving students in a wider spectrum of schools and regions will provide more insight into understanding the college-choice process that leads Japanese female students to 2-year colleges.</p>
