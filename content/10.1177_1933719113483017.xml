Using a dual-fluorescence reporter system in which mouse ESCs express green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of a germ cell–specific <italic>Pou5f1</italic> gene promoter and red fluorescent protein (<italic>Discosoma sp</italic> red [DsRed]) driven by the granulosa cell–specific Forkhead box L2 (<italic>Foxl2</italic>) gene promoter, we first confirmed in vitro formation of follicle-like structures containing GFP-positive cells surrounded by DsRed-positive cells. Isolated DsRed-positive cells specified from ECSs exhibited a gene expression profile consistent with granulosa cells, as revealed by the detection of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for <italic>Foxl2</italic>, follistatin (<italic>Fst</italic>), anti-Müllerian hormone (<italic>Amh</italic>), and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (<italic>Fshr</italic>) as well as by production of both progesterone and estradiol. In addition, treatment of isolated DsRed-expressing cells with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) significantly increased estradiol production over basal levels, confirming the presence of functional FSH receptors in these cells. Last, ESC-derived DsRed-positive cells injected into neonatal mouse ovaries became incorporated within the granulosa cell layer of immature follicles. These studies demonstrate that <italic>Foxl2</italic>-expressing ovarian somatic cells derived in vitro from differentiating ESCs express granulosa cell markers, actively associate with germ cells in vitro, synthesize steroids, respond to FSH, and participate in folliculogenesis in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>granulosa cells</kwd><kwd><italic>Foxl2</italic></kwd><kwd>embryonic stem cell</kwd><kwd>oocyte</kwd><kwd>follicle</kwd><kwd>ovary</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1933719113483017"><title>Introduction</title><p>The first report that differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can spontaneously form oocyte-like cells in vitro was published nearly a decade ago.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719113483017">1</xref></sup> A very recent article has now demonstrated that fully functional eggs can be generated from oocytes initially derived from mouse ESCs or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719113483017">2</xref></sup> Specification of primordial germ cell (PGC)-like cells (PGCLCs) from differentiating mouse ESCs or iPSCs follows a precise time frame in vitro, with PGCLCs formed between 3 and 6 days into the differentiation program closely resembling endogenous PGCs present in embryonic day 12.5 (e12.5) mouse ovaries. Accordingly, Saitou and colleagues aggregated in vitro-derived PGCLCs specified 3, 4, and 6 days after initiation of ESC differentiation with dispersed e12.5 ovarian tissue and then transplanted the aggregates under the ovarian bursal sacs of adult female mice. The PGCLCs subsequently developed into germinal vesicle stage oocytes that, following harvesting and in vitro maturation, underwent in vitro fertilization. The resultant 2-cell stage embryos were transferred to pseudopregnant female mice, of which a low percentage survived gestation and were delivered as apparently healthy pups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719113483017">2</xref></sup></p><p>Prior to the publication of this most recent report from Saitou and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719113483017">2</xref></sup> many other scientists have been testing the concept that cells other than PGCs are capable of generating fertilization-competent eggs, 2 of which succeeded using female germ line or oogonial stem cells purified from adult mouse ovaries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719113483017">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719113483017"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719113483017"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719113483017">6</xref></sup> This new study nonetheless represents a major milestone in both reproductive and stem cell biology for 2 principal reasons. The first, and most obvious, is the demonstration that mouse ESCs and iPSCs can actually be differentiated, albeit at low frequency, into oocytes capable of fertilization, embryogenesis, and development to live offspring. The second is that PGCLCs, which resemble endogenous PGCs in fetal gonads, require interaction with developmentally matched embryonic ovary somatic cells to realize their full potential in vivo. Indeed, prior attempts at generating competent oocytes from mouse ESC-derived germ cells transplanted into ovaries have failed, most likely because the PGCLCs were introduced into postnatal, rather than embryonic, mouse ovary tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719113483017">7</xref></sup> In order to provide the microenvironmental cues necessary for oogenesis, folliculogenesis, and ultimately egg formation from PGCLCs, a source of developmentally matched (embryonic) ovarian somatic cells is required.

Using a <italic>Foxl2</italic> promoter-driven reporter system, we have succeeded in purifying what appear, by lineage-specific gene expression profiling and functional testing (FSH responsiveness in vitro, incorporation into the granulosa cell layer of follicles in vivo), to be granulosa cells from ESC cultures during the earliest stages of specification. However, it bears mention that the approach employed can be improved on since early granulosa cell markers could sometimes be detected in the negative (non-DsRed expressing) cell population. This may reflect our FACS-based exclusion of a fraction of ESC-specified granulosa cells with a level of <italic>Foxl2</italic>-driven reporter expression that was too low to accurately identify and sort as positive cells.</p><p>The main problems faced in the purification and study of ESC-derived ovarian somatic cells are the vast heterogeneity of somatic cell types present in differentiating ESC cultures along with the reported low frequency of ovarian follicle-like structure formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719113483017">1</xref></sup> It is perhaps not surprising that these structures are rare, as ovarian follicles are comprised of cell types derived from distinct embryonic lineages. During mouse embryogenesis, PGC specification from pluripotent epiblast cells occurs around e7. Although PGCs are motile at this stage, they are retained in the hindgut until e9.5, at which time the cells initiate an active process of migration to the genital ridges over the next 2 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719113483017">18</xref></sup> Ovarian follicular somatic cells, on the other hand, are thought to be derived from the mesenchyme of the genital ridges and begin to proliferate only after PGCs migrate to and colonize the embryonic gonads.</p><p>While this developmental heterogeneity likely contributes to the rarity of follicle-like structure formation in ESC cultures, use of germ cell–selective fluorescent reporters has facilitated progress in this field. Among the most widely studied is a germ cell lineage reporter with GFP expression driven by a fragment of the mouse POU domain class 5 transcription factor 1 (<italic>Pou5f1</italic>; also known as octamer-binding transcription factor 4 or <italic>Oct4</italic>) gene promoter in which the epiblast-specific proximal enhancer region has been inactivated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719113483017">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719113483017">19</xref></sup> The ESCs generated from transgenic TgOG2 mice expressing this reporter can be reliably differentiated into GFP-positive oocyte-like cells in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719113483017">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719113483017">7</xref></sup> Moreover, when GFP-positive cells are isolated from differentiating TgOG2 ESC populations and transplanted into wild-type mouse ovaries, immature follicles containing GFP-positive oocytes can be detected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719113483017">7</xref></sup></p><p>In agreement with the results of others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719113483017">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719113483017">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719113483017">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719113483017">13</xref></sup> our findings confirm that follicle-like structures spontaneously form in monolayer cultures of mouse ESCs by day 16 of differentiation and continue to form through day 40. While the incidence of follicle-like structure formation was variable across the replicate cultures analyzed, GFP-expressing germ cells were consistently detected in all cultures. However, in ESCs expressing the <italic>Foxl2</italic>-DsRed reporter, we observed that approximately 20% of the more than 200 differentiating ESC cultures tested in this study failed to show the presence of any DsRed-positive cells. In addition, only those cultures containing cells expressing DsRed by day 5 of differentiation eventually generated follicle-like structures (data not shown). This indicates that not only do both cell types (germ cells and granulosa cells) need to be specified and present in these cultures for follicle-like structures to form but also the kinetics of granulosa cell and germ cell specification are critical. This conclusion is supported by in vivo observations with mice, showing that germ cell and granulosa precursor cell synchronization during fetal life is required for normal folliculogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719113483017">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719113483017"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719113483017">22</xref></sup></p><p>Our ability to isolate <italic>Foxl2</italic>-DsRed-expressing cells from all other cell types that arise in differentiating ESC cultures allowed us to perform a detailed assessment of changes in expression of known granulosa cell markers with the in-vitro progression of differentiation.

Notably, expression of luteinizing hormone receptor (<italic>Lhr</italic>) was never detected in our ESC cultures at any point postdifferentiation, and isolated <italic>Foxl2</italic>-DsRed-positive cells were not responsive to treatment with LH as measured by either estradiol or progesterone output (data not shown). This observation, combined with our findings that FSH significantly increases estrogen production by these cells, collectively indicate that the granulosa cells obtained from differentiating ESCs after day 10 resemble granulosa cells present in early secondary stage follicles.</p><p>To map the in vivo fate of these cells in a more natural setting by intraovarian transplantation, we used cultures differentiated for 12 days before isolation of <italic>Foxl2</italic>-DsRed-expressing cells to maximize the number of cells obtained from each culture. This time point is several days prior to the onset of follicle-like structure formation, and thus the DsRed-positive cells obtained would still resemble early stage pregranulosa cells. In addition, an FSH-responsive steroidogenic pathway can be activated in <italic>Foxl2</italic>-expressing cells at this stage of collection, solidifying their identity as granulosa cells. Even after waiting until day 12 postdifferentiation, a current limitation of this system for in vivo studies remains the very low frequency at which granulosa cells are specified from cultures of differentiating ESCs. In fact, 10 or more cultures of differentiating ESCs in 100 mm plates had to be pooled just to obtain the 200 to 500 DsRed-positive cells by FACs that were used for each intraovarian injection.</p><p>Despite the relatively low number of cells available for use, the injected DsRed-positive cells were clearly observed to associate with oocytes within a week after injection and then become incorporated, and exclusive localized, into the granulosa cell layer of immature growing follicles 2 weeks after transplantation These in vivo outcomes align well with our in vitro findings that <italic>Foxl2</italic>-DsRed-expressing cells, once specified, follow a progressive pattern of gene expression consistent with granulosa cell differentiation, not unlike what is observed in the developing gonad. Furthermore, these cells actively synthesize steroid hormones under basal culture conditions and elevate estradiol biosynthesis in response to FSH stimulation. Taken together, these data indicate that use of a <italic>Foxl2</italic> gene promoter-driven fluorescent reporter system facilitates purification and study of granulosa cells at progressive stages of differentiation from ESC cultures. The ability to now purify this important ovarian somatic cell lineage at the earliest stages of specification from differentiating ESCs may provide a means to more rapidly identify the factors and cell-to-cell interactions provided specifically by the embryonic ovarian somatic environment that instruct PGCLCs to differentiate into oocytes capable of maturation into fertilization-competent eggs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719113483017">2</xref></sup></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Laura Prickett-Rice and Kat Folz-Donahue of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute Flow Cytometry Core Facility for excellent technical assistance, and J.
