<abstract>
<p>Parents may maintain or exacerbate functional abdominal pain (FAP) in children through modeling of physical symptoms and solicitous responses to the child’s complaints. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine these relationships. Parents of children with FAP reported more physical symptoms than parents of healthy children (effect size <italic>d</italic> = .36). As all studies were cross-sectional or retrospective, the causal direction was unclear. For parental responses to child complaints, not enough studies were available to perform a meta-analysis. We conclude that the present literature is unfit to establish whether parents maintain or exacerbate pediatric FAP through the processes investigated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recurrent abdominal pain (AP) affects about 10 percent of school-aged children in western countries and is therefore a large health problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311410513">Chitkara et al., 2005</xref>). In most cases no organic abnormalities can be found to explain the pain, and thus the pain is considered ‘functional’ (FAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1359105311410513">Rasquin et al., 2006</xref>). Although no physical diseases are found in children with FAP, their daily functioning is usually significantly impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311410513">Campo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311410513">Claar and Walker, 2006</xref>). To develop effective treatments, it is crucial to have a thorough understanding of the factors that cause and maintain FAP. Unfortunately, however, the etiology of FAP is still unclear.</p>
<p>Throughout the literature the etiology of FAP is most often viewed within a biopsychosocial model. In the biopsychosocial model, biological factors like visceral hypersensitivity and psychological factors like coping style play a major role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311410513">Di Lorenzo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1359105311410513">Walker et al., 2008</xref>). A crucial social factor is the influence of parents on FAP. Although parents might also contribute to FAP biologically by passing on a genetic vulnerability – or, to use another term, through ‘nature’ – it has been suggested that their behavior (nurture) has an equal, if not larger influential role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311410513">Levy et al., 2001</xref>). The social learning theory proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311410513">Bandura (1977)</xref> explicates how this ‘nurture’ influence might work. Human behavior is for a large part learned by observing behavior modeled by persons in the environment. Whether modeled behavior is adopted by the observer depends on several factors, such as the number of times the behavior is modeled, or consequences of the behavior. Parents play a crucial role in two of these factors. First, parents are the primary models for children. With regard to FAP, this implies that parents who experience many physical symptoms themselves, may model a focus on physical symptoms to their children. Second, parents shape the behavior of their children with the feedback they provide. Children will more likely adopt modeled behavior if it results in positive outcomes than if it has unrewarding or punishing effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311410513">Bandura, 1977</xref>). Thus according to social learning theory, if parents react to FAP by, for example, allowing the child to stay home from school and watch television, this parental behavioral response might maintain or exacerbate FAP.</p>
<p>Pioneering work by Whitehead and colleagues in the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1359105311410513">Whitehead et al., 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1359105311410513">1986</xref>) has led to many publications on both the occurrence of physical symptoms in parents of children with FAP and the way parents react behaviorally when their child complains of AP. The results of these studies are mixed, and although some expert reviews have been published on this topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311410513">Levy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105311410513">Levy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359105311410513">Palermo and Eccleston, 2009</xref>), up until now no systematic or quantitative reviews have been performed. As such it is unclear whether these social learning processes show robust relationships with FAP over multiple studies. Another important issue that remains unclear after almost 30 years of research, is how these factors <italic>specifically</italic> relate to FAP. Do they contribute to the etiology of FAP or are they just epiphenomena, disappearing when the pain is resolved? Although it is a common belief among practitioners and scientists that social learning processes play a maintaining, exacerbating, or even causal role in the etiology of FAP, it has never been reviewed whether this is actually the case. Thus, the present study systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the literature on pediatric FAP to investigate both the magnitude and direction of the relationship between social learning processes and FAP.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors that could influence this relationship which should be considered when conducting a meta-analysis. For the present study we focused on both methodological parameters (methodological quality of the investigated studies, type of instrument used to measure social learning) and the theoretical parameters of parent gender, definition of FAP, and – specific for physical symptoms – type and moment of parental symptoms. The influence of parent gender was selected as a possible moderator, as previous studies showed that the relationship between parental and child complaints might be different for mothers and fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1359105311410513">Walker and Greene, 1989</xref>). Second, definition of FAP was selected because the term FAP has been used rather loosely to describe definitions ranging from ‘abdominal pain without a physical cause’ to definitions specifying duration and severity of the complaints. Third, as modeling effects might be specific to or stronger for the exact physical symptom that is portrayed by the parent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311410513">Buonavolonta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105311410513">Levy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1359105311410513">Whitehead et al., 1994</xref>), type of physical symptom was included as a moderator. Moreover, as it can be expected that more current displays of physical symptoms will have larger modeling effects than physical symptoms displayed in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311410513">Bandura, 1977</xref>), the moment of parental symptoms was included as a final moderator.</p>
<p>In summary, the purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate: (1) the magnitude of the relationship between parental physical symptoms/behavioral reactions and FAP in children and adolescents aged 4–18; (2) whether existing data can assess the causal direction of this relationship; and (3) whether the results of the studies are influenced by methodological moderators (methodological quality and type of instrument used to measure parental physical symptoms/behavioral reactions), and by the theoretical moderators of parent gender, definition of FAP, and – specific for physical symptoms – type and moment of parental symptoms.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1359105311410513">
<title>Search strategy</title>
<p>The MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, and A&amp;HCI (Web of Science) databases were searched up to 4 January 2011. In MEDLINE, PsychINFO and EMBASE, the thesaurus was used in combination with distinct key words. In Web of Science, no thesaurus is available, so the search was conducted by making use of key words only. Examples of key words used are (asterisks were used to truncate search terms): social learning, modeling, solicitous*, observational learning, abdominal pain*, irritable bowel syndrome*, functional dyspepsia, adolescent*, youth*, children. The specific search strings can be requested from the first author (SV). The reference lists of the relevant retrieved articles were searched for additional studies. Also, relevant reviews retrieved by the search were checked for additional studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1359105311410513">
<title>Study selection</title>
<p>The ‘PICO’ system (Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1359105311410513">Richardson et al., 1995</xref>) was used to define the study selection criteria. An article was eligible if it met all of the following criteria: (P) an empirical study presenting original data from children and/or adolescents (aged 4–18) or adults (in the case of a retrospective study); (I) concerning the effects of parental physical symptoms (occurring at the same time as the child’s pain or preceding the child’s pain) or parental behavioral reactions to the child’s pain; (O) on FAP (thus: either case-control studies comparing children with FAP and healthy children, or studies without control group in which a correlation between the measure of social learning and a measure of severity of FAP is calculated). Exclusion criteria were: case studies, no information reported on whether a medical cause was excluded or not, social learning behavior of others than parents or primary caregivers (e.g. siblings, grandparents). Note that the description of patients does not restrict the selected studies to research on clinical samples presenting to a hospital only, as a sole focus on children seeking medical consultation for FAP might bias the results. Similarly, the ‘C’ of the PICO system was not specified, as we also wanted to include studies that do not make use of a control group. No language restrictions were set beforehand.</p>

<sec id="section5-1359105311410513">
<title>Methodological quality assessment</title>
<p>Two reviewers (SV and RP) independently scored the quality of the studies. As no ‘golden standard’ for assessing the methodological quality of studies with varying research designs was available, we based our choice on a review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1359105311410513">Sanderson and colleagues (2007)</xref> and chose the checklist published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311410513">Fowkes and Fulton (1991)</xref> as a starting point. Five topics were reviewed, with several subcriteria per topic:</p>
<list id="list1-1359105311410513" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>representativeness of the sample (reliable source and sampling method is adequate/clear and relevant in- and exclusion criteria and demographic characteristics/adequate response rate);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>representativeness of the control group (if used; control group consists of well children/control group has comparable demographic characteristics as clinical group);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>quality of the instruments measuring social learning and quality of the instruments used to diagnose FAP or the procedure to exclude an identifiable organic cause of FAP (for both: a validated instrument is used/the procedure is reproducible/reliability of instrument is reported and sufficient);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>completeness of the data (drop outs and missing data do not influence the results); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>whether or not the raw data necessary to calculate an effect size were available.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Answer options were ‘yes’ (1 point), ‘no’ (0 points), and ‘don’t know’ (0 points). A total score for methodological quality was calculated by averaging the subcriteria per topic and then adding the scores for each topic. This resulted in a possible range of 0 (very low quality) to 5 (very high quality). Disagreement between the reviewers was resolved through consensus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359105311410513">
<title>Data extraction</title>
<p>SV extracted the data from the retrieved articles. Data concerning the sample, design, instruments used to measure social learning, the way in which an organic cause for the AP was excluded, and the outcomes were gathered on a standardized form. Data from studies that were suitable for meta-analysis were verified by RP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1359105311410513">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The available studies were first screened for eligibility for meta-analysis. To be eligible, a sufficient number of effect sizes (ES) had to be available (at least 10) from separate studies with a comparable research design. If a meta-analysis could be performed, an overall ES was calculated across the studies, which was tested for significance, using the macro for SPSS written by David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1359105311410513">Wilson (2005)</xref>. A homogeneity analysis was performed to check if the ES across studies were homogeneous. The influence of the methodological and theoretical moderators was investigated by performing a meta-regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105311410513">Lipsey and Wilson, 2001</xref>), making use of David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1359105311410513">Wilson’s (2005)</xref> macro for meta-analysis analog to ANOVA for the categorical moderators, and his macro for modified weighted regression analysis for the continuous moderator of methodological quality.</p>

<title>Search results</title>
<p>In total, the search strategy resulted in 731 citations (MEDLINE 234; PsychINFO 114; EMBASE 179; Web of Science 204). After removing doubles, the titles and abstracts were scanned for relevance. Ninety-four articles were retrieved in full; of these, 34 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Searching for references in reviews retrieved in the original search resulted in an additional six studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Upon further examination, 21 articles were excluded because they did not investigate whether there was an organic cause for the AP of the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311410513">Apley and Naish, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311410513">Bode et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311410513">Cardol et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311410513">Christensen and Mortensen, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311410513">Craig et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311410513">Crane and Martin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311410513">Groholt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311410513">Helgeland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311410513">Hommel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311410513">Jamison and Walker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311410513">Langer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105311410513">Levy et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105311410513">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311410513">Lipani and Walker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359105311410513">Mortimer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1359105311410513">Ramchandani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1359105311410513">Saunders et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1359105311410513">Stanford et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1359105311410513">Walker et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1359105311410513">Whitehead et al., 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1359105311410513">1994</xref>). Three articles were excluded from the analyses for parental physical symptoms because they did not solely focus on parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311410513">Krämer and Petermann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1359105311410513">Routh and Ernst, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1359105311410513">Walker et al., 1993</xref>). Finally, 10 studies reporting data on parental physical symptoms, six studies on parental behavioral reactions, and one on both, were included, making a total of 11 studies for parental physical symptoms and seven studies for parental behavioral reactions.

<title>Calculation of effect sizes</title>
<p>As a sufficient number of studies was available, the results for this search were meta-analyzed. To do this, one standardized mean difference ES <italic>d</italic> was calculated for each study. If more than one ES was available for a study because it measured the same kind of symptoms in both mothers and fathers, an average of the different ES was calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311410513">Garber et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1359105311410513">Robinson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1359105311410513">Walker and Greene, 1989</xref>). If both an ES for parental gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and for other physical symptoms was available, then the ES concerning GI symptoms was selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311410513">Campo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311410513">Kaufman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1359105311410513">Robinson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1359105311410513">Venepalli et al., 2006</xref>). For the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311410513">Garber and colleagues (1990)</xref>, a measure of a history of somatization, a history of psychogenic pain, and current somatization was available. However, only the current somatization measure provided raw data to calculate an ES. We contacted the authors to gain the acquired information, but unfortunately, this request stayed unanswered. Therefore, only the ES for current somatization was used for this study.</p>
<p>The raw data reported in these studies were either means or frequencies. To calculate one standardized mean ES <italic>d</italic>, the differences in frequencies had to be transformed to be comparable to the differences in means. For this purpose, the <italic>d</italic><sub>bis</sub> transformation was chosen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1359105311410513">Sánchez-Meca et al., 2003</xref>). For three studies, no sufficient raw data were available to calculate part of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311410513">Garber et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1359105311410513">Walker and Greene, 1989</xref>) the ES, or the entire ES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311410513">Lowman et al., 1987</xref>). In all of these cases, the studies reported that the effect was not significant. Therefore, an ES of 0 was imputed. Although this may underestimate the actual value of the overall population ES by creating a downward bias, this strategy might also compensate for the well-known effect that nonsignificant results are more likely to remain unpublished (the file-drawer problem), which can create an upward-bias.</p>
<p>The ES per study are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1359105311410513">Table 2</xref>. For interpretation purposes, the general conventions of Cohen can be used: <italic>d</italic> = .20 – small; <italic>d</italic> = .50 – medium; <italic>d</italic> = .80 – large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311410513">Cohen, 1977</xref>). No outlying effect sizes were identified.</p>

<title>Methodological quality</title>
<p>The results of the methodological quality assessment are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1359105311410513">Table 2</xref>. The two reviewers SV and RP agreed on 88.81 percent of the items, resulting in a good interobserver reliability of κ = .750.

<list id="list2-1359105311410513" list-type="order">

<list-item><p>no studies reported the reliability of the instruments used to measure social learning and to diagnose FAP in the sample at hand;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>only one out of the 11 studies used a validated instrument to diagnose FAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311410513">Lowman et al., 1987</xref>), and only five out of the 11 studies provided enough information to be able to reproduce their diagnosis of FAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311410513">Czyzewski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311410513">Garber et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311410513">Kaufman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1359105311410513">McGrath et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1359105311410513">Walker and Greene, 1989</xref>);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>only five of the 11 studies used control groups of which we were fairly certain they consisted of healthy children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311410513">Hotopf et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311410513">Lowman et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1359105311410513">Robinson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1359105311410513">Venepalli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1359105311410513">Walker and Greene, 1989</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A strong point of the studies was the absence of considerable missing data in seven of the studies. On average, the methodological quality of the studies was 2.86 (range 1.83–3.73). None received the maximum possible score of 5.</p>

<sec id="section14-1359105311410513">
<title>Meta-analysis and meta-regression</title>
<p>To investigate whether the overall ES of the different studies was significant and homogeneous across studies, a meta-analysis was performed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1359105311410513">Table 3</xref>). A significant small-to-medium overall ES <italic>d</italic> of .36 (95% CI: .13–.60; random effects model; <italic>p</italic> = .002) was found, indicating that parents of children with FAP report more physical symptoms than parents of healthy children. The homogeneity analysis showed the set of ES to be heterogeneous (Q<sub>within</sub> = 43.825; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). We therefore performed a set of meta-regressions in order to investigate whether our predefined moderators could explain this variance. In all of these analyses a mixed effects model was assumed, as this model has been shown to have a smaller risk on type I errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311410513">Higgins and Thompson, 2004</xref>). None of the investigated categorical moderators could explain the variance in ES across studies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1359105311410513">Table 3</xref>). For methodological quality, we did find a significant effect, indicating that studies receiving a higher score on methodological quality also reported higher ES (mixed effects model; Q<sub>model</sub> (1) = 4.262, <italic>p</italic> = .039; Q<sub>residual</sub> (9) = 10.598, <italic>p</italic> = .304; β = .54, <italic>p</italic> = .039; R<sup>2</sup> = .29).</p>

<p>As not enough studies with a comparable design were available to perform a meta-analysis, data on parental behavioral reactions to FAP were systematically reviewed. Seven studies were found with a total <italic>N</italic> for children of 736 for the clinical group and 248 for the control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311410513">Table 1</xref>). The designs of these studies are quite diverse: four are cross-sectional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311410513">Langer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1359105311410513">Venepalli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1359105311410513">Walker et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1359105311410513">Wendland et al., 2010</xref>), one retrospective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359105311410513">Pelzer, 1997</xref>), one experimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1359105311410513">Walker et al., 2006b</xref>), and one describes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioral intervention based on social learning theory is tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311410513">Levy et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1359105311410513">Table 4</xref> shows the definitions of parental behavioral reactions and the results of the seven studies. As can be seen in this table, the way behavioral reactions were defined ranged from punishment for problems related to bowel movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359105311410513">Pelzer, 1997</xref>) to solicitous behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1359105311410513">Venepalli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1359105311410513">Walker et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1359105311410513">Wendland et al., 2010</xref>). The experimental study, the RCT, and one of the cross-sectional studies reported some positive relationships between more rewarding parental reactions to FAP and more AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311410513">Levy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1359105311410513">Walker et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1359105311410513">2006b</xref>). Two cross-sectional studies found no significant relationship between either protective or solicitous parental behavior and pain severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311410513">Langer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1359105311410513">Wendland et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1359105311410513">Venepalli and colleagues (2006)</xref> found that mothers of children with FAP score higher on maternal minimizing/distracting behavior than mothers of healthy children. Finally, no relationship was found for punishing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359105311410513">Pelzer, 1997</xref>).</p>

<p>For the research question on whether existing data can assess the causal direction of the relationship between parental behavioral reactions and FAP, two out of the seven retrieved studies had a methodological design that had the potential to answer such a question: the RCT by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311410513">Levy and colleagues (2010)</xref> and the experimental study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1359105311410513">Walker and colleagues (2006b)</xref>. These studies were thus further scrutinized to investigate whether a causal relationship could be established. Starting with the former, the researchers investigated the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) protocol based on social learning principles. When looking at the contents of the protocol more closely, however, we found it also incorporated more general strategies like relaxation training and coping skills training. The researchers did not investigate which part of the effect was due to the social learning principles used in the protocol. Although it was established that solicitous parental behavior improved after treatment, the authors did not investigate whether this improvement could explain any of the treatment effects. Thus, this study could not provide evidence that social learning has a causal relationship with FAP.</p>
<p>The latter study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1359105311410513">Walker and colleagues (2006b)</xref> investigated the effects of parental attention or distraction in an experimental study. In this experiment, children first had to drink water until they felt completely full, which caused gastrointestinal symptoms. Parents were trained either to give attention to their child’s complaints or to distract their children. Whether this affected how much complaints a child experienced, was measured by observing the parent–child interaction for five minutes and scoring how often the child verbally complained about symptoms. In addition, children filled out a self-report questionnaire about gastrointestinal complaints when the parent–child interaction had ended. The design of this experiment is thus truly equipped to investigate whether there is a causal relationship between parental behavior and child complaints. The investigators found that if parents distracted their children from their AP, these children made less utterances of pain than if parents were instructed to pay attention to their child’s AP. Thus, it seems that distracting your child when it experiences AP is a positive reaction. However, this effect was not found when the level of AP experienced by the child was measured by a self-report questionnaire instead of by observing utterances of pain.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present structured review and meta-analysis shows that parents of children with FAP report more physical symptoms than parents of healthy children. Quantifying the relationship between parental symptoms and FAP over multiple studies for the first time, our meta-analysis showed a significant effect which was small-to-medium in size (ES <italic>d</italic> = .36). However, as all studies were either cross-sectional or retrospective, the direction of this effect could not be assessed. For parental behavioral reactions it was not possible to calculate the magnitude of the relationship with FAP, as not enough studies were available to perform a meta-analysis. Only one study assessed the causal direction of the relationship between this type of social learning and FAP. As the results of one study are not sufficient to draw a general conclusion, it is clear that the present literature cannot ascertain whether the common belief that parents may cause, maintain, or exacerbate pediatric FAP is accurate. Importantly, this is in contrast with the conclusion of a recent expert review, which concluded that ‘parental response to child pain behaviors appears to be a key factor in the development and maintenance of FAP’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311410513">Levy, 2010</xref>: 1). However, this review did not critically evaluate whether the designs of the studies included in the review could answer such a question about etiology. In fact, the expert based her conclusion solely on own – mostly observational – work, and on the same single experimental study we found in our structured review. Although the theory that parents may influence the etiology of FAP may still hold true, our systematic review clearly shows that the present literature is not equipped to support it.</p>
<p>Our last research question focused on whether methodological or theoretical moderators could explain differences across the studies. Although we did find that the effect sizes for parental physical symptoms differed significantly across studies, the only moderator that could explain some of this variance was methodological quality – studies that scored higher on methodological quality reported a larger effect size. The results for type of parental symptoms were especially surprising. Apparently, it does not matter whether parents suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms, somatization, or other physical symptoms – the effect sizes for these different types of symptoms did not significantly differ from one another. This raises the question whether parents model specific types of illness behavior or illness behavior in general, which is for some reason expressed by these children primarily through abdominal complaints instead of other physical symptoms.</p>
<p>However, it can be questioned whether the operationalization of modeling as ‘parental self-reports of physical symptoms’, which is used so often in the literature, is appropriate. Modeling can only occur if parents actually display physical symptoms to their child, which parents may or may not do even if they do report that they have physical symptoms. Nine out of the 11 studies investigated here measured parental physical symptoms by self-report, and we found no studies which asked parents to rate how often they displayed physical symptoms to their child, or children to rate how often their parents experienced physical symptoms, which both would be more sensitive measures of modeling.</p>
<p>Also, stress might offer an alternative explanation to modeling for the found relationship between parental and child symptoms – either the children experience more stress because of having an ill parent and develop FAP as a consequence, or the parents experience more stress because of having an ill child, and experience somatic symptoms as a result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359105311410513">Palermo and Eccleston, 2009</xref>). Parents and their children might also experience common life stressors which lead to somatic symptoms in both the parent and the child.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1359105311410513">
<title>Directions for future studies</title>
<p>Our study highlights a number of voids in the literature that need attention. The first obviously concerns the lack of studies with appropriate designs to sort out cause and effect. Second, for more than half (52.5%) of the studies that met our inclusion criteria, it could not be established that the AP of the children was in fact functional. These studies mostly focused on recurrent AP in general, without excluding organic causes for AP. Although in most cases of recurrent AP an organic cause cannot be found, studies should still explicitly exclude children for which an organic cause can be found, or they might risk a considerable sampling bias.</p>
<p>Third, only three studies on parental physical symptoms reported separate scores for mothers and fathers, and two out of these three did not report sufficient raw data to calculate a separate effect size for fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311410513">Garber et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1359105311410513">Robinson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1359105311410513">Walker and Greene, 1989</xref>). Therefore, it was impossible to establish the contribution of each parent to the total effect. Studies might do well to broaden their focus to incorporate fathers or secondary caregivers as well, especially as recent experimental research in adults has shown that people might be more likely to adopt behavior modeled by a same-sex model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105311410513">Lorber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105311410513">Mazzoni et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we could find very few studies that focused on the second element of social learning we investigated, parental reactions to a child’s AP. Additionally, these studies had largely differing designs, which made it impossible to perform a meta-analysis on their combined results. Three out of the seven studies found a positive relationship between maladaptive parental reactions and FAP. Obviously, these results leave ample room for discussion on the relevance of this type of social learning for FAP. Indeed, studies in other (pediatric) populations have also questioned the relevance of solicitous parental reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311410513">Jellesma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359105311410513">Palermo and Eccleston, 2009</xref>). The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1359105311410513">Walker and colleagues (2006b)</xref> is especially relevant in this regard, as it is the only study with an appropriate design to sort out cause and effect. This study found that if parents distract their children from their AP, children make less utterances of pain than if parents are instructed to pay attention to their child’s AP. Thus, it seems that distracting your child when he or she experiences AP is a positive reaction. However, this effect was not found when the level of AP experienced by the child was measured by a self-report questionnaire instead of by observing utterances of pain. Thus, the question is whether these children actually experienced less AP when their parents distracted them, or that they merely learned that they should not complain about the pain and should stop mentioning it, as the authors also point out themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1359105311410513">Walker et al., 2006b</xref>). Clearly, more (experimental) research is needed to sort out what the relevance of this type of social learning process is for FAP.</p>
<p>There are three issues this review did not focus on, which should be incorporated in future research. First, we have assumed that parents will model <italic>maladaptive</italic> illness behavior, while in fact parents may also react in <italic>adaptive</italic> ways to their own symptoms. If so, they might model adaptive coping behavior, and consequently have a beneficial influence on the symptoms of their children. Second, it should be investigated whether parental physical symptoms and behavioral reactions interact with each other. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311410513">Bandura (1977)</xref> describes social learning as a process in which both of these factors have a separate influence, but also interact: the odds that modeled behavior is actually adopted by the child will increase when motivational processes like a parent ‘rewarding’ the child’s behavior are added to the equation. Then, perhaps the effects of social learning are strongest in parents that both experience physical symptoms themselves, and reward their children when having AP. Finally, future studies would do well to investigate the way parents think about the complaints of their child. The current study focused on behavioral reactions which could be observed directly by the child, but this behavior is influenced by the thoughts, beliefs and worries parents have (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311410513">Bonner and Finney, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1359105311410513">Van Tilburg et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1359105311410513">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, it should be acknowledged that performing a systematic review and meta-analysis on a subject for which few empirical articles are available, has its limitations. For example, there was no room to explore alternative ways in which parents might influence the complaints of their child, as can be done in qualitative or expert reviews. We feel that this drawback is compensated, however, by the benefits of meta-analysis in this case, as it has clearly brought to light the lack of substantial evidence for causality that expert reviews have failed to underscore. Moreover, the meta-analytic approach adds new insights to the literature as it is the first meta-analysis performed, whereas other types of reviews on the relevance of social learning have appeared in abundance.</p>
<p>We conclude that the present literature is not equipped to either confirm or refute the common belief that parents may cause, maintain or exacerbate pediatric FAP. Parents of children with FAP do experience somewhat more somatic complaints than parents of healthy children, but cause and effect cannot be established. Although no compelling evidence on causality is available at this point, the theory that parents influence FAP might still hold true, as evidence underlining the opposite is also lacking. Performing more longitudinal and experimental studies is essential if we want to determine what role social learning plays in the etiology of FAP. Only then can we judge whether treatments of pediatric FAP should attempt to focus on the influence of parents.</p>
