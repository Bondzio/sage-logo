<p>Robert Frank’s <italic>The Darwin Economy</italic> is an ambitious attempt to establish a new conceptual framework to understand market competition, regulation, and tax policy. Frank’s bold assertion is that one hundred years from now, economists will name Charles Darwin, not Adam Smith, as the most important influence on their field. His key argument is that Darwin’s theory of natural selection is a more apt description of how competition actually works than is the doctrine espoused by Smith’s modern acolytes.</p>
<p>Instead of the traditional model, in which self-interest and the public good are aligned, Darwin’s economy is one in which individuals often engage in wasteful competition, particularly over “positional goods” whose evaluation is greatly influenced by contextual factors. For example, H. L. Mencken once said, “A wealthy man is one who earns $100 a year more than his wife’s sister’s husband.” Male Irish elk battle each other for access to females, a process that favors those individuals with the largest antlers. Unfortunately for the elk, large antlers increase their vulnerability to predators and make it more difficult for them to navigate their habitat. Similarly, human beings spend excessively on houses, clothes, cars, and all sorts of positional goods because, as Frank puts it, “life is graded on a curve.”</p>
<p>If the elk could somehow agree to reduce their antler sizes by the same proportion, no individual would be worse off (relative rank would stay the same), but the population would be better off. Analogously, we could all be better off if we spent less on positional goods and more on goods for which rank matters less, including public goods like safe roads and clean air that we can all enjoy. To accomplish this transition, Frank outlines a specific policy recommendation: a steeply progressive consumption tax that he predicts would discourage these arms races and reward savings and investment.</p>
<p>
<italic>The Darwin Economy</italic> aspires to fundamentally reshape the public discourse over the most contentious political issue of our time: the proper role of government in regulating economic activity. Despite tackling such a complex and expansive topic, Frank has produced an excellent book that is carefully researched and well written. The argument he develops will be most useful for policymakers and pundits, clearly his primary audience for this book. In the public arena, debating points are often scored by asserting that the market will always provide the most efficient outcome. Frank’s insights provide a coherent counter-narrative, deeply grounded in economics and other social sciences. Academics, including organizational scholars, will also find this work intriguing but will have to consult his scholarly articles for deeper explanations of the key ideas. Below, I explain the most important contributions of <italic>The Darwin Economy</italic> and reflect on the few weaknesses in its argumentation.</p>
<p>The most impressive feature of the book is Frank’s ability to take a simple, yet powerful argument rooted in his academic discipline and draw specific policy recommendations that could remake the American economy and radically alter our political discourse. He frames his argument as a conversation with a skeptical libertarian, whom he surmises would initially oppose most of his recommendations as restrictions of individual liberty. What he tries to convince the reader (and the imaginary libertarian) of is that many activities have hidden externalities that must be taken into consideration. As an example, he considers a sprinter who chooses to use anabolic steroids to gain an edge over his competitors. Though we might be tempted to tout the sprinter’s “freedom” to use drugs, this choice also indirectly harms the other sprinters.</p>
<p>Frank returns to this notion of indirect harm to build his argument for a progressive consumption tax in a society in which many things are graded on a curve. A consumption tax would tax the difference between what individuals make and what they save, less a standard deduction. One implication of this tax proposal is that the very rich might spend less on luxuries (e.g., a $2-million addition to a $10-million home would be taxed heavily), and this restraint would cascade down to those in the middle class who, Frank argues, are struggling today to keep up with the “Joneses” on stagnant incomes. After all, he argues, all societies choose to tax something to pay for public goods. The best target for taxation seems to be wasteful spending on positional goods.</p>
<p>Another strength of the book is that the author presents novel arguments that very few public intellectuals are making. There are countless popular press books on the market today making the same tired arguments from the right and the left, usually dressed up with a new framing or wrapped up in the author’s own public image. Frank himself does not loom large in his work. The spotlight is on his ideas. Moreover, though he is hardest on libertarians and the political right, he also parts company with the left on contentious issues around cost benefit analysis and the rationale behind new regulations.</p>
<p>Longtime readers of Frank’s work will recognize that he has pioneered many of these arguments in his prior academic and popular work. His 1985 <italic>American Economic Review</italic> piece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0001839213481577">Frank, 1985</xref>) introduces positional goods, and his books, <italic>Luxury Fever</italic> (for which I served as a research assistant when I was an undergraduate at Cornell) and <italic>The Winner Take All Society</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0001839213481577">Cook and Frank, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0001839213481577">Frank, 1999</xref>) popularized the idea that relative position matters. Rather than imagining individuals as maximizing utility independent of context, Frank was one of the first economists to recognize that relative position matters too. It is also worth noting that his arguments are not simply restatements of the latest insights from the behavioral economics literature. The arms race is driven by rational behavior, not cognitive errors that would be corrected in hindsight.</p>
<p>Although Frank’s work is a novel contribution to the public discourse, organizational scholars will be quite familiar with his key arguments. Those who study network structure, status, and peer effects may even be surprised that these concepts have not had greater influence on economic policy debates. The silver lining is that he has opened the door for economic sociologists to participate more actively in public policy debates. After all, while most of the social scientists who are deeply involved in public policy are economists, the issues that this book raises are in domains in which sociologists have made considerable progress.</p>
<p>Frank’s argument could benefit from a more robust consideration of organizations, however, both private and public. Frank sketches a very interesting argument to rebut frequent and unspecified allegations of public sector waste but points out that the private sector is incredibly wasteful too. Although he is primarily thinking of consumer spending on luxury goods here, it is also plausible that firms waste significant sums of money, despite the disciplining forces of the market. This point is often completely lost in public debates but is an important topic for scholars who study organizational governance and structure. But he does not elaborate much on this point and leaves the reader to consider more systematic ways to assess the full extent of private sector waste.</p>
<p>Moreover, while he uses Darwin’s insights primarily as a metaphor to explain his own perspective on competition, none of Frank’s policy recommendations rely on Darwin’s theories. Indeed, we need not invoke Darwin at all to discuss the frequent instances in which individual and group interests diverge. By inserting Darwin into the conversation, however, Frank introduces some additional complexity that might cause confusion. For example, the arms race that increases the antler size of male elk could have implications for individual bulls, bulls as a group, and elk as a species. Darwin’s theory does not make precise predictions for each case, which might hamper a neat mapping to economic policy. These complications are stumbling blocks for Darwin being recognized as the intellectual father of economics (in addition to the fact that he was heavily influenced by Malthus, a student of Smith), but they do not negate the key arguments of the book.</p>
<p>In addition, there is little consideration of the political economy factors that typically constrain the kind of institutional change that Frank is hoping for. As he himself points out, rich baseball owners like George Steinbrenner historically fought against a hard salary cap and revenue sharing because it would harm his advantage over his competitors, even if it would also reduce his total spending outlays. One can easily imagine that Frank’s proposals would be vehemently opposed by those who benefit from current economic policies, making them nearly impossible to implement.</p>
<p>Finally, it is an open question whether the problems in Washington today are an honest disagreement over ideas, rather than a ferocious battle to protect scarce resources for chosen special interest groups. After all, there are very few libertarians in the halls of Congress of the kind he describes. As persuasive as Frank’s arguments might be, there are reasons to doubt that winning intellectual arguments can influence votes in Congress or even public opinion, especially in the short to medium term. While Frank’s progressive consumption tax is not as radical as readers might think (it was introduced in 1995 by a bipartisan team of U.S. senators), it will not be considered until the two parties agree to take up comprehensive tax reform, which may not happen for years.</p>
<p>Even with these minor concerns, Frank has produced another engaging and well-argued book that is a welcome addition to the proliferation of popular-press “big idea” books by academics. He translates his own original research and faithfully incorporates the work of his fellow academics to create a novel and precise argument that, if implemented, would change our economy and society in a fundamental way. <italic>The Darwin Economy</italic> will likely be his most influential work to date, an impressive feat given his track record. Though primarily intended for policymakers and pundits, scholars of organizations will find this work useful, especially if they themselves wade into public debates and are looking for pithy and logical arguments.</p>
