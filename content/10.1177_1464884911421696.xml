<abstract>
<p>News outlets serve democratic norms by providing a wide range of viewpoints, including opinions from the public. This study examined opinion expression in online reader posts and letters to the editor in a community facing social conflict. Analysis of opinion expression about the Jena Six showed more balance in both the range and tone of opinions from online reader comments than reader letters. Online posts more often challenged community institutions than did letters. Ability to post anonymous comments, the absence of media gatekeepers and a younger audience are potential reasons why online reader comments differed from reader letters.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Opinion expressions are an essential element of democratic norms articulated through concepts like the marketplace of ideas that suggest the public needs access to a wide variety of views on a topic in making an informed, rational decision about their future. News outlets traditionally have served a critical role in disseminating these opinions, including avenues for the public to communicate with each other through forums like letters to the editor. This role of facilitating communication among citizens embodies the ideals of the public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884911421696">Habermas, 1999[1962]</xref>), which describes a democratic utopia in which all citizens have an opportunity to participate in discussing social and political matters important toward making decisions for the common good. This philosophy reflects norms of deliberative democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884911421696">Benhabib, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884911421696">Charney, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884911421696">Cohen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884911421696">Gimmler, 2001</xref>), which are grounded on the understanding that decisions are made by citizens engaged in free and reasoned deliberation.</p>
<p>However, this notion of news organizations contributing to a public sphere is more a normative ideal than reality. Audience letters do not necessarily reflect public opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911421696">Buell, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911421696">Forsythe, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911421696">Grey and Brown, 1970</xref>). This may be due to gatekeepers within news organizations limiting opinions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884911421696">Kapoor, 1995</xref>) or common news practices that ban anonymity, causing some to refrain from submitting letters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884911421696">Reader et al., 2004</xref>). New technology, however, has eliminated some obstacles to broad discourse. Many news organizations with websites allow the public to post anonymous comments in response to stories, bypassing gatekeepers who filter opinions. Online reader posts thus offer the potential for a range of opinions that more closely matches ideals of the public sphere.</p>
<p>To assess the range of opinions, this analysis compares opinions in letters to the editor and online reader posts in response to a social conflict during 2007 and 2008 when school and justice officials in Jena, Louisiana, faced harsh criticism, both within and from outside the community, over the punishment of six African-American high school students. The ‘Jena Six’ became a symbol of racist treatment of African-Americans that called into question the performance of school officials, political leaders and the community itself. The focus was on newspapers close to the site of the conflict, as the role of local news organizations to share the range of public views may be particularly critical in communities with few outlets for public discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464884911421696">Tichenor et al., 1980</xref>), including times when communities face a disruption of the established social, cultural and political order.</p>

<title>Literature review</title>
<p>Discourse has traditionally been conceived as playing a central role in creating the enlightened, engaged citizenry that is necessary for a democracy to function effectively. The marketplace of ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884911421696">Milton, 1909[1644]</xref>) advocates a broad range of discourse and was fundamental to later interpretations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884911421696">Dewey, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911421696">Meiklejohn, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911421696">Mill, 1999[1859]</xref>). Those philosophical roots form the basis of deliberative democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884911421696">Meraz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464884911421696">Wahl-Jorgensen, 2007</xref>) that assumes a rational public, exposed to widespread discussion, will make an informed decision on matters related to public policy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884911421696">Habermas (1999[1962])</xref> saw communication as playing a central role in the public sphere, through interpersonal discussion and mass communication that inform the public about political and social issues important for the collective good, providing a normative model for communication in democracies. ‘The public sphere as a functional element in the political realm was given the normative status of an organ for the self-articulation of civil society with a state authority corresponding to its needs’, Habermas wrote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884911421696">1999[1962]</xref>: 74). According to Stevenson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464884911421696">1995</xref>: 49), ‘The purpose of the public sphere was to enable the people to reflect critically on itself and on the practices of the state.’ Deliberation is a necessary condition for attaining legitimacy and rationality in decision-making (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884911421696">Benhabib, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884911421696">Cohen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884911421696">Gimmler, 2001</xref>), a space where citizens can freely debate, deliberate and engage in formation of collective democratic will (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884911421696">Charney, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The challenge is how to create a more inclusive, egalitarian and democratic public place, one in which news provides an outlet for public discourse. News outlets allow diverse constituencies to participate in the discourse and carry on a shared conversation, traditionally through letters to the editor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464884911421696">Wahl-Jorgensen, 2007</xref>) and more recently by posting comments on digital versions of stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884911421696">Chung, 2008</xref>). While journalists provide the context for opinion expressions through the choice of sources and views, the audience can echo those views, provide contrary opinions or introduce new ideas.</p>
<sec id="section3-1464884911421696">
<title>Opinions in letters to the editor</title>
<p>Letters to the editor are a forum for citizens to express opinions and debate important issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884911421696">Davis and Rarick, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884911421696">Dearden, 1986</xref>), often in reaction to a story, an editorial, or a previous letter to the editor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884911421696">Davis and Rarick, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911421696">Forsythe, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911421696">Grey and Brown, 1970</xref>). Ideally, letters sections are a forum for diverse public debate, allowing for direct and active participation in politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464884911421696">Wahl-Jorgensen, 2007</xref>). As described by Wahl-Jorgensen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464884911421696">2007</xref>: 35):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The newspaper not only contributed to making public private individuals’ ‘letters’ about political causes, but also constructed a mode of expression that relied on the appearance of a public debate. It provided a conversational and egalitarian mode of address. … It supported a principle of democratized rational debate because it implied that the writer could be any member of the public.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Reader letters have long been a staple of newspapers, dating back to 1722 in colonial America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911421696">Hart, 1970</xref>: 99). Reader letters were common throughout the partisan press era of the 18th and 19th centuries, typically reflecting the political stance of the newspaper. Newspapers of the era invited reader participation. For instance, Hart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911421696">1970</xref>: 111) described Thomas Fleet’s <italic>Boston Weekly Rehearsal</italic> as soliciting ‘all Gentlemen of Leisure and Capacity … to write anything of a political nature, that tends to enlighten and serve the Publick, to communicate their productions, provided they are not overlong’. Newspapers targeted a broader audience during the Penny Press era of the 1830s, dropping partisanship by separating opinions from fact-based stories. The net effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464884911421696">Wahl-Jorgensen, 2007</xref>: 38), was that ‘Regular citizens’ voices were allowed into the newspaper because they were seen as representing the truth and authenticity of the public.’ Reader letters have remained a regular feature of many newspapers, partly because letters are widely read (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464884911421696">Pritchard and Berkowitz, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464884911421696">Singletary, 1976</xref>) and editors believe they can have a significant impact on readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911421696">Hynds and Martin, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>Expressions of opinion in reader letters may also influence news content. Pritchard and Berkowitz found that content in letters influenced editors to write about certain issues and to emphasize particular topics in the news. Considering that most newspapers are commercial enterprises that survive by attracting an audience, journalists must provide the types of content that the audience desires. Letters to the editor are one the few means by which journalists can learn what readers are thinking about (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464884911421696">Pritchard and Berkowitz, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Less clear is whether letters are a good representation of public opinion. Since people who write letters are often older, better educated and more conservative than the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911421696">Buell, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911421696">Forsythe, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911421696">Grey and Brown, 1970</xref>), published letters may not be an accurate gauge of the audience. Yet letters to the editor may reflect public opinion on controversial topics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911421696">Hill (1981)</xref> found that the percentage of letters to the editor supporting the Equal Rights Amendment was similar to public opinion polls on the topic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884911421696">Sigelman and Walkosz (1992)</xref> found that the reasons voiced in major newspapers in Arizona nearly matched public sentiment on why the state voted against making Martin Luther King Day a paid holiday in Arizona. Sigelman and Walkosz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884911421696">1992</xref>: 945) argue that people who write letters are becoming more like the average citizen, and that ‘highly salient issues that engage large numbers of citizens’ are more likely to show similar proportions of letters that match public opinion polls.</p>
<p>Restricted space leads many newspapers to publish just some of the letters they receive. Only 5 percent to 50 percent of letters received at large newspapers are published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464884911421696">Wahl-Jorgensen, 2001</xref>). Media gatekeepers favor letters that are succinct, well-written and focus on timely, important issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884911421696">Kapoor, 1995</xref>). Other criteria favor letters containing ‘reasonable ideas’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464884911421696">Wahl-Jorgensen, 2001</xref>), and rejecting form letters, open letters to other people, and letters deemed too vulgar, not focused on current issues or containing false information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884911421696">Reader, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884911421696">Renfro, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>Writer identity is another common criterion directly relevant to examining differences between letters to the editor and online posts. Most contemporary newspapers require the writer’s name (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884911421696">Reader, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884911421696">Renfro, 1979</xref>), which reduces the number of people who write letters to the editor – especially among women, racial minorities and urban residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884911421696">Reader et al., 2004</xref>) – and potentially limits the range of views. By contrast, news websites typically allow writers to use a pseudonym. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884911421696">Reader (2005)</xref> speculates that allowing anonymity in letters to the editor would expand the range of views, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1464884911421696">Scholtz (2007)</xref> contends that anonymity may dampen discourse because anonymous posters are not accountable for their opinions. McDevitt et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884911421696">2003</xref>: 458) suggested that: ‘anonymity leads to behavior that tends to be emotional and impulsive … presumably this disinhibition extends to the expression of minority opinions.’</p>

<title>Opinions in online posts</title>
<p>The focus of this study – the tone of online reader posts – has received little scholarly attention. Instead, most research into online reader posts focused on the frequency and technology of news organizations in providing reader posts, or how news organizations react to the posts.</p>
<p>Online reader posts fit within a broader context of user-generated content, part of the reason why scholarship remains diffuse, with different labels attached to similar phenomena. For instance, several labels have been applied to opportunities for the audience to post comments online, including reader/audience blogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911421696">Domingo and Heinonen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884911421696">Hermida and Thurman, 2008</xref>), audience participation opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911421696">Domingo et al., 2008</xref>), audience/reader comments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464884911421696">Wardle et al., 2009</xref>) and online reader comments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911421696">Nielsen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884911421696">Santana, 2010</xref>). The term online reader comment is used here because it is less likely to be confused with broader phenomena like blogs.</p>
<p>Online reader posts are becoming ubiquitous among newspapers. Among the top 150 US newspapers in 2010, 92 percent accepted online comments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884911421696">Santana, 2010</xref>). Newspapers are increasingly accepting online posts, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884911421696">Johnson (2008)</xref> documented a rapid rise among the top 100 US newspapers from 17 percent in 2006 to 33 percent in 2007 and 75 percent in 2008. News sites provide easy access to public participation and require minimal technological expertise. Online reader posts are typically arranged in reverse chronological order, rather than using journalistic criteria like relevance, and items are published as they are posted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911421696">Domingo and Heinonen, 2008</xref>). While many news sites remove postings that are defamatory or in bad taste, most posts remain on the site. Typically, those posting comments on news sites attach a self-selected pseudonym rather than their name.</p>
<p>Journalists are ambivalent about online reader posts, expressing concerns over the posts, but acknowledging that posts occasionally affect stories. Journalists expressed general resistance to interactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884911421696">Hermida and Thurman, 2008</xref>) and considered them a distraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884911421696">Santana, 2010</xref>). Although online reader posts may promote a feeling of community among readers and foster dialogue between users and journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884911421696">Chung, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911421696">Domingo and Heinonen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464884911421696">Wardle et al., 2009</xref>), news organizations are still trying to figure out how to integrate user participation within existing journalistic norms and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884911421696">Hermida and Thurman, 2008</xref>), such as assuring that user-generated content is factual and verifiable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911421696">Nielsen, 2010</xref>). Some journalists pay attention to online reader posts – 36 percent of those reached by Nielsen say they frequently or always read online comments on their stories, while 69 percent of those contacted by Santana said they read online comments often or sometimes. Most journalists did not find comments useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911421696">Nielsen, 2010</xref>), yet journalists got story ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464884911421696">Robinson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884911421696">Santana, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464884911421696">Wardle et al., 2009</xref>), added story content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464884911421696">Robinson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884911421696">Santana, 2010</xref>) and fixed inaccuracies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464884911421696">Robinson, 2010</xref>) in response to online reader posts. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911421696">Domingo and Heinonen (2008)</xref> noted that posts may openly challenge journalism by offering competing or complementary information.</p>
<p>As for the content of online reader posts, anonymity gives reluctant individuals an avenue to express views, expanding the number of participants in the discourse and potentially the range of views aired. Although anonymity may allow extreme views to proliferate, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884911421696">McDevitt et al. (2003)</xref> found that those engaged in a computer-mediated discussion in an experimental setting expressed more moderate views than those in a face-to-face setting. The technology has similarities to blogs, but many blogs adopt a specific viewpoint, leading to ‘ideological balkanization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1464884911421696">Xenos, 2008</xref>) on political blogs and drawing primarily like-minded visitors. By contrast, news organizations typically pledge traditional news values of objectivity and balance, potentially attracting a broader range of public views.</p>

<title>Research questions</title>
<p>Evidence suggests a broader discourse among online reader posts than among letters to the editor, due to 1) the absence of media gatekeepers deciding which opinions to publish, and 2) the ability of the audience to post online comments anonymously. Most reader letters are not published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464884911421696">Wahl-Jorgensen, 2001</xref>) and media gatekeepers favor some letters over others, including those well-written (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884911421696">Kapoor, 1995</xref>), containing reasonable ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464884911421696">Wahl-Jorgensen, 2001</xref>) and focused on current issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884911421696">Reader, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884911421696">Renfro, 1979</xref>). By contrast, news organizations routinely allow all online reader posts, although posts in poor taste may be removed. The anonymity of online reader posts, as contrasted with the practice of newspapers to require the author’s name on letters to the editor, should increase the number of people willing to express opinion and perhaps lead to better representation among women and racial minorities who express reluctance to submit signed letters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884911421696">Reader et al., 2004</xref>). Considering the racially charged nature of the Jena Six events, more representation among racial minorities could mean a wider range of opinions among online posts. It could free anonymous writers from social pressures that come with expressing unpopular opinions that do not conform with dominant opinions. However, it is less clear how the broader discourse will manifest itself in the opinion expression, hence the first two research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-1464884911421696" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>RQ1: Did the balance of opinion expression about the Jena Six vary in comparing letters to the editor with online reader comments?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>RQ2: Did the tone of opinion expression about the Jena Six vary in comparing letters to the editor with online reader comments?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The presence of new information, coming from community events, news coverage and opinion expression in a variety of media, all can affect the subsequent tone of opinion expression in reader letters and reader posts. Thus, the final question:</p>
<list id="list2-1464884911421696" list-type="simple">

<title>Social conflict: Jena Six</title>
<p>Publicity about a series of racially charged incidents and responses centered in Jena, Louisiana, including a large rally led by prominent African-American leaders in September 2007, established ‘Jena Six’ as a national example of racial injustice. Their primary grievance was criminal charges filed against six African-American high school students (the Jena Six), but the marches also targeted racial prejudice in the area and across the country. For others, however, the primary issue was six African-American students beating up one white student and outsiders trying to trivialize the attack as minor, with these outsiders portraying the Jena community and justice system as racist. A series of events and incidents between July 2007 and January 2008 attracted news attention and public comments (see descriptions in the methods section). The high level of public interest in the incidents meant local news organizations could not ignore the topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884911421696">Berkowitz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1464884911421696">Wolfsfeld and Sheafer, 2006</xref>), while the inherent conflict made for public views both supportive and critical of the Jena Six. The Jena Six events received extensive news attention, especially in communities around Jena, Louisiana.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Data were drawn from electronic archives of letters to the editor and online reader comments from newspapers in Louisiana and Mississippi. Focusing on local news is especially appropriate to examine opinion expression that forms the range of public discourse during social conflict. Since those living in and around Jena have a personal stake in the performance of local institutions and the climate of racial relations, many should be motivated to participate in the public discourse. In addition, those living in the area may have access to first-hand accounts of what happened and insights into the behavior of principal characters involved in the incidents that would add to the dialogue.</p>
<p>All 32 daily newspapers listed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884911421696"><italic>Editor &amp; Publisher</italic> (2006)</xref> and located within 180 miles of Jena formed the study area. Since collecting online reader comments was a focus of this study, the six newspapers that archived reader comments (<italic>Alexandria Daily Town Talk, Hammond Daily Star, Monroe News-Star, Natchez</italic> (MS) <italic>Democrat, New Iberia Daily Iberian</italic> and <italic>Opelousas Daily World</italic>) were included in the sample. Of the remaining newspapers with searchable archives, the four closest to Jena (<italic>Bastrop Daily Enterprise, Lafayette Daily Advertiser, Leesville Daily Leader</italic> and <italic>Vicksburg</italic> (MS) <italic>Post</italic>) and the remaining five with the largest weekday circulation (<italic>Baton Rouge Advocate, Jackson</italic> (MS) <italic>Clarion-Ledger, Lake Charles American Press, New Orleans Times-Picayune</italic> and <italic>Shreveport Times</italic>) were included in the sample.</p>
<p>The term ‘Jena’ was used in searchable archives; Lexis-Nexis for the two newspapers with the largest circulation (<italic>Baton Rouge Advocate</italic> and <italic>New Orleans Times-Picayune</italic>) and the newspaper websites for the remaining 13 papers. All content (news items, editorials, letters to editors and reader comments that were at least five sentences long) that related to Jena Six events between 1 July 2007 and 31 January 2008 was copied into text files. This analysis focuses just on the online reader posts and letters to the editor. Anonymous letters to the editor were excluded from this analysis since there were few anonymous letters in the sample and it controlled one contextual factor.</p>
<p>An online reader comment was operationalized as all of a particular writer’s postings on a single day, excluding irrelevant postings. Thus, if an entire posting consisted of comments about another reader (e.g. ‘I think you’re stupid’) or matters unrelated to the topic (e.g. comments about the weather), it was excluded. Each newspaper with online comments was accessible for free. All online comments were posted in response to specific articles and each newspaper required posters to register and select a pseudonym. Each newspaper allowed users to flag posts for inappropriate comments and the archives indicated which posts had been removed.</p>
<sec id="section8-1464884911421696">
<title>Variables, reliability</title>
<p>Two researchers examined content and noted common viewpoints. Those opinions were divided into six pairs of contrasting topics, each representing either a pro-Jena Six or anti-Jena Six opinion. Many involved assessment of challenges toward community institutions, sparking expressions that were either favorable or unfavorable toward the Jena Six and their supporters. Each of the 12 potential topic opinions was coded on a scale of 0 = not mentioned, 1 = minor focus of article and 2 = major focus of article. Reliability testing was performed on 120 articles (19% of the 623 articles that constituted the population) using Krippendorff’s alpha, which takes chance agreement into account (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911421696">Hayes and Krippendorff, 2007</xref>). Variables with alphas of lower than 0.70 were dropped from the coding scheme, an acceptable level in exploratory research using conservative reliability tests that take chance agreement into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884911421696">Lombard et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Topic opinions, with reliability figures and percent of coder agreement:</p>
<p><italic>Jena incident, central figures</italic>: The pro-Jena Six variable captured views that the Jena Six were persecuted or victims, or that the white students at Jena High acted inappropriately or were a bad element (α = 0.77, agreement 85.7%). The parallel variable captured white students as persecuted or victims, or the Jena Six as behaving inappropriately or a bad element (α = 0.74, agreement 90.1%).</p>
<p><italic>Jena community, South as region</italic>: The pro-Jena Six opinion depicted the area as racist or authorities from the school or community behaving inappropriately toward the Jena Six (α = 0.75, agreement 92.3%). The contrasting variable declared the area was not racist or that local authorities behaved appropriately (α = 0.90, agreement 97.8%).</p>
<p><italic>Rallies and events about Jena Six</italic>: The pro-Jena Six variable depicted rallies (or similar events) on behalf of the Jena Six and its participants positively, or anti-Jena Six rallies negatively (α = 0.79, agreement 91.2%). The other variable depicted rallies (or similar events) against the Jena Six and its participants positively, or pro-Jena Six rallies and participants negatively (α = 0.76, agreement 86.8%).</p>
<p><italic>Justice system</italic>: The pro-Jena Six variable depicted opinions that the justice system (prosecutors, courts, police) was unfair or overly harsh toward the Jena Six or overly lenient toward whites involved in the Jena incidents (α = 0.73, agreement 91.2%). The parallel measure declared that the justice system was too lenient toward the Jena Six or unfair to whites involved in the Jena incidents (α = 0.84, agreement 97.8%).</p>
<p><italic>Societal racism, civil rights</italic>: The pro-Jena Six measure focused on broad societal racism and lack of civil rights toward African-Americans (α = 0.85, agreement 90.1%). The contrasting measure declares that whites are victims of societal racism or lack of civil rights (α = 0.70, agreement 92.3%).</p>
<p><italic>Mobilization, response to issues</italic>: The pro-Jena Six measure focused on statements that supporters of the Jena Six are fighting or need to fight back for the Jena Six or against their opponents (α = 0.85, agreement 93.4%). The contrasting measure is about those fighting back against the Jena Six or their supporters (α = 0.82, agreement 94.5%).</p>
<p><italic>Recoded variables</italic>: The anti-Jena Six opinion was subtracted from the pro-Jena Six opinion for each topic. Thus, a positive number on that topic opinion was pro-Jena Six and a negative number anti-Jena Six, each ranging from −2 to +2. The six topic opinions formed a reliable index (Cronbach’s α = 0.65) and were added together to create a variable assessing the overall opinion expression in each article, which could range from −12 (anti-Jena Six) to +12 (pro-Jena Six). Analysis was conducted using the single overall opinion assessment and the six topic opinions. To assess the balance of opinion expression, each case was recoded as pro-Jena Six, anti-Jena Six, neutral or no opinion.</p>

<title>Context, time periods, sampling</title>
<p>The content was divided into four time periods. The amount of content among newspapers across the United States, as discovered in a Lexis-Nexis search from 1 July 2007 through 31 January 2008 using the search term ‘Jena Six’, was somewhat similar to the distribution of articles in the sample of Jena-area newspapers.</p>
<p><italic>Prediscovery</italic> (before 1 July 2007): The controversy began when three white students hung nooses in a tree the day following a question in a school assembly from a black student asking if he could sit under a tree on the Jena High School campus. This tree was known as a gathering spot for white students. After this, racial tensions flared over several events, including a fight between white and black students at a party. The culminating event occurred on 4 December 2006 when six black students attacked a white student at school. Authorities charged the six black students with attempted murder, with the District Attorney arguing that the tennis shoes worn by the attackers were deadly weapons. Little news coverage (15 articles in the national sample) was found in this period and no content was collected for study.</p>
<p><italic>Discovery</italic> (1 July to 16 September 2007): The events received a modest escalation of coverage over the 62-day period, with 124 articles found in the national newspapers and 114 (combined news, letters and reader comments) in the local newspapers. Articles were spurred primarily by reactions to the perceived overly harsh charges against the Jena Six, which picked up when Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson visited Jena.</p>
<p><italic>Peak</italic> (17 September to 1 October 2007): Attention escalated before and after a rally, organized by Sharpton and Jackson, on 20 September that drew approximately 15,000 to free the Jena Six. The national sample during those 15 days reached 927 articles, while 244 were found in the local newspapers.</p>
<p><italic>Plateau</italic> (2 October to 15 December 2007): Coverage fell off, with content focused on events such as creation of a race relations panel in Jena, reaction to a song written by John Mellencamp, announcement by a pro-white group of a planned ‘Jena Justice Day’ rally, and societal reaction to the issues in Jena. In those 74 days, 818 articles were found in the national sample and 116 in the local sample.</p>
<p><italic>Resurgence</italic> (16 December 2007 to 31 January 2008): Stories were about the aftermath to the Jena Six, including whether a star athlete would be allowed to play football, but most of the content focused on a ‘Jena Justice Day’ rally on Martin Luther King Day sponsored by a pro-white organization. The national sample fell to 177 articles in the 48 days, while the local total was 148.</p>
<p><italic>Sampling</italic>: The sample included at least 30 articles from each content/time segment whenever possible and at least half of the content (randomly selected) in each content/time segment. For instance, the online reader comments content included 43 articles in discovery, 90 in peak, 78 in plateau and 66 in resurgence, while the sample totals were 31 (discovery), 56 (peak), 15 (plateau) and 37 (resurgence). The sample for this analysis consisted of 109 letters to editor and 139 reader comments. By time period, it included 60 in the discovery phase, 100 in the peak, 43 in the plateau and 45 in resurgence.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The analysis investigated the distribution and tone of opinion expression about the Jena Six among letters to the editor and online reader comments, and comparisons over time. Since opinion expression was the focus, those categorized as not expressing opinions on any of the six topic areas that formed the thrust of the study (22.0% of the letters and 23.7% of the online posts) were excluded from analysis.</p>
<p>In response to RQ1, concerning the distribution of opinion expression comparing letters to the editor and online reader comments, chi-square analysis showed significant differences between letters to the editor and online reader posts in frequency of pro- and anti-Jena Six opinions. Analysis excluding 3.7 percent of letters and 5.8 percent of posts that were neutral was significant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), as the 98 online reader posts showed an even split between pro- and anti-Jena Six opinions, while two-thirds of the letters to the editor (<italic>N</italic> = 72) were anti-Jena Six. The differences remained significant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .06) when neutral letters and posts were included in the analysis.</p>
<p>Among the six specific themes, chi-square analyses revealed significant differences on four themes and, on each, letters to the editor contained higher frequencies of anti-Jena Six opinions. On the Jena incident, central figures variable (χ<sup>2</sup> = 6.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), 76.9 percent of the letters (<italic>N</italic> = 39) were anti-Jena Six, compared with 52.3 percent of the online posts (<italic>N</italic> = 65). On the Jena community, South as a region variable (χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), 36 percent of the letters (<italic>N</italic> = 25) were anti-Jena Six, compared with 9.1 percent of the online posts (<italic>N</italic> = 22). On the rallies and events about Jena Six variable (χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), 88 percent of the letters were anti-Jena Six (<italic>N</italic> = 25), compared with 67.6 percent of the online posts (<italic>N</italic> = 34). On the societal racism variable (χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), 52.2 percent of the letters were anti-Jena Six (<italic>N</italic> = 23), compared with 31.3 percent of the online posts (<italic>N</italic> = 32).</p>
<p>Analysis of the tone of opinion expression (RQ2) revealed significant differences between letters and online posts. T-tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464884911421696">Table 1</xref>) showed letters to the editor were negative toward the Jena Six (M = −.53) and the online reader comments positive (M = +.17). The tone of letters to the editor and online reader posts were significantly different in t-tests on two of the six themes. The letters were more negative than the online reader posts on the Jena incident, central figure. Letters were less positive than online posts on Jena community, South as a region.</p>

<p>For example, letter writer Lynn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911421696">Allen (2007)</xref> questioned sympathy toward the Jena Six individuals: ‘How can you “Jena Six” come back and say that this was just a “school yard fight.” A boy was put in the hospital. How can you justify one person against six?’</p>
<p>A contrasting view was expressed by an online poster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911421696">abh, 2007</xref>):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE!!!!!!!!!!!!. This is wrong and some of you know its wrong. How in the hell is a tennis shoe gon be a weapon. He is a human being just like we are and he needs to be treated as one.</p>

<p>Differences were also apparent in comments about the Jena community or South as a region. An online poster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884911421696">Teach4Peace, 2007</xref>), saw clear evidence of racism:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>… we need to stop this foolishness and look at the bigger and most important picture, racial hatred and tension. From what I understand and from many reports on news articles I have read from various sources, Jena is a major step back in time, on BOTH sides of the coin.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Letter writer Richard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464884911421696">Rosa (2007)</xref> saw something else: ‘Relations between the races are fine in the South so long as people from other areas don’t come in and stir up things.’</p>
<p>Analysis within each time period (RQ3) revealed significant differences between letters and online posts just in the discovery period, in which 69.6 percent of the letters were anti-Jena Six compared to 44.4 percent of the online posts (χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .07). Although the differences were not significant, the letters were more negative than the posts in each of the three subsequent time periods.</p>
<p>As for the tone of overall opinions over time, no significant differences were found in ANOVA tests (<italic>F</italic> = 1.37, n.s.), although the overall tone changed over time on three of the themes. On Jena incident, central figures (<italic>F</italic> = 3.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), the decline period was the most anti-Jena Six (<italic>M</italic> = −.92) and significantly different in post-hoc tests from the peak period. Separate analyses over time for all letters and online posts showed no significant differences. However, online posts (<italic>F</italic> = 4.89, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) showed significant differences over time on the Jena incident, central figures variable, the most anti-Jena Six in the decline period and most pro-Jena Six/least anti-Jena Six in the peak period, while letters showed significant differences over time on the rallies and events variable (<italic>F</italic> = 2.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .06), most negative in the discovery period.</p>
<p>Comparing letters and online comments within theme, few significant differences were found: Jena incident, central figure in discovery, in which letters were more negative (t = −4.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); and Jena incident, South as a region, in which letters were more negative in the discovery (t = −1.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .08).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Both the range and tone of opinions varied between letters to the editor and online reader posts in public discourse about social conflict involving the African-American teenagers called the Jena Six. Opinions from the online posts provided an equal balance between pro- and anti-Jena Six comments, while the majority of opinions in letters to the editor were anti-Jena Six. The tone of opinions in online posts was pro-Jena Six and the letters anti-Jena Six. A similar pattern was found among the six specific themes analyzed.</p>
<p>The findings demonstrate the promise of online reader posts to bring additional views into public discourse on pressing social, cultural and political issues, as the posts clearly offered greater differences in opinion expression on the Jena Six events than did the letters to the editor. Pro-Jena Six opinions posed a challenge to the existing local power structure, being critical of the community and its institutions, while anti-Jena Six views tended to support community institutions. In essence, the anti-Jena Six comments from the audience operated much like the ‘guard dog’ press in smaller, less pluralistic communities – like the context analyzed here – acting to maintain the system, defer to economic and political powers in the community, and reinforce established authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911421696">Griffin and Dunwoody, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464884911421696">Tichenor et al., 1980</xref>). By contrast, pro-Jena Six views, perhaps due to different social and cultural factors in Jena as compared to the political and economic conflicts in previous analyses (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464884911421696">Tichenor et al., 1980</xref>), triggered a different emphasis in the public.</p>
<p>Various factors, separately or together, may help explain why online posts were more likely to challenge community institutions than letters.</p>
<p>First, the anonymity of the online posts might have freed the audience from public scrutiny and judgment that limits opinion expression, in comparison to letters to the editor, which contained the writer’s name. Requiring identification on letters has dampened participation from women and racial minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884911421696">Reader et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting a wider range of participation was likely among the online reader posts. This finding parallels the argument by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884911421696">Reader (2005)</xref> that anonymity would expand the range of views.</p>
<p>Second, no media gatekeepers decided which online reader posts to publish, in contrast to letters to the editor, in which just some of the letters are published. Although online posts may be removed for violating terms of participation (such as poor taste, inappropriate language or libelous comments), most are published unedited. By contrast, limited space means that not all letters to the editor are published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464884911421696">Wahl-Jorgensen, 2001</xref>), with factors such as length, quality of writing, topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884911421696">Kapoor, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884911421696">Reader, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884911421696">Renfro, 1979</xref>) and ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464884911421696">Wahl-Jorgensen, 2001</xref>) all determining what gets published. In addition, letters are commonly edited for language and/or length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464884911421696">Wahl-Jorgensen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, the nature of the technology matters, as posting makes it easier to participate in public discourse, but it may also represent a different audience than letter writers. Posting comments on a news site is simple for those with a basic level of technological expertise, allowing users to quickly access the electronic version of an article and post remarks. Readers can post numerous comments within a short period of time and sometimes engage in a virtual dialogue with others, both of which occurred in the material studied here. By contrast, submitting a letter to the editor typically requires time to write, edit, print, find the proper address and mail the letter. Those submitting letters perhaps had more available time and the extra effort to participate suggests they have been more passionate about the topic.</p>
<p>Fourth, although the demographics of the letter writers and online participants studied here are not available, overall trends suggest differences. Younger adults are more likely to be internet users than older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884911421696">Pew, 2010</xref>), while newspaper letter writers tend to be older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911421696">Buell, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911421696">Forsythe, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911421696">Grey and Brown, 1970</xref>). Both internet users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884911421696">Pew, 2010</xref>) and newspaper letter writers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911421696">Buell, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911421696">Forsythe, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911421696">Grey and Brown, 1970</xref>) are better educated than the general population. Letter writers are also more conservative than the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911421696">Buell, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911421696">Forsythe, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911421696">Grey and Brown, 1970</xref>). Letter writers may have been more establishment and less oppositional than online posters.</p>
<sec id="section12-1464884911421696">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One limitation includes an inability to analyze reader comments from all newspapers in the region. The sample included all news organizations in the region that put online reader comments into an archive, but most newspapers did not archive that material. Perhaps reader comments from papers without an archive would be different from those analyzed. However, when analysis was limited to newspapers that archived both online reader comments and letters to the editor, the pattern of findings was similar to those in the larger sample. Overall, online posts and letters (<italic>M</italic> = −.66, <italic>N</italic> = 64) were significantly different (t = −2.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), as were the themes of Jena incident, central figure (t = −2.54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .02, letters <italic>M</italic> = −.75, <italic>N</italic> = 36), societal racism, civil rights (t = −2.01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, letters <italic>M</italic> = −.30, <italic>N</italic> = 20) and Jena community, South as a region (t = −1.95, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.06, letters <italic>M</italic> = +.36, <italic>N</italic> = 22).</p>
<p>Online reader comments and letters to the editor showed similar patterns in length and focus. A random sample of the coded content showed a similar number of words (t = 0.06, n.s.) comparing online reader comments (<italic>M</italic> = 249.4) and letters (<italic>M</italic> = 251.5). The same subsample showed that more of the online reader comments (38.5%), as compared to letter writers (23.8%) specifically referred to other posters, letters or stories. Although the online comments were posted in response to specific stories, nearly 70 percent wrote general comments, most on racial relations or justice, rather than directly on the story theme. While one purpose of online posts may be to comment on specific stories, the evidence suggests that participants instead used the space as an open forum on that topic. Not surprisingly, many of the online posts contained poor grammar, including misspelled words and incomplete sentences, while the letters were mostly error-free. Some of the online posts used ALL CAPS in places (an online version of shouting), while few letters had similar usage.</p>
<p>Excluding anonymous letters from the analysis had little influence on the findings, as analyses including the anonymous letters revealed a substantially similar pattern of differences. The anonymous and signed letters were not statistically different in frequency or tone, although the tone of the 10 anonymous letters was pro-Jena Six. Perhaps the option to submit unsigned letters freed those writers from community pressure in a similar manner as for the online posters.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The lack of barriers to participation suggests the potential of online reader posts to approach ideals of the public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884911421696">Habermas, 1999[1962]</xref>) of discussion and debate. The nature of the technology allows for nearly instantaneous opinion expression and response, allowing for something resembling a debate. It also fits expectations of a deliberative democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884911421696">Charney, 1998</xref>) focused on space for citizens to freely debate and deliberate. The news organizations, through web and print editions, offer a rare venue for broad public discourse that is inclusive and egalitarian. One-fourth of internet users say they have commented on a news story or blog post (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884911421696">Pew, 2010</xref>). But rather than think of letters to the editor and online reader posts as an either-or scenario, perhaps it makes more sense to consider the two modes of opinion expression together as approaching the democratic norms of the public sphere. Combined, the two modes of expression added breadth to the range and tone of opinions during social conflict. News organizations are increasingly providing opportunities for the public to post comments online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884911421696">Johnson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884911421696">Santana, 2010</xref>) while retaining traditional letters to the editor, expanding opportunities for public engagement.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is the potential effect of the public discourse on news content and public policy, as those expressions could be used by journalists to gauge public opinion and make editorial decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884911421696">Reader, 2005</xref>) and determine story focus or content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911421696">Domingo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911421696">Farrell and Drezner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464884911421696">Robinson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884911421696">Santana, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464884911421696">Wardle et al., 2009</xref>). Reader comments included details about one of the Jena Six’s past criminal history and witness accounts of the beating that led to the criminal charges, the types of competing or complementary information (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911421696">Domingo and Heinonen, 2008</xref>) that journalists may have considered in crafting their stories. Further, expressions of public opinion informed journalists about the general tone of public opinion in the area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464884911421696">Pritchard and Berkowitz, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The presumed influences of reader expression on news content could be explored by a closer examination of the content or through interviews with journalists. The content could be examined for the timing of specific details to see if the public expressions preceded the news content. Interviews with journalists could clarify whether and how they monitored public opinion, and how that may have changed the thrust of their stories. This could help untangle the complex interactions between public opinion expression and news content.</p>
