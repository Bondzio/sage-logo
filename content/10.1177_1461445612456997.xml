<p>Different areas of child welfare work call for psychometric measurement to replace professionals’ judgements with objective numbers. Using data from a national Swedish evaluation of interventions for abused children, the present article investigates child interviewees’ resistance to constraints in psychometric questions. The article contributes to studies of how psychology operates in institutional settings; it looks into the discursive production of the interviewee’s position in the struggle between the principle of recordability and ‘sensitive’ interviewing. The findings suggest that interviewees resist questions’ structural restrictions in the service of telling the interviewer about their lives. Thus, the function of their misalignment is affiliative; it cooperates both with the institutional goal of eliciting information and with the interviewer’s interest in them. However, the interviewer’s solutions to children’s problem presentations remain focused on generating recordable answers. The article concludes that the narrow focus on recordability neglects important opportunities to talk about children’s experiences.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Different areas of child welfare work increasingly call for psychometric measurement. By making a record of people’s psychological state, psychometrics is meant to relieve social work from subjective judgements. Research on interaction in standardized settings has repeatedly shown that these claims of objectivity neglect the co-construction of answers between interviewee, questionnaire and interviewer (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445612456997">Antaki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461445612456997">Krosnick and Alwin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461445612456997">Schegloff, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461445612456997">Suchman and Jordan, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1461445612456997">Wilkinson, 2011</xref>). However, less attention has been given to how interviews supply participants with resources and restrictions for talking interpersonal encounters into being (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612456997">Houtkoop-Steenstra, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461445612456997">Maynard and Schaeffer, 2002</xref>). By investigating in detail child interviewees’ resistance to constraints in psychometric questions, the present article aims to contribute to studies examining the way in which psychology and psychological methods operate in institutional settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461445612456997">Hepburn and Wiggins, 2007</xref>). The findings expand our understanding of the interviewee’s position in the struggle between the principle of <italic>recordability</italic> and sensitive interviewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445612456997">Antaki, 2002</xref>). While the interviewees are misaligning with the questions’ structural restrictions, they affiliate with the activity of informing the interviewer about their lives. Therefore, the article argues that their resistance cooperates with the institutional goal of eliciting information and with the interviewer’s interest in them as persons.</p>
<p>The article starts out with three consecutive sections describing the data and outlining the analytical interest in questions and children’s participation in institutional settings. The analysis is then presented in two sections with a detailed account of the interplay between recordability and interpersonal orientation. The article concludes that child interviewees’ resistance to constraints in psychometric questions carries a potential for making sense of difficult experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1461445612456997">
<title>Data and analysis</title>
<p>The broader context for the psychometric interviews analysed below is a national Swedish evaluation study of support interventions for children exposed to violence against their mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461445612456997">Broberg et al., 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1461445612456997">1</xref></sup> With the purpose of evaluating whether interventions within child psychiatry and social services affected their well-being, children were asked to fill out questionnaires before and after the interventions. Seven interviewers interviewed 70 children one to three times, either on the premises of the evaluated agencies or at the children’s homes. The author was one of the interviewers, and the only one who audio-recorded the interviews. The present article is based on these recordings of 31 interviews from the first, second and third interviews with 21 different children. Whereas the entire interview, including both questionnaires and open-ended questions, lasted 30 minutes to two hours, the psychometric interview took 20 minutes to one hour. Some children completed one questionnaire (30 questions), while others completed all (150 questions).</p>
<p>The interviews resemble standardized interviews because the questionnaires have response options. However, the interviewers were not trained to remain neutral and were, furthermore, instructed to explain questions if requested. The children chose between reading questionnaires and having them read by the interviewer. This procedure could be targeted in a critique on validity and reliability, but the concern of this article is the interviews as social encounters. Accordingly, the combination of mundane interaction and the formalized activity of filling out questionnaires opens up for an analysis of the interplay between the ideal of effectiveness and neutrality and the ideal of sensitivity to the particular other.</p>
<p>The theoretical framework for the study is discursive psychology and the notion that talk delivers action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445612456997">Edwards and Potter, 1992</xref>). Within studies of talk-in-interaction, questions are recognized as obligating actions because they place restrictions on the recipient. The psychometric question below is an example of this.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>4. If I’m angry and my teacher tells me to Fits Fits Doesn’t fit   Doesn’t</p>
<p>calm down, then I can do that   very well quite well so well fit at all</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The question sets the agenda of action and topic, eliciting information about emotional regulation. It invites the recipient to choose one of the four response options. Moreover, the item includes presuppositions, for example that the recipient has experienced a teacher telling him or her to calm down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445612456997">Boyd and Heritage, 2006</xref>). However, as can be seen in the extract below, recipients can resist these constraints. The extract is transcribed in the conventions developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461445612456997">Jefferson (2004)</xref> and, for illustrative purposes, only includes the English translation. In the analysis, I provide both original wording and translation. In the first lines Clara, the interviewer, reads the item aloud to Martin, the nine-year-old interviewee.</p>
<graphic id="img1-1461445612456997" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612456997-img1.tif"/>
<p>We can see right away that Martin is not going to give an answer that aligns with the constraints of the question read by Clara (ll. 1–2). He delays his answer with silence and by saying ‘hm’ (ll. 3–5), none of which progresses the prior activity. Clara’s turns on lines 6–7 and 10 can be understood as pursuing an answer. In lines 12–14, Martin gives an account for his misaligning response by placing the reason for the anger in the teacher’s behavior rather than in his own. My focus is on responses like Martin’s, which treat the presuppositions in questions (in this case that teachers are fair) as problematic by providing an account that includes contradictory information. Detailed analysis of these kinds of accounts relates to the fundamental sociological task of studying the production of order in institutional settings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1461445612456997">
<title>Questions in institutional talk</title>
<p>Questions can be defined as ‘utterances that solicit (and/or are treated by the recipient as soliciting) information, confirmation, or action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461445612456997">Hultgren and Cameron, 2010</xref>: 328). In orienting talk-in-interaction to institutions’ topical and technical specificities, questions play an important part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461445612456997">Drew and Heritage, 1992</xref>). For example, questions in medical settings orient to the doctorable aspects of patients’ problems; that is, problems that medical competencies can solve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461445612456997">Heritage and Robinson, 2006</xref>). A particular constraining question form, common in institutional talk, is the yes/no interrogative, which limits the contribution to a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ and often prefers one to the other through grammar or projected action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461445612456997">Raymond, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to the principle of doctorability in medical interaction, questions and answers in psychometric interaction can be said to be governed by a principle of <italic>recordability</italic>. Psychometric testing restricts the recipient’s participation by providing different candidates for answering, which promotes efficiency in getting particular information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612456997">Houtkoop-Steenstra, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1461445612456997">Pomerantz, 1988</xref>). These response options circumvent the sensitivity to the particular other that we normally display in conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1461445612456997">Sacks et al., 1974</xref>), as well as omit guidance to choose one candidate over the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461445612456997">Maynard and Schaeffer, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>However, studies of test situations similar to psychometric interviews have shown how interviewers frequently guide recipients to the desirable answer. Although standardized questions should ideally lack responses other than minimal acknowledgement tokens, interviewers have been shown to check, clarify and provide alternative candidate responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612456997">Houtkoop-Steenstra, 2000</xref>) as well as revise questions in personalized terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445612456997">Antaki, 2002</xref>), to arrive at recordable answers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612456997">Houtkoop-Steenstra (2000)</xref> demonstrates how interviewers do ‘being friendly’ by reacting to interviewees’ assessable answers and by reformulating neutrally scripted questions into inviting ‘no problem’ answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445612456997">Heritage and Sorjonen, 1994</xref>). Practices like these illustrate a dilemma in the institutional agent’s task of delivering answers for an audience other than themselves, while they are also expected to establish a comfortable relationship with the client.</p>
<p>In most cases, interviewees conform to the standardized questions’ design. However, it is widely recognized that interviewees sometimes produce nonconforming responses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461445612456997">Suchman and Jordan, 1990</xref>). Answers to questions provide recipients with an opportunity to resist the rights and obligations projected by question design; they allow negotiation of the amount of agency the question provides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461445612456997">Heritage and Raymond, 2012</xref>). Resources for resisting questions’ constraints can be more or less cooperative. For instance, resetting the terms of a question can facilitate understanding and agreement, and is thus a mild form of resistance. To resist assumptions that must be true for the question to be valid is a far stronger form of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1461445612456997">Stivers and Hayashi, 2010</xref>). In the present study, resistance is understood as interviewees’ claims to more agency in defining their experiences than what is provided by the question. The next section elaborates this notion of resistance by drawing on the growing field of research concerned with children’s participation in institutional settings.</p>

<title>Children’s participation in institutional settings</title>
<p>Many institutions working with children have strategies for circumventing the tension between the ideal of participation and the common institutional agenda of changing children’s behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445612456997">Hutchby, 2005a</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461445612456997">Butler et al. (2010)</xref> demonstrate how helpline counsellors soften the epistemic asymmetry in advice giving by delivering the advice in interrogative form, thereby relaying epistemic authority to child callers. However, other studies show that institutional agents working with models for enhancing participation, such as ‘active listening’ in counselling or interviews about children’s views, also construct and direct answers by formulating what is said in institutionally relevant ways and taking for granted common understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445612456997">Danby et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461445612456997">Hutchby, 2005b</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461445612456997">Persson-Thunqvist et al. (2012)</xref> argue that research concerning children in institutional settings commonly targets interactional problems in terms of children’s cognitive inability. In contrast, studies in discursive psychology have demonstrated how children competently use similar conversational strategies as institutional agents to pre-empt and solve interactional problems and provide relevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445612456997">Cromdal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445612456997">Danby et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1461445612456997">Osvaldsson et al., in press</xref>). In emergency calls, children can manage the complex task of calling on behalf of a parent, although the institutional setting is adjusted neither to children nor to persons calling as representatives of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461445612456997">Persson-Thunqvist et al., 2012</xref>). Children have also been shown to use their knowledge of institutional practices and their own lives in resisting particular proposals from institutional agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445612456997">Danby et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461445612456997">Hutchby, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461445612456997">Lloyd, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461445612456997">Marlaire and Maynard, 1990</xref>) as well as general institutional agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445612456997">Hutchby, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461445612456997">2005b</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study contributes to these studies by showing how children resist presuppositions in psychometric questions with accounts about their lives. However, although challenging a question’s presuppositions has been described as a particular strong form of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1461445612456997">Stivers and Hayashi, 2010</xref>), the findings suggest that misaligning responses can affiliate with the broader institutional agenda of eliciting information. Rather than rejecting the questions, the children claim primary rights to knowing their own lives, and their resistance is thus concerned with negotiating their epistemic status in relation to the questionnaire. However, the findings also show how the interviewer’s narrow focus on recordability prioritizes the questionnaire’s definitions over opportunities to talk about children’s experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1461445612456997">
<title>Recordability and interpersonal sensitivity</title>
<p>For presentation purposes, the analysis will only account for a few examples of a practice that is recurrent in the whole data set: children resisting questions’ presuppositions by providing accounts about their lives. First, I use three extracts from the same interview to demonstrate how recordability and interpersonal orientation are negotiated. The second section in the analysis describes this practice in a different context and accounts for a deviant case.</p>
<sec id="section6-1461445612456997">
<title>Trust versus practicality</title>
<p>In the following three extracts, the interviewee and interviewer are engaging with a problem in several questions in the same questionnaire, a Swedish version<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1461445612456997">2</xref></sup> of the Attachment Security Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461445612456997">Kerns et al., 1996</xref>). This is the first of three interviews for 12-year-old Nathalie, and takes place at her home. With the interviewer sitting at the same table, looking in a book, Nathalie has quietly answered the first two questions in the questionnaire. These are formulated as examples of how children relate to their ‘dads’. The instructions tell the interviewee to pick one of the alternatives and then choose whether it ‘fits precisely’ or ‘fits approximately’. At the third question, Nathalie turns to the interviewer:
<disp-quote>
<p>3. Some kids can count on their dad helping  Other kids can’t trust that they will get help</p>
<p>out if they need help   <bold>BUT</bold> if they need it</p>
<p>Fits precisely  Fits approximately  Fits approximately  Fits precisely</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<graphic id="img2-1461445612456997" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612456997-img2.tif"/>
<p>In the first 10 lines Nathalie raises a problem with the question by reading it, contrasting it to her own situation and asking the interviewer what to do about it. She hereby orients to being entitled to knowing her situation but directs knowledge of the questionnaire procedure to the interviewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461445612456997">Potter and Hepburn, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Several cues suggest that this problem presentation is inviting collaboration from the interviewer. Both by using the attention marker ‘now look/<italic>alltså</italic>’ turn-initially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445612456997">Aijmer, 2007</xref>), and given that she does not have to read the question out, Nathalie is alerting the interviewer to a problem. Moreover, Nathalie’s problem presentation, ‘my dad isn’t y’know here so what should I tick’, includes a <italic>ju</italic>-account; an account with the adverb ‘ju’ (translated to ‘y’know’). In Swedish, ju-accounts index shared and self-evident knowledge. Thus, Nathalie’s turn can be heard as treating the information that her dad is not around as recognizable to the interviewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461445612456997">Heinemann et al., 2011</xref>). The interviewer’s continuers (ll. 2, 4, 7) and overlapping ‘no’ (l. 9), cooperate with this presentation and agree that Nathalie’s dad is not around.</p>
<p>Whereas in theory the answer to Nathalie’s question should be a version of ‘tick the box closest to what you think’, this interviewer delays her answer by asking another question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445612456997">Antaki, 2002</xref>). In what follows, she further departs from the standardized ideal. Importantly, the interviewer starts with the right-hand alternative’s wording ‘trust’, which is repaired into ‘would he come’ (ll. 11–12). The repaired version avoids the emotional baggage of both ‘trust’ and ‘count on’, and affiliates with the interviewee’s presented problem, ‘my dad isn’t y’know here’. The question invites a ‘yes’ and thus projects a ‘no problem’ response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445612456997">Boyd and Heritage, 2006</xref>), attending to interpersonal aspects rather than neutrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612456997">Houtkoop-Steenstra, 2000</xref>). After Nathalie’s early and brief ‘yes’ (l. 13), the interviewer orients to her failure in neutrality by providing an ‘or’. This ‘or’ (l. 14) is palpably delivered after Nathalie’s ‘yes’, and can be seen as an attempt at post-hoc objectivity, suggesting that the ‘no problem’ response is just one of several relevant answers.</p>
<p>After Nathalie’s confirmation, her initial question, ‘what should I tick’, gets the answer ‘then you can pick that’ (l. 16). However, Nathalie initiates a post-expansion sequence, treating this answer as inadequate (l. 18). She picks up on the practical issue the question ‘would he come’ raises by rephrasing the problem: the psychometric question presupposes that emotional security and physical proximity go together, but Nathalie’s experience is about practicality – not about trust. However, rather than going along with Nathalie’s report suggesting that the problem is not solved, the interviewer advises Nathalie to pick ‘fits approximately’ (l. 20). The interviewer’s latched positive evaluation ‘really good questions’ (l. 21), as well as the following assessment ‘it is really a bit unclear sometimes’ (l. 24), attends to this dismissal of Nathalie’s problem presentation. Still, these assessments minimize and ignore the problem raised by Nathalie – that the psychometric question does not fit.</p>
<p>Nathalie’s response is a minimal acknowledgement token (l. 25), after which she resumes filling out the questionnaire quietly for 36 seconds. During this time she answers three questions. At question 7, Nathalie says ‘hm’, is silent for four seconds, then sighs and laughs quietly:
<disp-quote>
<p>7. Some kids wish they had better contact  Other kids think they have sufficiently good</p>
<p>with their dad   <bold>BUT</bold>  contact with their dad</p>
<p>Fits precisely  Fits approximately  Fits approximately  Fits precisely</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<graphic id="img3-1461445612456997" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612456997-img3.tif"/>
<p>In this extract, it becomes clear that Nathalie is not only doing ‘recordability’ and ‘being a good interviewee’, but is also telling the interviewer about a problem in her life. Although the interviewer’s question on line 30 is the first pair part in the sequence, it is prompted by Nathalie’s sigh and quiet laughter. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461445612456997">Goffman (1978)</xref> has suggested that reaction tokens are interactional achievements, designed for a particular audience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1461445612456997">Wilkinson and Kitzinger (2006)</xref> provide empirical support for this suggestion in relation to surprise tokens. Reaction tokens alert participants to some reactable feature of the world, and when there is no apparent source of surprise, speakers need to explain their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1461445612456997">Wilkinson and Kitzinger, 2006</xref>). My transcription cannot adequately represent the voice quality of Nathalie’s inhale and deep exhale or of the quick and quiet laughter, through which both trouble and trouble resistance are displayed (l. 28). Still, this can be seen as a case of ambiguous emotion being performed in the highly task-focused interaction: while a sigh displays trouble, laughter is often connected to mitigating trouble or acknowledging something positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461445612456997">Jefferson, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>The interviewer’s yes/no interrogative ‘d’you see funny questions’ (l. 30) points to both the prior talk and the institutional activity. The interviewer re-orients to the fact that questions can be problematic – now by describing them as ‘funny’, whereas before she depicted them as ‘unclear’. By treating ‘questions’ as the reaction source, the interviewer restricts the response to the institutional task. Further, she only picks up on the laughter in Nathalie’s turn by using a smiley voice and choosing the word ‘funny/<italic>knasiga</italic>’ (l. 30). Thus, although the interviewer orients to a problem, she only makes relevant the institutional activity and ignores the potential sadness in the sigh.</p>
<p>In her answer, Nathalie adheres to these restrictions. In line 32 she offers a ‘no’, which aligns with the action preferences of the question, because a ‘yes’ would imply a negative assessment of the question. What follows is a contrast marker ‘but’ and a mitigated account for the laughter, going along with the exclusion of the sigh by describing the situation as ‘I think it’s kinda funny’. The way Nathalie delivers this information marks that what is ‘funny’ is that this question, in contrast to the other one she commented on, is easy to respond to because of the same thing that caused the problems before – her dad not being around. Although there are three questions between this and question 3, her word order marks ‘this one’ in relation to ‘that one’. In both Swedish and English, the routine word order is ‘I could answer this one right away’. The design ‘this one I could answer right away’ (1. 33) marks ‘this one’ as contrastive to the other questions. Moreover, ‘right’ in ‘right away’ is stressed, which relates to the problem of not being able to answer the questions ‘right away’ before.</p>
<p>This is receipted with ‘right/<italic>jaja</italic>’, a conventionalized token of understanding in Swedish (l. 34). Because Nathalie has produced a second pair part to the interviewer’s question, they could be done talking. However, Nathalie initiates a post-expansion sequence in which she accounts for both what ‘this one’ is and why she could answer it right away (ll. 35–36, 38). Here, Nathalie goes beyond the institutional task and tells the interviewer something about herself, which is that she wishes she had better contact with her dad. Although there are gaps (ll. 40, 43) where the interviewer could have addressed this information interpersonally, she only contributes with minimal acknowledgement (ll. 39, 42). In line 44, Nathalie offers a post-completion stance marker, an outstretched ‘m’ with downward intonation, which can be heard as wrapping up the piece of interaction on a sad note contrastive to the account of her initial reaction token as ‘I think it’s kind of funny’. Accordingly, this extract shows that Nathalie, besides doing ‘being a good interviewee’, is also telling the interviewer about difficult things in her life. The interviewer, however, does not treat this as interpersonally relevant, but only orients to the principle of recordability.</p>
<p>Nathalie goes back to answering questions 8 to 12. During these 30.5 seconds she also reports a missing letter in a word, which is positively evaluated by the interviewer as ‘very observant’. At question 13, she stops again and comments to the interviewer:
<disp-quote>
<p>13. Some kids go to their dad when they are  Other kids don’t go to their dad when</p>
<p>sad or angry   <bold>BUT</bold>  something has happened</p>
<p>Fits precisely  Fits approximately  Fits approximately  Fits precisely</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<graphic id="img4-1461445612456997" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612456997-img4.tif"/>
<p>In this final example from the interview with Nathalie, we can see how the interviewer makes an effort to deal with the problem Nathalie has raised. However, the interviewer’s attempted solution prioritizes the questions’ presuppositions over Nathalie’s description of the questions as not representing her situation adequately.</p>
<p>Nathalie’s report on lines 54 and 55 refers back to the problem with the prior questions by stressing the word ‘another’. Nathalie disregards the interviewer’s description of the questions as ‘unclear’ and ‘funny’, and sticks with the problem presentation of them as ‘difficult to answer’ because they presuppose a physically present dad. By asking ‘which is that then’, the interviewer treats this as another request for instruction on what to tick (l. 58). As Nathalie reads the question, the interviewer comes in early with a contrastive ‘but’, rebutting Nathalie’s description of the questions as problematic (l. 63).</p>
<p>The interviewer then uses an if/then construction in a yes/no declarative (ll. 63–64), stating that if Nathalie’s dad is not around, she cannot go to him. Although yes/no declaratives are regularly heard as questions when they concern the epistemic territory of the recipient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461445612456997">Heritage, 2012</xref>), they claim that the speaker has the requested information, and just need confirmation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612456997">Houtkoop-Steenstra, 2000</xref>). The persuading quality of this question is mitigated by the latched ‘or’, repaired to the yes/no interrogative ‘do you feel that you like call him or something when you’re sad or’ (ll. 65–66), which positions Nathalie as the epistemic authority. Still, the question presupposes that calling dad is similar to going to dad. In terms of grammar, the question invites a ‘yes’. However, taken together with the repaired yes/no declarative, a ‘yes’ would disagree with the interviewer’s proposed action, picking the answer that she does not go to her dad when something has happened. Nathalie comes in early with a ‘no’ (l. 67), which gets repeated by the interviewer (l. 68). The interviewer then produces the second pair part to what she initially treated as a request for help, instructing Nathalie to ‘tick’ the right-hand alternative. On line 69, Nathalie provides an acknowledgement token and goes back to quietly answering the psychometric questions.</p>
<p>Nathalie ends up picking ‘fits precisely’ for the right-hand alternative, ‘Other kids don’t go to their dad when something has happened’. From the perspective of the questionnaire constructors, this psychometric question may or may not have been answered correctly. However, as a social encounter between someone asking another person to tell them what they are experiencing in their life, the answer is inadequate and would not have been chosen by Nathalie if the questionnaire had not provided it (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1461445612456997">Wilkinson, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The three extracts point out the difficult practice of producing recordable answers while attending to the interpersonal aspects of the interaction. From a discursive psychological perspective, it is noteworthy that Nathalie is resisting that what she describes as circumstances in her life, her dad’s physical absence, is only made recordable as lack of security in relation to him – a psychological phenomenon. However, Nathalie’s misalignment with the presuppositions of the psychometric questions is doing ‘being a good interviewee’, and thus orients to the principle of recordability. Nathalie’s comments on the questions extend this focus by also reporting difficult things in her life, doing ‘telling you about me’, while the interviewer mainly orients to the recordable aspects of this interaction. In the next section, I will further address how the principle of recordability competes and colludes with the practice of ‘telling you about me’.</p>

<title>Doing ‘telling you about me’</title>
<p>The following extracts show other interviewees dealing with the same problem as Nathalie: while some aspects of the questions are produced as correct, the interviewees resist the conclusions a recipient would draw. In these cases, the setting is different. The interviewer participates more actively by holding the questionnaire and reading the questions while the interviewees tell her what to tick. The next extract is from the third interview with nine-year-old Martin on the premises of the evaluated agency, with a Swedish questionnaire on emotional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1461445612456997">Rydell et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<graphic id="img5-1461445612456997" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612456997-img5.tif"/>
<p>By quoting a hypothetical teacher (ll. 6–7), the interviewer makes an effort to personalize the question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445612456997">Antaki, 2002</xref>), thus responding to the silence and ‘hm’ as a case of not understanding the question. This is a sequentially quick and interactionally uncomplicated solution to lack of response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461445612456997">Pomerantz, 1984</xref>). It prevents interviewees from having to admit that they do not understand, and orients in this way to the interpersonal aspects of interviewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612456997">Houtkoop-Steenstra, 2000</xref>). However, it stays within the institutional activity and presupposes that the problem concerns knowledge rather than disagreement. When Martin still withholds an answer in the formatted design, the interviewer backs down from this claim to epistemic access to his life-world by offering a yes/no declarative: ‘but maybe that doesn’t happen so often’, with preference for ‘no’. This is delivered with a smiley voice, which affiliates with Martin’s laughter particle (l. 9). However, after providing the preferred answer, ‘no’ (l. 12), Martin repairs this line of talk:</p>
<graphic id="img6-1461445612456997" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612456997-img6.tif"/>
<p>Martin’s account (ll. 12–14) does the job of both questioning the presupposition of the category of ‘fair teacher’ and disagreeing with the interviewer’s suggestion. After the interviewer comes in early with a receipt of this as recognizable information, Martin expands his account and refers back to line 12 – he gets ‘cross’ because of the teacher’s reprimand. This further challenges the presupposition in the question: the course is not being angry and <italic>then</italic> being told off by the teacher; rather, the teacher’s unfair reprimand becomes <italic>the reason</italic> for him becoming ‘cross’.</p>
<p>The interviewer pursues the task of producing recordable answers by offering a formulation of how Martin feels, with a hypothetical declarative (ll. 17, 19). Although this construction involves the teacher as a problem, it carries the same presupposition as the psychometric question – that the interviewee is angry from the start – and Martin’s answer ‘n- yes o-’, can be heard as oriented to this problem. On line 23, Martin instructs the interviewer to ‘pick that’, which is ‘doesn’t fit so well’. He thereby affiliates with the interviewer’s agenda of producing a recordable answer. This recorded response, however, is very different from his account. So even though the interviewer seemingly orients to Martin’s rights to define his experience, and though she seems to support the authority of his decisions, her reformulation treats the question as the epistemic authority.</p>
<p>Like Nathalie, Martin seems to be resisting presuppositions – that occurrences in his life are a sign of his psychological state – in an effort to tell the interviewer about himself. The interviewer treats his descriptions as recognizable, but her interpersonal contribution is limited to recognition tokens. The last extract deviates from this practice because the interviewer orients to what the interviewee says on an interpersonal level. The interviewer reads questions from a Swedish version of the Kidscreen questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461445612456997">Herdman et al., 2002</xref>) to nine-year-old William. They are in his kitchen, with his mother present during the interview, which is the first of three. The extract is shortened for presentation purposes. We join the participants when the interviewer has already asked and clarified the question. Now she asks again:
<disp-quote>
<p>If you think about this last month, how often …</p>
<p>22. were you scared of other pupils? Never Seldom Sometimes Often Always</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<graphic id="img7-1461445612456997" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612456997-img7.tif"/>
<p>William cuts in before the interviewer provides the response options (l. 2). To save space, I have cut out 13 lines where the answer is negotiated from ‘not so much’ to ‘seldom’. It is worth noting, however, that ‘seldom’ is different from ‘not so much’ in terms of estimation. One can be ‘not so much’ scared all the time, and very scared ‘seldom’, and as can be seen on line 16 William sticks with his scale by reporting that he was ‘still a bit scared’.</p>
<p>Regardless of this discussion, it is also clear on line 16 that William resists the presupposition in the psychometric question that school is the relevant place for being scared of other kids. Because the recordable answer is already in place, his account can be heard as an attempt to tell the interviewer about his difficult experiences this last month. The interviewer treats being afraid on the street as an understandable experience (l. 18). Unlike her treatment of Nathalie and Martin’s reports, she does not mainly orient to the task at hand but rather asks William an ancillary question about his experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461445612456997">Heritage, 2011</xref>). The pause in her question can be heard as sensitive to her presupposition that he is afraid of ‘bigger’ kids (l. 18). William’s answer misaligns and repairs ‘small’ to ‘younger’ and accounts for this nonconforming answer by listing the scary characteristics of the boy as ‘bigger’, ‘cheeky’, and ‘nasty’ (ll. 20, 22, 25). This list is initially overlapped by the interviewer’s reaction token ‘whew’. When William is done, the interviewer displays empathy by providing a parallel assessment of the situation that he has to experience as ‘no fun’ (l. 28) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461445612456997">Heritage, 2011</xref>). However, the interviewer only does this after a recordable answer is already in place, and the interpersonal orientation can therefore be seen as secondary to the principle of recordability.</p>
<p>In sum, Nathalie’s account ‘my dad isn’t y’know here’, Martin’s account ‘it’s really her fault’ and William’s account ‘not at school but on our street’ are all examples of children resisting presuppositions in psychometric questions by referring to information in their epistemic domain. The interviewees accept some presuppositions in the questions (not seeing dad, being angry, and being scared of other kids), but resist the implications that their simply answering would have. However, this resistance seems to be done in the service of telling the interviewer about experiences in their lives. The interviewees do not take provided chances to say ‘the question does not fit’, and they explain their answers although the recorded response is already in place. The different responses the interviewer offers can be understood in the light of the sequential position of the resistance regarding the recordable answer. Only when the response is already recorded does the interviewer attend to the interpersonal aspects of what the interviewee says.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The limitations of a study only analysing interviews with one interviewer are many and the findings should be regarded as tentative. Still, each answer that includes resistance to questions’ constraints is important because it shows that a question can be problematic in its presuppositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612456997">Houtkoop-Steenstra, 2000</xref>). This article contributes to previous research on the interactional workings of psychology in institutional settings with three points.</p>
<p>First, the findings stress how central the principle of recordability is to the progress of the interview interaction, comparable to how doctorability structures doctor–patient interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461445612456997">Heritage and Robinson, 2006</xref>). Even when the interviewer is doing ‘being friendly’ by displaying understanding of the children’s problem presentations, the problems are negotiated into recordable answers. Regardless of this being a problem in relation to validity, the findings of this study point to a dilemma regarding standardization and child interviewees’ participation. On the one hand, because interviewees contribute their time and energy to the study, researchers are responsible for producing accountable research. On the other hand, the findings demonstrate that standardized answers risk being recorded at the expense of opportunities for interviewees to contribute with knowledge about their particular experiences.</p>
<p>The psychometric questions present topics, such as ‘my relationship with my dad’, which are relevant to the interviewees. However, the questions presuppose a reason for this relevance, a reason that the children resist either by presenting a problem for the interviewer to solve before they can deliver an answer, or by providing a disclaimer after the answer. Thus, the second point is that even when given a questionnaire with pre-printed response options, the child interviewees treat it with regard to what conclusions the people hearing the answers will draw. This is the present article’s main contribution to our understanding of interaction with children in institutional settings, in particular concerning their position in the struggle between literal and sensitive interviewing (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445612456997">Antaki, 2002</xref>). The article supports prior findings of children using knowledge of their lives and of institutional practices to cooperate with, as well as to resist, institutional restrictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445612456997">Cromdal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445612456997">Danby et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461445612456997">Lloyd, 1992</xref>). Previous studies have shown children resisting both institutional agents’ turns in interaction and the broader institutional agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461445612456997">Hutchby, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461445612456997">2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461445612456997">Marlaire and Maynard, 1990</xref>). This article contributes by demonstrating how child interviewees resist psychometric questions’ epistemic authority in a way that both cooperates with the institutional agenda of eliciting information about them and orients to the interviewer as an interested recipient who can recognize their descriptions. For the children, the interview situation is more than just ticking answers; they are managing both accurate answering and the interpersonal relationship with the interviewer. Thus, the study shows that not contributing to the sequential development of the interaction can be in the service of pushing the interpersonal relation forward (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461445612456997">Stivers et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, for using psychometrics in practice, the findings of how child interviewees can resist the questions’ constraints suggest that psychometrics can be a resource for talking about different versions of difficult events. Although not a solution to the problem of research validity, encouraging resistance to questions instead of treating it as residual may be a most valuable resource for making sense of the children’s experiences.</p>

<p>The original version of question 3, ‘Some kids find it easy to count on their dad for help BUT other kids think it’s hard to count on their dad’, differs from the Swedish translation in two important respects. First, the polar quality of the original disappears in the Swedish translation, in which ‘count on’ is translated to the more morally implicative ‘trust’ in the right-hand alternative. Second, the response options ‘Really true for me’ and ‘Sort of true for me’ are translated into the less subjectively oriented ‘Fits precisely’ and ‘Fits approximately’. I have tried to preserve the Swedish translations in my back-translation to English, since these are the words the interviewees and the interviewer use.</p></fn>
