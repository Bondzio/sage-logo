<abstract>
<p>This study examined depression in low-income elementary school children and identified gender differences in factors that influence depression from an ecological perspective. Participants were 262 first- to sixth-grade children recruited from six Korean community centers. Personal factors were anxiety and self-concept. Environmental factors consisted of caregiver (perceived caregiving style), school (perceived school life and quality of peer relations), and neighborhood. The outcome variable was depression. The predictors of boys’ depression were anxiety, perceived school life, and neighborhood. Predictors of girls’ depression were anxiety, self-concept, caregiving style, and neighborhood. School nurses are encouraged to screen elementary school children for depressive symptoms and consider gender differences and environmental factors when intervening in depression. School-focused interventions may be more effective for boys; family-focused interventions may be more beneficial for girls.</p>

<p>Childhood depression is a pervasive and debilitating problem that may lead to a less than ideal developmental course, undermining social and school functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059840512452887">McLeod, Weisz, &amp; Wood, 2007</xref>). Recently, depression has become a serious social issue in South Korea, especially when it results in suicide in elementary students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512452887">Abela and Hankin (2008)</xref> reported that 9% of youth in the United States have experienced at least one episode of severe depression by age 14. However, approximately 12.2% of South Korean children and adolescents are estimated to suffer from depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840512452887">Kim &amp; Yang, 2007</xref>). A number of factors are known to influence depression in adolescents and adults, but much less is known about depression in elementary school children in South Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059840512452887">Park, 2012</xref>). Children living in low-income families may show higher rates of depression because of their multiple adverse environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512452887">Dallaire et al., 2008</xref>; Evans, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059840512452887">Nishikawa, Hagglof, &amp; Sundbom, 2010</xref>). In addition, there is some evidence of gender differences in the factors that influence elementary school children’s depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840512452887">Dekker, Ferdinand, van Lang, Bongers, van der Ende, &amp; Verhulst, 2007</xref>). However, more research is needed to identify the factors that influence depression in elementary school children living in low-income families and whether those factors have a differential influence by gender. To fill this gap, the current study was conducted to explore the individual and environmental factors that differentially influence depression by gender in low-income elementary school children in South Korea.</p>
<p>Among the individual factors that influence depression are self-concept and anxiety. Cognitive theories propose that individuals with cognitive vulnerability such as negative self-concept are likely to develop depression when confronted with stressful life events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840512452887">Carter &amp; Garber, 2011</xref>). A recent study using short-term longitudinal designs provide prospective evidence of the moderating effect of negative cognitions on stress as a predictor of change in depressive symptoms in third- to seventh-grade children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512452887">Abela, 2001</xref>). Self-concept has been defined by researchers as the cognitive aspect of self-knowledge that reflects the child’s actual abilities and internalizations of the feedback obtained from significant others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840512452887">Garaigordobil, Perez, &amp; Mozaz, 2008</xref>). Self-concept becomes the self-defining characteristic that organizes self-information, moderates motivation, and mediates various emotional outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840512452887">Cole et al., 2001</xref>). These studies suggest that children who have a more negative self-concept and higher levels of stress are more likely to be depressed and that changes in self-concept predict changes in symptoms of depression. In addition to self-concept, children’s anxiety is another personal factor known to be associated with the development of depression. A longitudinal study with youth 11–14 years old demonstrated that their level of social anxiety symptoms predicted depressive symptoms 1 year later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512452887">Aune &amp; Stiles, 2009</xref>). A 10-year prospective study found that early-adolescent onset anxiety was associated with an increased risk of depressive disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512452887">Beesdo et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, anxiety should be considered when researching depression because of their strong association.</p>
<p>The environmental factors that influence depression include caregiving, school, and neighborhood. Caregiving style plays an important role in the development and maintenance of child psychological problems, including depression. McLeod, Weisz, and Wood, (2007) conducted a meta-analysis of 45 studies and found that negative caregiving was associated with childhood depression. This may because low-income children, in comparison to middle-income children, were exposed to greater levels of familial stresses such as family violence, disruption, and separation from their family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840512452887">Dalaker, 2001</xref>). Another meta-analysis conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840512452887">Grant et al. (2003)</xref> revealed a strong relationship between economic stressors and harsh, less responsive caregiving. Economic hardship can produce stress within the family and create an unfavorable emotional home environment which results in negative children’s outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512452887">Eamon, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>There is evidence that aspects of the child’s school and other social contexts are related to indicators of socioemotional or developmental problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512452887">Evans, 2004</xref>). Economically disadvantaged children and adolescents are more likely to attend low-quality schools and are less likely to perceive a sense of belonging and a positive school environment than are their more advantaged counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512452887">Evans, 2004</xref>). Youth who were more satisfied with their schools exhibited fewer depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512452887">Eamon, 2002</xref>). Depression is also reported to be associated with less-stable and poorer-quality friendships, suggesting that poor-quality friendships also are risk factors for depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059840512452887">Rudolph, Ladd, &amp; Dinella, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Characteristics of the neighborhood in which the child and family live also influence the development of child depression. Low-income families frequently live in disadvantaged neighborhoods characterized by few resources and high rates of unemployment, crime, violence, and deteriorating physical conditions. Studies have supported a strong relationship between neighborhood poverty and children’s depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512452887">Dallaire et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Gender differences in influences on childhood depression have been found in previous research. Parenting related variables such as parental rejection or acceptance, and warmth or harsh punishment, were associated with girls’ depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512452887">Hipwell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840512452887">Hutcherson &amp; Epkins, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059840512452887">Simons, Johnson, Beaman, Conger, and Whitbeck (1996)</xref> found that neighborhood disadvantage was associated with emotional problems for male adolescents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840512452887">Dekker, Ferdinand, van Lang, Bongers, van der Ende, &amp; Verhulst (2007)</xref> found that the level, expression, and factors influencing depression varied with respect to children’s sex. Unfortunately, few studies specify child gender when examining the association of depression in low-income children with various risk factors. It is important to identify and address gender differences in the context of the multiple personal and environmental factors associated with depression, to enable early detection and referral for treatment by community nurses and school nurses. In addition, there is a need to conduct research on elementary school children’s depression because it has been an increasing issue in South Korea. The factors influencing elementary school children’s depression especially in high-risk environments have not been fully established for this setting.</p>
<p>This study was guided by the ecological framework which underscores the significance of the interrelated interactions of environmental influences including family, school, and neighborhood along with personal characteristics to influence children’s outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840512452887">Bronfenbrenner &amp; Evans, 2000</xref>). This framework led us to identify which personal factors and which environmental factors should be considered in this study. This study examined whether elementary school boys’ or girls’ depression is affected differentially by personal, caregiver, school, and neighborhood in low-income children in South Korea.</p>

<title>Research Design</title>
<p>This study was a secondary data analysis, using a cross-sectional exploratory research design to identify gender differences in factors influencing depression in elementary school children of low-income families. Ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board of the Catholic University of Korea was received for secondary analysis of data derived from the screening survey conducted by visiting nurses in community centers. These data were originally used for planning mental health services for children of low-income families. The predictors included the personal-level variables (self-concept and anxiety), caregiver-level variable (caregiving style), school-level variables (perceived school life and quality of peer relations), and neighborhood-level variable (neighborhood where the children lived). The outcome variable was the child’s depression.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The data were gathered from 262 first- to sixth-grade children (142 boys and 120 girls) of low-income families from the community center in each of the six different communities in Gyunggi, South Korea. Children’s families were defined as low-income families, because they qualified to receive national basic livelihood security benefits from the Korean government based on the National Basic Living Security Act of South Korea for low-income families. According to the Act, families receive different levels of benefits, full or conditional benefits, based upon need. Demographic characteristics of the children are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840512452887">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section5-1059840512452887">
<title>Personal-level variables</title>
<p>The personal-level variables examined included anxiety and self-concept. Children’s anxiety was measured using the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety scale developed for children and adolescent from first grade of elementary school to high school students by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059840512452887">Reynolds and Richmond (1978)</xref>, validated and tested for reliability for use with a Korean population by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840512452887">Choi and Cho (1990)</xref>. It consisted of 37 self-report items including 28 anxiety items and 9 lie items with a binary rating scale. Possible scores ranged from 0 to 28, after summing 28 anxiety items and excluding the 9 lie items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059840512452887">Reynolds &amp; Richmond, 1978</xref>). Higher total scores indicated more severe anxiety. The Kuder-Richardson 20 (KR-20) reliability coefficient was .88 in this study. Children’s self-concept was evaluated by administering the Piers-Harris Children’s Self-Concept for elementary school children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059840512452887">Piers, 1984</xref>), used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059840512452887">Youn (2003)</xref> with Korean first- to sixth-grade elementary school children. This self-report questionnaire has a total of 80 items, rated on a binary scale: <italic>yes</italic> or <italic>no</italic>. Higher total scores indicated more positive self-concept. The KR-20 reliability was .91 in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1059840512452887">
<title>Environmental-level variables</title>
<p>Environmental-level variables consisted of caregiver, school, and neighborhood factors. The caregiver factor, perceived caregiving style, was assessed by the question, <italic>How do you think your primary caregiver takes care of you?</italic> The four possible responses were (1) <italic>very strict and dominant</italic>, (2) <italic>strict but receptive to what I want</italic>, (3) <italic>always permissive</italic>, and (4) <italic>rarely concerned about me</italic>. Nurses explained “<italic>very strict and dominant</italic>” by saying “Your mom, or the one who mainly takes care of you at home, is very bossy so you can’t do whatever you want without his/her permission. He/she mostly limits your behavior and acts like a king.” “<italic>Strict but receptive to what I want</italic>” was explained by saying, “He/she listens to what you say and want to do. You can do what you want if you obey some rules that he/she sets. However, the rules can be changed if he/she understands your thoughts and feelings.” “<italic>Always permissive</italic>” was explained by saying, “He/she always allows you to do whatever you want to do. You can do anything at any time. However, he/she is concerned about you.” “<italic>Rarely concerned about me</italic>” was explained by saying, “He/she is rarely concerned about you except for providing your meals.” We labeled response 1 as “strict” caregiving, response 2 as “balanced” caregiving, and responses 3 and 4 as “permissive” caregiving in terms of levels of control. Because only eight children (two boys and six girls) endorsed response 4, these were included with the “permissive” responses as examples of extreme permissiveness.</p>
<p>The school factor was assessed by two self-report items with a 3-point Likert-type scale. The perceived school life was measured by the item <italic>How much do you enjoy your overall school life?</italic> Responses ranged from 1 = <italic>not much </italic>to 3 = <italic>very</italic> <italic>much</italic>. The quality of peer relations was assessed by the item <italic>What kind of relationships do you have with your friends?</italic> Responses ranged from 1 = <italic>poor</italic> to 3 = <italic>good</italic>. Higher scores indicated more enjoyable school life and better peer relations. The neighborhood factor was assessed by the names of the neighborhoods where children lived.</p>

<p>Children’s depression was assessed using the Children’s Depression Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059840512452887">Kovacs, 2003</xref>) which has been used for children between 6 and 17 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840512452887">Demir, Karacetin, Demir, &amp; Uysal, 2011</xref>), and translated and tested for validity and reliability for use with Korean children by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512452887">Cho and Lee (1990)</xref>. It consisted of 27 self-report items, each of which comprises three response statements which represent varying levels of depression in the past two weeks. Possible scores ranged from 0 to 54. Higher total scores indicated more severe depression. Cronbach’s α was .80 in this study.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>In collaboration with nurses at community centers serving low-income families, nurse researchers at a college of nursing conducted the research, using the screening survey from the community centers that was administered to assign mental health services for children in low income families. Visiting nurses at the community centers obtained written informed consent from the primary caregivers and written assent from the school-age child participants. Children completed the questionnaires at their homes, schools, or community centers. Nurses provided children and their primary caregivers with the results of the questionnaire and used them to plan future services for the children. After assisting these nurses with analysis of screening data, the researchers conducted a secondary data analysis to better understand which personal and environmental factors were differentially influential to children’s depression in low-income families by gender.</p>

<sec id="section9-1059840512452887">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 18.0. Descriptive statistics were used for summarizing demographic characteristics of the children and personal, environmental, and outcome variables. The χ<sup>2</sup> test, Fisher’s exact test, and independent <italic>t</italic> test were conducted to test the gender differences in demographic data and descriptive data of personal- and environmental level variables. Correlations among continuous variables (self-concept, anxiety, perceived school life, and quality of peer relations) and depression were tested by Pearson’s correlation coefficient; associations between the categorical variables (caregiving style and neighborhood) and depression were tested by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Hierarchical multiple linear regression models were used to determine the predictors of depression in girls and boys, respectively, among the personal and the environmental variables. We did not control for demographic variables because there were no significant gender differences of depression by grade (<italic>F</italic> = 0.12, <italic>p</italic> = .735), living situation (<italic>F</italic> = 0.14, <italic>p</italic> = .709), primary caregiver (<italic>F</italic> = 0.02, <italic>p</italic> = .878), and type of national benefits (<italic>F</italic> = 0.20, <italic>p</italic> = .731) in the results of the two-way ANOVA.</p>

<title>Contributions of Personal and Environmental Variables to Child Depression in Low-Income Families</title>
<p>A four-step hierarchical multiple linear regression was conducted to test the influence of personal and environmental variables to predict depression, conducted by gender. Even though personal, caregiver, and school variables were not associated with girls’ depression in our correlation and ANOVA analyses, we included them in the hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis for several reasons. There were significant gender differences in the percentage of caregiving style and the level of perceived school life as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840512452887">Table 2</xref>. Additionally, anxiety and cognitive factors such as self-concept have been considered as important variables which influence mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840512452887">Beesdo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840512452887">Carter &amp; Garber, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, peer relationships have been discussed as important variables that influence children’s outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059840512452887">Rudolph, Ladd, &amp; Dinella, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We separately analyzed data from boys and girls. In the first step of the regression, the personal variables (self-concept and anxiety) were entered. In the next step, caregiving style was entered into the equation. School variables (perceived school life and quality of peer relations) were entered in the third step. Finally, in the fourth step, the neighborhood variable (the names of neighborhoods) was entered into the model. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840512452887">Table 4</xref> provides the results of the analysis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we took advantage of a readily available secondary data set to explore the predictors of childhood depression in low-income families in Korea. Following an ecological perspective, we wanted to explore gender differences in the relationships between elementary school children’s depression and personal and environmental factors in the context of poverty. Gender differences were found in the contributions to depression of variables at each of the ecological levels: personal, caregiver, school, and community. At the personal level, anxiety was a significant predictor of depression in both genders, but self-concept was a significant predictor only in girls’ depression. At the caregiver and school levels, the perceived school life was a significant predictor of depression for boys, whereas permissive caregiving was a significant predictor of depression for girls. In addition, the neighborhood where they lived was found to predict depression in both genders.</p>
<p>Inverse relationships between self-concept and depression have been identified in children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840512452887">Demir et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840512452887">Garaigordobil et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840512452887">Abela (2001)</xref> found that negative cognitions about the self interacted with negative events to predict increases in depressive symptoms in third- and seventh-grade girls but not boys. This was consistent with our finding that self-concept was a predictor only for first- to sixth-grade girls’ depression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059840512452887">Nolen-Hoeksema (2001)</xref> suggested that difference in males’ and females’ self-concepts was related to interpersonal orientation: the tendency to be concerned with one’s relationships and the opinions of others about oneself. Nolen-Hoeksema reported that, even in childhood, girls appeared more interpersonally oriented than boys. When the interpersonal orientation leads girls to prioritize the needs of others, they are likely to rely overly on the opinions of others. They may then be at high risk of depression when problems arise in relationships. In our study, girls’ depression was also influenced by caregiving, contrary to boys’ depression. This suggests that the association between girls’ self-concept and caregiving may contribute to girls’ depression.</p>
<p>The fact that in both genders depression was found to be influenced by the other personal variable (anxiety) confirms what is already well known: that depression is highly correlated with anxiety. Several longitudinal studies have found that anxiety symptoms or disorders precede depressive symptoms and disorders in children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059840512452887">Zahn-Waxler, Shirtcliff, &amp; Marceau, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840512452887">Gazelle, Workman, and Allan (2010)</xref> found that children with a history of anxious solitary withdrawal in third to fourth grade were more likely to be diagnosed with depressive disorders. Moreover, the level of social anxiety symptoms in 11- to 14-year-old youth was found to predict depressive symptoms 1 year later, controlling for initial depressive symptoms; however, depression did not predict later anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840512452887">Aune &amp; Stiles, 2009</xref>). The findings of our study and previous research suggest that anxiety regulation interventions may help prevent depression in children regardless of their gender.</p>
<p>We also found gender differences in the relationship between depression and caregiver-level variables. Caregiving style predicted depression only for girls, suggesting that caregiving may play an important role in girls’ depression. This is congruent with a report by a previous study that girls were more vulnerable to familial stress than boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059840512452887">Nolen-Hoeksema, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840512452887">Hipwell et al. (2008)</xref> similarly found that depression in preadolescent girls aged 7 to 12 was strongly related to low parental warmth. In particular, permissive caregiving in the current study was a significant predictor of girls’ depression. While permissive parents are responsive and accepting toward their children, they are not likely to control or supervise children’s behavior even when their children misbehave. Therefore, children of permissive parents are more likely to be impulsive and have low self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840512452887">Kang &amp; Kim, 2010</xref>). Considering that children need the protection provided by a certain amount of active parental supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840512452887">Frojd, Kaltiala-Heino, &amp; Rimpela, 2007</xref>), permissive parenting may be a negative predictor of children’s depression. In addition, a higher percentage of girls than boys perceived permissive caregiving and girls’ low self-concept was a significant predictor of their depression in our study. The link between self-concept and permissive caregiving may have contributed to our finding of gender difference. However, there is a need for further research into gender differences in the influences of specific caregiving practices on children’s depression.</p>
<p>At the school level, boys’ but not girls’ depression was influenced by their perceived school life in the current study. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512452887">Eamon (2002)</xref> asked 10- to 12-year-old low-income children a single question assessing how satisfied they were with their school, and found that, compared to girls, boys reported less school satisfaction, and less school satisfaction predicted depressive symptoms. In other research, good relationships with peers in school have been identified as critical factors in positive outcomes of early adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059840512452887">Oberle, Schonert-Reichl, &amp; Zumbo, 2011</xref>). In the current study, quality of peer relations was significantly correlated with boys’ depression; contrary to our expectation, in the regression model, this variable was not a significant predictor of depression in either gender. However, according to our results and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512452887">Eamon (2002)</xref>’s findings, school life may be more influential on boys’ than on girls’ depression. There is a need for further research with well-developed measures for evaluating the effect of school life variables on depression.</p>
<p>In contrast to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059840512452887">Simons et al. (1996)</xref> that community disadvantage was related to psychological distress only for male adolescents, the current study found that neighborhood strongly affected elementary school children’s depression in both genders. This is consistent with Dallaire et al.’s report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512452887">2008</xref>) that living in a disadvantaged neighborhood predicted youth depressive symptoms. This may be due to stress induced by exposure to neighborhood problems such as unemployment, crime, and violence, in the context of few resources to address those stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512452887">Evans, 2004</xref>). Even with the limited data on community factors available for analysis in this study, it is clear that community is a crucial factor influencing children's depression, as previous research has suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840512452887">Evans, 2004</xref>). Further study is needed to explore the more specific aspects of communities responsible for this substantive effect on the depression of low-income elementary children in South Korea.</p>
<p>The findings of this research are consistent with previous studies which indicated that impoverished children are at risk of developing depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840512452887">Dallaire et al., 2008</xref>). This study’s elementary school children of families in poverty were more depressed than reported by other community-based studies. The mean depression scores of 19.49 for boys and 19.46 for girls in this study was much higher than the mean depression scores of 13.95 found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840512452887">Cho and Lee (1990)</xref> and 14.72 found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059840512452887">Park (2008)</xref> in Korean elementary school children. Our study also found depression mean scores higher than the 11.21 and 9.98 reported in community studies in other countries by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059840512452887">Kovacs (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059840512452887">Poli, Sbrana, Marcheschi, &amp; Masi (2003)</xref>, respectively. Although influential factors on depression were found to differ by gender, the level of depression of elementary school children in this study was not significantly different between genders. This finding was similar with Demir, Karacetin, Demir, and Uysal’ s study (2011) of preadolescents and Eamon’s finding (2002) that depression of 10- to 12-year-old early adolescents did not vary by gender. Previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059840512452887">Petersen et al., 1993</xref>) has indicated that the gender difference in prevalence of depression escalates in the adolescent period; beginning around 14–15 years of age, females start to exhibit more depressive symptoms than do males. We found no gender difference in the severity of depression, possibly because our sample was younger than 14 years. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840512452887">Carter and Garber (2011)</xref> suggested that girls and boys who are exposed to similar risk factors, such as maternal depression and other stressors, may be equally likely to develop depression. Our study’s findings suggest that the experience of poverty is an environmental risk factor that may contribute to depression.</p>
<p>According to a longitudinal research on the trajectory of depression with children aged 4 to 16, girls with early childhood onset of high levels of depression were likely to experience increasing depression over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840512452887">Dekker et al., 2007</xref>). Boys with early high levels of depression that initially increase and then follow a decreasing trajectory from childhood to adolescence have significantly more mental health problems and a lower educational level later in life. Therefore, girls and boys with depression during childhood are especially at risk of poor emotional and behavioral outcomes as young adults and should be considered candidates for intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840512452887">Dekker et al., 2007</xref>). Both genders of low-income elementary school children in our study showed high levels of depression and are at high risk of poor emotional and behavioral outcomes. These results suggest that early detection of depression and effective intervention are critically needed to alleviate their childhood depression before it becomes a lifelong, serious mood disorder.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found that there are gender differences in the contributions to depression at each of the ecological levels, including personal, caregiver, school, and neighborhood factors. At the personal level, anxiety was a significant predictor of depression in both genders, but self-concept contributed only to girls’ depression. At the caregiver and school levels, perceived school life was a significant predictor of boy’s depression, whereas permissive caregiving was a significant predictor of girl’s depression. Neighborhood contributed to both boys’ and girls’ depression. School nurses need to be aware of these findings when they screen elementary school students in poverty for early detection of depression and refer them to interventions to promote their optimal mental health and developmental outcomes.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Several of the limitations of this study relate to working with an existing secondary data set from screening survey for designing services in community centers. Because the researchers did not have control over the selection of the measures, several variables were assessed using fairly restricted measures. Perceived caregiver and school variables were measured by only 1 and 2 items, respectively. These indicators may or may not have validly measured these constructs. Another limitation is that all of the available data were drawn from the child’s self-report and perceptions. While reliability of a child’s report/perspective on school and caregiving variables was questioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840512452887">Eamon (2002)</xref>, there is evidence that children’s report should not be completely discounted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840512452887">Ceballo, Ramirez, Hearn, &amp; Maltese, 2003</xref>). In a future study, the addition of well-established measures of caregiving, quality of school life, and peer relations, as well as the perspectives of additional respondents, would strengthen measurement of the constructs of interest.</p>
<p>Although this study examined relationships among variables across several levels of an ecological model, a more complete examination should include additional measures specific to each level: for instance, measures of children’s biological and genetic risk, parental depression, and specific characteristics of schools and communities. Despite these limitations, use of the available data set provided an opportunity to examine gender differences in depression of elementary school children, a little-studied topic that is of utmost importance of late, especially in Korea.</p>

<sec id="section18-1059840512452887">
<title>Implications for School Nursing</title>
<p>Results of this study underscore the critical importance of early detection and intervention for depression of elementary school low-income children beginning at the first grade in elementary school. School nurses should screen children for depressive symptoms, make appropriate referrals to mental health care providers and community nurses, and advocate for gender-sensitive interventions. School nurses should educate teachers and staff that high levels of depressive symptoms need special monitoring and care, both at home and at school. In addition, nurses should be aware that both self-concept and caregiving style predicted girls’ depression, whereas perceived school life predicted boys’ depression, so different interventions for boys and girls may be needed. However, these results should be viewed with caution due to the limitation of the measures of caregiving and school life.</p>
<p>School programs that focus on improving children’s school life and their ability to regulate their anxiety may prevent the emergence of depressive symptoms in low-income children who are at risk. Such school-focused interventions may be more effective for boys. To prevent or ameliorate boys’ depression, interventions that enhance school life with regulation of their anxiety are recommended. School nurses may engage in qualitative research to identify specific factors that influence boys’ perceived school life.</p>
<p>Developing family-focused interventions to strengthen self-concept and reduce negative caregiving behaviors represents an avenue for future research that could improve outcomes for elementary school girls. It is also important for researchers and clinicians to be mindful that children with depression may also elicit negative parental behaviors, with adverse effects especially for girls. School nurses may become involved in longitudinal studies conducted over time to determine the direction of causality between parent and child factors and depression.</p>
<p>An important result of this study was identification of the significant neighborhood-level influence on elementary school children’s depression in the presence of poverty. Further study is needed to explore the specific aspects of neighborhoods where children live for this substantive effect. School nurses are in a position to advocate at the policy level, informing policy makers and government bodies of the significant community-level influences on childhood depression. By joining in collaboration, nurse researchers in academic settings and nurses in schools and community settings can build the evidence base for needed interventions, as well as evaluate their impact on reducing symptoms of depression among vulnerable children living in poverty.</p>
<p>In order for school nurses to carry out these suggested activities in addition to the many activities they already do to support children’s physical and mental health, it is clear that more school nurse positions must be funded. Currently, in South Korea, school nurses are employed in only 68% of schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059840512452887">Rha, 2011</xref>); in the United States, only 76% of schools have a nurse who visits even once a week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840512452887">National Association of School Nurses, 2007</xref>). Increasing the number of school nurses to provide optimal school-based health care could play a critical role in reducing depression among elementary school children in Korea.</p>
