<abstract>
<p>Parents and schools often notice the need for addressing advanced mathematical performance in elementary students. Many gifted programs do not offer differentiated or accelerated mathematics as part of their elementary school options. In this report, the efforts of one school system to identify and serve the needs of highly mathematically able elementary students are reported. The process involved a multiple pilot program with increasing levels of involvement across the district over a 3-year period. Initially, a small group of students were allowed modest acceleration at one school. After each of the first 2 years, the identification and acceleration practices were refined. In the 3rd year, the program option was offered to students across the entire district.</p>

<p>Gifted programming differs greatly from state to state, district to district, and sometimes school to school within a district. Program delivery options range from services provided in regular classroom by teachers with minimal training to special schools and magnet programs with advanced coursework and specially trained faculty. No matter what the program option, gifted programs often have a “one size fits all” approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076217512465284">Hertberg-Davis, 2009</xref>) where all identified students receive the same services, often as general enrichment in a pull-out format. This type of general identification and programming seldom finds or addresses the needs of mathematically precocious students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217512465284">Assouline &amp; Lupkowski-Shoplik, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Even mathematics classes that work quite well for most students miss the educational needs of mathematically precocious students. Typically, mathematics courses present materials on a wide variety of mathematics topics but do so superficially with an ever spiraling approach to concepts and processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217512465284">Cossey, 1999</xref>). The typical approaches usually rely on drill and practice to ensure mastery and seldom include pre-assessment of understanding or problem-based strategies and solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1076217512465284">Sheffield, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1076217512465284">Usiskin, 1987</xref>). Regular mathematics classes typically make all students in the class advance at the same pace and do the same work with no attempt to modify the lessons or courses to address individual differences—at least among those with mathematical precocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217512465284">Diezmann &amp; Watters, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Even in cases where the unmet mathematical needs of these students are recognized, teachers and schools may not know how to efficiently design a curriculum that better addresses these needs. Lack of time and expertise for the classroom teacher may keep them from creating challenging curriculum within their classes for these students whose true rate of learning math is often astounding.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>What are the characteristics of a child precociously talented in mathematics? These students know a lot of the mathematics already, can learn it at a much faster pace than it is presented, and are developmentally ready to learn higher levels of mathematics than the normal grade-level curriculum provides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1076217512465284">Sayler, 2002</xref>). Cognitively, the mathematically precocious generally have a larger working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217512465284">Dark &amp; Benbow, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217512465284">Geary, Hoard, Byrd-Craven, &amp; DeSoto 2004</xref>) and specifically better executive functioning and naming speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1076217512465284">Swanson, 2006</xref>). Noncognitive characteristics such as motivation, beliefs about and attitudes toward mathematics, mathematical self-efficacy, and self-esteem also play important roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1076217512465284">Phillipson &amp; Callingham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076217512465284">Renzulli, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Addressing the needs of the mathematically talented is based on three broad principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217512465284">Brody &amp; Stanley, 2005</xref>): (a) mathematical learning is sequential and developmental, (b) children learn at different rates, and (c) effective teaching involves a match between an individual child’s readiness to learn and the level of the content presented. These principles underlie the work of researchers in the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) that was established by Julian Stanley in 1971 and has tracked more than 5,000 talented students for 40 years and led to hundreds of publications on these students and their education since (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217512465284">Benbow, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Applying these principles in classroom practices can take several forms. The specific approach taken depends on the needs of the students in the particular school or district and the current options and offerings provided to address their mathematics needs. The unmet needs of these students may go unnoticed as many of them appear to be “learning” as they often do well on grade-level tests, especially normed assessments. The daily instruction for these students tends to be repetitious and neither challenges them nor advances much of their current levels of learning.</p>
<p>Supplying a mathematics curriculum that is better matched to student need facilitates the development of mathematical talent. Acceleration, enrichment, and problem-based learning are common approaches. In their book reviewing and synthesizing the best practices in gifted education, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076217512465284">Robinson, Shore, and Enersen (2007)</xref> found clear evidence that acceleration allowed gifted students to cover the content more efficiently. An enriched or differentiated mathematics curriculum for high-ability elementary students resulted in significant gains over students who received the regular mathematics curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1076217512465284">Tieso, 2002</xref>). Basing mathematics differentiation on recent recommendations from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics on problem-based learning showed strong achievement gains for gifted and average but mathematically promising students in urban settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217512465284">Gavin, Casa, Adelson, Carroll, &amp; Sheffield, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Of these methods for addressing the needs of mathematically talented students, accelerative options are some of the most supported by research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076217512465284">Robinson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076217512465284">Southern &amp; Jones, 2004</xref>). Stanley and his many collaborators showed that acceleration in a student’s area of strength is a very effective way to meet the academic needs of these gifted children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1076217512465284">Stanley, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1076217512465284">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1076217512465284">Stanley &amp; Benbow, 1983</xref>). Accelerated instruction provides a cluster of approaches for meeting the needs of mathematically talented elementary students. The specific type of acceleration used to address current unmet needs relates to a variety of factors, including level and types of student abilities and their current performances, existing opportunities for challenging curriculum, family and cultural support, teacher preparation and/or worry about the effects of acceleration on their social and emotional development, the teacher’s comfort with math, state guidelines, concerns from administrators, staffing issues, and so on.</p>
<p>The Appalachia Model Mathematics Program (MMP) is one example of a program that systematized acceleration through initial and ongoing assessment, flexible grouping, and modifications in curriculum to match students’ current needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217512465284">Miller, Mills &amp; Tangherlini, 1995</xref>). The majority of the students were ready for Algebra I in Grade 7, and some of the highest level students enrolled in Algebra I in Grades 4, 5, or 6. In a four-group pretest, posttest study, groups of elementary gifted and nongifted students were given either regular curriculum or accelerated math (AM), a self-paced and differentiated curriculum that had the effect of accelerating their mathematics learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1076217512465284">Ysseldyke, Tardrew, Betts, Thill, &amp; Hannigan, 2004</xref>). The gifted students in both the AM and regular classes outperformed the regular students in either AM or regular classes with the gifted receiving the AM approach doing the best of all. The efficacy and appropriateness of acceleration in mathematics is not limited to well-to-do Anglo students. Acceleration in math was successful and well liked by mathematically talented minority students and their teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217512465284">Lee, Olszewski-Kubilus, &amp; Peternel, 2010</xref>). Teachers in the study believed the acceleration was beneficial for mathematically talented students regardless of ethnicity and the gifted minority students did not find undue peer pressure related to their participation in AM.</p>
<p>From a practical standpoint, knowing that acceleration is a viable and desirable option for mathematically talented students is just the first step. Schools, teachers, and parents who have interest in this approach must then ask how they can possibly do this given all the other demands on their time and resources.</p>
<p>This study presents the sequential trial and implementation approach used by one district in central Texas. It reports how they became aware of their students’ mathematical needs; how they initially identified the students most in need of acceleration; how they piloted a plan in one school, then in three schools; and how they used the pilot to plan and implement an appropriate accelerative option across the five elementary schools in the district.</p>
<p>The district involved served approximately 7,000 students through one high school, two middle schools, and five elementary schools. The district was largely Caucasian and relatively affluent. The median household income was approximately US$24,000 above the national average, 68.8% of adults were employed in White-collar jobs, and 52.8% had 4-year college degrees or higher. The district was named an exemplary district by the Texas Education Agency for several years during the time of the study. U.S. News and World Report ranked the district’s high school in the top 2.5% of schools nationally.</p>
<sec id="section1-1076217512465284">
<title>The Gifted Program</title>
<p>Students in the district were served by an interdisciplinary, projected-based, enrichment pullout program that met 4 hr per week. All gifted students received the same gifted/talented (GT) curriculum despite having noticeable individual strengths and performance profiles. All academic instruction, including mathematics, was provided to the identified GT students in their home classrooms along with the rest of their grade peers through use of the regular texts, curriculum materials, and assessments.</p>
<p>In 2008, the district conducted a programwide needs assessment. When analyzing the needs assessment data and reviewing the existing identification test information, it became clear that there were students in the GT program who had strong unmet mathematics talents and needs. These unmet needs were a topic of informal discussions among the elementary GT teachers and several districts’ personal. Within a year, these discussions led to the formal proposal and piloting of a program option for mathematically precocious students at the elementary level in addition to the services already provided by the existing GT program.</p>
<p>Existing data were used that came from the original GT identification process: Otis-Lennon School Ability Test (OLSAT-8), Williams Creativity test, Stanford Achievement Test (SAT-10), and with a teacher recommendation. The students initially considered for review for the new mathematics option were Grade 4 students with OLSAT-8 total and/or nonverbal scores at the 98th percentile or higher, strong teacher behavior ratings in mathematics, and who scored at or above the 96th percentile on the mathematics battery of the SAT-10.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1076217512465284">
<title>Development of a Pilot Program</title>
<p>One school was selected to pilot the program; it was a school with several strong mathematics students and a willing GT coordinator. An exploratory planning committee was created that included the five elementary GT teachers, the assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction, the Grade 5 classroom teachers at the pilot school, the building principal, and the middle school math department chair.</p>
<p>After looking at the data and talking about the potential participating students and the kinds of options that might work, the committee agreed on an approach for the experimental mathematics option. The pilot plan would allow a small number of the most mathematically precocious students to be instructed at the level of their current readiness; present materials 1 to 2 years above level; provide flexibly in what was presented, how it was presented; and use pre–post testing to ensure mastery of the advanced content. Numerous longitudinal studies had shown the efficacy of accelerative approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1076217512465284">Stanley, 2000</xref>), but teachers, administrators, and parents were still needing their own evidence. If the approach were successful here, it would be tried with larger classes at more schools.</p>
<p>As it was a pilot, the team felt that the first cohort also needed to be independent and self-motivated already. The pilot would be monitored closely, data collected and discussed, and an evaluation made before considering districtwide implementation. The initial goal was for these Grade 5 students to compact Grade 5 and Grade 6 pre-AP mathematics, and be ready for Algebra I in Grade 7 and geometry in Grade 8.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1076217512465284">
<title>Selecting the Participants</title>
<p>In December 2008, the committee reviewed on-level OLSAT-8 and SAT-10 scores from students in the pilot school for evidence of high mathematics performance. There were nine Grade 5 students who scored at the 96th percentile and above on the total math battery of the SAT-10. Out of these nine, five students additionally had a composite score of 130 or greater on the OLSAT-8, or a scored greater than 135 or more on the nonverbal OLSAT-8 subtest.</p>
<p>One program student, who was regarded as a top candidate by her Grade 5 math teacher, her principal, and her GT coordinator did not meet the pilot criteria on the OLSAT-8. This student spoke only Japanese at home, and although she is not considered to have limited English, it was the belief of her teachers that this and cultural differences may have been the reason for her lower than expected score. With further research, it was found that this student answered only 52 out of 72 questions on the OLSAT-8 before her time allotment ran out. Of the 56 questions answered, she only missed 2. Therefore, she was placed with the other four students for consideration in AM.</p>
<p>The parents of these five students were approached for permission for their children to receive instruction in an AM class during second semester of Grade 5. All accepted the opportunity. With permission in place, the pilot program began in January at one school with five students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1076217512465284">
<title>Developing the Curriculum</title>
<p>During meetings with the assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction and the Grade 6 math chair at the receiving middle school, it was decided that these students should attempt to compact the remainder of Grade 5 and all of Grade 6 state standards for mathematics. In addition, the Grade 7 mathematics standards that were covered in the Grade 6 pre-advanced placement (AP) mathematics coursework needed to be addressed because it was hoped these students would begin Grade 7 pre-AP mathematics as sixth graders.</p>
<p>To achieve these goals, the middle-school math chair and elementary GT coordinator met to discuss appropriate materials and curriculum. The teachers chose not to use any materials that were currently used in the Grade 6 pre-AP mathematics course. The rationale was that if students were not ready at the end of Grade 5 to accelerate, they should not repeat the same materials in Grade 6 pre-AP mathematics. It was decided that the Grade 6 <italic>Everyday Mathematics</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512465284">Bell et al., 2004</xref>) would be used as the primary resource for instruction. <italic>Everyday Mathematics</italic> is a mathematics curriculum developed by the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project (UCSMP) curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512465284">Bell et al., 2004</xref>). The <italic>Everyday Mathematics</italic> program is a spiraled curriculum. It helped to ensure that students did not have gaps created from compacting curriculum so quickly. In addition, the <italic>Everyday Mathematics</italic> program is structured so that a student is assigned a few application-level problems covering the day’s content and three to five problems addressing content previously taught. This program is rigorous and covers all Grade 6 state standards as well as a substantial component on integers and prealgebraic skills that were the relevant Grade 7 state standards.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1076217512465284">
<title>The Participants</title>
<p>The pilot group contained five Grade 5 students: three males and two females. Four of these students were Caucasian and one Japanese. All five had maintained grade averages of 90 or above in all subjects throughout their elementary years. The students were regarded as high achieving, self-motivated, and independent by their Grade 5 teachers and the principal.</p>
<p>Ethan (pseudonyms are used for all students) was an 11-year-old boy who qualified for gifted services in Grade 1. He scored 142 on the OLSAT-8 total and 99th percentile on the total math portion of the Grade 5 SAT-10.</p>
<p>Bob was the youngest of the group at 10 years 11 months at the beginning of the pilot. He was identified for the existing gifted program in Grade 1. He scored 150 on the Nonverbal subtest of the OLSAT-8 and 96th percentile on total math of the Grade 5 SAT-10.</p>
<p>Justin was an 11-year-old male who qualified for gifted services in Grade 4. He scored 135 on the Test of Nonvberbal Intelligence (TONI-3), which tests nonverbal reasoning, and 98th percentile on the total math of the Grade 5 SAT-10.</p>
<p>Anne was an 11-year-old female who qualified for gifted services in Grade 3. She scored 140 on the OLSAT-8 composite and 96th percentile on the mathematics battery of the SAT-10.</p>
<p>Mika was the oldest of the group at 11.5 years of age. She was bilingual, spoke English and Japanese. She scored 119 on the OLSAT-8 composite and 96th percentile on the SAT-10 math. She qualified for gifted services in December of her Grade 5 year, through an appeal process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1076217512465284">
<title>AM Pilot—Year 1</title>
<p>Initially, the five students did not all have math at the same time, and due to scheduling restraints for the GT coordinator, students’ schedules and classes had to be modified. Some of the students had to change homeroom classes to make the schedule work for the whole group. This was an inconvenience, but doable, to students and teachers to implement at mid year. The GT coordinator also gave up a Grade 5 math enrichment group, to create a time slot for this math class. The students were moved to one of two homeroom classes. This made it possible for the students to be pulled out each day for 1 hr during the regular math class instruction. The students received all math instruction and math grades from the GT coordinator rather than their homeroom teacher. The small class size facilitated the accelerative approach used in the pilot study.</p>
<p>On the 1st day of the AM class, the students were given the publicly released 2006 state assessment for Grade 6 mathematics. The purpose of this was to get a current performance baseline on each student, identify areas where they had misunderstandings, and indicate those areas that could be compacted. The participants had mastered most of the sixth-grade content already: Ethan, 97%; Bob, 87%, Justin, 83%; Anne, 74%; and Mika, 83%. During the assessment, the teacher asked the students to identify questions for which they had no idea of an answer with “IDK,” representing “I don’t know,” or to make notes on programs for which they had an idea but were not confident in their answer choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1076217512465284">Sayler, 1995</xref>). After discussing the IDK items with each student, the teacher found that they often got the answers correct on the questions they had marked IDK or about which they were uncertain. The areas where the students had the most incorrect responses were formulas, ratios, and vocabulary associated with statistics and geometry. Problems with basic operations and calculations were rarely missed. These data helped the teacher to compact the curriculum and pace instruction appropriately.</p>
<p>Throughout the semester, the students responded exceptionally well to the approach. All learned a great deal, gained confidence, and were excited about the opportunities. Students were given assessments at the conclusion of each unit. Each maintained an A average throughout the course of the pilot study. In addition, the GT coordinator was able to observe each of the students and their daily success with mathematics. Students spoke openly about their excitement about the opportunity to accelerate and be challenged in mathematics.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the semester, the students were given another Grade 6 publicly released Texas State Mathematics Test, and in every case, the scores improved. To ensure comprehension of the content in the pilot phase of the project, school officials required that the participating students take the Grade 6 exam for acceleration given through the University of Texas to receive credit for Grade 6 math. Three of the five students scored high enough to receive this credit. One student, who did not receive credit immediately, took the test at a later date, passed, and joined his peers in the accelerated programming. The last student rejoined his nonaccelerated classmates in the Grade 6 and continued on very successfully with pre-AP mathematics that was accelerated 1 year rather than 2 years like the other students participating in the pilot.</p>
<p>The district continued to monitor these students in middle school. Four of these five students took geometry in Grade 8 and one took Algebra I. All had averages of 90 or above in their middle-school mathematics coursework. When interviewed, all were very happy with their decision to accelerate. They reported that it has given them great confidence in their mathematical ability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1076217512465284">
<title>AM Pilot—Year 2</title>
<p>The success of the initial pilot led to expansion of the program to two additional schools. Summer staff development on curriculum compacting, on acceleration, and on the approach to mathematics instruction used in the program were provided for the two GT instructors who would teach the course in the two new schools. A team of GT and Grade 5 teachers, and the middle-school mathematics chair worked over the summer to revise the initial course to cover Grade 5 and Grade 6 (pre-AP) mathematics. The work was then reviewed by the middle-school pre-AP teachers to ensure adequacy of coverage. The course ran the entire school term instead of one semester.</p>
<p>A total of 11 students from three elementary campuses were identified for the Year 2 pilot. As before, the curriculum was compacted using pre-tests for units of study and released state assessments and the same textbook used. At the conclusion of the school year, students were to take the mathematics exam from the University of Texas. In all, 9 of the 11 students received credit for Grade 6 mathematics and entered the seventh-grade pre-AP mathematics course at the beginning of Grade 6. The students entered Algebra I as seventh graders and performed at the top of their classes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1076217512465284">
<title>AM Program</title>
<p>With 2 years of data, the assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction met with the GT specialists and began to develop a full-scale implementation for the entire district. Three major changes to the program were made. First, inclusion in the program should not be as restrictive as participation in the pilot. District officials recognized that not all students who were talented in mathematics qualified for the general gifted services. Second, students needed to be selected at the end of Grade 4 rather than at the beginning of Grade 5. The GT teachers who would be teaching the program met to review the text, the process used, and the results from the first two pilot years. Finally, the district decided to not spend money for the University of Texas mathematics examinations for students to receive credit for the course. State rules allow a district to use the University of Texas (or other university) tests to award credit or to use an internal district-created test of content mastery instead. The participants were required to pass the Grade 6 pre-AP mathematics exam, the same test all Grade 6 pre-AP students take.</p>
<p>To cast a wide net for candidates, a talent pool of students was created. The pool of students consisted of all current fourth-grade students identified as gifted and talented and any student who missed one or less on the state mathematics achievement assessment for fourth grade. These results arrived in school districts in the last 2 weeks of school and were screened by the GT coordinator on each campus. Invitations to test for the AM program were sent to all students who qualified.</p>
<p>Each school held a parent meeting to explain the program, the additional testing, and the implications of admission should their children be placed in the AM program. Parents had the final choice whether to give permission to test their child. These Grade 4 candidates were administered the total mathematics battery of the Grade 7 SAT-10. Their scores were reported based on the Grade 7 norms for the test.</p>
<p>In the 3rd year of the pilot, 184 students from all five of the elementary schools in the district were identified for the talent pool. Of these students, 24 scored in the 87th percentile or above on the off-level Intermediate 3 SAT-10. This test is typically given in the fall of Grade 7. The percentile rank was based on Grade 7 fall norms. These students were invited to participate in the AM program in Grade 5. Only one family declined participation.</p>
<p>The students completed the Grade 5 accelerated course and are now sixth graders taking Grade 7 pre-AP math at one of the two middle schools. Their receiving middle-school teachers noted that these students were well prepared and excited about their mathematics coursework and have adjusted well. In the most recent testing pool, 155 candidates were placed in the talent pool. After off-level testing, 30 students qualified for the AM program.</p>

<p>The implementation of the AM program for Grade 5 has provided an opportunity for many students to have their talent potential in mathematics challenged. Although most of the students who have entered the AM program have been students already participating in the gifted and talented program, some have not. This shows that screening a large number of students has helped reach students who had real mathematics talent but were not a good match for the general gifted program. Today, parents may also nominate their child for the talent pool along with those in the GT program and anyone who missed one or none in State Mathematics Achievement Test.</p>
<p>To assess impact over time, these students will continue to be monitored by math teachers and the GT specialists. The district will collect test and survey data about the experience and academic success of these students as they progress in their education. In addition, data will be collected to determine whether there were any negative or positive social implications with participation in acceleration. The pilot approach and increasing involvement of schools provided a good model for testing and implementing this program option. School officials, teachers, students, and their parents are happy and excited about the results and plan to continue the project.</p>
