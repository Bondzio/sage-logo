<p>The editorial team of <italic>Small Group Research</italic> invites authors to submit proposals for the 2015 Review Issue. Articles for the Review Issue are high-impact scholarly surveys of important group and team research literatures. They summarize recent research, provide integration across disciplines, and highlight important directions for future inquiries. The Review Issue is open to all areas of group and team research, including research methods and group-based learning activities. We are particularly interested in reviews that address critical turning points in the literature in terms of evolving theory, enduring issues where reviews can reveal future areas of attention, levels of analysis issues, or improvements in methodological approaches.</p>
<p>Proposals should be submitted between April 1, 2014 and May 1, 2014 via the <italic>Small Group Research</italic> online submission portal at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/sgr">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/sgr</ext-link> (please be sure to indicate that your submission is a Review Issue proposal in your submission letter).</p>
<p><italic>Please note that we are not accepting manuscripts before April 1, 2014</italic>.</p>
