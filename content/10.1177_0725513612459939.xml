<p>What does it mean to be human in the modern world? This is the primary question that Karl Smith addresses in <italic>Meaning, Subjectivity, Society</italic>. The question itself, and the various reformulations of it that we pose to ourselves and to others are, Smith claims, irresolvable, yet they are also perennial and intrinsic to the constitution of society. Smith wants to show that while an encounter with the basic questions of ethics and subjectivity is compelled by modernity’s notion of autonomy, the answers that subjects give to these questions (who am I?, who are we?, how should we live?) shape the meaning of autonomy and are part of the process of making ourselves autonomous. In other words, Smith seeks to clarify the interconnections between modern culture and what could be described as a social ontology of the subject. Naturally, this immensely difficult task can only be pursued in a highly reflexive manner; Smith reveals complications and then draws out their implications for autonomy. His conclusions highlight how practices of self-limitation are critical to autonomy. It is necessary, in his opinion, to continue the process of coming to terms with modernity’s deep-seated tensions, rather than yoking autonomy to a project of transcending them through radical transformation. </p>
<p>Smith develops this account of the perennial questions of meaning, subjectivity and society through an explication and comparison of the relevant dimensions of the thought of Cornelius Castoriadis and Charles Taylor. What these two theorists have in common, according to Smith, is an appreciation of how the human condition concerns the provision of meaning. Taylor claims that humans are ‘self-interpreting animals’, condemned to meaning. His philosophical anthropology emphasizes expression and how articulation is central to who we are. Castoriadis, by contrast, considers that every society institutes meaning in the form of social imaginary significations and that this web of meaning constitutes a world-horizon within which the subject is located and constituted. With its interest in embodied practices and language as an institution, Smith identifies Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology as a shared point of reference for these two theorists. However, they belong to a broader reorientation of thought during the 20th century, which Smith describes after Johann Arnason as involving a transition from the problem of knowledge to that of meaning. Significantly, Arnason’s disclosure of the interpretative dimension of Castoriadis’s thought underpins Smith’s analysis, since it alleviates the possible disjuncture between Castoriadis’s own negative characterization of hermeneutics and Taylor’s commitment to hermeneutics.</p>
<p>Smith details the different ways in which Taylor’s account of the self and Castoriadis’s elucidation of the subject illuminate the sources of autonomy in modernity. These two theorists’ concern with meaning correspondingly shapes their respective diagnoses of the ‘malaise’ and discontent that runs through modern social orders. Modern individuals possess a highly developed capacity for reflexivity and they are particularly concerned with how they relate themselves to what Taylor terms an ‘orienting framework’ and what Castoriadis conceives as the instituted social imaginary. Taylor argues, as is well known, that there is an integral connection between a sense of identity and an orientation to the good. Moral commitments have such significance for the self that they cannot simply be abstracted from and they involve ‘strong evaluations’. Castoriadis agrees that individual identity is formed through the acquisition of socially instituted meanings, but he is especially concerned with elucidating the attributes of an autonomous subject. That is, the subject that is capable of challenging the tendency of any social order to institute a closure of meaning and to limit human possibilities to its definition of reality. The social-historical conditioning of subjectivity is not the only factor that raises complications for autonomy; Castoriadis underlines the significance of the radical imaginary of the unconscious psyche. The radical imaginary is never fully assimilated to the instituted self and thereby enables creative innovations, yet it is also cathected to the individual’s socially fabricated identity and the extant social order’s significations.</p>
<p>Smith considers, then, that Castoriadis’s psychoanalytically informed theory of the subject is superior in one important respect: ‘Taylor’s theory of the narratively constructed self does not adequately account for the unsayable dimensions of the individual subject’ (p. 50). Of course, it is difficult to specify what the unsayable dimension of the individual is apart from certain experiences of the deficiencies of language. Smith adapts Hans Joas’s discussion of the unsayable in describing this dimension as drawing attention to a ‘gap between what is meant and what is said’ (p. 33). At the same time, Smith is reluctant to fully embrace Castoriadis’s interpretation of the unconscious, drawing on Marcel Gauchet’s arguments to reject the idea of the psyche’s monadic core in favour of a ‘more plural and more open conceptualisation of the unformed psyche’ (p. 111). In my opinion, this conception does not resolve the point of contention, but it is indicative of the general intent of <italic>Meaning, Subjectivity, Society</italic>. On the one hand, Castoriadis’s theory is presented as the more profound and original in its appreciation of the complications of modern subjectivity. Yet, on the other hand, Taylor’s writings do not exhibit the same depth of problems and their limitations are less consequential. Although Smith (p. 193) describes his approach as seeking to find the ‘middle ground’, the implication of this evaluation is a greater acceptance of Taylor’s framework of interpretation and analysis. For example, the following specification of how Smith’s argument proceeds makes this apparent:
<disp-quote>
<p>To put this another way, having followed Castoriadis’s rich articulation of how meaning is created in a field of social imaginary significations, we need now to turn back to Taylor for a better understanding of how meaning is for a subject, and is always something that matters to a subject. In this sense, qualitative distinctions operate at a mid-level between high level social imaginary significations and subject level identificatory actions. (p. 38)</p>
</disp-quote>
The main contention of Smith’s comparison is that Castoriadis’s vision of the project of autonomy needs to be reformulated. Smith proposes what he describes as a ‘relativizing’ of autonomy and Taylor’s writings are shown to provide certain pointers as to how this can be achieved. Castoriadis’s radical political commitments allegedly result in a flawed understanding of autonomy’s preconditions; Smith argues that relativizing autonomy entails qualifying or dispensing with revolutionary objectives, like the transcendence of capitalism and instituting participatory democracy. Although Smith largely regards these arguments for revolutionary changes as a political distortion of Castoriadis’s ontology, he suggests that theoretical weaknesses enable this misrepresentation of autonomy. Notably, Castoriadis lacks an adequate theory of action and his account of the imaginary institution would be enriched, in Smith’s opinion, by ‘Taylor’s approach to the tensions between different life orders, or fields – i.e., economics, politics, family, etc – and their competing value claims and “logics”’ (p. 158). While Smith’s criticisms possess considerable validity, it seems to me that something important may be lost in these arguments for downscaling the project of autonomy. There may simply be a greater potential for rethinking participatory democracy, for instance, than Smith’s conception of ‘relativizing’ autonomy permits. Further, Castoriadis’s positions arguably reflect a more developed and extended conception of heteronomy than that of Taylor, since his theory aims to disclose those sources of heteronomy that are unrecognized and to precisely question how an understanding of what is viable is constructed or instituted.</p>
<p>Despite the basic disagreement between the perspectives of Castoriadis and Taylor on religion, Smith demonstrates that it is possible to initiate a dialogue between them in this regard. Nonetheless, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Taylor’s Catholicism and Castoriadis’s secularism are probably incompatible. Smith appears to accept Taylor’s standpoint in arguing that religion’s articulation of the ‘perennial yearning for some meaning beyond human life is not likely to go away’ (p. 214) and he faults Castoriadis for failing to distinguish between religious experience (which is directed towards this yearning) and religion’s institutionalized historical manifestations. But this is the kind of distinction that Castoriadis’s theory is designed to contest. Smith rightly notes that Castoriadis and Taylor each subscribe to some version of the view that individual autonomy is conditional on the autonomy of others. It does not lead here, however, to an exploration of these theorists’ accounts of secondary associations, such as groups and movements, which lie between the general institution of society and the individual self. The perspective that Smith develops could, to be sure, assist in understanding secondary association’s collective projects and their modes of articulation.</p>
<p>
<italic>Meaning, Subjectivity, Society – Making Sense of Modernity </italic>will be of interest to those opposed to the contemporary trivialization of meaning and who believe that the questions of ethics and identity are inescapable. Smith provides an extended meditation on how two significant contemporary theorists have illuminated modern subjectivity and developed overlapping, as well as divergent, interpretations of modernity’s potentials. Like any intelligent and constructive comparison, Smith reveals how deficiencies in the arguments of one theorist can be corrected by formulations to be found in the work of the other. The limits to this potential for mutual instruction, however, derive from the sharp differences in Castoriadis’s and Taylor’s respective understandings of the implications of their projects. Taylor contends that human flourishing is connected to the moral horizon of meaning and instantiates life practices that would give expression to the good. Castoriadis does not so much disagree with this contention as provide instead a radically different assessment of the preconditions of autonomy. He suggests that the answers that have been given to the demands of meaning have been tied to the heteronomy of social institutions and that the project of autonomy involves answering the question of how we should live in a way that disregards what have been the predominant interpretations of the meaning of life.</p>
