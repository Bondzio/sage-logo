<abstract>
<p>Vietnam has become an attractive destination for foreign investors looking to maximize economic gains due to an increasingly young and educated population, a fast growing middle class, political stability, low labor cost, and loose operational standards. The inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) has brought many positive outcomes to Vietnam, but its dark side is beginning to emerge. This article discusses one of the negative aspects of FDI-driven economic development in Vietnam through a high-profile, ongoing scandal involving Vedan, a Taiwanese company caught in the poisoning of the Thi Vai river. The authors provide implications for policy making and future research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As a forewarning on the negative side effects of economic growth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0276146711423666">Layton and Grossbart (2006</xref>, 205) write: “Public policies that gloss over the whys (goals) of development can lead to poorly reasoned pursuits of unfocused economic growth, modernity, global involvement, and new technology that harm these institutions [conditions and rules for interactions and organizational entities in marketing systems] and other facets of society.” This purview is especially true for developing countries rushing to catch up with the wealthier developed nations by attracting foreign investors. In the competition for foreign capital, governments in developing countries might try to lure investors through tax breaks, cheap labor, and relaxed regulations, among other incentives. Researchers have suggested that FDI has many positive outcomes for the host countries, including increased production, employment, income, exports and imports, economic growth, balance of payment, and general welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0276146711423666">Balasubramanyam, Salisu, and Sapsford 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146711423666">Erdal and Tatoglu 2002</xref>). FDI also benefits the host countries through transfer of technology and know-how, labor and management training, and infrastructure development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146711423666">Borensztein, De Gregorio, and Lee 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0276146711423666">Nguyen 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0276146711423666">Peng and Beamish 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the quest for fast economic growth has many downsides as well. These include bribery and corruption, higher living costs, environmental pollution, and ecological destruction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0276146711423666">Robertson and Watson (2004)</xref> find that the more rapid the rate of changes in the inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) into a country, the higher the perceived level of corruption level in that country because an influx of foreign investment creates opportunities for local officials to profit from it. A rapid withdrawal or drop-off in foreign investment means fewer resources and foreign partners, and the competition for foreign monies creates an environment in which corruption may flourish.</p>
<p>Environmental pollution and ecological destruction on a large scale have also emerged as a serious side effect of economic growth. The lack of an efficient and enforced supervisory mechanism and legal framework, combined with rampant corruption and bribery, often leave societal constituents’ well-being and their habitat at the hand of companies, including foreign investors, whose economic interests sometimes overshadow their corporate social responsibilities. In other words, companies do not always put people first, and multiple stakeholders are not incorporated in their decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to grasp a more complete understanding of the problems related to FDI and economic growth in developing countries besides positive outcomes, it is imperative that the philosophy underlying foreign investors’ strategies (shareholders’ vs. stakeholders’ value maximization) and the roles played by multiple stakeholders in such countries be analyzed. This research addresses these issues through a case study of Vedan Vietnam, a subsidiary of Vedan International Ltd., a Taiwanese company specialized in the production of monosodium glutamate (MSG), lysine, and modified starch. In September 2008, Vedan Vietnam was caught red-handed in the poisoning and destruction of the ecological system along the Thi Vai river by illegally discharging untreated wastewater directly into the river (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0276146711423666">vietnambusiness.asia 2010</xref>). The pollution of the river has essentially driven tens of thousands of downstream farmers into extreme destitution as their only livelihood (fishery) was gravely affected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0276146711423666">Figure 1</xref>
). However, it was not until a class action was about to take place that Vedan agreed to compensate the affected farmers, two years after their illegal practice had been brought to light. This article also addresses a question that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy (2006</xref>, 172) ask: “When and under what circumstances do social criticisms of a particular marketing practice generate sufficient momentum to produce viable regulation of that action?”</p>

<p>At the turn of the twenty-first century, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0276146711423666">Shultz and Holbrook (1999</xref>, 218) warned that “environmentalism will be one of the greatest challenges in the twenty-first century” and recommended that marketers engage multiple stakeholders in the management of commonly shared natural resources and seek competitive advantages through legitimate green marketing, which involves business activities, services, and products that are commons-friendly. Their call has been proven particularly foresighted as the number of reports of environmental pollution related to economic growth in developing countries such as China has surged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0276146711423666">Cole, Elliott, and Zhang 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This article is organized as follows. First, the authors review the literature on the importance of FDI for economic growth and its impact in developing countries, followed by a discussion of the significance of stakeholders with regard to companies’ operations and sustainable growth. The authors then bring into focus Vietnam and the Vedan case with a discussion of the roles of multiple stakeholders informed by the normative perspective framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy 2006</xref>). The authors conclude with a proposal of implications for policy making with regard to FDI regulation in Vietnam and provide directions for future research.</p>

<title>The Significance and Impact of FDI in Developing Countries</title>
<p>A large body of research in economics and management has investigated the effect of FDI on economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0276146711423666">Balasubramanyam, Salisu, and Sapsford 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146711423666">Borensztein, De Gregorio, and Lee 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0276146711423666">Cole, Elliott, and Zhang 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146711423666">Erdal and Tatoglu 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0276146711423666">Kessing, Konrad, and Kotsogiannis 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0276146711423666">Nguyen 2009</xref>). By definition, foreign direct investment is “active ownership of a foreign company or of overseas manufacturing or marketing facilities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0276146711423666">Lamb, Hair, and McDaniel 2010</xref>, 65). A foreign company may make a direct foreign investment by acquiring an interest in an existing company in the host country or by building new facilities in the host country. Therefore, direct foreign investors have the greatest potential for rewards as well as risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0276146711423666">Lamb, Hair, and McDaniel 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The OLI (ownership, location, internalization) paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0276146711423666">Dunning 1988</xref>) has been suggested as providing guidance for FDI activities by multinational enterprises. Compared to other forms of international expansion such as exporting, franchising, and licensing, FDI holds three advantages: (1) ownership advantage (derived from firm-specific resources and capabilities); (2) internalization advantage (derived from reduction in transaction costs); and (3) location advantages (derived from country-specific attributes such as markets, resources, strategic assets, and efficiency; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0276146711423666">Habib and Zurawicki 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0276146711423666">Peng and Beamish 2008</xref>). In selecting a country for investment, corporations take into consideration a multitude of factors, including natural resources, types and availability of labor, proximity to markets, sociocultural and politicoeconomic climate, legal framework, infrastructure, market size, governance, competitive intensity, transportation costs, trade and investment regime, and openness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0276146711423666">Erdal and Tatoglu 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0276146711423666">Nguyen 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0276146711423666">Papadopoulos and Malhotra 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>However, there is a dearth of research that looks into the dark side of FDI, that is, the negative consequences that host countries have to face following their decision to open up the home markets to foreign investors. Few researchers have examined the impact of FDI on the environment and ecosystem. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0276146711423666">Yu (2009)</xref> shows that three decades of economic development and foreign investment in the Pearl River Delta region have turned the region into a “world factory” with serious water and air pollution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0276146711423666">Nguyen and Amin (2002)</xref> find that FDI results in environmental degradation in Hanoi, Vietnam. When operating overseas, foreign investors often are not under the direct regulatory supervision of their home governments and therefore it is up to them to decide whether to follow the regulations set out in their home countries or abide by rules and regulations in the host countries, in which the pressure for economic growth can lead to relaxed laws and loosened supervision. These characteristics allow foreign investors more leeway in their business practices and whether they choose to follow an agency or stakeholder approach has critical consequences on the well-being of the local communities and society, as each approach places economic and societal interests at different levels of priority.</p>

<title>Agency and Stakeholder Theories</title>
<p>In their seminal article on marketing ethics and social responsibilities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy (2006)</xref> contend that every transaction has an impact on society and therefore ethical marketers must evaluate not only the managerial appropriateness of what they do but also the ethics of their marketing activities. That marketing managers are sometimes preoccupied with the effectiveness and efficiency of their marketing practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy 2006</xref>) reflects an approach advocated by <italic>agency theory</italic>, which places stockholders at the center of all marketing activities. According to <italic>agency theory</italic>, a company’s management acts solely as an agent for stockholders and their responsibility is to maximize stockholders’ return on investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy 2006</xref>). This profit-centric approach places ethical actions at a subordinate level compared to economic return and often regards ethics as discretionary and costly rather than desirable and rewarding in the long term.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to <italic>agency theory</italic> is <italic>stakeholder theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146711423666">Freeman 1984</xref>), which argues that companies are responsible for not only making money but also to other constituents including their employees, collaborators, the local communities, and society. <italic>Stakeholder theory</italic> elevates a firm’s ethical considerations to a new height far exceeding the minimal legal requirements observed in an <italic>agency</italic> approach and illustrates the essence of corporate social responsibilities, as marketing organizations operate in and on behalf of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy 2006</xref>). Companies that embrace a <italic>stakeholder</italic> approach recognize the importance of multiple stakeholders and incorporate them in their decision-making process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy (1993)</xref> define a stakeholder as any group or individual who can affect or is affected by an organization’s achievement of its objectives. By this definition, a firm’s stakeholders include investors, customers, employees, collaborators (suppliers and distributors), host communities, and the general public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy 2006</xref>). Applying the stakeholder approach to its operations, a firm will uphold five essential ethical principles: (1) nonmalfeasance; (2) nondeception; (3) protection of vulnerable market segments; (4) distributive justice; and (5) stewardship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Normative Perspectives for Ethical and Socially Responsible Marketing</title>
<p>Synthesizing a rich body of literature investigating the effects of ethical considerations and practices on firms’ operations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy (2006)</xref> propose a set of normative perspectives that act as guidelines for marketers. Their framework consists of seven basic perspectives that are helpful taken individually as well as a whole because each perspective is connected with and informs other perspectives in creating a complete understanding of ethics and ethical behaviors in marketing. At the heart of this framework is the notion (or basic perspective) that ethical marketing puts people first. This basic perspective is connected with and influences the other perspectives that are meant to help elevate ethical practices within organizations (for a detailed discussion of the basic perspectives, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy 2006</xref>). In essence, the framework proposes a connective and holistic approach to the highest levels of ethical marketing.</p>
<p>In this article, the authors examine the consequences (both to the firm itself and the local communities) when the firm deviates from the most crucial perspective (ethical marketing puts people first) of the framework proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy (2006)</xref>, as well as the factors and forces that bring to attention the impact of such deviation, and those that facilitate it. From their findings, the authors make a set of recommendations for more effective regulation of FDI, thereby attenuating its negative effects (specifically, environmental pollution and ecological destruction) in developing countries.</p>

<p>The following sections provide information on Vietnam’s country background, Vedan International (Holdings) Ltd., Vedan Vietnam, and the methods of inquiry that the authors conducted, which include media coverage and discussion forum observation, site visits, interviews, and surveys.</p>
<sec id="section7-0276146711423666">
<title>Country Background</title>
<p>Located in Southeast Asia, Vietnam has a total area of 331,210 square kilometers with a population of approximately 89.5 million people at 1.1 percent annual growth rate (
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146711423666">
<italic>CIA World Factbook</italic> 2010</xref>). Hanoi, the capital city, is the cultural and political center with a heavy French influence while Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) is the economic hub. After the reunification in April 1975, the Vietnamese government implemented a centrally planned economy modeled after the Soviet Union with private trade reduced to a minimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0276146711423666">Maruyama and Le 2007</xref>). This, combined with an economic embargo imposed by the United States, the ravages from decades of war, and especially the loss of economic assistance from the Soviet Bloc, caused the country to sink deeply into poverty.</p>
<p>In 1986, Vietnamese leaders took a dramatic action (<italic>DoiMoi—</italic>renovation) to partially open up the economy through privatization of state-owned enterprises, allowance of private businesses, and attraction of FDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0276146711423666">Shultz 2007</xref>). Key elements of <italic>DoiMoi</italic> include: (1) agricultural land reform that allowed individuals and families long term rights to use land; (2) price liberalization to eliminate the “two price” system and the removal of barriers to internal trade; (3) facilitation of a modern banking system; (4) liberalization of foreign investment and international trade; (5) shift toward a market determined exchange system; (6) reform of the State Owned Enterprise (SOE) system—changing the relationship between SOEs and the budget, reforming ownership structures; (7) creation of a legal framework for the corporate sector; and (8) government budget reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0276146711423666">AUSAID 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the implementation of <italic>DoiMoi</italic>, Vietnam has experienced a level of economic growth few countries in the world could rival, averaging an annual rate of 8 percent between 2003 and 2007 and 6 percent between 2008 and 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0276146711423666">World Bank 2010</xref>). By 2009, Vietnam’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (purchasing power parity) had risen to $2,900 (CIA <italic>World Factbook</italic> 2010) with FDI accounting for 42.5 percent of the country’s GDP. Total foreign investment disbursement in Vietnam reached $10 billion by the end of 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0276146711423666">Ministry of Planning and Investment 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Fast economic growth has brought about many positive changes in the lives of the Vietnamese people. The percentage of population below the poverty line has decreased sharply from 58 percent in 1993 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0276146711423666">AUSAID 2010</xref>) to 12.3 percent by 2009 (CIA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146711423666">
<italic>World Factbook</italic> 2010</xref>), and household income has improved greatly. However, fast economic development has also created numerous undesirable outcomes. Land price in Vietnam has soared over the last few years, the costs of medications have become unaffordable to many Vietnamese people, food safety (or lack thereof) has spun out of control, and most seriously, environmental pollution has risen to a level not too far behind the world’s worst cases such as China and Mexico. The Vedan case that is examined here is the first, and certainly not last, that involves a foreign investor inflicting the largest hitherto adverse impact on the environment in Vietnam and therefore has received an unprecedented amount of media attention, large-scale boycott, and almost a class action.</p>

<title>Vedan International (Holdings) Ltd.</title>
<p>Sheng-Po Yang and his brothers founded Ve Cheng Food in Taichung County, Taiwan, in 1954 and Vedan was officially launched in 1970. As a leader in the Taiwanese amino acid industry, Vedan’s product portfolio includes amino acid products (MSG, glutamic acid or GA, and lysine), starch products (native starch, modified starch, and glucose syrup), specialty chemical products (caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, and hypochlorite), and several new products (PGA hydrogel, PGA new product, and Y-PGA hydrogel). Vedan has production facilities in Vietnam and China manufacturing and selling fermentation-based food additives, biochemical products, and cassava starch-based industrial products including MSG (76.8 percent of total revenues), modified starch (4.8 percent), GA (3.9 percent), lysine (0.3 percent), seasoning (0.9 percent), specialty chemicals (5.3 percent), fertilizer (4.0 percent), and others (4.0 percent). Vietnam is the largest segment accounting for 52.1 percent of Vedan’s total revenues, followed by Japan (19.5 percent), China (18.9 percent), ASEAN countries (4.9 percent), and other regions (4.6 percent). Total revenues in 2009 and 2008 were $289.137 million and $348.557 million, respectively. The company had a total of 3,703 employees as of December 31, 2009, of whom 3,058 were employed by subsidiaries in Vietnam (82.5 percent), 630 in China (17 percent), and 15 in Taiwan (.05 percent; vedaninternational.com 2010a).</p>

<title>Vedan (Vietnam) Enterprise Corporation Ltd.</title>
<p>As early as the 1970s, Vedan MSG was one of the kitchen staples in many middle-class Vietnamese households and a valued gift during <italic>Tet</italic> (lunar New Year). In August 1991, Vedan Vietnam Ltd. was established in accordance with investment permit No. 171A/GP issued by the State Committee for Cooperation and Investment (now Ministry of Planning and Investment), making Vedan one of the first foreign investors to enter Vietnam even prior to the lifting of the US trade embargo in 1993. Between August 1991 and August 1994, Vedan Vietnam started the design and construction of its integrated production facilities at the Phuoc Thai complex. The first Vedan plant in Vietnam was opened in August 1994 and to date Vedan Vietnam has a total investment of $416.2 million over a total gross area of 2,053,420 square meters (22.1 million square feet). The production capacities of Vedan’s four plants in Vietnam are as follows: 148,000 tons of GA and MSG, 18,000 tons lysine, 40,000 tons modified starch, 216,000 tons native cassava starch, 140,000 tons glucose syrup, 60,000 tons caustic soda, and 170,000 tons hydrochloric acid. The Vietnam MSG plant has the largest MSG production capacity in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0276146711423666">vedaninternational.com 2010b</xref>). Vietnam has for long been Vedan’s largest market with steady growth rates of 9.6 percent in 2005, 9.1 percent in 2006, and 5.2 percent in 2007. Forty-five percent of Vedan Vietnam’s output is exported, over 40 percent is sold to domestic food processors, and less than 15 percent is sold at retail outlets with approximately 7 percent at supermarkets.</p>
<p>Vedan’s Phuoc Thai and Phuoc Long complexes were accredited ISO certifications by Bureau Veritas Quality International in 1999 and 2000. In December 2002, the company won the National Quality award from the Ministry of Science and Technology of Vietnam. In addition, the company was granted the “Outstanding tax payer in Vietnam” award in May 2002, March 2004, and January 2005 by the Ministry of Finance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0276146711423666">vedaninternational.com 2010c</xref>).</p>

<title>Methods of Inquiry</title>
<p>The authors reviewed over 200 articles on Vietnamese popular media including Web portals and newspapers (both in English and Vietnamese) from September 2008 to August 2010. In addition, the authors accessed Vedan’s corporate Web sites (Vedan Taiwan, Vedan International, and Vedan Vietnam) on many occasions to collect data on the company’s operations as well as corporate philosophy and mission statement. The authors also spent over twenty hours visiting the local wet markets and supermarkets in Dong Nai, Vung Tau, and Ho Chi Minh City, talking to shop owners, as well as shoppers that were present when the authors visited. One researcher also conducted a 45-minute, in-depth interview with the head of a large, popular supermarket chain in Ho Chi Minh City. Additionally, the authors conducted a short survey with sixty-five people in Vung Tau, Dong Nai, and Ho Chi Minh City through a snowballing technique with three simple questions: (1) What brand of MSG do you currently use in your household? (2) How do you feel about Vedan? and (3) If Vedan agrees to compensate affected farmers in full, would you consider buying Vedan products again? These questions were written in Vietnamese.</p>

<title>The Poisoning of the Thi Vai River</title>
<p>As early as late 1994, upon receipt of complaints from affected farmers, the Vietnamese government requested the Dong Nai Service of Science, Technology, and Environment to examine the pollution of the Thi Vai river by Vedan Vietnam. From May to November 2004, the Service took twenty-six samples of Vedan’s wastewater and every sample showed that the pollution level was excessive, causing the Service to demand that Vedan take prompt measures to reduce the pollution level, and this request was not heeded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0276146711423666">
<italic>TuoiTre Online</italic> 2010a</xref>). However, in December 2004, just one month later, the director of the Service requested that Vedan be awarded with an honor for having passed pollution tests by Vietnamese B standards despite having polluted the Thi Vai river from 1994 to 1999.</p>
<p>After tests conducted on July 30, 2007, showed that the pollution in the Thi Vai river had again exceeded acceptable levels, Vedan was warned of potential penalties. Five months later, Dong Nai Province’s Department of Water Resource Management granted a permit allowing Vedan to discharge treated wastewater into the Thi Vai river (
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0276146711423666">
<italic>Dan Tri Online</italic> 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>On September 13, 2008, after months of undercover investigation, a special taskforce from the Environmental Protection Department of Vietnam concluded that Vedan Vietnam had been discharging untreated wastewater directly into the Thi Vai river. In the days that followed, the taskforce uncovered a sophisticated 800-meter long underground system that was well covered by another legitimate yet hardly functional decoy system. Vedan’s discharge system was managed by eight employees, five of whom were Vietnamese and three were Taiwanese. However, only two Taiwanese nationals working at the plant had access to the system. Vedan’s plant was strictly guarded by the company’s security personnel and the Vietnamese environment police investigators had to disguise as night fishermen to conduct their missions (
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0276146711423666">
<italic>Dan Tri Online</italic> 2010b</xref>). In meetings with the investigators, Vedan repeatedly refused to provide the plant’s blueprints despite admitting to its wrongdoings. September 20–23, 2008, investigators excavated the underground system and found new evidence showing that Vedan was trying to cover up their acts by fixing the underground system to look as if no wastewater ran through it. On September 26, 2008, investigators concluded that Vedan Vietnam had been polluting the Thi Vai river for fourteen years by directly discharging untreated wastewater into the river at a rate of 105,600 cubic meters per month. Additionally, the company had been evading mandatory environmental fees totaling $7.7 million. In water samples taken from the Thi Vai river, scientists found unusually high traces of heavy metals such as zinc, lead, and mercury. Coliform tests (a commonly used bacterial indicator of sanitary quality of foods and water) revealed that the coliform level in the Thi Vai river exceeded acceptable levels by hundreds of times (
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0276146711423666">
<italic>Dan Tri Online</italic> 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>In their defense, Vedan Vietnam characterized the illegal wastewater discharge as operational negligence driven by production expansion to meet market demand. In early October, 2008, the Vietnamese government ruled that Vedan Vietnam must pay a $16,000 fine and that a $7,713,000 accrued environmental fee owed by the company must be paid between 2008 and 2009. Since the ruling Vedan has taken remedial measures, including upgrading the three sets of wastewater treatment equipment at the plant, drawing up plans to install two new sets of wastewater treatment equipment and additional recycling facilities including special condensation equipment and a solid fertilizer plant. These new investments cost Vedan approximately $31 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0276146711423666">vedaninternational.com 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the uncovering of the underground discharge system, numerous meetings have been held between Vedan Vietnam and authorities at the communal, provincial, municipal, and ministerial levels in order to reach a satisfactory compensation package that Vedan is mandated to pay to the affected residents in the three provinces of Ba Ria—Vung Tau, Dong Nai, and Ho Chi Minh City. However, Vedan has challenged the Vietnamese authorities to show evidence regarding the adverse impacts of its plant’s untreated wastewater on the livelihood of local residents as well as the Thi Vai river’s ecosystem. Vedan argued that the claims had no ground because the claimants had no operation licenses or that the claim period had expired.</p>
<p>Backed by results of tests conducted by Vietnam’s top environmental experts, farmers in Dong Nai, Ba Ria–Vung Tau, and Ho Chi Minh City have demanded payment of VND119.6 billion ($6.26 million), VND53.6 billion ($2.8 million), and VND45.74 billion ($2.4 million), respectively (
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0276146711423666">
<italic>ThanhNien News</italic> 2010a</xref>). In their response, Vedan offered to pay a fraction of the requested amounts and worded the package as subsidies to maintain good relationship with the communities as well as honor its corporate social responsibility. The company initially started at VND7 billion to Dong Nai, then raised to VND15 billion, and later to VND30 billion. For Ba Ria–Vung Tau, the package was offered at VND6 billion and later raised to VND10 billion. Farmers in Ho Chi Minh City were offered VND7 billion initially, then VND12 billion, and later VND16 billion. Frustrated, governmental and provincial officials called for a class action by the affected residents against the Taiwanese polluter. By early August 2010, over 5,000 individual petitions have been filed to local People’s Courts in all three provinces (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0276146711423666">Figure 2</xref>
). Facing what was potentially the most high-profile lawsuit against a foreign investor in Vietnam, Vedan finally backed down. On August 17, 2010, Vedan agreed to an out-of-court payout of VND210 billion ($10.7 million) to farmers in the three affected provinces to be paid in two installments. A contractual agreement was inked between Vedan and local authorities documenting the payout amount and schedule, prompting a withdrawal of petitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0276146711423666">

<title>Stakeholders’ Reactions</title>
<sec id="section14-0276146711423666">
<title>Vedan’s competitors</title>
<p>There are five major brands of MSG in the Vietnamese market: Ajinomoto, A-one, Vedan, Miwon, and Orsan. In addition, there is a large amount of unbranded MSG illegally imported from China, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0276146711423666">
<italic>TuoiTre Online</italic> 2011a</xref>). Japan’s Ajinomoto has the lion share of the market and targets households with 80 percent of its output sold at retail outlets. So far all of Vedan’s competitors have remained silent. The authors believe there are a number of reasons. Approximately 85 percent of Vedan’s output is either exported or sold to Vietnamese food processors who will likely continue to buy from Vedan because of its low price. As such, Vedan’s share of the retail market is rather small. In addition, Vedan’s current competitors might not have the capacity to meet increased demands should they gain additional market share from Vedan. Besides, large quantities of illegally imported MSG from China, Laos, and Cambodia pose serious threats to the above-mentioned MSG manufacturers (
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0276146711423666">
<italic>Cong AnNhan Dan</italic> 2009</xref>). Attacking Vedan might pave the wave for illegally imported MSG to increase market share through Vedan’s loss.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0276146711423666">
<title>Corporate customers</title>
<p>So far no Vietnamese food processor has joined the fight against Vedan. Waste treatment is a major financial investment not only for Vedan and its competitors but also for the food processors themselves. Vedan sells seasoning and food enhancers at an affordable price, making it an amiable supplier to food processors. Boycotting Vedan creates an impasse for such food processors, as finding a new supplier who could match Vedan is difficult because most suppliers have long-term contracts with food processors. Importing might not be a viable option because of unstable supply, high import fees, and uncertain delivery dates.</p>
<p>It is quite likely that most business customers will continue to purchase from Vedan, helping the polluter secure at least 40 percent of its output in the Vietnamese market. Besides, Vedan’s exports to foreign markets are not likely to suffer from the negative publicity in Vietnam. All in all, Vedan will be able to maintain at least 85 percent of its production capacity before the dust settles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0276146711423666">
<title>Distributors</title>
<p>Since the uncovering of the Vedan case in September 2008, many supermarkets in Vietnam have boycotted the polluter to show their support for the affected farmers and punishment against unjust and illegal business practices. However, for some supermarkets, the reason behind their decision to take Vedan products off the shelf might be low sales. For example, at Big C, MSG is one of approximately 50,000 products sold at the company’s supermarkets and accounts for a very small share of the company’s sales. Similarly, at Fivimart, Vedan’s sales are minute in comparison to other brands such as Ajinomoto and Miwon. As of late 2010, some supermarket chains have resumed selling Vedan products, citing product quality and affordability as the major driver of their decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0276146711423666">
<italic>Saigon TiepThi</italic> 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>All seven large distributors in Vung Tau and Ho Chi Minh City continue to sell Vedan products for a very simple reason: Vedan is still the number one choice for restaurants, food courts, and food processors. The authors found that compared to other brands, Vedan products are cheaper by VND2,000/kg (5 cents/lb) and has become even cheaper due to Vedan’s aggressive promotion. To wholesalers, selling Vedan products not only secures their source of supply but also improves profit margin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0276146711423666">
<title>Small retailers</title>
<p>Unlike large supermarkets and wholesalers, small independent retailers (owners of street-front shops, wet market stalls, and mom-and-pop shops) showed strong support for the affected farmers and abhorrence for the Taiwanese company (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0276146711423666">Figure 4</xref>
). One researcher visited several major wet markets in Vung Tau and Ho Chi Minh City in August 2010 and found no signs of Vedan products on the shelf. Shop owners stated that boycotting Vedan was necessary as such action sent a strong message that corporate social responsibility is demanded from all companies doing business in Vietnam, domestic and foreign alike.</p>

<p>In Dong Nai, shop owners told the authors they would not sell Vedan products in the future. However, when asked what they would do if Vedan agreed to fully compensate affected farmers, about half of the respondents said they would consider giving the Taiwanese company a second chance. The other half remained skeptical as to whether Vedan would properly treat its wastewater or continue polluting the environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0276146711423666">
<title>Consumers</title>
<p>Economic growth has greatly improved household income among Vietnamese consumers and they have become more aware of their choices’ impact on a company’s operation. Discussion forums calling for a large-scale boycott against Vedan attracted high Web traffic and garnered unified support (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.webtretho.com/forum/archive/t-533622.html">http://www.webtretho.com/forum/archive/t-533622.html</ext-link>). One of the topics that drew the highest number of responses was whether Vietnam is a dumping ground for foreign investors. When their plants are built in other countries with stricter environmental standards, waste treatment costs will reduce profit margins. In Vietnam, such costs are kept at the lowest possible level, partly because of inadequate and inefficient environmental regulation policies and the general public’s low awareness of environmental pollution effects, and partly because the executive arms of environmental protection have been ineffective for various reasons. Many participants expressed their skepticism at the effectiveness of the measures taken by concerned authorities and governmental agencies.</p>
<p>In early August 2010, the authors surveyed sixty-five people in Ho Chi Minh City, Vung Tau, and Dong Nai with three simple questions. Respondents were asked which brand of MSG they used at home, whether they would continue using Vedan products and why, and how they felt about the Taiwanese company. Results show that at the time of the survey, none of the respondents were using Vedan in home cooking, 60 percent would not use Vedan products even if the company had agreed to fully compensate local residents, 26 percent would buy Vedan products again, and 14 percent were undecided. When asked how they felt about Vedan, about 67 percent of the respondents said they strongly disliked Vedan and boycotted the company’s products to support downstream farmers.</p>

<title>Production and sales</title>
<p>According to figures reported on Vedan’s Web site, due to the temporary cut in the production of MSG, lysine, and starch at the Vietnam plant in the fourth quarter of 2008, Vedan’s turnover in 2009 in all markets totaled $289.1 million, down by $59.4 million or 17 percent from the previous year. Specifically by product category, MSG sales were down by 6.4 percent or $15.2 million, lysine 95 percent or $19.5 million, GA 41.6 percent or $8.1 million, and modified starch 54.3 percent or $16.5 million. However, due to an increase in the price of MSG and a prosperous consumer market in Vietnam, the company’s gross profit grew by 10.6 percent or $6.8 million with a net profit margin of 6.2 percent compared to 2008. In the Vietnamese market, Vedan recorded a slight growth of 1.1 percent or $1.7 million, mostly from an increase in sales of MSG, despite a decline of 67.7 percent in GA sales and 98.7 percent in lysine sales. Vedan’s total revenue in Vietnam in 2009 was $150.5 million, or 52 percent of the company’s total turnover, up from 42.7 percent in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0276146711423666">vedaninternational.com 2010d</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>With hundreds of industrial parks and export processing zones, thousands of factories and plants, and an ineffective legal framework, the environment in Vietnam is being heavily polluted, threatening the well-being of tens of millions of people. The Vedan case provides important implications for policy makers and foreign investors not only in Vietnam but also other developing countries. The lessons learned from this case as applied to the regulation of foreign investment activities as well as issues in ethical decision making by foreign investors in Vietnam will be discussed in the sections that follow.</p>
<sec id="section26-0276146711423666">
<title>Putting People First</title>
<p>When doing business overseas, especially in developing and transitioning economies where there is often a lack of strict and effective legal frameworks, multinational corporations are faced with a difficult decision: whether to conform to their home countries’ business practices or to adapt to those of the host countries. The authors believe that despite differences rooted in cultural and sociopolitical structures among nations, companies must conduct ethical practices on the premises of <italic>stakeholder theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146711423666">Freeman 1984</xref>) and their outcomes need to be evaluated in terms of fairness and rightness on all entities in the marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy 2006</xref>). The normative perspective framework proposed by Laczniak and Murphy provides a holistic, comprehensive guideline for better ethical marketing practices, and the nexus of the framework is the perspective that “marketing puts people first.” It should be understood that people are the focus of all marketing activities, be they at home or abroad, and divergence from this principle has long-term consequences, including an ecological disaster as discussed in this case.</p>
<p>In its home country, Taiwan, Vedan portrays the image of a responsible corporate citizen through its “commitment to never overlook the importance of giving back to the community” in addition to developing its business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0276146711423666">vedan.com 2010a</xref>). For instance, the Vedan Culture and Education Foundation was established to actively participate in and to promote public activities. In addition to an emphasis on the promotion of public education, literature and arts, the foundation has recently begun focusing on advocating public health through the holding of the annual “More Water Cup Marathon” and other public sporting events encouraging the Taiwanese public to engage more actively in exercise and fitness programs to achieve physical well-being. The company’s management philosophy reads:<disp-quote>
<p>With a management philosophy that focuses on innovation, professionalism, modesty, and excellence, Vedan is an environmental-conscious, customer-oriented and employee-caring company that makes every effort to seek breakthroughs and innovations, to maintain our active corporate energy, superb production quality, and outstanding customer service. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0276146711423666">vedan.com 2010b</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>This philosophy is reflected in the company’s vision “Every product labeled with Vedan is infused with a fine, sophisticated, and reliable touch from our employees, as well as our thoughtfulness towards people, our respect towards nature, and our commitment towards health” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0276146711423666">vedan.com 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what Vedan shows on its Web site as the guiding light for its operations at home is not what was practiced by Vedan Vietnam. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0276146711423666">Kolk and van Tulder(2010)</xref> have noted, even though many multinationals subscribe to the triple P (People, Planet, and Profit) paradigm and sustainable development, it is debatable whether this commitment is mere window dressing and public relations or a true commitment and realized strategy, especially when it involves external stakeholders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0276146711423666">Nill (2003</xref>, 90) suggests that “difference in business customs and ethical norms may not only be the result of cultural differences or differences in economic development but also the outcome of marketers’ rational pursuit of economic self-interest, which is often to the detriment of all market participants.” His point is well proven in this case. The motive behind Vedan’s decision to discharge untreated wastewater into the Thi Vai river is increased shareholder value through lower operational costs and higher profits. Its intentions are clear, and the company must be responsible for the consequences of its actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy 2006</xref>). Despite irrefutable evidence, Vedan stood its ground. What happened was merely operational negligence caused by production expansion to meet increasing market demand. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy (2006)</xref> see such tactics as rationalized ex post facto by companies in a manner that shields them from responsibility for their wrongdoings.</p>
<p>In accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy (2006)</xref>, the authors believe that companies should adopt a <italic>stakeholder</italic> approach not only in their home countries but also in the host countries. More importantly, the authors believe that foreign investors should not be left alone to decide whether to adopt an <italic>agency</italic> or <italic>stakeholder</italic> approach and it is the responsibilities of all stakeholders to ensure ethical business practices are being conducted by the companies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0276146711423666">Jamali and Mirshak (2007)</xref> contend that weak demand for corporate social responsibility adoption, limited corporate social responsibility advocacy and awareness, limited regulatory capacity, and nascent community organizations severely attune the private sector’s motivation to engage in corporate social responsibility in developing countries. Their argument proves to be especially valid in the Vedan case. Developing countries in general and Vietnam in particular cannot and should not overlook the supervision of foreign investors operating in their markets as such negligence can result in long-term devastating effects on the ecosystem such as the poisoning of the Thi Vai river.</p>

<title>Foreign Investment Regulation</title>
<p>The authors believe that the local authorities and Vietnam’s Ministry of Resources and Environment should take full responsibility to the Vietnamese public for the killing of the Thi Vai river. Vedan was an exemplary success of the open door policy attracting foreign investors to Vietnam. Vedan entered Vietnam as early as 1991, even before the US trade embargo on Vietnam was lifted, and started operating its first production facilities in 1994. Over the course of fourteen years (until the case was uncovered in 2008), the Vietnam plant had become Vedan’s largest MSG manufacturing plant in the world. Vedan received many benefits offered to a major investor, such as tax breaks, low rent, and loose supervision from governing authorities. In Vietnam, Vedan has been fined four times for violation of environmental standards and by Vietnamese laws, three strikes means shutdown. In 1997, environmental scientists conducted several tests and concluded that the segment of the Thi Vai river where Vedan’s plant is located was heavily polluted. However, there was no penalty or investigation, because Vedan was a major purchaser of raw materials (cassava) grown by local farmers. After having repeatedly violated Vietnamese environmental standards, on April 23, 2008, Vedan still received a five-year permit from the Ministry of Resources and Environment to discharge wastewater into the Thi Vai river. In October 2009, Vedan Vietnam received the “2009 Product Safety for the Community’s Health” award granted by the Ho Chi Minh City branch office of the Ministry of Science and Technology in collaboration with Natusi, a quality and branding consultancy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0276146711423666">Figure 5</xref>
). This award was later revoked by said authority, citing an “administrative” error (

<p>Following the uncovering of the illegal discharge, the general public and media in Vietnam called for the closure of the Vedan plant and repossession of Vedan’s profits according to stipulations in the Law on Competition of Vietnam. However, it is the government and not the public or media that makes decisions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0276146711423666">Layton and Grossbart (2006)</xref> argue that judgments about the potential risks of marketing systems (such as economic, physical, ecological, and social) affect governmental decisions on marketing systems, and understanding their moral and ethical dimensions is a challenge. Closing down the Vedan plant in Vietnam would drive over 3,000 Vietnamese employees out of work, and the ripples of such effect would undoubtedly be felt by their families and the local communities.</p>
<p>In recent years, especially after Vietnam became the 150th member of the World Trade Organization in January 2007, the Vietnamese government has advocated the decentralization of administrative duties and this move has been hailed with enthusiasm from domestic and foreign enterprises. However, the negative effects of decentralization did not become disturbingly prominent until the exposure of the Vedan case. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0276146711423666">Kessing, Konrad, and Kotsogiannis (2007)</xref> show that the vertical dimension of economic decentralization, measured by the number of government tiers in the host country, has a negative impact on the inflow of FDI into the host country. The multiple layers of governance create redundancy and bureaucracy, which may deter investment efficiencies. In the case reported here, the multiple layers of communal, provincial, and ministerial governance in Vietnam stalled the timely reaction to and resolution of the Vedan case. Instead of working together, local authorities and the Ministry of Resources and Environment kept pointing fingers at each other and evaded responsibility. The Minister of Resources and Environment was quoted as saying:<disp-quote>
<p>Vedan is a very complicated case. The Ministry is only responsible for assessing the level of pollution that Vedan created. The local authorities and other agencies in agriculture, healthcare, as well as People’s Committees and Farmers’ Associations, are responsible for evaluating the adverse impacts on agricultural production and people’s well-being. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0276146711423666">Dan Tri Online 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>The consequence of their lack of accountability is the time it has taken to resolve the case: over two years.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that the Ministry of Planning and Investment of Vietnam and concerned governmental agencies should review regulations and standards applicable to the granting of FDI permits in Vietnam. The Law on Foreign Investment in Vietnam was written in 1987 and has been revised since then, but in order to prevent future violations similar to the Vedan case, stricter stipulations and standards need to be institutionalized, especially with regard to environmental and labor issues. Vietnam’s economy has consistently achieved impressive growth over the last decade and attracted a large amount of FDI, thus the bar on such investment needs to be raised. Stricter regulations may discourage investors with a short-term profit motive but will ensure long-term economic growth and societal well-being.</p>
<p>The Vedan case is the first to be uncovered, and the authors believe it is not the last. With 103 industrial parks and export processing zones discharging wastewater directly into the Dong Nai river basin, water pollution in the basin has been alarmingly high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0276146711423666">
<italic>TuoiTre Online</italic> 2011b</xref>). Regular assessment and inspection should be conducted in order to ensure environmental standards are being met at export processing zones and industrial parks, as well as factories and plants. In addition, violations of such standards should be swiftly and properly dealt with. Punitive damages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0276146711423666">Morgan and Stoltman 1992</xref>) should be strictly enforced to send a strong message that illegal business practices are not tolerated in Vietnam and the consequences are much more costly in the long term than the short-term profit they bring. Competitive advantage through low-cost labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0276146711423666">Porter 1990</xref>) and lower operating standards is not sustainable and the Vietnamese government should take actions before the adverse impacts of economic development such as the killing of the Thi Vai river become irreversible.</p>

<title>Stakeholders’ Voice</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0276146711423666">Freeman (1984</xref>, 46) defines stakeholders as “any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization’s objectives.” Historically, the focus of a firm’s stakeholder group has switched from investors (in the 1950s) to employees (1960s) to consumers (1970s) to human beings (1980s and 1990s; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0276146711423666">Prothero 1990</xref>). The engagement of multiple stakeholders in dialogues to resolve the dilemmas facing the commons can result in mutually beneficial solutions and more commons-friendly marketing activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0276146711423666">Shultz and Holbrook 1999)</xref>. The Vedan case highlights the importance of the voice of the stakeholders in a developing country context.</p>
<p>First of all, it is the prospect of a class action by the affected downstream communities that forced Vedan to finally back down. The vast majority of the affected residents are poor farmers who traditionally do not have voice in Vietnam due to a number of reasons. They live in small communes and villages with little access to the media, burdened with the brunt of the quotidian struggle to make a living. Most of them have no formal education, no access to legal assistance, and more importantly, they have been <italic>used to</italic> having no voice at all. These farmers are economically, socially, and politically disadvantaged. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0276146711423666">Prothero, McDonagh, and Dobscha (2010)</xref> emphasize the importance of a new form of business where all relevant stakeholders are given voice, especially from those who are most affected by mass production and consumption, such as workers in developing countries and communities affected by pollution.</p>
<p>The farmers in the three affected provinces of Ba Ria—Vung Tau, Dong Nai, and Ho Chi Minh City are represented by their Farmers’ Associations, but it is not clear whether these associations indeed represented the voice of their members. For example, before Vedan finally backed down and agreed to pay Dong Nai farmers VND120 billion ($6.2 million) as requested by the People’s Committee of Dong Nai, the Farmers’ Association of Dong Nai had already agreed to a VND15 billion compensation package offered by Vedan, citing a vote from a meeting held with 104 farmers, or 10 percent of the number of claimants from Dong Nai Province, in which representatives from the Farmers’ Association overwhelmed the farmers with presumably complicated legal procedures should they decide not to accept Vedan’s offer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0276146711423666">
<italic>Nguoi Lao Dong</italic> 2010a</xref>). It is not our intention to discuss the motive behind this seemingly confusing move but we believe that local authorities should work more closely with their constituents to represent them in any conflicts involving companies, domestic and foreign alike. Stakeholder groups will effectively mobilize against firms when they are aware, willing, and capable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0276146711423666">Rowley and Berman 2000</xref>). In the Vedan case, the local residents are aware of the destructive effects of the Vedan plant on the Thi Vai river and their livelihood, and are willing to seek justice, but they would not have been capable of doing so without the help of the media, the people’s committees, and lawyers.</p>
<p>Another force that has recently gained power as Vietnam opened up its retail market to foreign enterprises is Vietnamese consumers. Traditionally, Vietnamese consumers do not have power the way Western consumers do and consumer watchdogs are still nascent in the Vietnamese market. This is the consequence of a centrally planned economy in which goods were always scarce and consumers were fortunate enough to get what they needed. However, Vietnamese consumers now have a plethora of choices and therefore they should leverage their power to establish justice in the marketplace. Consumer boycott is a new concept in Vietnam, especially in the rural areas where consumers are financially, socially, and politically disadvantaged. In this context, the media play a particularly pivotal role in the protection of consumer rights because it can help unite consumers in their fight against illegal and immoral corporate practices.</p>
<p>Researchers have suggested that stakeholder group members often have heterogeneous interests that impede their ability to set actionable priorities and mobilize for collective actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0276146711423666">Wolfe and Putler 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0276146711423666">Laczniak and Murphy (2006)</xref> point out that satisfaction from a particular segment of customers (first-order) does not necessarily lead to net benefits to society and in fact can cause substantial second- or third-order effects that are harmful to society. It is likely that the reason business customers did not participate in the fight against the Taiwanese polluter is because Vedan sells MSG to them at a price lower than that of the competition. We believe that Vedan Vietnam would have reacted differently had their business customers, importers, and distributors shown their unity, as manifested by actions, with the authorities, the media, and affected residents in the fight against Vedan. Vietnamese companies that are business customers of foreign companies operating in Vietnam should set short-term profitability aside and take a more active role in the quest to promote long-term societal benefits.</p>
<p>On the significance of stakeholders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0276146711423666">Crane (2000)</xref> argues that firms must respond in an appropriate manner to pressure from consumers and other stakeholders such as regulators and environmental groups so as to generate and maintain competitive advantage. Especially in a crisis situation (even though self-inflicted such as the Vedan case here), greater emphasis on the stakeholder model of corporate governance may help foreign investors recover more successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146711423666">Alpaslan, Green, and Mitroff 2009</xref>). Social responsibility and concerns for the long-term welfare of consumers should be an instrumental element in the strategic playbook of foreign investors in Vietnam.</p>

<sec id="section29-0276146711423666">
<title>Legal Framework</title>
<p>Perhaps the most valuable lesson learned from the Vedan case is the undesirable outcomes caused by the lack of an effective legal framework to deal with this type of business malpractice by a foreign investor. Such insufficiency is one of the factors that contribute to the inexplicably long time it has taken concerned authorities to take actions. The case against Vedan is an unprecedented, landmark case in Vietnam and there are many facets of the case that have yet to be addressed by the current laws in Vietnam. It exposes an inconvenient truth that business laws in Vietnam have lagged behind economic development, requiring governmental and local authorities to conduct a comprehensive review and revision of the current legal framework with regard to areas such as civil and criminal laws, foreign investment, labor, and environment. It is imperative that new procedures be added to deal with cases in which there are a large number of plaintiffs or defendants and the level of damage is not easily evaluated on an individual basis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-0276146711423666">
<title>Executive Taskforce</title>
<p>One of the reasons why the Vedan case has not been fully resolved after two years despite public outcry is because of an overlapping yet ineffective accountability system. Ministries, government agencies, and local authorities keep pointing fingers and blaming one another for the tardiness in dealing with the outcomes of the case, to the detriment of the local residents. It is recommended that the Vietnamese government establish an executive taskforce consisting of members from concerned ministries, agencies, and authorities to deal effectively and promptly with similar cases. Such taskforce will execute well-prepared procedures in dealing with conflicts, complaints, and lawsuits to ensure that justice is served. The line of responsibility and accountability should be clearly demarcated to avoid overlapping causing redundancy and evasion of responsibility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-0276146711423666">
<title>Technology-Enhanced Supervision and Communications</title>
<p>The role of technology in disseminating information, enhancing communication, and educating all stakeholders concerning commons dilemmas must not be overlooked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0276146711423666">Shultz and Holbrook 1999)</xref>. The Vedan case has received extensive media coverage on Vietnamese national television and radio stations as well as online news portals and print media. Numerous discussion forums and blogs have been created in which participants exchange views on the responsibilities of all concerned parties as well as necessary punitive actions against the polluter (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.webtretho.com/forum/archive/t-534160.html">http://www.webtretho.com/forum/archive/t-534160.html</ext-link>). In this case, technology informs and empowers the Vietnamese consumers and in turn they (consumers) have used communication networks to rally community support, pressure regulators, and motivate marketers to conduct ethical business practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0276146711423666">Shultz and Holbrook1999</xref>). The Vietnamese media should leverage its power in uncovering corporate wrongdoings, disseminating information, and rallying the general public’s support in the quest to justice using technologies enhanced by the Internet such as online forums, blogs, and online surveys.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The goal of this research was to bring to researchers’ attention to the negative side effect of economic growth and FDI in the context of a developing country (Vietnam). More specifically, the authors present the findings regarding a large-scale environmental pollution scandal caused by a foreign investor (Vedan). The literature is replete with studies investigating the positive effects of FDI on economic growth and people’s well-being while its negative consequences remain largely neglected. Developing countries are characterized by many contextual factors vastly different from those in developed countries, including political, cultural, social, and especially economical. The main reason why foreign investors pour money into a developing market is higher profitability driven by lower costs. Besides incentives such as tax holidays and low rents, many developing countries compete for investors’ capital by relaxing operational standards including waste treatment and workers’ working conditions. These short-term incentives are backfiring, as abusive labor practices and environmental pollution are not rare in many developing countries.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to this research. It is limited to a single case specific to Vietnam and the authors were unable to get Vedan Vietnam’s responses to their request for meetings. Only one (Citimart) out of many supermarket chains that carry Vedan’s products agreed to talk to the authors and the surveys were conducted only with consumers in the three affected provinces and cities. The authors encourage researchers to further investigate the negative outcomes of FDI in developing markets and recommend effective policies in order to curtail the adverse impacts of economic development through foreign investment. Short-term economic development goals should not come at the expense of the population’s well-being, and the authors believe that academics should share the responsibility to illuminate the dark side of such sought-after economic growth.</p>
