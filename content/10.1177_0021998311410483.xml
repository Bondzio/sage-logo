<abstract>
<p>This experimental study discusses the effects of the tube diameter and the impact energy level on the impact and compression after impact behaviors of [±55]<sub>3</sub> filament-wound glass/epoxy composite tubes. Four different tube diameters were selected as 50, 75, 100, and 150 mm. The composite tubes were subjected to various impact energy levels, 15, 20, and 25 J, using an instrumented impact testing machine at room temperature. Impacted and nonimpacted samples were subjected to axial compression tests. Results indicated that both specimen diameter and impact energy highly affect the impact response and compression-after impact strength of composite tubes.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311410483" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Filament-wound fiber-reinforced composite materials increasingly find many application areas such as pressure vessels, pipe lines, rocket motor casing, and wind turbine towers, because of their extremely high strength to weight ratio. However, these structures are susceptible to loadings such as compressive, fatigue, and blast after impact damage by, for example, rough handling.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that most composite structures are rarely completely flat in practice, most of the research has been focused on plate and beam structures, while relatively little research has been carried out on composite shell structures. Also, post-impact behaviors of composite pipes or tubes are little studied. Some investigations have been carried out to determine the impact behavior of composite tubes. Mamalis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410483">1</xref></sup> studied the compressive properties and crushing response of square FRP tubes using finite element program LS-DYNA3D. Chib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410483">2</xref></sup> researched the low-velocity impact simulation of carbon/epoxy tubes using LS-D DYNA software program. Their study demonstrates the accuracy and effectiveness of the impact test on tubes with LS-D DYNA and gives good predictions with obtained results for various parameters such as impactor velocity, lay-up configuration, and boundary conditions. Krishnamurthy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410483">3</xref></sup> investigated the impact response and damage in laminated composite cylindrical shells using a finite element method. Zhao and Cho<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311410483">4</xref></sup> investigated the impact-induced damage initiation and propagation in laminated composite shell under low-velocity impact. The damage analysis is performed using the Tsai–Wu quadratic failure criterion.</p>
<p>Doyum and Atalay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311410483">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311410483">6</xref></sup> investigated the detection possibility of different types of defects produced a result of low-velocity transverse impact loading on (±45<sub>2</sub>/90) S-glass and (±54<sub>3</sub>/90) E-glass fiber-reinforced epoxy tubular specimens. Visual inspection, water-washable red dye, water-washable fluorescent, and post-emulsified fluorescent penetrant systems were utilized for damage detection. Cracks of different sizes and nature, and delamination zones caused by impact were detected using the above-mentioned nondestructive inspection techniques.</p>
<p>Tarfaoui et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311410483">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311410483">8</xref></sup> carried out static and dynamic analysis of the thick glass/epoxy tubular structures, experimentally and numerically using ABAQUS. Scale and size effects on dynamic response and damage were investigated. Finite element analysis simulated damage was compared with experimental results. The numerical and experimental results were found to be in good agreement. Matemilola and Stronge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311410483">9</xref></sup> developed an analytical solution for calculating the impact response of a simply supported composite cylinder. Numerical examples for both thick and thin cylinders showed that local contact deformation is important for an accurate solution of the impact response.</p>
<p>The dynamic behavior and impact damage of laminated composite shells with various curvatures and stacking sequences were investigated by Kim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410483">10</xref></sup>. A three-dimensional finite element code was developed to describe the dynamic and impact response of shell-shaped structures. The results were compared with those of plates of the same dimensions and stacking sequences. As the curvature increases, the maximum impact force becomes higher for the same impact velocity. Although the delamination patterns of the cylindrical shell have a similar tendency to those of the plates, the delaminated area widens as the curvature increases.</p>
<p>Some investigations have also been performed to determine the behavior of composite tubes under axial compression loading. Xu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311410483">11</xref></sup> studied the local and global buckling of cylindrical shells under axial, compressive impact loads. It is found that critical buckling loads are affected by radial inertia, which tends to increase the critical loads. Huang and Wang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311410483">12</xref></sup> conducted quasi-static tests on carbon-reinforced composite tubes first to examine their axial crushing response; then, numerical simulations were performed and compared with experimental data to investigate how to establish an effective model for predicting energy-absorption behavior and crushing failure mode of composite tubes. Khalid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311410483">13</xref></sup> examined the energy absorption mechanisms of hybrid composite tubes to compare it with the single fiber/epoxy composite tubes; he also studied the effect of laminate sequence type on the energy absorption of the hybrid composite tubes under crushing. Results show that carbon-fiber reinforced tubes stand to higher loads than glass fiber and cotton fibers. On hybrid type tests, tubes with the external layer of carbon have shown higher strength than those of internal carbon fiber layers. Mahdi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311410483">14</xref></sup> carried out experimental and finite element simulations of the axial crushing of filament-wound laminated cotton/epoxy tubes. Cotton/epoxy tubes with different diameters, 50, 70, 90, 110, and 130 mm, and fiber orientation angles, 80° and 90° were used. Results indicate that the tube with fiber orientation of 80° and outer diameter of 130 mm shows the best load-carrying capacity at initial crush stage and the amount of energy absorbed by the tube depends on the crushing mechanism.</p>
<p>The main objective of this investigation is the determination of both the impact response and axial compression-after impact response of glass/epoxy composite tubes with various diameters and energy levels. Filament winding method was used in the manufacturing of composite tubes having [±55]<sub>3</sub> winding angles. Contact force–deflection and absorbed energy-tube diameter curves are illustrated. Distribution of compressive-after impact strength according to the tube diameter is obtained. The impact and compression-after impact damages of the tubes are given for various tube diameters and energies.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021998311410483" sec-type="materials"><title>Material</title>
<p>Glass–epoxy tubes with [±55]<sub>3</sub> were manufactured using a CNC filament winding machine in Izoreel Firm. Roving E-glass–fiber with 600 Tex and 17 µm diameter was used as reinforcement. Epoxy EPR 828 EL resin and EPH 875 hardener were selected as matrix. Composite tubes were cured at 130°C during 3 h. The fiber volume fraction (<italic>V</italic><sub>f</sub>) of the tubes studied in this investigation was 65%. Specimens were cut out from the long composite pipe to obtain the specified test length using a diamond wheel saw. The length of the tubes was 150 mm. The inner diameters of the specimens were selected as 50, 75, 100, and 150 mm. The wall thickness of the specimens was approximately 1.75 mm.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0021998311410483" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>Impact tests are performed using a Fractovis Plus impact test machine. The test machine was suitable for a wide variety of applications requiring low to high impact energies. The impactor, which has a hemispherical nose with 12.7 mm diameter, is connected to a 22.4 kN piezoelectric force transducer. The total falling mass including impactor nose, force transducer, and crosshead was 5.02 kg. During impact tests, an anti-rebounding system has prevented the samples from multiple impacts. Tests were performed under various impact energies, 15, 20, and 25 J, in order to examine the damage process in the tubes with various diameters and stacking sequences [±55]<sub>3</sub> at room temperature.</p>
<p>For the impact test, a special apparatus was developed. The tube specimen was closed with two glass–epoxy lids to simulate a real long tube situation; it was rest on the groove and fixed to the bottom plate of the apparatus with two U-bolts, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410483">Figure 1</xref>.
<fig id="fig1-0021998311410483" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Impact test fixture with V groove test fixture and specimen.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410483-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The impact characteristics such as the force–deflection curve and absorbed energy were examined for all the impact energies. The failure modes in the specimens are found to be crack initiation, delaminations, and fiber/matrix fracture, depending on the impact energy and the tube diameter. The absorbed energy is the energy consumed through the formation of damage and friction.</p>
<p>Axial compression-after impact tests were performed using a SHIMADZU tension-compression test machine having a capacity of 500 kN. The load was applied to the samples at a constant cross-head speed of 2 mm/min. Nonimpacted and impacted tubes have been subjected to compression tests until failure. For all cases, each test was repeated four times to obtain average values.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec5-0021998311410483"><title>Impact tests</title>
<p>Transverse impact tests are performed for various impact energies, namely 15, 20, and 25 J on the tube with stacking sequences of [±55]<sub>3</sub> and diameters, 50, 75, 100, and 150 mm, at room temperature.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311410483">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311410483">4</xref> give the images of the composite tubes impacted at 15, 20, and 25 J, respectively. All the specimens have failure in terms of matrix cracking and delamination. For the tubes with 50 mm diameter, the failure in circumferential direction is restrained by the borders in that direction. For this reason, the failure continues to extend in the longitudinal direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311410483">Figures 2(a)</xref>, 3(a), and 4(a)). When the diameter of the tube is 75 mm, the failure extends in the circumferential direction, but not in longitudinal direction with increasing impact energies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311410483">Figures 2(b)</xref>, 3(b), and 4(b)). It is seen that with the increase in diameter, specimens become more flexible and the impact energy is consumed via elastic deformations to a large extent, resulting in smaller damage areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311410483">Figures 2(c) and (d)</xref>, 3(c) and (d), 4(c) and (d)).

<p>The contact force–deflection curves give significant information about the impact response of the composite tubes tested. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410483">Figure 5</xref>, contact force–deflection curves of the specimens for four tube diameters at three different impact energy levels are shown. These curves, turned toward the origin of the diagram after reaching a maximum force, imply rebounding of the impactor from the sample and hence relatively small damage formations in samples.
<fig id="fig5-0021998311410483" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Load-deflection curves of the glass–epoxy composite tubes subjected to the transverse impact at: (a) 15 J, (b) 20 J, and (c) 25 J.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410483-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>As seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410483">Figure 5</xref>, during loading, the slope of the curve decreases by increasing diameter of the specimen up to about 2 mm deflection. After that, the slopes of the curves decrease because of the matrix cracking and delamination. In the unloading case, return speed of the curve of specimen with high diameter is higher than specimen with small diameter because of flexibility and small failures. The peak force does not change significantly with increasing specimen diameter except for the specimen with 150 mm diameter, under 15 J impact energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410483">Figure 5(a)</xref>). The impact resistance of the specimens with small diameter decreases by increasing the impact energy compared to the specimen with the high diameter. As a result of this, second slope in loading case and maximum contact force decrease by increase of specimens’ diameter while maximum deflection increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410483">Figure 5(c)</xref>).</p>
<p>Maximum contact force increases with the increase in impact energy for specimens with 100 and 150 mm diameters while it does not change significantly for 50 and 75 mm diameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410483">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Absorbed energy is defined as the enclosed area between the load–deflection curve and the horizontal axis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311410483">Figure 6</xref> gives the absorbed energy values of composites tubes with four different diameters. Absorbed energy decreases with increasing diameter for each impact energy level.

<sec id="sec6-0021998311410483"><title>Axial compression-after impact tests</title>
<p>The main problem in the compression test is the failure formed at the end of the tube that is the contact point between the tube ends and the plates of the compression test machine. This failure occurs before obtaining the real compression strength of the tubes. To prevent the sample from this premature failure, the tubes were closed fit with two glass–epoxy lids at the ends, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410483">Figure 7</xref>.
<fig id="fig7-0021998311410483" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Illustration of composite tubes and clamp part.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410483-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In the compression tests, a data acquisition system records the force–displacement history. The maximum load is obtained from the force–displacement curve.

<p>The photos of the nonimpacted tubes subjected to compressive loading are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311410483">Figure 8</xref>. As seen from the photos, the damages generally occur near the end of the tube due to the local buckling behavior, especially in the higher diameters. The images of the damaged samples subjected to axial compressive loading after impacts are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311410483">Figures 9</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311410483">11</xref>. The failure propagates from the impact point except for the specimens having 100 and 150 mm diameters, and 15 J impact energy. For these tubes, the failure likely results from buckling.

<p>The variation of compression-after impact strength of the composite tubes was obtained according to the tube diameter for various impact energy levels, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311410483">Figure 12</xref>. As can be seen from the figure, compressive strength does not change significantly for the diameters between 50 and 100 mm of nonimpacted specimens (0 J). For the specimen with 150 mm diameter, the strength drops suddenly because of buckling. Compression-after impact strength increases by increasing tube diameter, while it decreases by increasing impact energy except for the 150 mm diameter. The compressive strength of the tube with 150 mm diameter is nearly the same for all impact energies. Since there is no serious damage in that composite tube and the impact damage zone is very small compared to the total surface area, the main failure mode seems to be buckling.

<p>In this study, transverse impact and compression-after impact behaviors of [±55]<sub>3</sub> filament-wound glass–fiber/epoxy composite tubes are investigated experimentally, considering the various tube diameters and impact energy levels.</p>
<p>The main conclusions, which can be drawn from this investigation, are:
<list id="list1-0021998311410483" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Tubes with higher diameters, being more flexible, absorb more energy elastically and are not damaged as much as the tubes with relatively small diameters for a given impact energy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Failure of the tube with 50 mm diameter in circumferential direction is restrained by diameter. As a result of this, failure which extended in the longitudinal direction for the tube with 50 mm diameter is higher than that of the tube with 75 mm diameter.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Maximum contact force increases with increase of impact energy for specimens with smaller diameters while it does not change significantly for higher diameters.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Absorbed energy decreases with increasing diameter for each impact energy level, while it increases with increasing impact energy for each diameter.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Compression-after impact strength increases with the increase in tube diameter, while it decreases with increasing of impact energy, except for the 150 mm diameter. But it does not change significantly in the largest diameter because of buckling.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The compression-after impact damage propagates in the fiber direction of the tube with the smallest diameter.
