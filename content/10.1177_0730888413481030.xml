<abstract>
<p>This study, based on data from a large nationally representative sample of Canadian workers with disabilities, examines the relationship between employment arrangements and the accommodation of disability in the workplace. We address whether workers with disabilities in nonstandard arrangements are more likely to have unmet accommodation needs and if other key dimensions of precarious employment mediate the relationship between nonstandard work and accommodation. Results from multivariate models suggest that despite disability legislation, practices of workplace disability accommodation parallel the unequal distribution of other labor market protections, with workers in more precarious arrangements (i.e. those in nonpermanent, low-wage, and nonunion jobs) at greater risk of having unmet needs.</p>

<p>One of the ways in which work and employment relations have changed since the 1970s is through the growth of nonstandard employment arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0730888413481030">Kalleberg, 2009</xref>). Employment relations are a key source of stratification because they determine the ability of labor market structures to smooth out some of the risks and uncertainties encountered by individuals across the course of their lives. The collectively based protection of workers typical of standard employment relationships increasingly has been replaced by a devolution of responsibility for the management of these risks from employer to worker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0730888413481030">Beck, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0730888413481030">Kalleberg, Reskin, &amp; Hudson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0730888413481030">O’Rand &amp; Shuey, 2007</xref>). Research highlights the greater precariousness of workers in nonstandard jobs resulting from greater job insecurity, lower and less stable wages, and reduced access to training and benefits such as pensions and other forms of compensation (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0730888413481030">Ferber &amp; Waldfogel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0730888413481030">Vosko, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0730888413481030">Zeytinoglu &amp; Cooke, 2005</xref>). However, missing from the discussion is the relationship between nonstandard employment and access to protections provided by workplace disability accommodations that were institutionalized in the late 1980s and early 1990s by laws such as the <italic>Americans with Disabilities Act</italic> (ADA) and the <italic>Canadian Human Rights Act</italic>. Workplace accommodations serve to protect workers from the potentially harmful effects of disability on employment outcomes, and differential access to these protections is a source of inequality and precarity in the workplace. In this article, we investigate if the nonstandard employment arrangements characteristic of a growing segment of today’s economy are associated with unequal protections for workers with disabilities. We begin with a review of the literature on nonstandard employment arrangements, followed by a discussion of the legal context and research on disability accommodation.</p>

<title>Nonstandard Employment Arrangements and Labor Market Inequality</title>
<p>Discussions of changing work institutions are often organized around a distinction between standard and nonstandard employment arrangements. The term <italic>standard employment</italic> is rooted in the industrial jobs typical of the postwar period and has historically referred to full-time work with one employer that spans an indefinite period of time and provides statutory benefits and entitlements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0730888413481030">Kalleberg, 2000</xref>). These employment contracts historically have been associated with union or professional association activity that imparts additional advantages related to wages and benefits, as well as greater relative security and stability that provided workers the ability to plan for the future. In industrialized nations, standard employment arrangements were the normative basis for the development of social insurance programs such as unemployment insurance and public pensions, and labor laws and legislated collective bargaining.</p>
<p>A number of changes beginning in the mid-1970s led work organizations to search for greater flexibility in their workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0730888413481030">Kalleberg, 2003</xref>). Global economic changes increased competition and promoted workforce flexibility to increase profits and reduce uncertainty; labor laws protecting permanent workers encouraged employers to search for other options to avoid costs and regulations; and the increased labor force participation of married women fuelled the creation of the temporary help industry (for a discussion see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0730888413481030">Cappelli et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0730888413481030">Kalleberg, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0730888413481030">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0730888413481030">Vosko, 2000</xref>). Since that time, nonstandard work arrangements have become increasingly prevalent throughout the labor force both in high- and low-skill jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0730888413481030">Kalleberg, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0730888413481030">2011</xref>). As of 2007, 33% of employed men and 37% of employed women worked in nonstandard arrangements in Canada, up from 28% and 32% respectively in 1989 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0730888413481030">Vosko &amp; Clark, 2009</xref>, p. 31). In the Canadian context, the realization that half of the new jobs created in the 1980s did not fit the traditional model of full-time, permanent employment raised new concerns over job insecurity and brought the term <italic>nonstandard employment</italic> into widespread usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0730888413481030">Cranford, Vosko, &amp; Zukewich, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there are variations in the conceptualization of nonstandard employment, fundamental characteristics of employment such as work hours and the continuity and permanency of the work relationship form the basis of the standard/nonstandard distinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0730888413481030">Zeytinoglu &amp; Cooke, 2005</xref>). One commonly used definition of nonstandard employment consists of temporary help and subcontracted business services, independent contracting, “on call” workers and day laborers, part-time work, and self-employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0730888413481030">Benner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0730888413481030">Kalleberg et al., 2000</xref>). Some argue for the exclusion of self-employment since own-account self-employment (the self-employed who do not have paid employees) is not necessarily insecure in that it assumes an ongoing employment relationship with oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0730888413481030">Krahn, 1991</xref>). Research on nonstandard work often combines analyses of temporary and part-time work arrangements because both categories of workers often report a preference for full-time permanent work and the higher wages, benefits, and security it provides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0730888413481030">Schur, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Nonstandard arrangements are not considered inherently problematic, as these arrangements allow employers greater flexibility and the management of labor costs during slow periods and economic downturns and are thought to allow workers greater control over aspects of their labor such as scheduling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0730888413481030">Kalleberg et al., 2000</xref>). However, the disadvantages of nonstandard work are many. Workers in nonstandard arrangements experience greater uncertainty about the number of hours they work per week and the length of their employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0730888413481030">Kalleberg et al., 2000</xref>); a sense of insecurity that is cultivated by the practice of employers using contract workers, temporary workers, and part-time workers to limit the duration of their employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0730888413481030">Pfeffer &amp; Baron, 1988</xref>). In addition, both part-time and temporary workers earn lower wages on average than regular workers with comparable skills and education and typically receive fewer fringe benefits such as health and retirement benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0730888413481030">Ferber &amp; Waldfogel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0730888413481030">Kalleberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0730888413481030">Nollen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0730888413481030">Segal &amp; Sullivan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0730888413481030">Tilly, 1996</xref>). Although there is variability across nonstandard arrangements, in general the conclusion is that workers in nonstandard arrangements are often disadvantaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0730888413481030">Kalleberg, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Broader labor market changes associated with the growth of nonstandard work have also made the issue of job quality more salient, and studies of job quality often draw a dichotomy between employment in “good” and “bad” jobs. In the postindustrial economy, skilled blue-collar or well-paid white collar jobs primarily located in information and knowledge-intensive sectors are synonymous with good jobs, as they provide greater job security and wages, access to benefits, and opportunities for training and mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0730888413481030">Bartik &amp; Houseman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0730888413481030">Duffy, Glenday, &amp; Pupo, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0730888413481030">Gautié &amp; Schmitt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0730888413481030">Green, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0730888413481030">Kalleberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0730888413481030">McGovern, Smeaton, &amp; Hill, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0730888413481030">Smith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0730888413481030">Wright &amp; Dwyer, 2006</xref>). This good/bad dichotomy overlaps with employment relations, with nonstandard arrangements often considered synonymous with bad jobs and standard relationships in the form of regular, steady, full-time jobs a benchmark of sorts when it comes to defining “good” jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0730888413481030">Gunderson &amp; Riddell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0730888413481030">Kalleberg et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent research has incorporated the literature on job quality and nonstandard work into the concept of precarious employment, which more explicitly identifies the harmful features of work that reduce access to protections and benefits and function as mechanisms generating greater uncertainty and vulnerability for nonstandard workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0730888413481030">Vosko, 2006</xref>). Although variation in job quality exists among jobs that fall into the nonstandard category, existing research tends to group all nonstandard work together as a uniform deviation from the standard employment relationship without regard for variations in the level of precarity it produces for workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0730888413481030">Vosko, 2006</xref>). In her work, Vosko identifies three key dimensions that expand on the standard/nonstandard dichotomy to include aspects of employment that create variation in job quality and the level of precariousness for workers. The first dimension relates to the balance of power within the workplace and protection from labor market insecurities. Greater precariousness results from factors such as the lack of union contract or access to collective bargaining, the absence of regulatory protections, and low wages. Union protection, for example, affects the ability of employees to individually and collectively exercise power over employment situations and working conditions to gain benefits, control, and protections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0730888413481030">Kalleberg, 2011</xref>). Unionized workplaces are more likely to have formal grievance procedures in place that give employees a vehicle to express dissatisfaction with their treatment and to appeal perceived unfair behavior by their employer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0730888413481030">Greenberg, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0730888413481030">Hirschman, 1970</xref>). Because of loopholes and subcontractor arrangements, union representation among nonstandard workers is much lower than in standard arrangements, and many workers with nonstandard jobs are unable to access the kinds of protections that unions, collective bargaining, and labor laws offer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0730888413481030">Boheim &amp; Booth, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0730888413481030">Fang &amp; Verma, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0730888413481030">Gunderson &amp; Riddell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0730888413481030">Kalleberg et al., 2000</xref>). In terms of legal and regulatory protections, research suggests that part-time and temporary workers fare better in larger firms, as small firms are exempt from some federal and provincial labor laws (such as providing employees with sick leave) as well as equal pay and employment equity legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0730888413481030">Armstrong &amp; Armstrong, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0730888413481030">Cranford &amp; Vosko, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0730888413481030">Lipsett &amp; Reesor, 1998</xref>). Finally, research suggests the harmful effects of low wage work (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0730888413481030">Applebaum, Bernhardt, &amp; Murnane, 2003</xref>) and its significant overlap with nonstandard arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0730888413481030">Ferber &amp; Waldfogel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0730888413481030">Kalleberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0730888413481030">Nollen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0730888413481030">Segal &amp; Sullivan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0730888413481030">Tilly, 1996</xref>). Workers in low-wage, low-skill positions tend to have less power, voice, and access to workplace protections, are viewed by employers as more expendable, and are at greater risk of job loss and cycling among low-wage jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0730888413481030">Appelbaum, Bernhardt, &amp; Murnane, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0730888413481030">Ehrenreich, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0730888413481030">Yoshikawa, Weisner, &amp; Lowe, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, social contexts such as industry and occupation are important for differentiating employment precariousness across work arrangements, as they differently expose workers to uncertainty resulting from forces such as economic restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0730888413481030">Vosko, 2006</xref>). For example, worker vulnerability to economic restructuring is particularly high in primary industry and manufacturing; thus, full-time permanent work in these rapidly restructuring sectors may be more precarious than temporary work in other sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0730888413481030">Cranford &amp; Vosko, 2006</xref>). Industrial and occupational context also overlaps with rates of union coverage, with the lowest rates of union coverage found among nonstandard workers in service sector occupations. This fact, in conjunction with a high rate of part-time, low wage, and insecure work makes employment in sales and service occupations among the most precarious, even among those considered full-time permanent workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0730888413481030">Cranford &amp; Vosko, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0730888413481030">Kalleberg, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, the distribution of precarious work mirrors other patterns of labor market inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0730888413481030">Vosko, 2006</xref>). A multitude of studies find that access to “good” jobs and their associated benefits intersects with the social locations of race-ethnicity, social class, gender, as well as disability status (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0730888413481030">Kalleberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0730888413481030">Presser, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0730888413481030">Sengupta, Edwards, &amp; Tsai, 2009</xref>). Women dominate nonstandard employment and thus are disproportionately affected by its perils. Whereas men are more likely than women to be employed in full-time permanent employment, the least precarious form of wage work, a greater proportion of women are employed in part-time temporary work, which is the most precarious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0730888413481030">Cranford et al., 2003</xref>). Research highlights the unequal negative effects of nonstandard work on the lives of men and women, with nonstandard work having a greater adverse effect on employment outcomes for women such as wages and the likelihood of promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0730888413481030">Prokos, Padavic, &amp; Schmidt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0730888413481030">Zeytinoglu &amp; Cooke, 2008</xref>). Nonstandard employment is also racialized, with studies from the United States and Canada showing that disadvantaged racial/ethnic minority workers and new immigrants are disproportionately found in temporary and involuntary part-time employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0730888413481030">Carre &amp; Heintz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0730888413481030">Cranford &amp; Vosko, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0730888413481030">Fuller &amp; Vosko, 2008</xref>). In addition, disability status also intersects with employment arrangements, with workers with disabilities overrepresented in jobs with nonstandard arrangements including part-time and temporary employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0730888413481030">Krahn, Lowe, &amp; Hughes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0730888413481030">Schur, Kruse, Blasi, &amp; Blanck, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0730888413481030">Tompa, Scott, Trevithick, &amp; Bhattacharyya, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0730888413481030">Yelin &amp; Trupin, 2003</xref>), as well as in service occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0730888413481030">Hale, Hayghe, &amp; McNeil, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Bringing in Workplace Disability Accommodation</title>
<p>The labor force participation of individuals with a disability depends on a complex array of factors including legal directives, economic and employment contexts, job demands, social structural location, as well as the policies and workplace culture cultivated by employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0730888413481030">Schur et al., 2009</xref>). People who enter the labor force with a disability, or develop a disability during the course of their work lives, often face unique challenges in retaining employment and experience unequal outcomes. For example, research shows lower levels of pay and benefit access (i.e., health insurance and pension plans) and greater job insecurity among workers with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0730888413481030">Baldwin &amp; Schumacher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0730888413481030">Kruse, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0730888413481030">Schur, 2002</xref>). In addition, workers with disabilities are nearly twice as likely to be in nonstandard work arrangements, potentially problematic because of the disadvantages of nonstandard work discussed above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0730888413481030">Schur, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Formal definitions of “disability,” established by various governmental and nongovernmental organizations, affect employers’ treatment of workers and their policies regarding disability in the workplace. In Canada, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0730888413481030"><italic>Canadian Human Rights Act</italic> (1985)</xref>, in conjunction with the 1986 Employment Equity Act, prohibits discrimination in the workplace on the basis of disability and makes employment opportunities and benefits accessible to designated disadvantaged groups, which includes persons with disabilities. Similarly, in the United States the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0730888413481030">1990 <italic>Americans with Disabilities Act</italic> (ADA)</xref> encourages the employment of individuals with disabilities and makes it illegal to discriminate in hiring, promotion, and other employment outcomes. Both the ADA and Canadian legislation require employers to alter workplace conditions to allow people with disabilities equal opportunities in employment. The underlying principle, called <italic>reasonable accommodation</italic>, acknowledges that employers can make choices regarding how work is performed that provide employees with greater flexibility and can lead to greater inclusion and tolerance in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0730888413481030">Harlan &amp; Robert, 1998</xref>). Employers are required to provide accommodations that do not impose undue hardship on themselves in terms of cost, disruption to other employees, or the ability to conduct business. Such modifications can include the removal of physical barriers and the provision of devices that assist with visual, mobility, or speech disabilities, as well as changes to norms of productivity, such as modified duties and work schedules.</p>
<p>The establishment of the duty to accommodate arose in conjunction with a monumental change in social thinking toward disablement in North America that began in the 1970s. Prior to that time, the biomedical and economic models of disability prevailed, both of which viewed disability as an individual pathology and ignored the role of society in the creation of unnecessary environmental barriers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0730888413481030">Bickenbach, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0730888413481030">Hahn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0730888413481030">Jongbloed, 2006</xref>). Little attention was given to accommodating individuals in the workplace, and people with disabilities were viewed either as noncontributors or former contributors to the institution of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0730888413481030">Jongbloed, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0730888413481030">Stone, 1984</xref>). Beginning in the 1970s, the politicization of disability brought about a sociopolitical or social model of disability, which removed the focus on individual pathology and understood disability as social injustice resulting from the attitudes and discriminatory practices of the larger society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0730888413481030">Bickenbach, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0730888413481030">Hahn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0730888413481030">Oliver 1990</xref>). This model of disability emphasizes modification of the social environment through policy change and is associated with a new human rights paradigm in Canadian legal thought on disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0730888413481030">Lynk, 2008</xref>). From these roots, Canada became the first country to include protections for people with disabilities in its constitution, the 1982 <italic>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</italic>, and in comparison to the United States, disability employment rights in Canada are viewed as more expansive and liberal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0730888413481030">Bickenbach, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0730888413481030">Lynk, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>However, despite these legal protections, ambiguities inherent in legal discourse on disability and reasonable accommodation allow employers considerable latitude in their decisions regarding the support of disabled employees. Laws are sufficiently broad to allow the weighing of financial costs and other risks associated with noncompliance or avoidance of these laws among employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0730888413481030">Harlan &amp; Robert, 1998</xref>). Employers’ decisions occur within the context of prevailing negative social attitudes toward the capabilities of people with disabilities and, despite legal protections, research suggests that prejudice and bias in the workplace remain. Within the workplace, organizational mechanisms tolerate and encourage discriminatory practices, including the failure to examine the erroneous belief that accommodating workers’ needs is cost-prohibitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0730888413481030">Robert &amp; Harlan, 2006</xref>). Negative attitudes among employers include the perception that people with disabilities are less capable of meeting organizational demands, unable to work at a normal pace, capable of only limited tasks, and more expensive for the company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0730888413481030">Abberley, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0730888413481030">Hahn, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0730888413481030">McFarlin, Song, &amp; Sonntag, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0730888413481030">Robert &amp; Harlan, 2006</xref>). In turn, employer perceptions about the worth and performance of employees affects their willingness to comply with worker accommodation requests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0730888413481030">Florey &amp; Harrison, 2000</xref>). Employees who face nonaccommodating environments are responsible for filing a complaint to begin an arduous grievance process, which in Canada is handled through labor arbitration in unionized workplaces and by human rights tribunals for nonunionized workers. Cases brought to the tribunals are disproportionately from middle and lower income workers, as they are more likely to be employed in nonunionized workplaces, and decisions in these cases seldom result in the reinstatement of the employee’s job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0730888413481030">Lynk, 1999</xref>). In sum, researchers conclude that despite existing legal protections, discrimination and disparate treatment on the grounds of disability remain “stubborn and pervasive features” of employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0730888413481030">Lynk, 2008</xref>, p. 193).</p>
<p>Whether legal protections extend to all workers is an interesting empirical question. In Canada, the duty to accommodate is a fundamental legal obligation and Canadian human rights and equity laws designed to protect the employment rights of people with disabilities apply to all workers regardless of temporary or part-time employment status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0730888413481030">Lynk, 1999</xref>). However, a review of leading disability cases from human rights tribunals and labor arbiters suggests that employers may view temporary employees differently in terms of their obligations to accommodate them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0730888413481030">Lynk, 1999</xref>, p. 218). Lynk suggests that despite the duty to accommodate, the burden on employers to establish undue hardship as a reason for nonaccommodation may not be as great for part-time and temporary workers. Consistent with research finding that U.S. employers may be particularly reluctant to make accommodations for both part-time and temporary workers with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0730888413481030">Schur, 2003</xref>), the case review in Canada suggests that employers may make less of an effort to accommodate nonstandard workers and that the threshold for establishing reasonable accommodation through arbitration is lower for these workers. Thus the protection of labor laws has greater difficulty reaching nonstandard workers. Not only are such laws considered more difficult to enforce in the context of nonstandard work but also nonstandard workers are often reluctant to bring forth a complaint and are seldom covered by a union capable of filing a complaint on their behalf and offering protection against employer reprisals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0730888413481030">Gomez &amp; Gunderson, 2005</xref>, p. 192). Thus, similar to the unequal distribution of other labor market protections, research suggests workers in nonstandard arrangements may have unequal access to disability accommodations despite existing legislation and regulations aimed at ensuring equality.</p>

<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>In this analysis, we examine employment context as a potential mechanism of inequality in disability accommodation. We first examine (a) whether workers with disabilities in nonstandard employment arrangements are more likely to have unmet accommodation needs. (b) Second, we examine the extent to which key dimensions of employment that indicate degree of precariousness and are often associated with nonstandard arrangements (such as unionization, wage level, and regulatory protection) mediate the relationship between nonstandard employment and disability accommodation. (c) Third, we examine the intersecting relations of race and gender, addressing whether the relationship between nonstandard employment and disability accommodation is gendered and racialized. (d) Finally, we investigate these relationships in the presence of controls for individual differences in disability, such as severity and duration, which studies have shown are critical to issues of labor force participation (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0730888413481030">Baldwin &amp; Johnson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0730888413481030">Jongbloed, 1990</xref>).</p>

<title>The Sample</title>
<p>In this analysis, we use the public use microdata file (PUMF) of the 2006 Participation and Activity Limitation Survey (PALS), which is a postcensal survey of persons with disabilities in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0730888413481030">Statistics Canada, 2010</xref>). The PALS is a rich source of information on type of disability and employer supports for persons with disabilities. The survey population was selected through two disability filter questions from the 2006 Census and includes children and adults who were residing in private or collective households in the 10 Canadian provinces. Census questions assessed whether respondents had (a) “any difficulty hearing, seeing, communicating, walking, climbing stairs, bending, learning or doing any similar activities” or (b) whether “a physical condition or mental condition or health problem reduces the amount or kind of activity [they] can do at home, at work or at school, or in other activities, for example, transportation and leisure” (for more details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0730888413481030">Statistics Canada, 2010</xref>). Persons who answered “yes, sometimes” or “yes, often” to either of these questions on the 2006 Census were sampled to be included in PALS and were then asked an additional series of detailed screening questions regarding activity limitations. Those who responded “yes” to any of the PALS screening questions proceeded with the remainder of the interview. The PALS response rate was 73.9%, resulting in a sample size of 38,839 adults aged 15 and above, of which 10,008 reported at least one disability and fell into our age range of interest (20 to 64 years of age). Of this group, 4,072 disabled individuals aged 20 to 64 reported working for wages, salary, tips, or commission at the time of the survey. Over one third (38.5%) of these 4,072 individuals indicated a need for disability accommodation (<italic>N</italic> = 1,567). Thus the analytic sample used for multivariate analysis of unmet need for accommodation consists of the 1,567 disabled wage and salary workers aged 20 to 64 who indicated a need for disability accommodation.</p>

<title>Unmet need for workplace accommodation</title>
<p>PALS respondents were asked the following question: “Because of your condition, do you require any of the following to be able to work?” They were presented with a series of accommodations: job redesign (modified or different duties); modified hours or days or reduced work hours; human support, such as a reader, sign language interpreter, job coach or personal assistant; technical aids, such as a voice synthesizer, a Teletype (TTY) or Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD), an infrared system or portable note-takers; provision of specialized computer; communication aids; other equipment, help or work arrangement; handrails or ramps; appropriate parking; accessible elevator; modified workstation; accessible washrooms; accessible transport; or other aid. Respondents who answered “yes” to any of these 14 items were considered to have a <italic>need for workplace accommodations</italic>. Those who reported a need for accommodation were then asked whether each of the required modifications “has been made available to you?” Cases in which at least one of the required modification(s) was not made available by the employer were coded 1 on <italic>unmet need for accommodations</italic> for bivariate and multivariate analyses.</p>

<title>Nonstandard employment</title>
<p>Respondents were coded 1 on <italic>nonpermanent employment</italic> if they indicated that their current job was temporary, term or contract, casual or on-call, or performed through a temporary agency. A respondent is considered a <italic>part-time</italic> worker if the usual number of hours worked per week was less than 30, which is the typical cutoff for research in the Canadian context.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0730888413481030">
<title>Employment context</title>
<p>A number of dimensions of employment associated with worker precariousness were investigated in the analysis. <italic>Nonunion status</italic> is coded 1 for those respondents who are not union members or are not covered by a union contract or collective agreement in their current job. <italic>Firm size</italic> is a categorical variable indicating the number of persons employed at the respondent’s place of employment, or, if the company operates at more than one location, the number of employees at all locations combined. The four categories include small firms (less than 20 employees), small-medium (20 to 99), medium-large (100 to 500) and large firms (above 500 employees). Based on theoretical interest and initial analyses, these categories are further collapsed in multivariate models to compare employment in <italic>small firms</italic> (coded 1) to all others. Indicators of <italic>occupation</italic> consist of dummy variables constructed from a categorical measure of occupation that is based on the National Occupational Classification system’s major occupational groups. Categories include positions in management, business and finance, education and government, health, science, arts and culture, sales and service, the trades, and manufacturing and industry. Multivariate models presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0730888413481030">Table 2</xref> compare the above categories to a reference category consisting of those employed in business and finance and education and government (which have a similar bivariate and multivariate relationship with accommodation), a group that represents roughly one third of the sample. Employment income in the previous year is a categorical variable constructed by Statistics Canada consisting of the following categories: income less than or equal to CAD19,999; CAD20,000 to CAD49,999; and CAD50,000 and beyond. A fourth category, no income, captures the small portion of the sample who were engaged in paid employment at the time of the survey but who did not receive employment income in the previous year. Models retain this separate category for workers without prior year employment income to prevent data loss and to isolate workers who have a more volatile work history due to disability or other labor market factors. Multivariate models compare the categories <italic>low-wage</italic> workers (those earning up to CAD20,000) and workers with <italic>no income in the previous year</italic> to a reference category consisting of those receiving higher levels of income.</p>

<sec id="section12-0730888413481030">
<title>Worker characteristics</title>
<p><italic>Gender</italic> is a dummy variable (women coded 1) that captures social structural location and represents gender differences in labor market participation as well as differences in onset and nature of disability. An indicator of first language (0 = <italic>English or French</italic>; 1 = <italic>all others</italic>) serves as a proxy for <italic>immigrant status</italic>, which was the only available measure of ethnicity in the PALS. <italic>Low educational attainment</italic> (1 = <italic>less than a high school diploma</italic>) is constructed from a four-category variable that distinguishes between respondents who have less than a high school diploma, high school graduates, graduates of college or trade school, and those with a university degree.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0730888413481030">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>Analyses include a control variable for <italic>disability severity</italic>, which is captured through a global severity index constructed by the PALS staff using questions about intensity and frequency for each of seven types of disability (including sight, speech, hearing, mobility, agility, pain, and other limitations). The product of frequency and intensity were used to measure severity for each disability type. This score was standardized and averaged across the seven disabilities and the distribution was divided into four severity levels, ranging from mild to very severe. After examination of different functional forms, disability severity was included in the multivariate models as a continuous variable ranging from 1 to 4. In addition, a measure of the <italic>duration of the limitation</italic> was included. The PALS staff constructed a variable consisting of five categories ranging from less than 1 year to 20+ years. Categories were collapsed based on significant differences in early multivariate models, and the final models reported in the tables compare respondents with a primary limitation of long duration (20+ years) to a reference category consisting of those with medium- or short-term disability. In the PALS survey <italic>age</italic> is measured as a categorical variable representing respondents in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s (up to and including age 64). It is included in multivariate models as an interval level variable to control for the positive association between age and disability.</p>

In terms of disability severity, around one third (36%) of respondents reported limitations considered “severe” or “very severe” on the PALS global severity index. Thirty-four percent and 31% reported a disability that was classified as a medium or mild disability, respectively.

<p>In terms of employment characteristics, three quarters of the analytic sample worked full-time. Most (90%) had a permanent position, and 43% had a unionized job. The modal employment income category was CAD20,000 to CAD49,999, encompassing 38% of the sample; over one-quarter (28%) earned less than CAD20,000 and nearly the same earned above CAD50,000 (27%). About half (49%) were employed by large firms, while 22% worked in small firms with less than 20 employees. Roughly one half of respondents were either in occupations in sales and service (24%) or in business, finance, and administration (24%). Nine percent were in management, 9% were in occupations unique to manufacturing and industry and 12% were in the trades.</p>
<p>Columns 2 and 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0730888413481030">Table 1</xref> present bivariate results from cross-tabular analysis of <italic>unmet need for accommodation</italic>. In terms of employment characteristics, workers in nonpermanent jobs were more likely to have unmet needs than workers in more permanent arrangements (46% compared to 34%). In addition, part-time workers were more likely to have unmet needs than those working full-time (39% compared to 33%). Unionized workers were less likely to have unmet needs (31%) than those not covered by a union contract or collective agreement (37%). In terms of occupation, workers employed in manufacturing/industry and the trades were the most likely (52% and 40% respectively), while those in management occupations were the least likely (16%) to have unmet needs. Workers who were out of the labor market in the previous year (no employment income) were the most likely to have unmet needs (44%) followed by low-wage workers (40%). In contrast, only 31% of workers in the highest earning category had unmet needs. Firm size was not significantly associated with accommodation.</p>
<p>In terms of worker characteristics, there was no significant association between unmet need and gender, immigrant status, or age. Social class was important, with the more highly educated more likely to have their needs met by their employer. More specifically, 32% of university-educated respondents expressed unmet needs compared to 46% of those with less than a high school degree. Severity of disability was associated with unmet accommodation needs, with a higher proportion of respondents with severe (47%) or very severe limitations (55%) reporting an unmet need, compared to a low of 24% of those with limitations that fell in the middle of the severity scale. Duration was also significant, with a higher proportion of workers with long-term disabilities reporting unmet needs (45%) compared to those with disabilities of recent (35%) or medium-term onset (30%).</p>

<p>First we are interested in whether workers with disabilities in nonstandard employment arrangements are more likely to have unmet accommodation needs. From the baseline model we see that similar to the bivariate results, workers in more temporary positions (temporary, contract, or on-call workers) were 57% more likely to experience unmet needs than workers with permanent jobs ((e<sup>.455</sup> –1) × 100). Similarly, part-time workers were 24% more likely to report unmet needs ((e<sup>.216</sup> –1) × 100). The significant positive effect of nonpermanent employment remained stable across the models; however, part-time employment dropped from significance once other key employment characteristics, such as union status and wages, were introduced in Model 2.</p>
<p>Next we are interested in the extent to which key dimensions of employment that are often associated with nonstandard arrangements and indicate greater precariousness for workers mediate the relationship between nonstandard employment and accommodation. This question is addressed in Model 2. First, workers without union representation were 40% more likely to have unmet accommodation needs than unionized workers ((e<sup>.336</sup> –1) × 100). This relationship remains significant across all of the models, including the final model controlling for disability status. Second, although the literature suggests there may be a negative effect of the lack of regulation on the accommodation of workers in small firms, this does not appear to be the case. In the first two models, workers in small firms were 22% less likely to have unmet needs, ((e<sup>–.248</sup> –1) × 100), Model 2. However, in the final model this effect is no longer significant, raising the question of whether workers with long-term disabilities or limitations that are more severe are underrepresented in small firms. Third, compared to higher wage workers, low-wage workers were 31% more likely, ((e<sup>.271</sup> –1) × 100), and workers who were out of the paid labor market in the previous year were 68% more likely, ((e<sup>.519</sup> –1) × 100), to have unmet needs. Workers who were previously out of the labor market likely represent a group of disabled workers who make multiple labor force exits and reentries across their work lives, and the higher odds of unmet needs among this group suggest that these individuals remain the most vulnerable to future exits. Finally, workers in certain occupational categories emerged as more vulnerable to having unmet needs. In particular, workers in manufacturing and industry, ((e<sup>.702</sup> –1) × 100), Model 2, were 101% more likely, and workers in management and service occupations were 66%, ((e<sup>–1.086</sup> –1) × 100), and 27%, ((e<sup>–.313</sup> –1) × 100), less likely to have unmet needs, respectively. The effects remain significant in the presence of controls for disability status, suggesting that this lack of accommodation is a function of the occupation rather than the result of more severe or longstanding limitations among workers within the occupation. Note that the models shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0730888413481030">Table 2</xref> present coefficients compared to a reference category consisting of occupations in business and finance or education and government. Although the coefficient for manufacturing becomes nonsignificant with the introduction of controls for disability status, changing the reference category shows significantly higher odds of unmet needs among workers in manufacturing compared to workers in management occupations across all models, including Model 4.</p>
<p>Next, we are interested in the effect of social structural location on disability accommodation (introduced in Model 3). Although there were no significant effects for gender and immigrant status, workers with lower levels of education were more likely to have unmet needs. However, disability controls added in Model 4 render the effect of education insignificant and suggest that the well-documentated relationship between social class and health was driving the results related to education and income in previous models. In other words, from the health literature we know that low-wage, less educated workers experience earlier disability onset and greater disability severity which, in turn, may be more difficult to fully accommodate in the workplace. The inclusion of these control variables explained the greater risk of unmet needs among low-wage and less educated workers that we saw in Models 2 and 3. The introduction of controls for disability also explained the greater odds of having an unmet need among those with no employment income in the previous year seen in the earlier models, suggesting the effect may have been a function of higher levels of disability severity among those exiting and reentering the labor market. Controls for the duration of the limitation and degree of severity introduced in Model 4 also changed some of the earlier relationships; in particular, the effect of manufacturing occupations and employment in a small firm was no longer significant. In terms of the disability measures themselves, degree of severity was a significant predictor of accommodation, with the odds of having an unmet need increasing 58% in conjunction with an increase in the degree of severity ((e<sup>.455</sup> –1) × 100). In addition, workers with a disability of long duration were 55% more likely to have unmet needs ((e<sup>.440</sup> –1) × 100).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Work in today’s globalized economy involves a greater reliance on nonstandard work arrangements, including temporary workforces and part-time positions. From existing literature we know that nonstandard arrangements offer workers fewer protections and present additional risks associated with lower levels of job security, wages, and benefits. However, the protections provided to workers through legally mandated disability accommodation practices have not been included in discussions of the insecurity and inequality associated with nonstandard work. Thus the goals of this article were threefold. First, we wanted to investigate whether form of employment is related to disability accommodation in the workplace. Second, we were interested in whether key dimensions of employment that indicate greater precariousness and are often associated with nonstandard arrangements mediate this relationship. Third, we asked whether the relationship between nonstandard employment and disability accommodation is gendered and racialized.</p>
<p>Results addressing our first goal support the addition of disability accommodation to the list of disadvantages associated with nonstandard work. From bivariate and early multivariate models we found that nonpermanent (temporary, contract, or on-call) and part-time workers are more likely to have unmet accommodation needs. However, since previous research suggests that there are important variations across nonstandard arrangements, our second goal was to assess whether other key dimensions of work associated with precariousness helped to explain these initial relationships. Here is where differences emerged between part-time and nonpermanent arrangements. Key dimensions of employment mediated the relationship between part-time work and unmet needs, indicating that characteristics of employment associated with precariousness, such as union representation and location in the wage structure, are more important to having unmet accommodation needs than part-time status. In contrast, temporary and contract workers remain disadvantaged in access to accommodations regardless of employment context, social structural location, or disability status. For these workers, neither legal or union protections reduce the greater risk of having unmet needs, perhaps as a result of a greater reluctance among employers to accommodate temporary workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0730888413481030">Schur, 2003</xref>) in conjunction with a lower threshold for establishing reasonable accommodation through arbitration for workers in temporary arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0730888413481030">Lynk, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Key dimensions of employment associated with precariousness not only partially explain the effect of nonstandard arrangements but they also have strong direct effects on accommodation. In particular, we found nonunion workers at greater risk of having unmet needs. Literature on the importance of unions for securing protections for workers abound, however, disability accommodation is rarely included in the discussion. Indeed, some research suggests that unionized workplaces may be harmful for the accommodation of workers’ needs because collective bargaining agreements are designed to protect collective rather than individual employee interests. As a result, union employees who request accommodations may be more limited in the types of accommodations they receive because employers may have less discretion in modifying work arrangements (through remedies such as job reassignment, for example) while upholding other requirements of the collective agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0730888413481030">Balser, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0730888413481030">Roberts &amp; Lundy, 1995</xref>). However, research also suggests that unionized workers may have a heightened sensitivity to mistreatment and be more likely to express dissatisfaction and report discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0730888413481030">Balser, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0730888413481030">Freeman &amp; Medoff, 1986</xref>). This increased awareness of employers’ responsibilities and the presence of a formalized grievance procedure through which to voice concerns over unfair treatment has the potential to shift the balance of power within the workplace, giving workers a greater ability to express their needs. An empowered workforce may feel more secure disclosing a disability to an employer and expressing a need for accommodation.</p>
<p>The issue of disclosure is important because before a disability can be accommodated a worker first needs to request accommodation from an employer. The term disability, although grounded in the real functional limitations that people experience, is also a social construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0730888413481030">Lorber, 1997</xref>) and research points to the ways in which worker power and representation affects contestation over meanings, identity, and dignity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0730888413481030">Hodson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0730888413481030">Sallaz, 2010</xref>). Workplace discrimination and fear of marginalization may prevent workers from exposing their limitations or approaching their employer for modifications, particularly workers in precarious employment arrangements whose low-wage and low-skill positions tend to provide less power and control over the work process and make them more expendable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0730888413481030">Appelbaum et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0730888413481030">Ehrenreich, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0730888413481030">Yoshikawa et al., 2006</xref>). Previous research on disability accommodation finds that workers frequently cite concerns over the potential for discrimination and dismissal as a reason for nondisclosure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0730888413481030">Wilton, 2006</xref>). Research has also shown that workers in more precarious occupational locations are less likely to disclose a disability; for example, managerial and professional workers were the most likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0730888413481030">Ellison, Russinova, Macdonald-Wilson, &amp; Lyass, 2003</xref>) and women in nonunionized service jobs were the least likely to disclose a disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0730888413481030">Dyck &amp; Jongbloed, 2000</xref>). In addition, workers in more precarious arrangements are less likely to perceive discrimination in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0730888413481030">Balser, 2002</xref>), less likely to ask an employer for workplace accommodations, and are more likely to have requests for job modifications denied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0730888413481030">Harlan &amp; Robert, 1998</xref>). In sum, the unequal distribution of power in the workplace affects workers’ perceptions of discrimination and the process of disclosure and is one possible explanation for our findings regarding union representation.</p>
<p>In addition, broader labor market factors likely affect the disclosure and accommodation process. Decisions about the hiring and accommodation of worker disability occur within an historical context characterized by heightened company pressures to compete in today’s global economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0730888413481030">Abberley, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0730888413481030">Hahn, 1988</xref>). Pressures on companies to remain competitive set the stage for greater emphasis on cost-cutting and productivity, including expectations that workers will perform their jobs with greater speed and efficiency. Employers make decisions regarding the composition of their workforces within this context of global competition, evaluating the relative cost of hiring and retaining different kinds of workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0730888413481030">Gautié &amp; Schmitt, 2010</xref>). Employers demand from workers higher skills, flexible schedules, longer work hours, and the acceptance of contingency, and workers who are not able to operate within these parameters due to health limitations risk being phased out or marginalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0730888413481030">Carnoy, 2000</xref>). The present data were collected in 2006, toward the end of a period of economic expansion. In a tight labor market when the economy is good and unemployment is low, employers find it more difficult to fill vacancies and discriminatory practices become more costly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0730888413481030">Reimers, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0730888413481030">Schur, 2003</xref>). The extent to which economic prosperity brings greater protections for workers with disabilities and whether accommodation practices fluctuate with economic booms and downturns, is unknown. Structural constraints in labor markets overlap with the process of disability disclosure and may make workers in more precarious arrangement less likely to request assistance for fear of job loss or other negative repercussions or to receive accommodation. Such questions about time and process call for a panel study that follows workers and their experiences with disability and employment over historical and biographical time.</p>
<p>In contrast to the outcomes for union representation, firm size as an indicator of the degree of regulatory protection did not operate as anticipated. Reduced access to some regulatory protections for workers in small firms led to our hypothesis that workers with disabilities employed in these firms would be less likely to have their needs met. However, we found that after controlling for other key dimensions of employment, workers in small firms are less likely, rather than more likely, to have unmet needs. Perhaps this is a reflection of differences in managerial control strategies within small firms, which tend to be less hierarchical and more focused on indirect methods to control workers; strategies such as responsible autonomy, which gives workers greater freedom in how they perform their work tasks and is perceived as more responsive to workers’ needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0730888413481030">Friedman, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0730888413481030">2000</xref>), and management citizenship behavior, which is perceived as positive for workers as a result of its commitment to ethical and supportive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0730888413481030">Hodson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0730888413481030">Rubin &amp; Brody, 2011</xref>). However, that the effect of firm size disappears with controls for disability status suggests that workers in small firms are less likely to have unmet needs because they have less severe limitations. Because of the unique features of small firms, it is difficult to know, for example, whether this is a function of a hiring process whereby owners of small firms are more reluctant to hire workers with disabilities, or is the result of these workers disproportionately seeking employment in larger firms that are more likely to have formalized accommodation processes in place and managers with more positive attitudes toward disability legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0730888413481030">Hernandez, Keys, &amp; Balcazar, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Low-wage work was also included in the analysis as an indicator of precarious employment arrangements. Educational attainment served as an indicator of social class and knowledge surrounding an employer’s legal responsibility to accommodate the disability needs of workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0730888413481030">Ellison et al., 2003</xref>). Both were significant predictors of unmet need in early multivariate models, with low-wage, less-educated workers more likely to have unmet needs. However they were not significant in the final model that incorporated controls for disability status. Their early significance likely reflects disproportionately high rates of poor health and disability among workers of low socioeconomic status. In addition to the role of power discussed above, the more precarious health and greater levels of disability among this group of workers may make it more difficult to fully accommodate their needs in the workplace, particularly since low-wage work tends to be more physically demanding and labor intensive.</p>
<p>Occupational context also provides some interesting results. Of all occupational categories, workers in occupations unique to manufacturing and industry have the highest risk of having unmet needs, while managerial occupations have the lowest and sales and service occupations lie somewhere in the middle. As indicated by a social model of disability (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0730888413481030">Oliver, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0730888413481030">Oliver &amp; Barnes, 2012</xref>, for example), the extent to which disability presents accommodation challenges is contextualized by occupation. Occupations differ in their requirements and demands, with some occupations such as postal driver proving more limiting to the functioning of a person who uses a wheelchair than another occupation where mobility functioning of the lower body is less important, for example (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0730888413481030">Altman, 2005</xref>). Another possible explanation for the effect of occupation relates to the distribution of power in the labor process and a greater ability of workers in jobs with higher status, in this case those in managerial and supervisory occupations, to use their status and power to generate greater rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0730888413481030">Avent-Holt &amp; Tomaskovic-Devy, 2010</xref>, p. 162). We would argue that this power-dependent distributive process applies not only to resources such as wages, as examined by Avent-Holt and Tomaskovic-Devy but also to the claiming of other types of resources such as accommodations that provide workers with greater security and protection. A third possible explanation has to do with the role of workplace culture within organizations and occupations. Some occupations that we found were associated with accommodation also have interesting historical roots when it comes to the organizational culture surrounding workers with disabilities. For example, occupations unique to manufacturing and industry are rooted in an organizational culture associated with the rise of the factory system and the “marginalization of disabled workers who could not follow standardized production schedules or who did not have the dexterity to perform certain tasks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0730888413481030">Malhotra, 2003</xref>, p. 103). That workers in this environment are more likely to have unmet needs is not surprising. Other research on the intersection of disability and workplace culture also discusses the beneficial role of a “justice climate” within an organization reflecting collective beliefs about the provision and handling of workplace accommodations and the extent to which employees are treated with “respect, dignity, and sensitivity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0730888413481030">Schur et al., 2009</xref>, p. 384; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0730888413481030">Liao, 2007</xref>). Yet other research points to the benefits for workers with disabilities of employment in more flexible organizations that place a high value on diversity, individual autonomy, and the consideration of employee needs, in contrast to the harmful effects of employment in bureaucratic organizations that value competitive achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0730888413481030">Stone &amp; Colella, 1996</xref>). In sum, our findings regarding the relationship between occupational location and disability accommodation likely reflect a complex process related to occupational demands, power dynamics, and workplace culture, and they raise many unanswered questions requiring further exploration.</p>
<p>Our third and final goal was to examine whether the relationship between nonstandard employment and disability accommodation is gendered and racialized. As there were no significant effects of gender or immigrant status on accommodation in any of the models, this portion of the analysis raises more questions than answers. Although literature suggests that the disadvantages of disability in the workplace are compounded for minority populations, our ability to explore such questions was restricted by a proxy measure that provides limited information regarding visible minority or immigrant status. In terms of gender, we know that women are more likely than men to work in part-time jobs and nonstandard arrangements and that there are gender differences in the outcomes of this employment (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0730888413481030">Vosko, MacDonald, &amp; Campbell, 2009</xref>). It is unclear whether women with disabilities are more likely to leave the labor market than men (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0730888413481030">Flippen &amp; Tienda, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0730888413481030">Loprest, Rupp, &amp; Sandell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0730888413481030">McDonough &amp; Amick 2001</xref>, for example), but the potential role of gender in the health selection out of employment calls for caution in cross-sectional examinations of gender and accommodation. The issue of health selection out of employment is relevant in other ways as well. Accommodation is part of a complex individual biography that often consists of pathways involving multiple disability-related labor force exits and reentry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0730888413481030">Burkhauser &amp; Daly, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0730888413481030">Campolieti, 2001</xref>), and the cross-sectional design of the current study is unable to capture the dynamic relationship between work and disability over the course of people’s lives. We know that workers with disabilities are disproportionately found in temporary, part-time, and service-sector jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0730888413481030">Kaye, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0730888413481030">Schur et al., 2009</xref>), but our data are unable to capture the process whereby workplace accommodation operates as a mechanism that sorts such workers both into nonstandard work as well as out of the labor force, and thus out of our sample. Our finding that workers without employment income in the previous year were more likely to have unmet needs provides a glimpse into this dynamic process. This group likely represents disabled individuals who have made at least one labor force exit and reentry, and their higher risk of having unmet needs suggests that even after returning to work they maintain a very precarious tie to the labor force. Research suggests that a change in health is often a better predictor of labor force exit than current health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0730888413481030">Bound, Schoenbaum, Stinebricker, &amp; Waidmann, 1999</xref>), and the extent to which changes in health status interact with accommodation practices to prevent or encourage labor market exit are best examined longitudinally.</p>
<p>In sum, results indicate that workers who occupy more precarious positions in their present jobs are more likely to have unmet needs. Practices of workplace disability accommodation parallel the distribution of other labor market protections, with workers in more precarious arrangements in nonpermanent, low-wage, nonunion jobs at greater risk of having unmet accommodation needs. Further research exploring the role of employer accommodation in the dynamic processes through which workers with various types of limitations rearrange the details of their employment and are sorted out of the labor market would greatly improve our understanding of the impact of new economy changes in the nature of work on workers with disabilities. Policies and practices designed to address the employment challenges of workers with disabilities are particularly salient given the threat of future labor shortages linked to population aging and the desire on the part of policy makers to create working environments that allow workers to stay in the labor force despite health limitations. What this research suggests is that legislatively mandated protections against health-related risks remain unequally distributed across employment contexts and are an additional feature of precarious work in today’s economy.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Workers with disabilities are overrepresented in nonstandard arrangements and are more likely to be in service jobs and less likely to be in managerial or professional jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0730888413481030">Hale et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0730888413481030">Schur, 2002</xref>). These workers have higher rates of job loss and lower levels of job security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0730888413481030">Baldwin &amp; Schumacher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0730888413481030">Yelin &amp; Trupin, 2003</xref>). Although temporary and part-time work has been discussed as offering workers with disabilities advantages in terms of discretion over work schedules and as a way of easing the transition from unemployment to full-time work, many would prefer full-time permanent employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0730888413481030">Schur, 2002</xref>). We know that there are many disadvantages of nonstandard employment such as lower wages, fewer benefits, and greater job insecurity. In addition, we find that these nonstandard arrangements also place workers with disabilities at a disadvantage in terms of the likelihood that their needs will be accommodated in the workplace.</p>
<p>Public policy in Canada is based on a conceptualization of disability that locates disability in the social environment, at the point of interaction between an individual and his or her surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0730888413481030">Oliver &amp; Barnes, 2012</xref>). Beginning in the late 1970s, legislation codified the right of people with disabilities to participate in society and guaranteed equal opportunity through the elimination of discriminatory or exclusionary practices of employers, including the failure to make accommodations for workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0730888413481030">Cook &amp; Burke, 2002</xref>). Canadian public policy operates within a model that strives for equality; and equality in the workplace for people with disabilities operates through the accommodation process. Such legislation is important because it recognizes that workplaces are not neutral in their treatment of people with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0730888413481030">Robert &amp; Harlan, 2006</xref>, p. 622). However despite these legislative provisions, our findings show that inequality in accommodations remains, mirroring other distributional processes in the labor market which generate higher levels of insecurity among workers in more precarious arrangements. Further research is needed to better understand the intersection between employment context and the accommodation process as a potential mechanism linking disability to unequal outcomes for workers.</p>
