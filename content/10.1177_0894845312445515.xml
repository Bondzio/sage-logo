The participants consisted of 3,241 male and 3,029 female students from the Korea Youth Panel Survey, a nationwide longitudinal study of South Korean adolescents. The present study explored the shape of the career maturity growth curve and the effects of sex-role stereotyping, gender, and socioeconomic status on the career maturity growth curve. Results indicated that the career maturity of Korean adolescents from 4th grade to 12th grade develops in a cubic manner. The authors found significant effects of household income and mother’s education level on the trajectory of the career maturity growth curve. The authors also found a significant, negative longitudinal relationship between sex-role stereotyping and career maturity as well as an interaction effect between gender and sex-role stereotyping on career maturity change. Implications for career guidance for Korean adolescents are discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>career maturity</kwd><kwd>sex-role stereotyping</kwd><kwd>Korean adolescents</kwd><kwd>SES</kwd><kwd>longitudinal study</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>While many scholars consider career development to be a lifelong process which takes place across the life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894845312445515">Gottfredson, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894845312445515">Super, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894845312445515">Tiedeman &amp; O’Hara, 1963</xref>), increasing attention is being paid to the role of career development in adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894845312445515">Creed, Prodeaux, &amp; Patton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894845312445515">Skorikov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894845312445515">Tan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894845312445515">Trice &amp; McClellan, 1994</xref>). Therefore, to better assist Korean adolescents in their career development, this present study was conceived to investigate career maturity longitudinal change of Korean adolescents from 4th to 12th grade.</p><sec id="section1-0894845312445515"><title>Career Maturity and its Developmental Features</title><p>The construct of career maturity was derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894845312445515">Super’s (1955</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894845312445515">1990</xref>) career theory emphasizing developmental perspectives on career. Career maturity has been defined as the individual’s capacity to make appropriate career choices that fit one’s abilities, interests, and vocational preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894845312445515">King, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894845312445515">Ohler, Levinson, &amp; Hays, 1996</xref>). It represents the degree to which one has gained the required information and abilities to make pragmatic career decisions, given one’s age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894845312445515">Levinson, Ohler, Caswell, &amp; Kiewra, 1998</xref>). Career maturity has been found to be positively associated with a number of important career-related variables, such as career decidedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894845312445515">Rojewski, 1994</xref>), work salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894845312445515">Naidoo, Bowman, &amp; Gerstein, 1998</xref>), and career decision self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894845312445515">Creed &amp; Patton, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894845312445515">Super (1955</xref>) theorized that people gradually develop career maturity with age, empirical studies have shown equivocal results on the relationship between career maturity and age (or school grade; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894845312445515">Patton &amp; Lokan, 2001</xref>). That is, the majority of studies found older students had a higher level of career maturity than younger students, but atypical findings of no difference between different age groups were also reported. Yet, previous literature appears to be insufficient to make a credible conclusion about developmental change of career maturity by age, because most studies used cross-sectional samples.</p><p>Contrary to the theoretical assumption of uniform development in career maturity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894845312445515">Patton and Lokan (2001</xref>) suggested career maturity would develop unevenly due to “practical consideration such as the planning activities needed for immediate decisions at transition points imposed by education systems” (p. 36). Thus, a growth curve of career maturity during adolescence may not progress in a linear fashion. Adopting a perspective of career theories considering developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894845312445515">Ginzberg, Ginsburg, Axellrad, &amp; Herman, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894845312445515">Gottfredson, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894845312445515">Super, 1980</xref>), we can expect a dynamic pattern in a growth curve. Given Ginzberg et al.’s three stages reflecting a developmental shift of career aspiration from fantasized to tentative to realistic occupations during adolescence, it would seem plausible that adolescents develop career maturity in a cubic fashion (i.e., S-curve shape). That is, when adolescents dream of fantasized careers in their early age, their perceived career maturity can appear to be increasing. When adolescents start to reconsider earlier fantasized career goals in favor of more realistic career goals, their shifting of aspiration and confusion can be expressed as stagnation or temporary decreases in career maturity. When they finally find more realistic and practical career goals in their late adolescence, their new found career decidedness can be shown again as increasing career maturity.</p><p>Yet, this hypothesis of a cubic growth curve has never been tested, maybe because it requires a substantial longitudinal sample which has multiple observed points over a long adolescence period as well as an appropriate statistical method. The present study met these requirements because the authors used a sample of nationally representative Korean adolescents from 4th grade to 12th grade. Use of linear mixed effects regression (LMER) analyses enabled us to track individual changes and explore patterns of career maturity changes over time.</p></sec><sec id="section2-0894845312445515"><title>Correlates of Career Maturity</title><p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894845312445515">Patton and Lokan’s (2001)</xref> review on career maturity research, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES) have received notable attention as correlates of career maturity. The majority of studies in their review found females in different age groups showed higher levels of career maturity than males in many countries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894845312445515">Cha, Kim, Lea, and Kim (2007</xref>) found similar results with high school students in South Korea.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894845312445515">Patton and Lokan (2001</xref>) found weak or no correlation between SES and career maturity in most previous research studies.

The recent special issue of <italic>Journal of Career Development</italic> (volume 36, number 1, 2009) is one example of the continuous attention that is given toward the impact of sex roles in career development. Considering sex-role socialization as an important social cultural factor, social cognitive career theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894845312445515">Lent et al., 1994</xref>) explained that the sex-role socialization process has a tendency to bias children’s access to certain experiences. Consequently, adolescents tend to develop interests and skills which are culturally gender appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894845312445515">Eddleston, Veiga, &amp; Powell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894845312445515">Hackett &amp; Betz, 1981</xref>). A recent study found eighth-grade boys and girls reported greater interest in and more self-efficacy for careers which they, respectively, perceived as male dominated and female dominated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894845312445515">Ji, Lapan, &amp; Tate, 2004</xref>). In South Korea, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894845312445515">Tak (1995</xref>) found Korean college students who held a stronger sex-role stereotype tended to choose occupations that matched their sex role, but those who had a weaker sex-role stereotype tended to choose occupations which matched their interests and aptitudes.</p><p>While there has been continuing attention paid to sex-role stereotyping and career development, little is known of the relationship between sex-role stereotyping and career maturity among adolescents. Given that a sex-role stereotype refers to a prevalent belief of distinct roles and behaviors between sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894845312445515">Broverman, Vogel, Broverman, Clarkson, &amp; Rosenkrantz, 1972</xref>), it is presumed that those who hold strong sex-role stereotypes adopt a traditional sex-role and aspire for jobs which are socially considered gender appropriate. In this manner, if stronger sex-role stereotyping limits one’s career options based on gender, how does it influence one’s career maturity? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894845312445515">Gottfredson (2005</xref>) suggested that sex-role stereotyping can impede career maturity development by leading adolescents to have premature occupational foreclosure. Therefore, we hypothesized that increased sex-role stereotypes would be associated with decreased career maturity over time (and vice versa) for both boys and girls. In addition, we hypothesized that sex-role stereotypes would have a differential impact on career maturity development for girls and boys, because recent research suggested that an influence of gender stereotype on one’s career preference is greater for women than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894845312445515">Gadassi &amp; Gati, 2009</xref>). Given that male-dominated occupations have been typically more prestigious and high paying than female-dominated occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894845312445515">Miller, Neathey, Pollard, &amp; Hill, 2004</xref>), sex-typing of occupations would have differential effects on career development for men and women.</p><p>This study is meaningful because the relationship between sex-role stereotypes and career maturity development was explored in the Korean cultural context. Historically influenced by a Confucian idea that there should be a distinction between the genders, Koreans traditionally believed men and women should be different and have a different role in a family and a society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894845312445515">Kim, 2001</xref>). Recent statistics suggest inequality is still prevalent in the Korean culture. Based on the recent Human Development Report by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894845312445515">United Nations Development Program (2009</xref>), South Korea ranked 25th of the 109 countries on the gender-related development index which measures gender inequalities in terms of “a long and healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living” (p. 210) but only ranked the 61st in terms of “economic participation and decision-making, political participation, and power over economic resources” (p. 210). In addition, the South Korean government Department of Statistics reported wives of working couples spend 5 times more time doing house work than husbands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894845312445515">Son, 2010</xref>). These reports suggest the effects of sex-role socialization on women’s career development are very influential in Korean society. In this context, this study has implications for those countries where sex-role stereotyping and gender inequality of career activities are predominant as well as for certain minority populations (e.g., Asian American and Latino American) in the United States who tend to hold strong traditional sex roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894845312445515">Sue &amp; Sue, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section4-0894845312445515"><title>The Present Study</title><p>This study investigated the longitudinal change of career maturity over time of adolescents in South Korea.

The KYPS was conducted by the Korean National Youth Policy Institute which is part of the National Research Council for Economics, Humanities, and Social Science in the Korean Prime Minister’s Office. The KYPS selected participants to represent Korean adolescents through a stratified multistage cluster sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894845312445515">National Youth Policy Institute, 2010</xref>). We used data from the KYPS that was administered to 3,449 junior high students and their parents every year for 5 years, starting in 2003, from their 8th-grade year to 12th-grade year (the 8th-grade cohort). We also used data from the KYPS that was administered to 2,844 elementary students and their parents every year for 5 years, starting in 2004, from their fourth-grade year to their eighth-grade year (the fourth-grade cohort). The sample consisted of 3,241 male students and 3,029 female students. In Korea, fourth graders are typically 9 years of age. The eighth and the ninth grades are a critical time period for Korean adolescents because they have to carefully think about their career path by choosing the type of high schools they would like to apply for. Students’ choice of major in college and their career tends to be influenced by the type of high school (e.g., liberal arts, technology, foreign language, science, and arts schools) students attend.</p></sec><sec id="section7-0894845312445515"><title>Measures</title><p>All measures were developed by the KYPS researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894845312445515">National Youth Policy Institute, 2010</xref>).

The LRT is based on the comparison between the reduced model and the full model which includes an additional variable or a set of variables. The model comparison process allowed us to construct the best fitting model to explain the career maturity growth curve. LMER was conducted for each model. LMER considers not only fixed effects, shared by all individuals, but also random effects which indicate individual deviations from the fixed effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894845312445515">Fitzmaurice, Laird, &amp; Ware, 2004</xref>).

The dependent variable was career maturity in the models. The time variable was students’ grade. The static covariates included cohort, gender, household income, father’s education, and mother’s education. The cohort variable was included as a control variable in the models to better reflect our combined data set and account for a potential cohort effect (J. Long, personal communication, July 8, 2010). Sex-role stereotyping and its interaction with gender were included as dynamic variables in the models. The intercept was anchored at the eighth grade because the eighth grade was the only grade point which had data from both cohorts in our data set. The cubic curve was preselected in models during model comparison process based on the hypothesis of the present study. Given individual differences in career development, it was expected that adolescents would show different levels of career maturity and have different growth trajectories over time. Thus, random effects were included for the intercept and the trajectory in models. Assuming individual difference in the relationship between sex-role stereotyping and career maturity, random effects were included for sex-role stereotyping which was a dynamic variable in the models. LMER models allowed us to examine the association of static variables with a career maturity growth curve as well as the association between changes in career maturity and changes in the dynamic variables.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="section13-0894845312445515"><title>Results</title><sec id="section14-0894845312445515"><title>Preliminary Analyses</title><p>The group means of career maturity for each grade were 2.685 (4th grade), 2.764 (5th), 2.775 (6th), 2.709 (7th), 2.623 (8th), 2.615 (9th), 2.717 (10th), 2.719 (11th), and 2.864 (12th). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0894845312445515">Table 2</xref> presents descriptive statistics and correlations among all study variables in the eighth grade.

Students whose mother had below a 10th-grade education started from lower levels of career maturity.

There was also a significant effect of the interaction between gender and sex-role stereotyping on career maturity change, which indicated a stronger negative longitudinal covariation between sex-role stereotyping and career maturity for female students than male students.

In other words, youth’s self-reported career maturity increases during the late elementary school period, decreases slightly during the junior high school period, and increases again during the high school period. The present study clarified the previously inconsistent findings noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894845312445515">Patton and Lokan (2001</xref>) in their review regarding career maturity and age. It is noteworthy that adolescents develop their career maturity with an uneven fashion over time and also faced stagnant or declining periods in career maturity during a given period. Two plausible explanations exist for this phenomenon.</p><p>First, considering the perspective that adolescents experience career development in different stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894845312445515">Ginzberg et al., 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894845312445515">Gottfredson, 1981</xref>), uneven growth in career maturity might be reflective of different stages in career development, and also stagnant or declining periods may represent the transition between stages. For example, according to Gottfredson’s theory, adolescents would change their career developmental stages from social valuation orientation to internal, unique self-orientation between ages 13 and 14. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894845312445515">Figure 1</xref>, career maturity of adolescents in this study appeared to decrease during this age period. Also, as we described in the introduction, this phenomenon may reflect adolescents’ general shifting in career aspiration from fantasized to tentative to realistic careers during adolescence. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894845312445515">Helwig’s (2001)</xref> longitudinal empirical study, the rate of fantasy occupational aspirations was high until the eighth grade (e.g., 39% for boys and 20% for girls) and this rate was reduced in later grades.</p><p>Second, uneven development in career maturity may reflect the reality of educational systems which require students to make a decision for their career path at specific stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894845312445515">Patton &amp; Lokan, 2001</xref>). For example, we suspect that career maturity of students sharply develops again around the ninth grade because Korean ninth graders (i.e., seniors in junior high schools) have to decide on the type of high school they want to attend. Given the high stakes surrounding this decision and the severe consequences these decisions have on students’ prospects for higher education, career planning activities may peak during such times.</p><p>Based on the results, female adolescents showed overall higher levels of career maturity than male adolescents across grades. This finding of gender difference in levels of career maturity is consistent with the results of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894845312445515">Cha and her associates (2007)</xref> study of 1,550 Korean adolescents. Cha et al. argued that female students are more engaged in activities which explore career information as well as their interests and skills and that for male students, low motivation was the main cause for career indecision.</p><p>Regarding the effects of SES, we found significant effects for household income and mother’s education level on the trajectory of career maturity growth curve. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0894845312445515">Figure 2</xref>, although differences in career maturity levels among three income groups vary over grades, students in the high-income group showed generally higher career maturity than those in the low- or medium-income groups. We surmise that those adolescents in poorer families have relatively limited access to job information as well as fewer role models in their social network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894845312445515">Rojewski, 1994</xref>) to potentially inspire their career aspiration. In addition, poor families in Korean society tend to have limitations in affording private education or extracurricular activities, which could help their children to explore more diverse interests and career paths. Due to more limited job opportunities and, hence, less diverse career role modeling in poorer regions, it is possible such a perceived lack of options contributes to a career mind-set that purely focuses on making money to survive. Of course this is realistic and by no means wrong, but it can certainly have the effect of discouraging a more expansive view of career development that incorporates interests, aptitude, and values.</p><p>The results suggest that mothers’ education has greater influence on career maturity growth of adolescents than fathers’ education. This finding is likely associated with Korean culture in which mothers are typically more responsible for a child’s education and guidance than fathers in families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894845312445515">Kim &amp; Hoppe-Graff, 2001</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0894845312445515">Figure 2</xref>, adolescents whose mothers held higher education levels showed higher career maturity across grades. We inferred that mothers with higher education pay more attention to their children’s future career and, consequently, they are better at helping children to explore career interests and skills.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the differences in career maturity levels by mothers’ education and household income were large in elementary grades, but decreased over time such that the differences were relatively small at the end of high school. This may imply influences of SES on students’ career maturity diminish in late adolescence, because, regardless of their SES backgrounds, all seniors are required to have certain career plans by the time they graduate. Some readers may presumably conclude the effect of SES on career development of adolescents is minimal because its influence on career maturity was weakening as adolescents get older. We argue, however, that the effects of SES on career development are still critical for later career development because even if students from different SES groups showed similar career maturity levels in late adolescence, career maturity gaps due to SES in early adolescence may still impact later career development. That is, those who showed higher career maturity in early adolescence could have been actively exploring their career interests and be better prepared in terms of academic record and job trainings than those who showed lower career maturity. Thus, those who belatedly find their career interests and experience delayed career maturity growth might be less competitive in job markets and, therefore, may end up pursuing less desirable jobs.</p><p>We found a significant negative longitudinal association between sex-role stereotyping and career maturity such that endorsing more traditional sex-role stereotypes over time would impede career maturity growth and vice versa. Since stronger sex-role stereotyping can lead to more sex-typing of occupations, we surmise that those who adopt strong sex-role stereotyping tend to unnecessarily narrow their career choice based on their gender and do not fully explore various career options which may better fit their interests and skills.</p><p>The interaction effect between gender and sex-role stereotyping on career maturity indicated that the impact of sex-role stereotyping on career development is greater for female students. Girls’ occupational sex-typing, influenced by sex-role stereotyping, may confine their aspiration to female dominant careers. Considering women have relatively lower socioeconomic status than males in Korean society, career aspiration confinement due to sex-typing of occupation could create more conflicts for female adolescents because they could be interested in male-dominated careers which tend to be higher paying and higher social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894845312445515">Park, 1993</xref>). In addition, historically Korean society has encouraged women to become “good wives and wise mothers” based on Korean Confucian tradition, but seldom emphasizes their roles as career women in society. Thus, when society imposes traditional sex-roles for girls, girls may not envision themselves as career women in society, and consequently not make efforts to pursue professional careers unless they consciously and intentionally decide not to become homemakers. In this respect, career counselors should pay attention to potential detrimental effects of sex-role stereotyping on career development of women, particularly in cultures and countries where women’s professional social role is not encouraged and gender inequality is prevalent.</p></sec><sec id="section19-0894845312445515"><title>Limitation and Future Research</title><p>Limitations of the present study and suggestions for future research are presented here. First, we assumed stronger sex-role stereotyping would be associated with more sex-typing of occupation, which potentially impedes career maturity growth, but participants’ sex-typing of occupation was not directly assessed. Thus, further research should examine participants’ career aspirations and directly investigate the relationship between sex-role stereotypes and sex-typing of occupation and its effect on career development. Second, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894845312445515">Boslaugh (2009</xref>) identified as a limitation of secondary data analysis studies, we did not have control of using particular measures in this study. The number of items for career maturity and sex-role stereotyping measures was small and the reliability of the career maturity measure was low for certain measurement points. Thus, further research using well-established measures to confirm our findings is recommended. Finally, the statistically significant results should be interpreted with caution, because of a large sample size and ensuing statistical power in our analysis.</p></sec><sec id="section20-0894845312445515"><title>Implications</title><p>The findings of the present study provide useful information for career guidance and intervention. First of all, career counselors should be aware of overall changes in career development of adolescents and provide timely, appropriate support. For those junior high students who experience decreasing career maturity, counselors should normalize their confusion by helping them consider their struggle as tentative transition to find clearer and realistic future career. Also, counselors and teachers should provide intensive support for those students (e.g., Korean seniors in middle schools and high schools) who are required to make far-reaching career decisions due to their education systems. Given the effect of SES on career maturity was more influential in elementary grade levels, counselors and teachers should pay extra attention to students from low SES backgrounds in the early adolescence period. If schools offer career workshops where students can obtain career information and meet role models in various fields, gaps in career development due to the SES might be partially reduced.</p><p>In cultures where distinct sex-roles are emphasized, adolescents’ sex-typing of occupation can be prominent. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894845312445515">Gottfredson (2005</xref>) stated, however, “guidance systems neither can nor should instruct students that sextyped choices are wrong or less worthy, but they can help keep children’s sextype boundaries fluid” (p. 92), so that their interests, skills, and values can be considered in their career exploration. Considering that female adolescents have higher career maturity but women have low social economic status in society, simply helping female adolescents find career information related to their interests can be insufficient for women’s career development, because women tend to perceive more barriers such as role conflicts in the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894845312445515">Luzzo, 1995</xref>) and gender inequality in society than men. As the Korean neologism “Super Mom” implies, Korean society has started to expect women to fulfill the role of career women as well as caregivers for the child. Men’s participation in housework and child care, however, has remained unchanged and minimal. Thus, counselors can not only help female students to overcome social obstacles but also practice and possibly role-play the types of conversations they may have with family members in sharing these different sex-role expectations. Counselors also need to facilitate the challenging of sex-role stereotyping by male students to create a flexible perception of their own and women’s role in family and society. Finally, but most importantly, counselors need to be able to differentiate between female students’ internal values and career choices from values and choices which are gender-oppressive, given that Confucian tradition emphasizing women’s role as a supportive homemaker in the family remains forceful in Korean culture. Therefore, the career counselor’s job in this Korean context requires artful oscillating between respect for cultural traditions while at the same time challenging gender biases.
