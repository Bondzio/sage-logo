<abstract>
<p>A Sydney-based megachurch with global reach, well-known for its “prosperity gospel” of financial acquisition, has developed an additional strand: a detailed theology of consumption. The affinity between a theology of guilt-free—indeed, obligatory—consumption and late capitalism goes some way towards explaining the attraction this minority strand of Christianity holds for politicians, including those without personal religious commitments, in a secular electorate.</p>

<sec id="sec1-2050303213476108" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Continuing an almost unbroken decline, the nation’s lowest-ever religious adherence was shown in Australia’s 2011 census, with 61 per cent of respondents claiming a Christian belief. Those claiming “no religion,” at over 22 per cent, included Australia’s Prime Minister, Julia Gillard.</p>
<p>On that basis, one might predict religion fading also from Australia’s politics. In fact, religion has become salient in public life, particularly since the late 1990s, almost in proportion to declining population levels of religiosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2050303213476108">Crabb, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2050303213476108">Maddox, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2050303213476108">2005</xref>). PM Gillard and her immediate predecessors, Kevin Rudd and John Howard, have been enthusiastic deployers of religious tropes in political discourse and funders of religiously-inflected policy. These factors challenge significant aspects of the secularization hypothesis as conventionally understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2050303213476108">Maddox, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In brief, an additional important feature of the new, heightened religiosity in Australian politics is the kind of religion that has become prominent. Until the early 1990s, the religious traditions with the greatest political impact, measured in terms of media presence and access to senior politicians, were also those that the majority of religiously-practicing Australians attended—namely, the mainline Christian churches. From the late 1990s, that changed: senior politicians were more likely to attend events organized by, and hold meetings with, representatives of evangelical and Pentecostal minority denominations and parachurch groups—a transformed Christianity that is summed up as “the megachurch,” or, more accurately, “growth church” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2050303213476108">Maddox, 2012</xref>). Such churches have been distinguished by a determined orientation towards growth, which leads to virtually abandoning potentially off-putting features, such as speaking in tongues, and to a reliance on appearing entirely conventional.</p>
<p>A clear representation of this new Christianity is Sydney-based Hillsong Church. Its services resemble popular television shows; its members are young, hip and upwardly-mobile. At Hillsong, this article locates a complement to the prosperity gospel: not just focused on making more money, the adherent must be an ideal consumer. Australia’s largest congregation, claiming over 20,000 worshippers per weekend, invests extraordinary effort in coaching its members in what sort of consumers they should be; in how to regard a particular, capitalist version of consumption as not merely permissible but as a religious duty; in how to market themselves as commodities in both the economic and spiritual marketplace; and how to use their abilities as skilled consumers, self-marketers and self-promoters as tools of evangelism, bringing others to the cause of similarly skilled consumption and marketing.</p>
<p>From its main campus in Sydney’s north-west, and with other campuses across Sydney, Hillsong also has offshoots in Konstanz, Kiev, London, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Paris, Capetown, and New York, broadcasts its televised services in at least 160 countries, but reaches furthest through its chart-topping music sales. Hillsong Sydney’s main campus is located in the fast-growing “technology corridor,” home of companies such as Microsoft, Toshiba, Sony, Hyundai, Siemens, Fuji-Xerox, and Foxtel. Hillsong’s second campus, in inner city Waterloo, is surrounded by some of the city’s trendiest brasserie-style eateries and design shops. For the present study, I attended services between 2008 and 2011, listened to many hours of CD and DVD sermons, and also participated in its national women’s conferences, “Colour Your World,” in 2008 and 2009, and in a women’s leadership training program, “Shine,” in 2009.</p>
<p>Hillsong joins other prosperity advocates in interpreting “fullness of life” (John 10:10) as not only spiritual but also material blessing. Hillsong senior pastor Brian Houston has published such striking titles as <italic>You Need More Money: Discover God’s Amazing Financial Plan for your Life</italic> and <italic>Get a Life: Principles for Success and Enjoyment in Every Area of Life</italic>. Hillsong imports a stream of prosperity preachers, especially American, such as Jerry Savelle, known for “talking people into winning.” Savelle’s book, <italic>Send Prosperity Now</italic>, shows “the direction you need to receive God’s breakthrough power on your finances” for “a blessed financial future.” Every few years lately, Hillsong’s annual conference features Dallas pastor T D Jakes, who defends his lavish lifestyle because “Jesus was a rich man” and “The myth of the poor Jesus needs to be destroyed because it’s holding people back.”</p>
<p>Several sociologists of religion have analyzed Pentecostalism as a suitable theology for highly deregulated, post-industrial, service-based economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2050303213476108">Cox, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2050303213476108">Martin B, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2050303213476108">Martin D, 2008</xref>). Rather than fostering the virtues of solidarity and community, advantageous in the village or factory floor and beloved of social gospel and liberation theologies, Pentecostalism stresses the individual virtues of initiative, aspiration, self-belief and self-motivation. These analyses share with Marx and Weber an interest in how religion contributes to people’s self-understanding and legitimating world views in relation to themselves as workers or producers.</p>
<p>Unlike Weber’s Calvinists, however, Pentecostals’ theological origins lie in the holiness tradition, and, from early Methodism’s proclamation of the possibility of universal salvation, Hillsong’s version of Pentecostalism has developed its own variety of Arminianism. Hillsong’s statement of faith, “What We Believe,” rejects the Calvinist theory of election, explaining that: “our eternal destination of either Heaven or hell is determined by our response to the Lord Jesus Christ.” Far from the sublimated election anxiety to which Weber attributed puritans’ worldly success, prosperity gospel Pentecostals are convinced that wealth, like salvation, is available to all who have faith enough to receive it.</p>
<p>It has become a commonplace in social theory that, by the late twentieth century, Western societies had made a transition to capitalism based on consumption. The part of the economy concerned with producing tangible goods is now dwarfed by intangibles such as financial services, personal services, and so on. Participants are no longer encouraged to see themselves primarily as producers (whether as workers or as owners of the means of production). Instead, they are primarily encouraged to see themselves as consumers—shoppers for goods, purchasers of services, users of media, and so on. Even though hyperconsumption of all these things obviously requires that they also be produced, the dominant image of a market participant has shifted from worker to consumer. Fittingly, Hillsong has developed a detailed theology of consumption—an insufficiently appreciated second strand of prosperity theology, highly visible in Hillsong’s explicitly gendered teaching. Here I concentrate on consumption theology directed towards women, which falls into two distinct components. I call them, respectively, “Envy evangelism” and “Born to shop.”</p>
<sec id="sec2-2050303213476108"><title>Envy evangelism</title>
<p>Brian Houston’s book, <italic>How to Flourish in Life</italic>, argues that “flourishing” financially is not an option but “a responsibility,” because “this kind of abundant life reveals and demonstrates the power of God.” Bobbie Houston, addressing one of Hillsong’s weekly women’s meetings, developed envy’s evangelistic potential still further, summed up her book title <italic>I’ll Have What She’s Having</italic>. Perhaps its most striking exposition is her CD set “Kingdom Women Love Sex,” reissued as <italic>She Loves and Values Her Sexuality</italic>. Christian wives should emulate advertisers’ standards of beauty, even resorting to plastic surgery “if it’s for the right reasons,” and certainly attending to diet and exercise: “Becoming a bit fitter could be advantageous to your sex life.” Nor is exercise merely cosmetic: “Girls, pelvic floor exercises. I have heard that orgasm is not as strong if you are really sloppy in that area.” The expressed goal is evangelism:
<disp-quote>
<p>We need to be good at sex ourselves so that if the world happens to come knocking we can tell the story of God in our lives. … we can say, “I have a great marriage and a great sex life” — wink wink, nudge nudge. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2050303213476108">Houston, 2004</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Hillsong has offered courses with themes like “Back in Shape Body Shaping Exercise Guide,” “Keeping Up Appearances” and “21 Day Fat Blasting Starter Plan.” A styled home, honed figure, elaborate grooming, lavish wardrobe and unmatched sex life stimulate one’s unsaved friends’ envy and, hopefully, their interest in Jesus, to whom all this is credited. Where Weber’s Puritans practiced <italic>innerweltliche Askese</italic>, Hillsong makes a religious duty of conspicuous consumption—one’s body, image and lifestyle are a walking evangelistic billboard.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-2050303213476108"><title>Born to shop</title>
<p>Early generations of Pentecostal women were discouraged from wearing makeup or fashionable clothes. Some reported the Holy Spirit taking over their bodies in protest when they attempted to put on the jewelry they had worn before they were saved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2050303213476108">Blumhofer, 1993</xref>). Spiritual beauty was the goal, and worrying about physical appearance a dangerous distraction. Hillsong women still hear occasional references to spiritual beauty, but much more often physical beauty. Hillsong’s weekly women’s meetings can begin with “pamper” sessions that range from a simple hand massage to a manicure, with nail polish or face massage with perfumed creams and makeup.</p>
<p>Shine is a Hillsong course for girls aged 12 to 18 which runs over about six weeks and is offered in schools, both state and private, around Australia, in some cases as an alternative to compulsory sport, or as part of the school’s personal development program. Shine also runs in juvenile prisons and other state-sponsored centers for troubled girls, as well as in numerous churches, and even a Sikh temple. According to its program materials, the course aims to teach girls that “I have worth! Through skincare, makeup, haircare and nailcare, girls discover their value in their God created uniqueness.” The program begins with a session on grooming—makeup application, hairstyles, nailcare, and so on. Later sessions deal with such topics as self-esteem, friendships, and relationships. The program concludes with a lunch or dinner for which the girls are encouraged to dress up, are picked up by chauffeur-driven cars and taken to a high-end restaurant (or, where this is not possible, such as in detention, hold a banquet on the premises). The goal is that, by the end of the course, they should have learned to see themselves as “princesses.”</p>
<p>Claiming one’s status as a princess is central in Hillsong women’s teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2050303213476108">Maddox, 2013a</xref>). Advertising materials for Hillsong women’s events often depict young, beautiful women wearing tiaras and references to princesses as “daughters of the King”; some attendees at the events I attended wore plastic tiaras; T-shirts and other merchandise for sale at the many stalls were decorated with diamante-studded tiaras and swords.</p>
<p>Princesses are an obvious fit for prosperity theology: they are, by definition (at least in their popular, Disney version), automatically associated with wealth. But, crucially, they occupy a very clear side of the producer−consumer divide. No one could imagine a princess producing anything (other than heirs). Even in the fairytales in which princesses briefly occupy a producer role—being credited with spinning straw into gold, or helping turn pumpkins into coaches, for example—they do these things only before they are elevated to princess standing, and usually with supernatural help. Real princesses look beautiful, and consume.</p>
<p>Moreover, princesses (the popular, Disney, swords-and-tiaras kind iconic at Hillsong, that is) excel at a particular kind of consumption. Their nearest real-life approximations are Grace Kelly, Diana Spencer, and now Kate Middleton. All are (or were) personal brands significantly created by the fashion industry, even as they simultaneously also became among the fashion industry’s greatest marketing weapons. Both the Disney princess archetype and identifiable modern princesses provide exemplary role-models for the aspiring feminine consumer. And the kind of gendered, princess-like consumerism into which Hillsong women are coached holds a very high place in the church’s understanding of the Christian life. For consumerism is more than a duty of “envy evangelism.” Buying into the ideology and lifestyle of consumerism can be salvific in itself.</p>
<p>Hillsong stresses gender complementarity, and “femininity” is divinely-ordained. In the CD series, <italic>She Loves and Values Her Femininity</italic>, a leader in Hillsong’s internationally influential music enterprise, Catrina Henderson, reported that her “femininity came under attack” when she was sexually abused as a child. In response, “I rejected my femininity,” meaning she hated pink, disliked shopping, took no interest in accessories or flowers and avoided weddings and babies. Looking back, she explained to a Hillsong women’s audience in 2007, she was able to understand that she had become “hardened and unappealing” because, deep-down, she associated femininity with “fear, shame and brokenness.”</p>
<p>Redemption was gradual. “I fell in love, for the first time in my life, with the man of my dreams—Jesus—and my femininity started to stir.” Then, “God brought good friends into my life who didn’t have a problem with their femininity,” epitomizing “accessories and shoulder pads to the max.” One took her shopping:
<disp-quote>
<p>to buy jeans that actually showed I had legs. And I’d be like, “Are you sure?” and she’d be “Yeah, they look hot,” and I’d be “That’s what I’m worried about!”</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>With Jesus’ help, Henderson learned to look in the mirror; then to buy accessories, wear pink and “accept compliments,” and could finally attest: “Now, I love being a woman, I love my femininity, I celebrate it.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2050303213476108">Houston et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Failure to hone their looks into a commercially-sanctioned ideal of feminine beauty is the nearest Hillsong women are likely to hear about sin, at least in any publicly-accessible forum. God’s plan for human life includes strong gender differentiation, which, for women, is normatively expressed through a hyperfeminine aesthetic of fashion, makeup, attention to hair and nails. Hillsong women are literally born to shop—because not to shop is to thwart one’s God-given destiny.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-2050303213476108"><title>Born to be led</title>
<p>A feature of consumerist ideology, which is frequently noted in sociological accounts, is the notion of consumer sovereignty. In the 1930s, William Harold Hutt explicitly hailed a democracy of the market, arguing that “consumers’ sovereignty has at least the same measure of social validity as a ballot decision” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2050303213476108">Hutt, 1990</xref>: 262). Stefan Schwarzkopf argued that sovereign consumers are “invested with the same destructive moral absolutism that had once characterized pre-modern monarchs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2050303213476108">Schwarzkopf, 2011</xref>: 124).</p>
<p>Whether liberal-democratic or monarchic-totalitarian, consumer sovereignty is not a theme in Hillsong’s feminine ethics of consumption. Although sovereignty might superficially seem congruent with the princess motif, a scan of the lives of the iconic princesses and Disney prototypes reveals that such princesses exercise very little real power: they are, at best, decorative adjuncts to an actual sovereign. Hillsong princesses, too, are carefully coached not to expect power in this present existence. In tune with a sovereign/princess imbalance, in Bobbie Houston’s and other Hillsong leaders’ teaching, women’s power is deeply ambivalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2050303213476108">Maddox, 2013a</xref>).</p>
<p>According to Bobbie Houston:
<disp-quote>
<p>Our roles are that Brian is … senior pastor, and because I’m married to him and connected in heart and soul with him … I am seen and respected as senior pastor with him also. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2050303213476108">Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2005</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Brian Houston explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>We’re very much a team … I’ve got a conservative, biblical idea that a man should take a role of leadership in his life, but I certainly don’t adhere to the mentality that a woman must submit or that she should be pushed down. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2050303213476108">Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2005</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Bobbie Houston warned the 2006 Hillsong men’s conference, “When you guys … don’t lead, don’t influence … it badly affects us [women] … We can survive without you … but it doesn’t lend itself to health” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2050303213476108">Houston, 2006</xref>). Hillsong’s ten-week “Woman to Woman” course discusses “right &amp; wrong submission” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2050303213476108">Hillsong Church, not dated</xref>). Such ordering is not necessarily inconsistent with Brian Houston’s depiction of his marriage as “a team”: seasoned listeners to megachurch sermons replete with sports metaphors will not need reminding that every team consists of a captain or coach who directs the play, and ordinary players who take up their positions according to a game plan set out for them.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-2050303213476108"><title>The politics of prosperity</title>
<p>Hillsong’s gendered theology has an elective affinity with highly gendered, consumerist culture. In Hillsong’s version, men make money that women spend. Women, as we have now seen, need to be part of a couple, with a man who “leads” and “influences.” And those men are the subject of their own stream of prosperity theology, one whose coaching lines push them towards taking their place as “leaders” in the postmodern economy. Yet they are encumbered by what Arlie Russell Hochschild, in her study of Silicon Valley employees, called the “drag coefficient,” meaning the personal factors that might cause an employee to prioritize anything other than the demands of the employer: “Living at some distance from the Valley, and/or being burdened with a wife or child, lifts the ‘drag coefficient’ and lowers the applicant’s chances of employment.” An ideal employee would even “leave the company when they are no longer needed, without complaint or litigation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2050303213476108">Hochschild, 2001</xref>: xix−xx).</p>
<p>In an economy in which a wife or child is likely to be viewed as an encumbrance, a wife who can be relied upon to put her and her children’s needs second to the husband’s, and to follow his changeable circumstances without attachments to other bonds, is the next best thing to no wife. Indeed, an employee with such a wife may be no more encumbered, but considerably happier, and thus a better employee, than one without.</p>
<p>Thus the ideology of wifely submission, at first glance so out-of-kilter with twenty-first century assumptions, turns out to fit at least some aspects of the postmodern economy remarkably well. But twenty-first century women know that submission is not their only option. And consumer culture offers powerful enticements: the whole panoply of consumer goods that might once have been considered guilty pleasures are spread before the Hillsong princesses. But possession, use and discard are recast. No longer a temptation, the whole cycle is now a sacred obligation; to resist is to thwart God.</p>
<p>Among the thousands attending Hillsong’s 2005 annual conference were sixteen state and federal politicians. Several addressed the congregation. The only speaker from the Labor side of politics was NSW State Premier Bob Carr, who gave Hillsong what one journalist described as “a full sales pitch” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2050303213476108">West, 2005</xref>), commending the “prosperity gospel” and the church’s “optimistic and upward-striving” style. Carr, at the time of writing, is federal foreign minister and shares with the Prime Minister that, throughout his public life, he has never identified as a religious person. He has not revisited Hillsong (both the church and the politicians became more circumspect after the 2005 extravaganza), but the government in which he now serves has only intensified several of its predecessors’ policy positions reflecting elective affinities between consumer capitalism and the theology of prosperity and conspicuous consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2050303213476108">Maddox, 2013b</xref>).</p>
