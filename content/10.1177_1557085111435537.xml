<abstract>
<p>The impact of childhood gender polarization on adolescent problem behaviors and delinquent behaviors was measured through a survey of students in sociology and criminal justice classes. Three predictors were measured: parental gender-polarized attitudes during middle and late childhood, gender-coded activities during middle and late childhood, and parental heteronormative expectations regarding dating, romance, and marriage. Gender-coded activities increased the risk of problem and delinquent behaviors for both boys and girls, but gender-polarized attitudes affected only girls, and heteronormative expectations affected both female heterosexual and lesbian/bisexual respondents. Significant differences were found based on the race and social class of the respondents.</p>

<p>One of the more perplexing areas of juvenile delinquency is the so-called “gender gap” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1557085111435537">Rennison, 2009</xref>), or the differential between male and female juveniles’ problem and criminal behaviors. In 2006, females constituted only 19% of juvenile arrests for violent offenses in the United States, 33% of arrests for simple assault, and 32% of arrests for disorderly conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1557085111435537">Puzzanchera, 2008</xref>). Female adolescents are far less likely to engage in violent, threatening, and aggressive acts that do not result in arrest; for instance, according to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1557085111435537">Center for Disease Control’s (2008)</xref> Youth risk behavior surveillance report, 7.5% of female and 28.3% of male students had carried a weapon, and 26.5% of female and 44.5% of male students had been in a physical fight.</p>
<p>However, females constituted 57% of juvenile arrests for running away from home, 69% for prostitution, and 70% for shoplifting. In addition, females are more likely than males to exhibit nonviolent problem behaviors, such as emotional disorders and difficulties with peers. A secondary data analysis of the <italic>National Survey of Adolescents</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1557085111435537">Kirkpatrick &amp; Saunders, 2009</xref>) reveals that 25.1% of male and 36.3% of female high school students had suffered from depression, 19.6% of male and 27.8% of female had lost a close friend, and 9.7% of male and 17.5% of female students had considered suicide.</p>
<p>Thus, we can conclude that although both juvenile boys and girls engage in property crimes, drug and alcohol abuse, and many status offenses in approximately equal numbers, boys are more likely to engage in destructive activities that are overt, directed at others, and public (assault, vandalism), whereas girls tend to engage in activities that are covert, directed at themselves, and private (shoplifting, running away from home). How can we explain these differences?</p>
<p>In this study, we hypothesize that promoting stereotypic feminine-coded activities and interests during childhood increases the risk of nonviolent problem behaviors and criminal offenses in girls. Children raised by adults who consistently express gender-polarized attitudes, promote gender-polarized activities, and require heteronormative performance respond differently to the pressure to live up to these gender-polarized expectations. As gender polarization increases power and freedom in boys, male juveniles will generally maintain conventional behavior. Female juveniles, however, will perceive gender polarization as decreasing their power and freedom, and will therefore rebel through problem behaviors, or seek out alternative avenues to social capital through status and criminal offenses. Therefore, girls who grow up in gender-polarized households will be more likely to engage in nonviolent problem behaviors and criminal offenses than those who grow up in gender-neutral households.</p>
<sec id="section1-1557085111435537">
<title>Why Girls Become Delinquent</title>
<p>As assault and vandalism are noisy, aggressive, and threatening to outsiders, it is not surprising that most criminologists have concentrated on boys’ constellation of destructive activities. Many criminologists cite hegemonic masculinity, which posits “challenges” to boys’ masculine identity, internal or external accusations of femininity that require disconfirmation through assault, vandalism, burglary, and drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1557085111435537">Collier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1557085111435537">Messerschmidt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1557085111435537">Miedzian, 2002</xref>). Theoretically girls are untouched by accusations of failed masculinity and therefore less likely to engage in these behaviors.</p>
<p>Theories about adult female offenders usually reference differentials in economic opportunity that encourage property crimes, or else deficits in public sphere interaction that inhibit violent crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1557085111435537">Miller &amp; Mullins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1557085111435537">Simon &amp; Ahn-Redding, 2005</xref>), However, they do not generally address the situations of delinquent girls, or the different constellation of offenses committed by female juveniles and adults. In 2008, the female percentage of juvenile and adult arrests differed significantly in family offenses, simple assault, embezzlement, fraud, gambling, arson, prostitution, and vandalism (Uniform Crime Reports).</p>
<p>In April 2010, the Girls Study Group of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention published a report on <italic>Causes and Correlates of Girls’ Delinquency</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1557085111435537">Zahn et al., 2010</xref>). Although it acknowledged that male and female juveniles differ considerably in the type and severity of their delinquent acts, the predictive factors it discussed in girls were substantially the same as those that predict delinquency in boys: poor and inconsistent parenting, parental deviance, school and neighborhood environment, deviant peers, and lack of prosocial involvement. Other criminologists who discuss female delinquency suggest that when girls do become delinquent, it is because they are victimized more severely than boys by the same causal factors, especially sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1557085111435537">Flowers, 2001</xref>), or because they are easily swayed by male friends and romantic partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1557085111435537">Morash, 2006</xref>). Such explanations of female delinquency have been criticized as replicating a centuries-old stereotype of the female as naturally innocent, becoming criminal only when she is “led astray” by a male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1557085111435537">Belknap &amp; Holsinger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1557085111435537">Britton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1557085111435537">Chesney-Lind &amp; Shelden, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1557085111435537">Chesney-Lind &amp; Shelden (2003</xref>, p. 29) suggest that these theories are actually designed to explain boys’ delinquency, with girls thrown in as an afterthought.</p>
<p>Several theories move beyond the existence of delinquency itself and attempt to account for the different constellation of offenses in male and female delinquents. Psychological theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1557085111435537">Moffitt, Caspi, Rutter, &amp; Silva, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1557085111435537">Zoccolillo, 1993</xref>) discuss the impact of sex-differentiated genes, neurotransmitters, physiological systems, and such emotional development factors as constraint and negative emotionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1557085111435537">Moffitt et al., 2001</xref>, p. 124) on aggressive and antisocial behaviors. Social control theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1557085111435537">Costello &amp; Mederer, 2003</xref>) argues that the values of hegemonic masculinity (toughness, autonomy) push boys toward rebelling against prosocial norms, whereas the values of conventional femininity (compliance, passivity) pull girls toward noncriminal problem behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1557085111435537">Ericcson and Jon (2006)</xref> found that boys in a juvenile detention center, far from being forced to respond to accusations of femininity, were perceived as excessively masculine (“They overdid it; their boyishness was excessive”), whereas girls were perceived as insufficiently feminine, as violating their “natural virtue.”</p>
<p>Self-control theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557085111435537">Gottfriedson &amp; Hirschi, 1990</xref>) argues that the ability to restrain one’s antisocial impulses is the most significant predictor of delinquency and is reified both through environmental factors and socialization into the norms of conventional masculinity and femininity. Control balance theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1557085111435537">Tittle, 1996</xref>) suggests that hegemonic masculinity and conventional femininity impose epistemological constraints on the kinds of crimes that can be imagined; boys are likely to conceptualize themselves as criminal, and in fact often play games that involve pseudocriminality, whereas girls are likely to conceptualize themselves in a positive, prosocial manner. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1557085111435537">Jensen (2003)</xref> draws on social learning theory to augment conventional masculinity and femininity with both the internalization of “conventional moral beliefs” and the impact of deviant peers.</p>
<p>Power control theory suggests that gender-based parental power and privilege have different impacts on boys and girls. In “egalitarian” households, the mother and the father behave as equal partners, sharing parenting duties and decision making, but in “patriarchal” households, the father has the ultimate authority, whereas the mother quietly demurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1557085111435537">Hagan, Simpson, &amp; Gillis, 1987</xref>). As, according to Freudian theory, children most closely align with same-sex parents, boys in patriarchal households grow up with a sense of freedom and entitlement that increases their likelihood of aggressive and antisocial behavior, whereas girls grow up heavily constrained, likely to keep quiet and “not make waves.”</p>
<p>Power control theory gets bogged down in a limited definition of patriarchal control (primarily parental supervision and power differentials between parents). It has also been criticized for assuming that men and women bring radically different ideologies to parenting, that only families with “a mother and a father” exist, and that freedom from restraint necessarily leads to deviance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1557085111435537">Bates, Bader, &amp; Mencken, 2003</xref>). Recent tests of the theory have yielded mixed results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1557085111435537">Grasmick (1996)</xref> found that egalitarian, not patriarchal, households increase delinquency risk in girls. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557085111435537">Blackwell &amp; Piquero (2005)</xref> suggested that power control is antecedent to gender variations in self-control. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111435537">Mack and Leiber (2005)</xref> applied the theory to single-mother households, and found that patriarchy does not always derive from the influence of a father. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1557085111435537">Hadjar, Baier, Boehnke, and Hagan (2007)</xref> developed three power-control variables, and found that structural patriarchy, parenting style, and gender-role attitudes (ideological patriarchy) had different impacts under different circumstances.</p>

<sec id="section2-1557085111435537">
<title>Gender Polarization</title>
<p>The present study attempts to include multiple family types and household arrangements as well as influences external to the household by maintaining that gender and number of the custodial parents is not as relevant as the attitudes and expectations presented to the child. Instead of patriarchy, it operationalizes gender polarization, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1557085111435537">Sandra Bem (1994)</xref> defined as “the ubiquitous organization of social life around the distinction between male and female” (p. 80). In the ideology of gender polarization, men and women, boys and girls are expected to have completely different, purportedly innate abilities, tastes, psychological qualities, leisure interests, even conversational styles and favorite colors. Few if any scholars believe that the promoted traits and interests actually reflect physiological or psychological differences; they are ideological constraints forced on individuals, regardless of their true characteristics, to produce and maintain power differentials based on the assumption of gender, sexual orientation, race, and social class. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1557085111435537">Judith Butler (1993)</xref> states, sex is “a process whereby regulatory norms materialize ‘sex’ and achieve this materialization through a forcible reiteration of those norms” (p. 2).</p>
<p>Thus the traits, interests, and competencies forced on children are regimented as well as polarized. Traits, interests, and competencies that are masculine coded (that is, presumed characteristic of men and boys, regardless of their true characteristics) accrue more social capital than traits, interests, and competencies that are feminine coded (that is, presumed characteristic of women and girls, regardless of their true characteristics). Adults who maintain the ideology of gender polarization expect boys (or individuals classified as boys, regardless of their true gender identity) to exhibit high-power traits such as aggression, stoicism, group orientation, and comfort in the public sphere, and girls (or individuals classified as girls, regardless of their true gender identity) to exhibit lower-power traits such as passivity, emotionality, an individual orientation, and comfort in the private sphere. In short, boys are encouraged to be strong, and girls to be weak. Boys are given practically unlimited freedom, and the few limits, they are told, will be swept away when they become adults. Girls, however, are told that they must be constantly guard the boundaries of their bodies, their houses, and their lives against violent intrusion. Thus we see in toy catalogs that the recommended toys for boys involve heroic quests to save the universe, and the recommended toys for girls involve selecting fashion accessories.</p>
<p>Many theories suggest that the ideology of gender polarization is forced on juveniles with equal intensity and equal enthusiasm by all family members, friends, teachers, social institutions, and mass media texts. However, the present study maintains that there are vast differences in the how adults understand, believe, and adhere to the ideology of gender polarization, and thus how aggressively they encourage and discourage gender-polarized activities, interests, and traits. Teachers may praise girls for quiet, gentle play, and boys for loud, rough play, but parents allow their children whatever play style they prefer. Parents may give their sons a later curfew than their daughters or a bigger allowance, or external chores such as mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, regardless of the gender-neutrality practiced at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1557085111435537">Heimer, De Coster, &amp; Unal, 2006</xref>). Thus, some children will receive more, and more intense, exhortations to maintain the strictures of gender polarization, with resultant impact on their adolescent behavior.</p>
<p>Of particular importance is the way in which parents and other adult agents of socialization respond to “transgressions,” or evidence of nonhegemonic interests or traits (a boy who is quiet and shy, a girl who is loud and aggressive). Adults may actively encourage or discourage such transgressions. They may ignore them, their concept of a polarized “essence” triumphing over the specific circumstances of the child in their care. They may also marginalize or even punish transgressions in an attempt to steer the child away from interests and traits that they deem insufficiently masculine or feminine.</p>
<p>The ideology of gender polarization is usually bound together with heteronormativity, the presumption that heterosexual interest and practice are universal and inevitable, that a pubescent “discovery” of the other sex is an absolute, occurring in all children, as unavoidable as puberty itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1557085111435537">Dennis, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1557085111435537">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1557085111435537">Myers &amp; Raymond, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1557085111435537">Nielsen, Walden, &amp; Kunkel, 2000</xref>). Parents and other adults who promote gender polarization usually expect or require children to express heterosexual interest. They may interrogate boys concerning “What girl do you like?” or longingly evoke a girl’s future “husband and children.” They may consider heterosexual dates, romances, and even casual statements about cross-sex friends causes for celebration, and respond to a lack of “adequate” expression of heterosexual interest with concern, reprimand, or appointments with a counselor.</p>
<p>Although heteronormative expectations are common at home, at school and in the greater society, the fervor with which heteronormativity is applied can produce internalized homophobia in sexual minority youth and overt homophobia in heterosexual youth, as they begin to perceive sexual minorities as alien, abnormal, or evil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1557085111435537">Aboud, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1557085111435537">Durrell, Chiong, &amp; Battle, 2007</xref>). Homophobia is strongly associated with problem behaviors and delinquency in adolescence, as teenagers try to demonstrate that they are “not gay” through risk-taking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1557085111435537">Pascoe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1557085111435537">Poteat, Espelage, &amp; Green, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Gender polarized and heteronormative expectations occur through the lifespan, but they are most salient during middle and late childhood (ages 7 or 8 through 12 or 13), when children receive more responsibilities and have more freedom than they did before, but still depend on their parents and other adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1557085111435537">Coltrane &amp; Adams, 2008</xref>, p. 183). By early adolescence, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1557085111435537">Handel (2005)</xref> states, “Children evaluate their own thoughts, feelings, and actions according to the gender socialization they see in the culture” rather than through their own local situation (p. 295). Therefore gender-polarized attitudes and activities and heteronormative expectations promoted in middle and late childhood, more than in adolescence, are expected to correlate with problem and criminal behaviors in girls.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The impact of frequent or intense promotion of the ideology of gender polarization on problem behaviors, status offenses, and nonviolent criminal offenses was tested in a survey conducted on two stratified random samples of female students at a small university in New York. Obviously most college students have few serious criminal acts in their background; however, most juvenile acts that result in arrest do not consist of serious crime, but of vandalism, disorderly conduct, simple assault, and drug use, and self-reports demonstrate an even greater preponderance of the so-called “minor” offenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1557085111435537">Kirkpatrick &amp; Saunders, 2009</xref>). To ensure a representative distribution, responses were weighted by major. A total of 35.1% of respondents were majoring in one of the social sciences, 32.8% in child and family studies, 9.1% in humanities, 10.1% in the natural sciences, and 12.9% in other fields (weighted <italic>n</italic> = 658).</p>
<p>The frequency and intensity with which the ideology of gender polarization was promoted in childhood was measured through 53 questions regarding respondent experiences in middle childhood and adolescence, including school performance, extracurricular activities, community activities, leisure interests, household chores, and actions and statements by parents and other adults. It was acknowledged that asking about events from 10 or more years ago might produce inaccurate memory; however, all memory is a construct, events parsed, colored, and imbued with significance at the time and now recalled through the lens of the present. In effect, all memory is story. We were not interested in the objective reality of everyday life in respondents’ childhood homes so much as in the way in which the respondents recalled and interpreted their upbringing.</p>
<p>Data reduction through a varimax rotation with a Kaiser normalization yielded eight principal components, each with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Further analysis of the rotated components matrix yielded seven independent variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1557085111435537">Table 1</xref>):</p>

The index variable ranged from 11 to 71. The mean was 31.26, with a standard deviation of 9.09.</p>
<p>Nonviolent criminal behaviors measured the extent of adolescent participation in the criminal offenses most commonly appearing on juvenile self-reports. There were 11 questions, answered on a Likert-type scale from 1 (<italic>rarely or never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very often</italic>): Part One property crimes (shoplifting, other types of larceny, burglary), drug offenses (marijuana use, other illicit drug use), public order offenses (disorderly conduct), and other Part Two offenses (vandalism, disorderly conduct, simple assault, and counterfeiting an ID). The Part One violent offenses, homicide, rape/sexual assault, robbery, and arson, were omitted. The index variable ranged from 8 to 43. The mean was 11.23, standard deviation 3.35.</p>
<p>The main demographic variables studied were race, sexual orientation, and social class. Five categories of race/ethnicity (White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, and Other) were dichotomized into White/non-White. Four categories of sexual orientation (heterosexual/ lesbian/bisexual/other) were dichotomized into heterosexual/lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, questioning (LGBTQ). Social class was calculated through the occupation of the respondents’ two primary caregivers, classified by the Revised Socioeconomic Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1557085111435537">Stevens &amp; Featherman, 1981</xref>), and then divided into low (working/lower class) and high (middle/upper class).</p>

<p>Masculine- and feminine-coded activities derive from the advice, stipulations, and encouragements of adults, and also from the juvenile’s own choices. Therefore, these variables address not only adult ideas concerning gender polarization but also the juvenile’s own conception of “appropriate” masculine/feminine behavior, and anticipates the nexus of hegemonic masculinity and exclusion that scholars have found predictive of violent criminality in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1557085111435537">Kimmel &amp; Mahler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1557085111435537">O’Connor &amp; Kelly, 2006</xref>). Engaging in masculine-coded activities, one of the strongest predictors, may suggest “transgressions” that were punished by parents and other adults, resulting in a lowered self-image and an increase in the likelihood of risky behavior. Indeed, the measures may be interrelated; girls who are interested in masculine-coded activities may be more likely to hear gender-stereotyped and heteronormative statements, as the adults experience more anxiety over their “transgressions” and attempt to intervene.</p>
<p>Heteronormative expectations, another very strong predictor, proved surprising; less than 10 of the respondents reported a nonheterosexual identity, and one would not expect a question about “which boy do you like?” to trouble a heterosexual girl. Perhaps respondents’ self-designated sexual orientation did not fully capture the many variations of desire, behavior, and identity, particularly during childhood and adolescence, or perhaps heteronormative expectations represent an additional constraint, not only presuming heterosexual identity but also encouraging girls to define themselves through marriage and family.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1557085111435537">Table 3</xref> displays the unstandardized coefficients for linear regressions on nonviolent criminal offenses. Approximately, the same factors that predicted problem behaviors and status offenses predicted nonviolent criminal offenses: being non-White and working class and engaging in masculine-coded activities. However, in this case, feminine-coded activities did not act as a deterrent. We surmised that the ideology of gender polarization, whether promoted through gender-polarized activities, represents a social constraint that leads girls to react through delinquent acts.</p>

<p>To facilitate further analysis of the impact of demographic variables, the variables that specifically addressed gender polarization, masculine-coded activities, feminine-coded activities, gender stereotyping, and heteronormative expectations were dichotomized at the mean and recoded. The dependent variables, problem behaviors and nonviolent criminal offenses, were also dichotomized and recoded. 2 × 2 contingency tables were prepared, with chi-square and Phi (chi-square/number of cells) which provides a more reliable measure of the strength of the association between a single independent and a single dependent.</p>
<p>We found no significant causal impact of social class on differentials in problem behaviors/status offenses. However, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1557085111435537">Table 4</xref> indicates, social class was a significant antecedent variable on the association between gender stereotyping and nonviolent criminal behavior. 13.6% of middle/upper class respondents and 36.9% of working/lower class respondents who experienced frequent gender stereotyping (<italic>n</italic> = 124) reported high levels of nonviolent criminal behavior, a difference of 23.3 percentage points (Φ = .267, <italic>p</italic> = .003). Gender stereotyping appears to be predictive of delinquent behavior in girls primarily in the absence of other signifiers of privilege, such as middle/upper class respondents might enjoy.</p>

<p>When race was specified, the risk of problem behaviors/status offenses of White/non-White respondents was practically identical. However, race was a significant antecedent variable on the impact of gender stereotyping on nonviolent criminal offenses: 68.8% of non-White respondents with high gender stereotyping (<italic>n</italic> = 32) and 50.0% of White respondents with high gender stereotyping reported many nonviolent criminal offenses. There were too few non-White respondents for a significant impact to be confirmed, but the specification does suggest that White and non-White youth respond differently to gender stereotyping.</p>
<p>Heteronormative expectations derived from questions about how often parents and other adults evoked presumed future heterosexual practices: heterosexual romantic interest (“is there a boy in your class that you like?”), cross-sex dating (“I can’t wait until you bring a /boy home for dinner”), and heterosexual marriage and reproduction (“some day you will have a husband and children”). It was assumed that only sexual minority youth would find discourse about potential heterosexual partners disconcerting, and in fact, LGBTQ respondents who experienced high heteronormative expectations reported more problem behaviors/status offenses and nonviolent criminal offenses. However, heteronormative expectations were also predictive for heterosexual respondents. Heterosexual respondents who experienced high heteronormative expectations were 17.4 percentage points more likely to report many problem behaviors/status offenses (Φ = .187, <italic>p</italic> = .000) and 14.1 percentage points more likely to report many nonviolent criminal offenses (Φ = .178, <italic>p</italic> = .000).</p>
<p>For LGBTQ youth, the salient factor in heteronormative expectations is the assumption of universal heterosexual interest or practice, which denies their essential humanity and attempts to constrain them into an unwelcome, alien identity. However, for heterosexual youth, the salient factor may be not the assumption that they are heterosexual but the assumption that they should be deeply concerned with romantic practices of any sort. In the absence of validation of public sphere interests and activities, a future of economic, artistic, or social pursuits, heteronormative expectations are likely to make girls feel constrained by an implied future of domestic activity. They may perceive such expectations as an attempt to define them not through their own accomplishments, but through their relationship with a man. They will therefore be more likely to assert their autonomy through problem behaviors or status and criminal offenses.</p>

<sec id="section12-1557085111435537" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The sample was somewhat limited, both in size and in type of respondent. While the respondents, all college students, reported a surprisingly high number of problem, status offenses, and nonviolent criminal offenses, about 75% of the adult population of the United States does not have a college degree, so respondents with only a high school diploma and respondents who dropped out would provide a more representative sample. The questionnaire also omitted the Part One Violent Offenses that most parents, school boards, and juvenile justice agencies are most concerned about. The relatively small number of LGBTQ and non-White respondents produced mixed results that could profit from further elucidation in an oversample or an ethnography.</p>
<p>However, the results supported the hypothesis even with the limited sample. Gender stereotyping, gender-polarized activity, and heteronormative expectations during middle to late childhood are associated with both problem behaviors/status offenses and nonviolent criminal offenses, especially in working/lower class girls whose lives are already somewhat lacking in both social capital and economic potential. We suggest that, when their parents and other adults attempt to promote quiet, passive, domestic norms, they are likely to respond by demonstrating their autonomy through aggressive and risky behaviors, they are less likely to adhere mainstream social institutions, and eventually they find their way into the deviant subcultures that are breeding grounds for delinquent behavior. Likewise, the expectations of heteronormative expectations affect both LGBTQ and heterosexual girls by asserting that their future is, or should be, entirely contained by the role of a heterosexual wife and mother.</p>
<p>Many policy recommendations can be made from these results. First, toys, games, sports, and daily chores should not presume that girls but not boys have a natural, constitutional domestic orientation, but instead should promote both internal and external competencies in both boys and girls. Second, the distinction between masculine- and feminine- coded activities should not lead to intensified gender stereotyping to ameliorate “transgressions”; girls who engage in so-called masculine-coded activity should not be treated as different, unusual, or even pioneering, but as perfectly ordinary. Third, heteronormative statements should be avoided, as they both erase the possibility of LGBT identity and promote domestic constraints in girls who happen to be heterosexual.</p>
