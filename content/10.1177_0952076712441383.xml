<abstract>
<p>Since the UK devolved administrations first took office in 1999, they have asserted their distinctiveness and identity while remaining within UK norms and traditions of public administration. Many variables now show a balance between institutional continuity and adaptive local practices, including: distinctions between the executive and legislative branches, and between ministers and civil servants; control of expenditure within the UK managed total; the unified Home Civil Service; the position of special advisers; professional networks inside government; public sector integration and joined-up government; techniques of coalition formation and management. Whether these amount to Scottish and Welsh models of public administration (alongside the clearly singular Northern Ireland model) is more contestable. Generally the devolved administrations fall within continuing patterns of UK government, including recent concepts such as ‘public service bargains’, ‘everyday life’ and ‘policy bureaucracy’. The system has proved resilient even in the face of challenges to the UK constitutional order, especially in Scotland, where officials have advised the Scottish National Party government about their constitutional aspirations in the same way as they do for other policy areas, whether or not devolved. Controversy over this role is a reminder that public administration is a third dimension alongside the politics of nationalism and devolution and the service-specific public policies of the devolved nations, and also a contribution to our understanding of adaptations of the Whitehall model.</p>

<p>Devolved politics in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have taken surprising and unpredictable turns. The fourth elections in May 2011 returned a majority Scottish National Party (SNP) government in Scotland. Between 2007 and 2011 the SNP had successfully run a minority government despite having an arrangement for support with only one other party (the two-member Green group). In Wales, Labour formed a minority government in 2011 with exactly half of the members; from 2007 to 2011 they had been in coalition with the nationalist Plaid Cymru. In Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party consolidated their duopoly on power by gaining ground at the expense of the other main party on their side of the community divide.</p>
<p>In many respects these outcomes were not ‘meant to happen’ in terms of the electoral system or the presumed lack of congruity between party positions. In particular, the inclusion of nationalists in all three devolved administrations between 2007 and 2011 posed questions about the stability of the systems and the ability of ministers to work with elite bureaucratic and professional groups whose whole careers had been based on a United Kingdom reference point for their work. In contrast to Plaid Cymru, who lost votes in 2011, the key to the SNP victory in 2011 was a perceived competence in government and as ministers, which enabled them to extend their support within the section of the electorate opposed to independence. On the classic civil service criteria of willingness to listen to advice, preparedness to take decisions, and courteous personal behaviour, nationalist ministers scored no less well than their predecessors.</p>
<p>A general theme has been the attenuation of symbolic aspects of subordination inherent in the UK’s approach to devolution in 1997. This approach rejected a uniform federal structure and set up ‘assemblies’ and ‘executives’ in the non-English nations (with the one exception reflecting Labour’s participation in the Scottish Constitutional Convention). On the simple level of nomenclature, Scotland and Wales now have devolved ‘governments’. Rhodri Morgan’s administration coined the phrase ‘Welsh Assembly Government’ in 2002 to distinguish itself from the legislative side of the Assembly. This was not challenged, and was given statutory form in the Government of Wales Act 2006. In 2011 the (again non-statutory) name of the ‘Welsh Government’ was adopted. In Scotland, the administration branded itself as the ‘Scottish Executive’ in 1999; this was technically the collective name of the Scottish ministers and, more pointedly, adopted a logo and typeface identical in design to that of the old <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0952076712441383">Scottish Office. In September 2007</xref>, the new SNP administration rebranded itself as ‘the Scottish Government’ after an unannounced weekend replacement of signs outside its buildings. The UK Government maintained the old Executive name in its own usages, until eventually giving up its resistance in the Scotland Bill 2012. Flying of the Saltire and the Welsh dragon flags in place of the Union Jack flag – rather than alongside it – became universal even before nationalists entered office. Northern Ireland alone, with its fragmented executive branch, hung on to the legal name of ‘Executive’. All this meant that any notion that there was only one ‘Government’ in the UK, with everything else subordinated to it, was thoroughly extinguished.</p>
<p>Devolved politics has been made much more interesting by nationalist strength, but its effect on the systems and institutions of government is less clear. Parties wishing to upset the traditional constitutional order might be seen as lacking interest in administrative arrangements set by it. However, nationalists have participated for decades in the House of Commons and are necessarily involved with UK institutions and political behaviour as at least an interim stage in their political evolution. Since the 1980s the SNP and Plaid Cymru have accepted a gradualist approach to constitutional change through referendums that implied participation in existing devolved government arrangements. In their aspirations to be the equal of the English polity, they are receptive to the norms that define its operation.</p>
<p>This issue is located in the wider context of adaptations of Westminster-derived systems, based on flexible constitutions, a permanent civil service, and governments whose members and authority emerge from Parliament but with an executive whose power is largely wielded apart from it. Devolved administrations, with their smaller scale and lesser history, can provide clues to the evolution of system characteristics such as multi-level governance, minister–official relationships, government formation and democratic control.</p>
<p>‘Devolution as a process’ has become commonplace in public commentary to cover a multitude of adaptations of the systems, large and small, but it has a special significance for public administration. Electoral divergence and incongruence between Westminster and the devolved nations has not proved to be the decisive variable. The advent of nationalist devolved ministers and a Conservative-led UK government has not caused a rupture in arrangements. Rather, a series of specific issues, not reducible to fixed or uniform phases, have been managed politically. They include the re-emergence of the Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as specific offices not combined with other UK government posts; Labour’s agreement to let the Welsh Assembly hold a referendum to give itself full law-making powers; the SNP’s decision not to press its plans for a separate Scottish civil service; and the UK Coalition’s decision in 2012 to resist the Scottish government’s claim to be able to call an independence referendum, but equally to offer to underwrite it itself as legally and politically definitive.</p>
<p>These areas have been studied by numerous scholars, especially Derek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0952076712441383">Birrell (2009)</xref>, Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0952076712441383">Keating (2010)</xref>, Paul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0952076712441383">Cairney (2011)</xref>, Colin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0952076712441383">Knox and Paul Carmichael (2005)</xref>, Alan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0952076712441383">Trench (2007)</xref> and Alistair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0952076712441383">Cole (2006)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0952076712441383">Prosser et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0952076712441383">Knox (2010)</xref> are notably detailed administrative accounts about Wales and Northern Ireland, respectively. Much material emerged from the ESRC’s Devolution and Constitutional Change Programme and generally commentators have been attentive to public administration variables in their work, especially when describing formal reorganisations. Less well-covered is public administration as a variable in its own right. The question posed in this article is whether, beyond any particular policy, personality or political party, the system itself may be under transformation, in relation to what was inherited in 1999 and to what has been changing at the progenitor UK level.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0952076712441383"><title>Continuity and change in devolved public administration</title>
<p>The contribution of the devolved administration to UK public administration is distinct from, but related to, the opportunity for policy divergence in the new system based on a democratic legitimacy to seek local solutions for local problems. In terms of public administration, the key variables discussed below show a balance between institutional continuity and distinctive local practices, many being related to the fact that administrative devolution long predated legislative.</p>
<sec id="sec2-0952076712441383"><title>Distinctions between the executive and legislative branches, and between ministers and civil servants</title>
<p>Only one of the three devolved systems, Scotland, was designed to replicate UK norms on the relationship between actors in the system. But Scotland’s parliament was designed to be different from Westminster, with its new electoral system, committee system, working arrangements, and general projection of a collective purpose rather than power supremacy (the election of the presiding officer and deputies by secret ballot being a striking innovation). The multi-party Consultative Steering Group, reporting in 1998, expressed new and optimistic principles of inclusivity and shared power; this was less of a reflection of Scottish political variables than a negative commentary on Westminster practices. But Scotland’s devolved administration was scarcely designed at all. Executive power was given to ‘Scottish ministers’ who had to be approved by the parliament. In effect, the parliament’s vote on First Minister (with no royal request to form an administration) was decisive. The expected coalition governments in the first two terms did not alter the default assumption of Westminster norms based on Westminster roles – cabinet ministers, junior ministers, frontbenchers, backbenchers. The most comprehensive report on the workings of the system – from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0952076712441383">Scottish Parliament Procedures Committee (2003)</xref> – concentrated on access to the parliamentary process; the Scottish Executive’s response resisted any ambiguity about the exclusive responsibility of civil servants to ministers.</p>
<p>The biggest compliment to the Scottish approach came from Wales. The subordinate status of Welsh devolution had originally been expressed by truly setting it up as a ‘glorified local authority’ with executive powers vested in a single corporate Assembly. Amendments during the parliamentary process did produce de facto ministers, not now chairs of functional committees but still members of them and with a common set of civil servants servicing the legislative and executive functions. So uncomfortable did this prove to the entire system that the path was set to the Government of Wales Act 2006 and the confirmation by referendum of full law-making functions in 2011, which brought Wales into broad parity with Scotland in its competence and processes (apart from the continued non-devolution of law and justice to Wales). Welsh AMs were culturally unprepared for their ambiguous role in the policy process, and the logistics of running an assembly responsible for both scrutiny and policy making proved challenging. A similar process was evident in British local government at this time as the role of executive members became differentiated from that of scrutinizing, de facto backbench, councillors.</p>
<p>In Northern Ireland, the Westminster pattern had two twists. The Executive was composed of all parties – unless, as naturally did not happen, they passed up the chance of ministerial jobs and let them be taken by opponents. And executive power was vested in statutorily defined departments, whose ministers did not necessarily even talk to one another or turn up at Executive meetings. This extraordinary arrangement was partly counteracted by the emergence of an Office of First Minister and Deputy First Minister as an integrative force. In the circumstances the survival of the Executive for extended periods was remarkable. A lengthy suspension until 2008 was ended when the largest parties in each community became the ‘extremist’ Democratic Unionists and Sinn Féin and who nonetheless agreed to co-exist. Departments remained the fiefdoms of parties, and programmes and budgets were difficult to construct. The traditional role of the civil service was preserved as part of this general system inertia.</p>
<p>A wider comparison between the systems would suggest a convergence between systems. Northern Ireland has the widest range of devolved powers, but police and justice was added only in 2010 and power-sharing constraints have led to a lack of innovative capacity. Wales has shown high adaptive potential in its public administration to replicate the Scottish model of executive and legislature. Scotland continues on its path of positive adaptation of the Westminster system even to the threshold of independence.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0952076712441383"><title>Expenditure counted within UK total managed expenditure</title>
<p>‘Treasury rules’ determine the architecture of public administration and the processes under which it is allocated. The devolved administrations have two important freedoms: to allocate expenditure within their assigned budgets without reference to the UK level, and to alter responsibilities and financial relations within the devolved sector (including changing local authority functions and financing). But the freedoms can only be exercised within the un-devolved rules of government accounting. Seemingly technical matters like the status of debt, end-year carryovers, distinctions between current and capital expenditure and between annually managed and departmental (multi-year) expenditure, treatment of non-funded public sector pensions, and handling of EU payments create a web of ongoing traffic with the Treasury. UK money premised on a particular policy (like attendance allowance, council tax benefit, and the financing of public service pensions) is lost if the UK policy is no longer followed. The inclusion of all devolved expenditure as part of UK ‘total managed expenditure’, the aggregate used for macro-economic management, sets a limit to devolution separate from that of legislative competence and also makes imperative a close technical relationship between spending controllers at UK and devolved levels. The Barnett formula arrangements that relate changes in the Scottish assigned budget to changes in corresponding English expenditure predate 1999. Although the devolved administrations broke free of UK government policy on their spending decisions within the budget, technical arguments about the formula continued in much the same way.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0952076712441383"><title>Unified Home Civil Service</title>
<p>Devolution preserved the position of civil servants in Scotland and Wales as part of the Home Civil Service, with the UK prime minister as its ‘minister for the civil service’. In Northern Ireland, the civil service remained distinct but enjoyed ‘club privileges’ with the other services (their original merit recruitment being recognized) and with non-partisan norms enforced by the non-devolved Northern Ireland civil service commissioners and the codes they regulate. One of the great non-issues of the devolution era has been whether an administration could secure the loyalty of its officials without being in managerial control of them. The SNP’s election-winning manifesto in 2007 called for a Scottish service on the Northern Ireland model, but this was quickly sidelined into discussions with UK and Northern Ireland colleagues. The Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010, which put the Civil Service on a statutory basis, with Scottish and Welsh officials inside it, did not become an occasion to review the issue.</p>
<p>As Scottish governments have found, maintaining a normative and legal framework for their officials from the UK jurisdiction has many conveniences. Merit recruitment receives a ready-made definition. Pension arrangements are unchanged. Civil servants can be imported without formality. Senior pay is not a political responsibility. With the agreement of the civil service commissioners, discretion can be pushed out on the length and character of temporary appointments and secondments, often the main point of controversy in the UK system. The commissioners, some of whom are from devolved nation backgrounds, work directly with devolved ministers on the permissible involvement of the ministers in senior appointments. Under minority governments in Scotland and Wales, the convention that the civil service works solely to ministers, who exercise unabridged executive power, was a great convenience, especially to the SNP.</p>
<p>The reason for a unified service often stated before 1999 – a facilitator of good intergovernmental relations – has not been important. Roles have evolved but civil service status in itself is not the decisive variable. Within the basic issue of ‘whom do you work for?’, found within Whitehall and beyond, these relations are essentially personal and attenuate through time and for lack of business or routine maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0952076712441383">Parry, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The most symbolic aspect of the Whitehall link – the formal confirmation by the UK prime minister of appointments to the top two levels – became problematical because it was mentioned in press releases about the appointments. After a recommendation by the Calman Commission on Scottish devolution, this formal confirmatory power was transferred to the head of the Home Civil Service in 2010. This might seem little improvement, and was soon used to greater impact when the permanent secretary of the Department of Communities and Local Government, Peter Housden, was transferred to the Scottish government – a move described as ‘at the request of the Cabinet Secretary’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/FOI/Disclosures/2011/09/RelocationExpenses">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/FOI/Disclosures/2011/09/RelocationExpenses</ext-link>). Alex Salmond embraced the notion that his top official could come from outside Scotland and, by already being at the required grade, could be appointed without a competition.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0952076712441383"><title>Position of special advisers</title>
<p>The 40-year-old institution of special advisers, civil servants recruited to work for ministers during their term of office without political impartiality, was transplanted to Scotland (up to 12) and Wales (up to 6). Practice varied, including the advertisement of the positions (Rhodri Morgan in Wales), use of them to appoint a media spokesman (Donald Dewar in Scotland) or a chief of staff (Jack McConnell). In coalitions both parties can have their advisers, which is a useful tool. Under the SNP, the first minister’s special adviser, Kevin Pringle, is quoted in summaries of media briefings alongside the (career civil servant) official spokesman. Under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010, the Whitehall control of special adviser numbers was dropped in favour of local accountability, the only real change of substance in the Act for the devolved systems.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0952076712441383"><title>Professional networks inside government</title>
<p>Often unremarked are the networks of professionals inside the civil service with similar training. Statisticians are important because of the certification of data as meeting national statistics standards; similar considerations apply to economists. Medical and nursing staff are bound together by the common organization of UK health professionals. Agricultural and veterinary staff are involved in European and cross-border issues. Policy and research are now recognized as professions and have shared training. An important network that includes local government is that of the police and anti-terrorism. Some devolved staff work in embassies and Brussels offices.</p>
<p>Public administration intersects with the large non-devolved area of commercial and employment law, which sets a common framework for the activity of trade unions and employers’ associations. Sixty-five per cent of civil servants in Scotland and Wales are still non-devolved (Work and Pensions, Revenue and Customs, Defence, Home Office) and their Britain-wide trade unions pursue bargaining on wages and conditions in parallel with deals with the devolved administrations, so setting common expectations and norms.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0952076712441383"><title>Public sector integration and joined-up government</title>
<p>The territorial departments had always been pioneers of non-departmentalism because of their small scale and territorial, rather than functional, focus. Both the Scottish Office (1939) and the Welsh Office (1964) were the bringing together of separate boards and departments (some of high distinctiveness and influence, such as the Scottish Education Department), but in time their finance and personnel functions were integrated. The effect of this was a common personnel pool across functional areas and a varied career experience of senior officials, It also meant that there was no precise equivalent of the Cabinet Office or Treasury and a resultant better balance between central policy and service delivery. In contrast, Northern Ireland had a long history of separate ministries under the Stormont Government and these remained under direct rule, with a small policy-making Northern Ireland Office, most of whose staff was on secondment from the Northern Ireland Civil Service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0952076712441383">Carmichael, 2002</xref>). Integration of finance and personnel management was slow.</p>
<p>The small scale of the devolved nations – low population, but dispersed geographically and with correspondingly dispersed local political interests – poses a choice for them on whether to run services nationally. Traditionally, two-tier local government with small authorities was the norm, with little nationalisation of local government functions. In Northern Ireland, the creation of small and weak district councils in 1973 led to a further centralization of functions, some into the civil service like water and roads.</p>
<p>In Scotland, moves to nationalization were staved off by the existence from 1974 to 1996 of the regions, many of which were large and powerful even in UK terms, running water and in most areas police and fire. Wales had counties on the English model but, unlike Scotland, could not avoid the division of top-tier local government in its main urban area, Glamorgan. In both nations reorganisations in 1996 introduced single-tier authorities (32 in Scotland, 22 in Wales) that were geographically large in rural areas but excessively subdivided in urban areas and generally small enough to invite a policy grab from the centre.</p>
<p>With devolution, it became possible to take forward the joined-up agenda from within the local political context. It is curious that a devolved system, by definition with incomplete powers, should choose to emphasise whole-system outcomes, much of which depend on decisions by other governmental actors or are little susceptible to government action at all. The explanation probably lies in the wish of the Scottish and Welsh governments to grasp a primary legitimacy and reputation as the lead actor in public affairs in their nations from the UK government. For devolved ministers and officials, the big picture is the interesting one; they are national, not local, actors, and they feed off each other’s enthusiasms. Also relevant is the general concept of multi-level governance, with an actively managed distribution of powers on political and functional grounds, always a more comfortable one to the periphery than to the centre of the UK polity.</p>
<p>Devolution was an opportunity to clear away the undergrowth of appointed public bodies that had grown up as a substitute for elected bodies. Equally, it could be seen as a power grab by the newly devolved centre unable to appropriate reserved powers. In Scotland, Northern Ireland and (generally) in Wales, devolution statutes did not guarantee the preservation of subordinate bodies but gave the executives a free hand in remodeling in the name of efficiency.</p>
<p>The most ambitious attempt to sort out a system was Northern Ireland’s Review of Public Administration, reporting in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0952076712441383">Knox and Carmichael, 2006</xref>). This started off as a review of senior appointment procedures under Lord Ouseley and later became a vehicle for decongesting the system. Implementation of the conclusions announced in 2006 was mixed: the reduction in the number of local authorities from 26 to 11 was postponed in 2010 on the grounds that it would cost money; a single Health and Social Services Board was established in 2008, with a reduced number of NHS trusts beneath it, but the Education and Library Boards have resisted their planned abolition in favour of a single Education and Skills Authority, which exists in shadow form under a ‘convergence delivery plan’.</p>
<p>In Wales, the decisive move came in 2004 when the report <italic>Making the Connections</italic> set out the principle that ‘where executive Assembly Sponsored Public Bodies (ASPBs) undertake functions that are essentially governmental in character, in that they set or lead on an aspect of public policy or policy delivery, they should be integrated with the Assembly Government’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0952076712441383">Welsh Assembly Government [WAG], 2004</xref>: 23). The Welsh Development Agency, Education and Learning Wales, and the Wales Tourist Board came into civil service structures in 2006. This enabled the WAG to gain a network of local offices and allowed the deconcentration of staff to regional centres, a process much loved by politicians. In Scotland, the SNP absorbed functions less ambitiously and took statutory powers in the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 to merge or abolish ‘quangos’ by secondary legislation. In Wales, the Beecham report <italic>Beyond Boundaries</italic> (2006) gave substance to an approach based on capacity building, cultural change and collaborative networks within existing structures, and remains the most cogent challenge to New Public Management approaches found at UK level. In Scotland, the Christie commission report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0952076712441383">Commission on the Future Delivery of Public Services, 2011</xref>) set out a comparably cogent defence of partnership working rather than structural reorganization. The SNP government agreed with this logic and resisted calls for mergers of local authorities, but under the expenditure pressures in 2011 set out plans for single police and fire services.</p>
<p>A corollary of a joined-up and integrated public sector is the ability to set goals for the system as a whole. The Scottish government has shown the greatest interest in this, starting with the coalition’s ‘Futures project’ in 2006 that ranked Scotland in international terms on a range of indicators with a ‘trend analysis’ of global social and economic developments. The SNP government built on this approach with its national outcomes and indicators of 2007, as set out on the ‘Scotland Performs’ website; this replaces departments with seven ‘purpose targets’ (healthier, wealthier, greener, et cetera) that also structure ‘single outcome agreements’ with local authorities. The Welsh Government’s ‘Programme for Government 2011–16’ of September 2011 presents outcome definitions (rather than targets) that go some way towards the Scottish approach.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0952076712441383"><title>Techniques of coalition formation and management</title>
<p>Central to lesson-drawing from the devolved administrations are the techniques of coalition formation and the role of the civil service within these. The design of the devolved system included elections by single transferable vote in Northern Ireland within large constituencies – a highly proportional system leading to perpetual forced coalitions – and a mixture of constituency and list seats in Scotland and Wales. The Welsh system left Labour on the cusp of an overall majority in many years (28 seats out of 60 in 1999, 30 in 2003, 30 in 2011), allowing them to take the lead in the coalitions they did choose to form (with the Liberal Democrats in 2000 and Plaid Cymru in 2007). Officials offered to assist all party leaders and assess their proposals.</p>
<p>In Scotland coalition formation has been more systematic, and set precedents for the 2010 UK negotiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0952076712441383">Hazell and Paun, 2009</xref>: Chapters 5 and 6). The 1999 negotiations happened under the unusual circumstances that power had not yet been transferred to the newly elected parliament, and the Labour leaders had a dual role as temporarily continuing UK ministers and putative devolved ministers. This made it natural for officials to be present in the building when Labour and the Liberal Democrats were negotiating and provide both parties with briefings and costings. In 2003 it was again simple because coalition ministers were continuing in office. In 2007, drawing on UK conventions about pre-election consultation with opposition parties, the civil service opened lines to the SNP in particular, with teams of officials working on the costings of manifestos. After the elections, as Permanent Secretary John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0952076712441383">Elvidge has described (2011: 18)</xref> a rapid informal meeting with Alex Salmond led to detailed civil service advice: talks that led to the very limited SNP–Green deal took place at St Andrew’s House. There was also a relaxed time scale typical of European coalition negotiations, with one month allowed in Scotland for the election of a first minister (also now specified for Wales in the 2006 Act). UK coalitions in 2010 seemed to show some of the ‘ménage à trois’ aspects of devolved negotiations, with the civil service in a semi-procurer, semi-facilitator role – with the added element of the presumed demands of the financial markets for a rapid resolution.</p>
<p>Setting coalitions as the norm makes it all the more unusual when a single-party government emerges, as a minority on three occasions in Wales (1999–2000, 2003–07, 2011 to date) and once in Scotland (2007–11). Minority government creates a vulnerability to threatened defeat on budget bills, as minor parties press for spending concessions, something of which there is little experience at UK level. It has also extended our understanding of the ways that a government might lose votes without losing the confidence of the legislature (notably in the SNP’s tactical decision to accept a defeat on Edinburgh trams early in their government and, unwisely as it turned out, to fund the project). But in itself minority government does not take devolution in new directions; if sustained it can prove stable in devolved circumstances when so much can be done through executive powers over expenditure, regulation and government organisation within existing laws.</p>
<p>True majority government, immune to rebellions and by-election losses, was not meant to happen in the devolved systems. The SNP’s 2011 majority of 9 (over 40 on the Westminster scale) was a ‘perfect storm’ of a high SNP vote (44%); little difference between the level of the SNP vote on the regional lists and in the first-past-the-post constituencies; the marked weakness of the vote for the Liberal Democrats, Greens and other parties, which was insufficient to gain them seats in most regions; and the crude d’Hondt formula for seat allocation. (John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0952076712441383">Curtice has demonstrated [2011: 66–68]</xref> that under the formula for allocating UK party list seats in the European parliament the SNP would not have gained a majority.) The occurrence of majority government remains an unusual contingency in the Scottish multi-party devolved system.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0952076712441383"><title>Scottish and Welsh models of public administration?</title>
<p>The Scottish and Welsh permanent secretaries in post for most of the devolution period have made published contributions about their experience. In Wales, Sir Jon Shortridge (1999–2008) presided over the consolidation of the Welsh system into something more cohesive and government-like. As he wrote in 2010, ‘a serious legislature with serious primary legislative powers needs to operate on a conventional parliamentary model with a clear separation of powers rather than with the cosy consensuality implied by the original corporate body’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0952076712441383">Shortridge, 2010</xref>: 88). It was painful for Shortridge and his colleagues when the Assembly sought to interfere in the internal organization of the civil service on matters like the location of environmental policy making and the position of the Counsel-General (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0952076712441383">Rawlings 2003</xref>: 463–464). Shortridge’s long interview in 2005, published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0952076712441383">Prosser et al. (2006: 180–189)</xref> hints at some of these tensions.</p>
<p>Two contextual factors were important in Shortridge’s thinking. The first was the dependence of the Assembly on Westminster to take forward its legislative programme. This involved taking account of Assembly requests to Westminster for policy changes, either through Wales-only legislation, or by giving the Assembly greater room to apply secondary legislative competence in services like health and education. The problem was partly political, as the Secretary of State for Wales and Welsh MPs were not comfortable to be mere postboxes of the Assembly, but also due to the technical grind of winning space in the legislative programme and engaging with the UK government’s ability to play politics by accelerating or retarding progress within it.</p>
<p>Shortridge, in comparison with his Scottish colleagues, seemed uninterested in relating to the Westminster club of senior officials or attending their Wednesday morning meetings. He set in place a flatter structure of senior officials (in an Executive Board, later the Management Board), which allowed all cabinet ministers to have a top-tier official sitting on the board. Shortridge’s successor Dame Gill Morgan has moved to a more normal Whitehall (and Scottish) pattern of directors-general on what is now called the Strategic Delivery and Performance Board.</p>
<p>The second factor was the relative under-development of Welsh administrative practices compared with the deposited tradition in Scotland and Northern Ireland. This has accelerated the concept of the ‘Welsh public service’ with some common training and an expectation of greater movement within it. The Welsh model has twice undergone comprehensive review – by the Richard Commission in 2004 that led to the Government of Wales Act 2006, and by the All-Wales Convention reporting in 2010 that led to the successful referendum on law-making powers in March 2011. These reviews have been about, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0952076712441383">Rawlings’s phrase (2003)</xref>, ‘delineating Wales’ as a nation and as a constitutional system with the Welsh Government as the leading force.</p>
<p>In Scotland, Sir John Elvidge (2003–11) has made a major contribution – unusually long and candid for a former permanent secretary – about what he calls the ‘Scottish model of government’ (2011). He contends that the devolved system facilitated joined-up government in which there were (from 2007) no component departments and few Cabinet ministers. He mentions the Futures project, Scotland Performs, and community planning with local government. He is also proud of the modalities of coalition formation that he developed (also discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0952076712441383">Hazell and Paun, 2009</xref>: Chapter 5).</p>
<p>Elvidge was able to recover from a rocky time in 2006, when the ‘Taking Stock’ exercise, the Scottish equivalent of Whitehall capability reviews, raised questions about the clarity of leadership within the Executive; his response, which caused further trouble, was to institute a slimmed-down Strategic Board that did not include all the directors-general. His cerebral style (and perhaps the fact that he is English but chose to spend his career in Scotland) gave him a new lease of life with the SNP, fitting in well with the minority government’s emphasis on economic growth and measurably improved social outcomes.</p>
<p>There is a long history of anti-departmentalism in Scotland, and there was serious interest in 1999 in having no departments but grouping around ‘business units’ (comparable to the 40 or so present-day directorates; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0952076712441383">Parry and Jones, 2000</xref>). Curiously, the SNP manifesto in 2007 did set out a proposed new departmental structure, but the new ministers agreed to the more radical approach of abolishing departments both in the sense of denominated titles and of a match-up of ministerial briefs with directors-general. A key player in the intra-government process has been John Swinney, finance secretary since 2007 and widely admired for his skilful handling of his brief as ‘Scottish Chancellor’ in challenging times.</p>
<p>The ‘Scottish model’ seems to involve strong attention to civil service advice and continuity with the self-confident, pre-devolution arrangements, which involved the unapologetic defence of Scottish interests from within a strong engagement with Whitehall. By abolishing ministries and departments as ‘silos’, and decoupling ministerial from director-general commands, it centralizes politics and administration around the first minister and the permanent secretary in a way that goes beyond anything that has been possible in Whitehall. This centralised force then reaches out to embrace the wider public sector through ‘community planning’ of services. The rhetoric is of a citizen and outcome focus, but the reality is one of top-down technocratic norms that orientate the public sector towards measurable social and economic improvement and away from debates about allocation and distribution. The ‘Welsh model’ has similarities but has taken longer to cohere. Both stand in contrast to the intensely political system in Northern Ireland that has partly resisted the de-localisation of a congested administrative system.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-0952076712441383"><title>Analysing the variables</title>
<p>In the words of three of the most influential recent works on British government, have the devolved administrations shown different patterns of ‘public service bargains’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0952076712441383">Hood and Lodge, 2006</xref>), ‘policy bureaucracy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0952076712441383">Page and Jenkins, 2005</xref>), or ‘everyday life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0952076712441383">Rhodes, 2011</xref>)? We lack a devolved equivalent of these major studies but they provide a template for analysis.</p>
<p>In the first of these, it is the continuity of the public service bargain that is apparent: officials have been treated with respect, especially by the SNP government in Scotland, and have been given pay increases comparable to UK norms that have left public employees in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland with a pay advantage over private of 16 per cent for women and 11 per cent for men (against UK averages of 10% and 5%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0952076712441383">Bozio and Disney, 2011</xref>: Table 7.4). In Scotland, an <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0952076712441383">Independent Budget Review Panel drew attention to this phenomenon (2010: Chapter 4)</xref> but pushing through its logic is difficult when so much public sector wage and pension bargaining is on a common UK basis. Current SNP policy is of no compulsory redundancies in the Scottish government, although staff cutbacks are planned especially at senior levels. This sensitivity to job cuts is part of a wider preference for ‘concordats’ that resemble social partnership arrangements in systems with corporatist traditions; notably, the 2007 concordat with local government proved successful at securing a council tax freeze.</p>
<p>On the second – Page and Jenkins’s suggestion that policy in Whitehall is led to a surprising extent by middle-range officials – it might seem that the smaller scale of devolved government risks this phenomenon. Despite suggestions of a lack of policy-making capacity, especially in Wales, analytical strength was in place under administrative devolution and has grown. Middle-ranking officials do more, but have closer relations with ministers and special advisers to gain the necessary ‘steer’ on policy directions.</p>
<p>On the third, we can observe continuities of practice and learning. The private offices continue as the axis of minister–official relationships (though in Scotland and Wales they are more integrated to reflect the joined-up nature of the governments), as do ways of working in service spheres, especially health. ‘Everyday life’, the personal skills officials and ministers’ need to survive and flourish have not changed in fundamental character.</p>
<p>Intergovernmental and central–local relations have also shown continuity. Scotland and Wales have traditional local government, with Unison as single trade union, and have not reorganized it. Northern Ireland continues to organize education, housing and social care outside local government, and major elements of its Review of Public Administration concluded in 2005 remain unimplemented. Scotland and Wales have reorganized the NHS back into traditional area boards and created a time-warp resistant to the English innovations of arm’s-length Trusts, use of private sector facilities and GP commissioning. In one important pioneering move, Scotland piloted partial direct elections to two Health Boards in 2010.</p>
<p>Within this continuity, there has been learning in the other direction, especially on the reincorporation of non-departmental public bodies in to the civil service and on coalition formation, where techniques developed in Scotland and Wales about the gaming of party positions, contact with opposition parties and the need to offer advice to all parties while remaining neutral between coalition possibilities prefigured the civil service approach to the formation of the UK government after the 2010 election.</p>
<p>Dynamic trends over time are in some ways counter-intuitive – a drift away from Whitehall norms would be posited but actually the need for channels to the UK system is greater than ever. As an English permanent secretary, Peter Housden’s importation to the Scottish government in 2011 was unprecedented before devolution let alone after. Although the Welsh permanent secretary since 2008, Gill Morgan came from outside the civil service (with a health background, and also a participant in the <italic>Beyond Boundaries</italic> review), a former Whitehall finance director, Michael Hearty, has been imported to a similar role. Northern Ireland is an exception, since it acquired police and justice responsibilities in 2010 and took over the last significant tranche of non-devolved staff; but it too needs to deal with UK expenditure issues and civil service and professional norms.</p>
<p>Most observers predicted in 1999 that the unified civil service would not last, but it has been endorsed by the Richard Commission in Wales, the Calman Commission in Scotland and implicitly by the SNP government going slow on their 2007 (but not 2011) manifesto promise of a Scottish Civil Service. Wales, though in mid-decade exploring the notion of a Welsh public service with open advertisement of all civil service jobs, seems more receptive to Whitehall organizational norms (such as strategic directors-general) under its present permanent secretary than her predecessor. This might be explained by a hypothesis that, under administrative devolution before 1999 and a general trend towards contract-based New Public Management, effective decoupling had already taken place and subsequent change has been for reasons endogenous to the devolved systems. What looks like an imposed continuity is in fact a tactical political choice.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-0952076712441383"><title>Civil servants and ‘the project’: Building a new constitutional order</title>
<p>The final issue that requires attention is the role of public administration in the complex of issues around a possible ‘break-up of the UK’ through either legal independence or a maximal form of devolution that would break the hold of Treasury and Cabinet Office norms on official behaviour.</p>
<p>Two variables are relevant here. The first is the implicit position of the Home Civil Service as a ‘unionist’ institution within the political system (along with the monarchy, the BBC, the UK Supreme Court, commercial and industrial law, and professional bodies and trade unions – except for teachers). This role could have been reinforced had officials rested their advice on the reserved status of the union and the legal inability of the devolved legislatures to secede from the UK. The fact that this issue has not been pressed is related to the second variable, the exclusive loyalty owed by the civil service to the ministers they serve (this latter aspect of civil service codes now being enshrined in legislation under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010). Within that loyalty, it is hard to draw distinction between the areas in which advice may or may not be sought or offered.</p>
<p>In Wales and Northern Ireland, nationalists in office have been the secondary partners in voluntary or compulsory coalitions and so the issue has been contained. In Scotland, it was faced early on in 2007 when Sir John Elvidge declined to make an issue about advice on constitutional matters (any more than had been done previously about building up the international profile of the Scottish Executive); implicitly, he set a notion of civil service competence to supply evidence and briefing to ministers wider than that of legislative competence. The phrase ‘it is arguable’ – the qualification used in the first White Paper about independence to a statement that the Scottish government had the legal power to call a referendum about opening negotiations towards it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0952076712441383">Scottish Government, 2007</xref>: 35) – is a faint hint of what might have been a serious confrontation.</p>
<p>SNP use of civil service time to prepare work on its constitutional business has been viewed with suspicion by the other parties. The authorisation in September 2011 of a new director-general position for Strategy and External Affairs (which, at that grade, required Cabinet Office approval) was presented by the opposition as an official who would plan for independence and elicited a letter to opposition leaders from Gus O’Donnell stating that ‘within Scotland there is an elected Government with a policy programme for, amongst other things, very significant constitutional change. The UK Government takes a different view on some of these issues. It is right and proper that civil servants working to their respective administrations undertake the relevant work to support Ministers to pursue their aims, whether or not those aims are the subject of political controversy’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.holyrood.com/articles/2011/10/07/odonnell-letter-clears-housden-over-bias-allegations/">http://www.holyrood.com/articles/2011/10/07/odonnell-letter-clears-housden-over-bias-allegations/</ext-link>). Once the UK government conceded that the SNP had a mandate (if not a clear legal right) to seek an independence referendum, there was no obstacle to full civil service advice to them on this matter. Officials serve their ministers, not the parliament or the system as a whole, even when the ‘breakup of the UK’ is on those ministers’ agendas.</p>
<p>In Wales, there has been a critical tone in relations with the civil service, culminating in the cryptic, and constitutionally inaccurate, statement in the Welsh Labour manifesto of 2011 (p. 22) that:<disp-quote>
<p>We believe it is anomalous that the Assembly Government senior civil service is not accountable to Welsh Ministers and that after the first decade of devolution it is appropriate that the current civil service system be reviewed. We will therefore review and seek realignment of the governance and performance of the Assembly Government civil service, better to reflect the developing requirements of devolution whilst remaining part of the Home Civil Service.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This is a warning shot about the confused nature of political understanding of civil service status even twelve years after devolution, and the political risks if officials seem to get caught up in high-level ‘projects’ that are politically contestable matters. It emphasises that public administration is relevant to our understanding of devolution, and that the devolved nations have something distinctive to offer to the discipline. Public administration is a third dimension alongside the politics of nationalism and devolution and the service-specific public policies of the devolved nations. It explains much about the behaviour of devolved governments and especially of nationalists within them. It also offers evidence of further adaptations of Westminster-style public administration systems within a fundamental persistence of the ‘Whitehall model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0952076712441383">Page, 2010</xref>: 413), in this case by smaller jurisdictions within the UK facing nationalist pressures.</p></sec>
