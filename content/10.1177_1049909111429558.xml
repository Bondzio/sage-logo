<abstract>
<p>Due to the rapid influx of Palliative care and Hospice services over the last decade, there has been an increase in the number of medical professionals interacting with terminal patients. One of the challenges with this growth becomes how to integrate these services into already busy practices along with providing physicians the education and tools they need to provide quality care. While there is no shortage of articles focusing on the educational needs of physicians related to end of life care, less is known about the level of anxiety physicians feel about interacting with dying patients and their families.</p>

<body>
<p>Managing terminally ill patients creates a dilemma for many in the medical profession today. With the development of more complex medicine during the past few decades, medical professionals have been able to keep patients alive much longer than before. As such, end-of-life care (EOLC), or medicine practiced in order to diminish the suffering and improve the quality of remaining life of terminally ill patients, has had a growing role over the past few decades. With the expansion of technology and services for the dying patient, however, comes further responsibility for the primary caregivers. As physicians, nurses, and hospital personnel are increasingly involved in EOLC, they begin to assume the role, not only of caregiver but also as confidant, counselor, and friend. In accordance with this, the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic>defines EOLC as providing psychosocial, spiritual, and bereavement support for the patient, not only medical support.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111429558">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The importance of a study on physicians’ attitudes on EOLC is due to their unique relationship with the patient. The majority of the burden for optimizing EOLC falls on the physician. The physician’s formerly curative relationship with the patient changes focus. Furthermore, it is the physician who is in primary control of information concerning the patient’s condition and prognosis, and it is his/her responsibility to inform the patient of their condition as it changes. Of course, this has always been a central role of physicians. However, the growing weight of this responsibility shifts to primary care physicians serving the aging population nationwide.</p>
<p>As a part of the effort to maximize quality care toward the end of life, provisions were made in the Medicare/Medicaid bills to promote robust EOLC.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111429558">2</xref>
</sup> Indeed, hospice and EOLC accounted for roughly a quarter of the Medicare budget and 18% of the total health budget in the United States in 2001 and has grown ever since.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111429558">3</xref>
</sup> Under Medicare and Medicaid, physicians are monetarily incentivized to spend more time with terminal patients. However, many observers feel that physicians have lost sight of the primary reason for these incentives and as a consequence, treat terminal patients to the maximum Medicare reimbursement.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111429558">4</xref>
</sup> Such treatment could benefit from using a multidisciplinary approach emphasizing maximum appropriate psychosocial, spiritual, and bereavement support. Furthermore, physician shortages in primary care and time pressures in medicine decrease the availability of a patient’s primary care physician to actively participate in management decisions for the dying patient during hospitalizations. All of these factors are contributing factors that influence physician’s attitudes about providing EOLC.</p>
<p>The heart of the medical profession is the idea of beneficence or the charge that a physician should, above all, do no harm. However, when patient wishes and physician expertise conflict, beneficence becomes much harder to define.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111429558">5</xref>
</sup> Medical ethics suggests that the physician’s role is in guiding the patient and their families toward a “good death.” This is characterized by a number of tangible provisions, ranging from seemingly mundane tasks, such as putting the patient’s affairs in order, to the more abstract, such as being treated as a “whole person.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111429558">6</xref>
</sup> The most unfulfilled promises of EOLC, according to patient families, are the lack of emotional support and availability provided by physicians, the unwillingness to discuss death, and the mismanagement of the patient’s pain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909111429558">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In 2007, a study was conducted examining nurses’ attitudes toward EOLC, revealing that many nurses felt apprehension in dealing with terminally ill patients, even though most were exposed to the situation in academic and clinical situations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111429558">8</xref>
</sup> This study was conducted using a shortened version of the Physicians’ End of Life Attitudes Scale (PEAS) that measures health professionals’ anxiety concerning dealing with terminally ill patients.<sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111429558">9</xref>
</sup>
</sup> A logical next step to define the attitudes of physicians’ toward terminally ill patients would be to conduct a similar study focused on this group.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049909111429558" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>In an effort to effectively examine physicians’ attitudes on EOLC, the authors adapted the original PEAS model. The original PEAS system was developed toward the end of the 1990s in an effort to measure the extent of anxiety experienced by medical trainees in dealing with terminally ill patients in various situations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111429558">9</xref>
</sup> The sample was made up of 62 adult and pediatric medical professionals who had participated in focus groups commissioned by the Project on Death in America to explore medical students’ and residents’ opinions regarding their education in palliative care. Respondents were grouped by their specialty and were asked to respond to 64 Lickert-scale questions, as and to describe their training in EOLC.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111429558">9</xref>
</sup> The respondent’s answers were then coded so that higher scores on the PEAS indicated higher levels of anxiety in discussing EOLC. After determining the most effective questions in the original PEAS survey, a substantially shorter version of the PEAS survey was developed for the present study. Aside from demographic information, such as gender, specialty, location of practice, and so on, respondents were asked to answer only 38 questions pertaining to EOLC. The first 7 questions were True–False, with a “Neither True Nor False” response in the center of this response continuum (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049909111429558">Table 1</xref>). Subsequently, respondents were asked to answer 31 Likert-style 5-point questions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049909111429558">Table 2</xref>), wherein these questions from the PEAS survey were concerned with dealing with terminally ill patients, either from a professional or personal perspective.</p>

<p>From these responses, 3 separate scores were then generated: an overall communication apprehension score, a personal impact score, and a professional impact score. The personal impact score was derived from the questions concerned with the emotions and interactions experienced when interacting with a terminally ill patient or their family. Meanwhile, the professional impact score was derived from the questions concerned with the more logical aspects of death, such as discussing advanced directives and discussing the course of the illness the patient will face. Among the PEAS questions, the survey included 13 questions pertaining to the personal impact score and 18 pertaining to the professional impact score. The overall communication apprehension score was simply these 2 scores combined. Higher scores correlated with higher apprehension in dealing with terminally ill patients.</p>
<p>This modified PEAS survey implemented employing electronic survey strategy. The survey was sent via e-mail to 1923 randomly selected physicians within a Catholic health care System, composed of nearly 5000 physicians in the 4 Midwestern states of Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. Four reminder e-mails were then subsequently sent to physicians who had not yet returned a completed survey. Furthermore, to minimize a bias against nonusers of health system e-mail, the survey was also sent to 3218 physicians via fax. No financial incentive was offered for completion of the survey. Both the groups were randomly drawn from the pool of affiliated personnel independently of each other, producing a possible overlap between the 2 groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1049909111429558">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The survey was returned by 220 physicians by e-mail and 402 physicians by fax, yielding a total respondent pool of 622 physicians. These 622 respondents were then subcategorized according to specialty and divided among 10 specialty categories: surgeons (1), family practitioners (2), emergency/urgent care (3), hospitalists (4), pediatrics (5), medicine (6), radiologists (7), oncologists (8), “other” (9), and the remaining specialties (10). Furthermore, of the 622 respondents, 29% were female physicians; this is remarkably close to the most recent American Medical Association survey on physician gender in 2006, asserting that roughly 28% of all physicians were female.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111429558">10</xref>
</sup> This close correlation indicates a standard composition of the sample, significantly limiting any gender bias in the data.</p>
<p>Each answer to a PEAS survey question was coded on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 indicating the highest amount of anxiety. On the whole, the PEAS total mean item score was 2.41 (standard deviation [SD] = 0.36), with PEAS professional and PEAS personal means measured at 2.48 (SD = 0.34) and 2.32 (SD = 0.37), respectively. On the 5-point scale of increasing anxiety, these findings show a moderate level of anxiety among physicians with respect to dealing with terminally ill patients but not an excessive or debilitating level of anxiety. However, when PEAS scores were examined with respect to individual specialties, the effect of specialty on communication anxiety proved to be statistically significant for PEAS total scores (<italic>F</italic>
<sub>12,592</sub> = 2.78, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), PEAS professional scores (<italic>F</italic>
<sub>12,592</sub> = 3.86, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), and PEAS personal scores (<italic>F</italic>
<sub>12,592</sub> = 2.02, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .02).</p>
<p>An analysis of PEAS total scores indicated that the highest PEAS total scores were observed in oncology (<italic>M</italic> = 81.78), pediatric (<italic>M</italic> = 78.5), and surgical (<italic>M</italic> = 78.47) specialties. Meanwhile, the lowest PEAS total scores were observed in family practice (<italic>M</italic> = 73.33) and medical specialties (<italic>M</italic> = 73.85; <italic>F</italic>

The PEAS scores of the remaining specialty subgroups remained fairly similar, ranging from 75.08 to 77.25. Furthermore, a similar pattern was found when examining PEAS professional and personal scores, with respect to specialty, wherein the <italic>F</italic>values were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) in each case.</p>

<p>In an effort to explain the above differences in PEAS total scores across specialties, a series of exploratory 2 × 10 analysis of variance (presence or absence of professional or personal experience with terminal patients/death × specialty) was carried out. In no case did specialty category interact with any personal experience variable (eg, having a durable power of attorney and having had someone close to them die). Furthermore, with the exception of having made inpatient hospice visits, no other professional experiential variable (eg, having studied/worked with terminally ill patients in medical school) interacted with specialty (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .056). For oncologists (<italic>M</italic> = 79.3 vs 68.8), pediatricians (<italic>M</italic> = 79.4 vs 74.7), and surgeons (<italic>M</italic> = 80.4 vs 75.3), having made inpatient hospice visits or not was the most substantively influential variable on PEAS total scores, as lower PEAS total scores were observed in those who had indeed made inpatient hospice visits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049909111429558">Figure 1</xref>), wherein this interaction clearly approached statistical significance (<italic>F</italic>
<sub>9,594</sub> = 1.86, <italic>P</italic>= .056). All other specialties’ PEAS total scores were lower for those who had made inpatient hospice visits, with the exception of emergency/urgent care physicians (<italic>M</italic> = 75.8 vs 77.1) and hospitalists (<italic>M</italic> = 68.8 vs 77.6).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The above findings suggest that the degree to which PEAS scores vary between those physicians who have or have not made inpatient hospice visits across specialties correlates well with the differences observed across specialties. Furthermore, these effects seem to be stronger in surgeons, oncologists, and pediatricians and weaker in emergency physicians and hospitalists.</p>
<p>Indeed, except for hospitalists and those in emergency/urgent care, all PEAS scores were higher for specialties which had not made inpatient hospice visits. Thus, due to the fact the PEAS scores for almost all specialties dropped in response to making hospice visits, this variable can only be examined within specialties. Therefore, the discrepancy between surgeon, oncologist, and pediatrician PEAS scores with those of emergency physicians and hospitalists shows a distinct difference in outlook concerning EOLC. However, more generally, it can be safely assumed that professional experiences, such as hospice visits, are effective in lowering anxiety across specialties.</p>
<p>Although some professional variables appear to have an effect on specialty PEAS scores, personal variables do not appear to have a similar effect. Among personal variables within, none proved statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05) for any specialty.</p>
<p>Thus, physicians are more affected by professional interaction with terminally ill patients rather than by their personal interactions with them. While many physicians expressed views that “providing relief for [the patient’s] suffering is one of the most rewarding aspects” of being a physician, it is clear that there is significant anxiety in dealing with terminally ill patients. Although conventional wisdom would associate a physician’s ability to deal with terminally ill patients with his or her own personal experiences concerning death, the data here indicates that in actuality physicians’ levels of anxiety may decrease with professional experiences, evidenced in this study by spending more time with hospice patients.</p>
<p>While most physicians’ PEAS scores decreased if they had made inpatient hospice visits, the effect of such experiences does not impact all specialties equally. Indeed, oncologists, pediatricians, and surgeons were noted to have the most anxiety in dealing with terminally ill patients. Furthermore, anxiety was lower among all specialists who spent time studying or visiting inpatient hospices. One outspoken respondent addressed this split among specialties:<disp-quote>
<p>“Even the oncologists avoid to talk to their patients about end-of-life issues, even when they have untreatable stage IV cancers, and guess who has to break the news to the patient and families when they come to the hospital with seizures from metastatic brain cancer, or respiratory failure, etc … why are the primary care physicians there to fill the night, weekends, holiday coverage, and mainly doing the "dirty and painful work?” When a patient who has already undergone surgery, seen an oncologist and a radiation therapist for chemo and radiation [treatment] has not been told that they will not be cured of their stage IV non small cell lung cancer…and that [primary care practitioners] have to do it on or near the last day of their life…”</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although presumably an extreme case, this presentation can perhaps be best explained by the differing amount of professional experiences of primary care providers and family medicine physicians (as the specialties with the lowest PEAS scores) have in dealing with terminally ill patients. Furthermore, the relatively higher amount of professional experiences with EOLC experienced by some specialties might account for the polar difference in PEAS scores for hospitalists and urgent care physicians.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>A significant limitation is the overall response rate for the physicians of all specialties participating in this study. Of a potential 5141 respondents, 622 physicians (roughly 12%) participated in the study. With average response rates of around 50%, this response set seems fairly limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049909111429558">11</xref></sup> No incentives, monetary, or otherwise were able to be offered to potential respondents, which could account for the lower response rates. However, the number of participants in published EOLC surveys average around 200, so the 622 respondents to this study seems adequate to provide additional results from which to design further studies on EOLC.</p>
<p>Potential bias also exists within the survey, most significantly from the fact that the study was conducted entirely within a Catholic health care system. The subject pool drawn from such a system might have cultural response sets different from a nondenominational health care system, therefore skewing the data. It must be pointed out, however, that there is no requirement for physicians to be Catholic in order to practice within this system. Another limitation to the study was that the overwhelming majority of respondents (80%) practiced in the state of Missouri, with the other respondents practicing in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. This could promote a geographic cultural bias in these responses, further distorting the data. Finally, 69% of respondents practiced medicine for “10+” years. The other offered categories of “2 to 5 years” and “6 to 10” years both garnered 18% and 11% of respondents, 5% of the sample responded “0 to 1 year.” This skew in age results in a potential bias toward physicians, respectively, with only longer experience.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Recommendation</title>
<p>With expansion of EOLC in hospitals nationwide, it is crucial for physicians to be well versed in EOLC. However, many physicians in the modern health care system are uncomfortable discussing such care with their patients. It is necessary to address this issue with data-driven information if physician comfort levels are to be improved. Although the majority of respondents in this study reported experience in dealing with terminally ill patients in academic and clinical situations, their PEAS scores showed moderate anxiety in administering EOLC.</p>
<p>Thus, it seems that additional training may be needed to lower the apprehension of physicians in understanding and/or administering EOLC. This training could come in a number of forms but should include providing physicians with additional professional experiences in treating terminally ill patients, as demonstrated by the impact of inpatient hospice visit experience on PEAS scores. Other potential additional training could range from lecture sessions on EOLC to clinical visits to inpatient hospices. Regardless, it is important that these training sessions on professional interaction with patients in EOLC, as this had the highest impact on lowering PEAS scores. In this way, physicians may continue to improve their delivery of optimal EOLC.</p>
