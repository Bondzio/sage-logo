<abstract>
<p>This paper derives literature-based components of social capital. Since social capital changes form given the context, the paper uses the theoretical concepts of social capital to observe how they play out in rural tribal India. A qualitative data-coding software is used to sieve through the literature as well as to analyze the empirical data from Jhabua. The coding procedure combines theoretical codes based on previous literature and emergent codes derived from interview data. The paper suggests that not all forms of social capital are positive. However, each component must be clearly understood to promote community-driven actions towards development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The literature does not indicate one clear definition of social capital. But there seems to be a general agreement that social capital has two broad divisions; first, structural social capital which includes social structures, organizations, institutions; second, cognitive social capital which is based on mental processes and psychology in the domain of ideas and includes particularly norms, values, attitudes, and beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611430191">Cattell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611430191">Forrest and Kearns, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611430191">Lin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021909611430191">Woolcock, 2001</xref>). Therefore, the structural (embeddedness), opportunity (accessibility) and action-oriented (use) aspects of social capital reinforces an identity and recognition to an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611430191">Forrest and Kearns, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611430191">Lin 1999</xref>). The main essence of social capital, as observed from the definitions, is using the strength of networks to create a unique communal identity which helps to mobilize individual resources toward achieving a common goal. In the context of education, this could be a parent–teacher association coordinating their activities to promote student learning, or a local government body discussing the quality of education in local village schools. In a larger context, this community-driven action could translate into economic or political development.</p>
<p>This paper will first empirically derive the components of social capital from an extensive literature base of 64 articles. The literature review helps remove some of the existing fuzziness in the definition of social capital. The following section describes the context of the Jhabua district followed by the sampling and data collection procedures. The analysis section uses the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611430191">Grootaert and Bastelaer’s (2002)</xref> framework to align literature-driven components of social capital to the empirical components of social capital. The discussion and conclusion section follows. Prior to this study, there have been very few studies that have contextualized social capital in the Indian setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909611430191">Krishna, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909611430191">Pantoja, 2002</xref>). This study will help to widen the literature base and craft out the definition of social capital in a tribal rural Indian setting.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<sec id="section3-0021909611430191">
<title>Social Capital and its Components: Methodology of the Literature Review</title>
<p>To be able to contextualize social capital to the Indian setting, the first step would be to understand what constitutes ‘social capital’ and how it has been defined in the literature so far. The purpose of this section of the literature synthesis is to parse different components of social capital. This literature review is a synthesis of 64 articles from journals, edited books, book sections, etcetera. The method used is as follows. I categorized the definitions of social capital using the following framework – very general and complex statements describing broad categories of the concept were placed under the ‘constructs’ category. Note that the constructs are not mutually exclusive and may tend to overlap. More specific elements of the definitions were placed under the ‘domains’ category. If the author presented examples on how these domains were operationalized, they were placed under the ‘indicator’ category.</p>
<p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611430191">Wu and Pretty (2004)</xref> describes social capital in terms of ‘relations of trust, reciprocity and exchanges, common rules, norms and sanctions and connectedness, networks and groups’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611430191">2004</xref>: 1). This was defined as a social capital construct. The author further sub-classifies connectedness as ‘Three types of connectedness have been identified as important for the networks within, between and beyond communities. These are called bonding, bridging and linking types of social capital’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611430191">2004</xref>: 2). Therefore, bonding, bridging and linking types of social capital are the domains in my classification category. The author further provides indicators of connectedness which show how these domains are measured or become visible:
<disp-quote>
<p>households with greater connectedness have been shown to have higher incomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909611430191">Krishna, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021909611430191">Narayan and Pritchett, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611430191">Wu and Pretty 2004</xref>), better health, educational achievements and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611430191">Fukuyama, 2000</xref>), improved social cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611430191">Baron et al., 2001</xref>) and lead to more honest government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021909611430191">Putnam, 1993</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611430191">Wu and Pretty, 2004</xref>: 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These were categorized as indicators. It is not necessary that all three categories need to be complete for each author, as it depends on the details provided by the author in each category. I used in-vivo text to do the classification and created an excel database for these classifications.</p>
<p>Following the creation of the database, I used QSR NVIVO 8 software to code the constructs and the domains. The coding procedure is used as a data reduction strategy which helped to synthesize the classification and also map out the frequency of each of the constructs and the domains. I used in-vivo unstructured coding for this process.</p>

</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The data presented in the table are the number and percentage of references corresponding to their constructs and domains using the unstructured coding. Percentage are calculated out of the total number of references coded (total number of referenced coded = 714) from 64 articles. Please note that the number of references for the construct labels is not a summation of the number of references for the domains under the same construct. The constructs are coded independently of the domains, since some articles do not break down the construct into its corresponding domains. For example, for the cooperation and coordination construct, there are 28 references that were coded; their corresponding article sources did not break the construct down into its domains. But there were articles that described the sub-domains in detail, which have been coded and reported independently. In other words, the number of references for the construct will not match the summation of the references to the corresponding domain.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021909611430191">Table 2</xref> shows that, among all the constructs and the domains, the most references were for interpersonal trust (with 56 references), followed by social and civic norms (with 51 references), social control (with 49 references), structural group membership (with 47 references) and neighborhood-ecological effect (with 42 references). The data indicates that mutual trust, structural group membership and neighborhood factors form an important part of the social capital construct. Social capital is also explained by social and civic norms and a means to exert social control which is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611430191">Bourdieu’s (1970)</xref> concept of cultural capital. This analysis presents the importance given in the literature to certain aspects of social capital over others.</p>

<title>Context of Jhabua</title>
<p>Jhabua is located in the western most part of Madhya Pradesh, touching the state of Rajasthan in the north, Gujarat in the west and Maharashtra in the south. The district is primarily rural with about 1,313 inhabited villages and has almost 89% tribal constitution. On development indicators such as literacy, age of women at (first) marriage, infant mortality, and nutritional status of women, Madhya Pradesh in central India is counted among the least-developed states in India. Madhya Pradesh hosts the largest tribal<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021909611430191">1</xref></sup> populations in India (10 million – i.e., one fourth of the total state population; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611430191">Adak et al., 2000</xref>). Jhabua is the seventh least-developed district in India with an overall adult literacy of about 36.9% and female literacy of 25.7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611430191">Government of India, 2009</xref>). Fifty nine percent of the residents live below the poverty line.</p>
<p>The history of Jhabua started to emerge in the 16th century when the Islamic rulers started a mission to suppress the local residents, the Bhils, under Emperor Jehangir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611430191">Bajaj, 2008</xref>). The Bhil leader Jhabbu Naik (who has lent his name to the region) vigorously fought against the Islamic empire. Since then the Bhils have fought many battles with the Mughal rulers, the Marathas and later the British (1817–18). Bhil uprisings continued until the First Indian war of Independence (1857) where Bhil leaders sided with the Indian freedom fighters. However, the rulers of Jhabua took the side of the British. The known history of Bhils is thus of vigorous struggles against any external influence or domination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611430191">Bajaj, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The two most predominant tribes in Jhabua are the Bhil and the Bhilala.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021909611430191">2</xref></sup> The Bhil are organized into a number of patriarchal exogamous clans. They include 11 sub-groups. Traditionally they practiced polygamy. The Bhilala are a mixed tribe which sprang from marriages between Rajput<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021909611430191">3</xref></sup> men and Bhil women and are divided into four sub-groups. They speak the ‘Bhili’ dialect mixed with Malwi Hindi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611430191">Shrivastava, 2006</xref>). The tribal numbers are fast declining because of the influence of Christianity, Buddhism and other religions. For many, Christianity is a way to escape from being treated as ‘untouchables’ and ‘impure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021909611430191">Sedwal and Kamat, 2008</xref>). Their main occupation is agriculture and cattle rearing but, because of the development of roads in the area, the agriculture and cattle rearing areas have reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611430191">Shrivastava, 2006</xref>). There is seasonal agriculture in the region and, because of the lack of water in the summer months, most families migrate to the neighboring state of Gujarat. Poorly-designed poverty elimination programs of the government, corruption at various levels of the compensation distribution channels and lack of awareness and education have resulted in a poverty trap for the tribals. Indebtedness is common among the tribals of Jhabua, which often leads to exploitation by the money lenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909611430191">Amanullah and Sharma, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>The resident tribes of Jhabua have a very active community life; all their rituals and festivities are conducted in the public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611430191">Bajaj, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611430191">Shrivastava, 2006</xref>). Symbolic of popular culture is the <italic>haat</italic>, which is a weekly market in larger villages and towns in the district. Along with its economic significance, the <italic>haat</italic> is an important ritualistic and festive occasion for the tribals, which is accompanied by dancing wearing silver jewelry, fine clothes and also the use of weaponry.</p>
<p>The tribal community’s most important festival is the <italic>Bhagoria</italic> spring festival. This festival is closely associated with the <italic>haat. Bhagoria</italic> is the name of the dance that is performed in a group. It is said that many young men and women find partners while performing the dance. Bright red and florescent yellow are common color clothes for this occasion. Festivals in Jhabua are celebrated as community events; the festivities are held in common places, in the weekly <italic>haat</italic>, village squares or village temples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611430191">Bajaj, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611430191">Nahar, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611430191">Shrivastava, 2006</xref>). The day after Bhagoria is celebrated by the community praying to the deity <italic>Gal-Bapji</italic> for the protection against all diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611430191">Shrivastava, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Not only do the tribals celebrate and pray together, they also work together. During the harvest season, the farmer community collectively decides on a schedule of harvesting all fields in the village. That is, instead of working on their own fields, they all harvest a field and move together to another field, until all are harvested. This practice is repeated every year and is called the <italic>halama</italic>. The associated custom of <italic>arji-paraji</italic> denotes that labor is loaned for urgent agricultural purposes, and the family receiving such a loan needs to pay back when required. Such exchange allows the Bhils to avoid hiring labor for money. Even the irrigation system, called the <italic>Pat of Sakri</italic>, is constructed and maintained jointly by farmers. The Bhils also have their own judicial system which they call the <italic>jati-panchayats</italic>. These are un-official village meetings that settle the disputes within the communities. It is believed that the faith in these panchayat proceedings is such that even in the cases that are settled in the secular national judicial courts system in India, the parties do not believe that full justice has been done until the verdict is passed by the <italic>jati-panchayats</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611430191">Bajaj, 2008</xref>). The Bhils have a belief that disputes must not be continued and must be settled by the <italic>jati-panchayats.</italic> These customs emphasize social discipline and cohesion within the Bhil society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611430191">Bajaj, 2008</xref>). Thus, Jhabua showcases a community with a strong social capital factor and therefore makes it an interesting case study.</p>

<sec id="section6-0021909611430191" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>A case-study approach is useful since the cases (individual respondents) are in a bounded system, which are the villages, and situated in a context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021909611430191">Creswell and Clark, 2007</xref>). There are six existing blocks<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0021909611430191">4</xref></sup> in Jhabua District. To get a representative sample, villages were selected from all the six blocks. Two to three villages were randomly sampled from an exhaustive list of all the villages provided by the Census of India 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021909611430191">Government of India, 2001</xref>). Data is collected from a total of 14 randomly-selected villages scattered across all the six blocks. Purposeful sampling is used to select the village leader from each village, followed by convenience sampling to select the cases in the village (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611430191">Richards and Morse, 2007</xref>). The main data collection techniques involved group interviews and semi-structured individual interviews, along with field observations, village mapping, etcetera. Each interview lasted for 45–50 minutes. The protocols for the interviews are adapted from instruments used in previous social capital literature. QSR NVIVO 8 software is used to analyze the data. The coding procedure combines theoretical codes based on previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611430191">Glaser, 1978</xref>, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611430191">Ezzy, 2002</xref>) and emergent codes derived from the data.</p>
<p>Villages are typically hamlets (also called <italic>phalias</italic>) comprised of scattered sub-communities based on their castes. From the villages selected, all sub-communities were included in the data collection to gather information on forms of collective organizations such as local government bodies (village education committees, village panchayats<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0021909611430191">5</xref></sup>) and parent–teacher associations existing in the village will either be a part of the structured individual interviews or group interviews. In each village, the typical data-collection activity would include meeting the village leader who is usually a <italic>panchayat</italic> member or someone educated in the village – more often it was an elderly person in the village. The meeting was in the open and attracted other members of the village. The discussion in the interviews included guided and unguided conversations, formal meeting interactions and multiple-respondent interviews. This was followed by a transect walk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021909611430191">Rietbergen-McCracken and Narayan, 1998</xref>) across the village to draw a map of the village with the help of the village members.</p>

<p>The framework is modified by including the non-cognitive outcomes along with the cognitive outcomes on the X axis, where the cognitive aspects would be covered in quadrant II and the non-cognitive part is included in quadrant IV. Apart from governance-related factors in quadrant II, the quadrant is extended to include other positive and negative outcomes of social capital like cognitive abilities, social control, routine activities and co-operation and co-ordination. This framework is useful as it presents a macro overview of social capital. The discussion on the constructs follows.</p>

<title>Structural and Institutional Mechanism</title>
<p>The domains under this construct, as derived by the conceptual coding process, are the diversity of institutions, efficacy of the institutions, institutional resources and the vertical hierarchical organization. Institutions in the social capital literature are defined in terms of their hierarchical structure. Please refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021909611430191">Table 1</xref> for descriptions of each domain in the literature review section. Quadrant I comprises of higher-order institutions with authority, most likely with the state involvement. As defined in the literature ‘the structural category, broadly speaking, is associated with social organization of various kinds and particularly with roles and rules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611430191">Carroll, 2001</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>The interview data from Jhabua suggests that the central social organization in the village that has the responsibility of all development work is perceived to be the panchayat. Upon being asked the question, ‘for any development work in the village, like digging up a well, or constructing a road, whom will you go to first?’, the respondents in most villages usually replied ‘I will ask the sarpanch [head of the panchayat] and then go to the panchayat meeting’. The <italic>panch</italic> or the five heads of the panchayat are perceived to be the main ‘problem resolvers’ in the village. All matters in the village are reported in the panchayat meeting, but there is also a belief that their problems go unattended. In a village that needed a pond to be deepened before summer, they requested the panchayat and the respondent complained that the matter was dismissed by authorities. ‘The sarpanch does not listen to us. He does what he feels like doing’, indicating that the efficacy of the structural mechanism was questionable. The relationship with the panchayats is an excellent depiction of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611430191">Coleman’s (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611430191">1990</xref>) notion that social capital includes ‘vertical associations characterized by hierarchical relationships and unequal power distribution among members’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021909611430191">Grootaert, 1999</xref>: 5). The indicator of the vertical and hierarchical organizations ‘encompasses formalized institutional relationships and structures, such as governments, political regimes, the rule of law, court systems, and civil and political liberties’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021909611430191">Serageldin and Grootaert, 1997</xref>: 46).</p>
<p>However, these vertical and hierarchical linkages weaken when it comes to education. I asked them ‘if the teacher stops coming to the village primary school or is absent for many days, what would you do?’. Only a handful of respondents indicated that they will complain to the <italic>Sarpanch</italic> (head of the panchayat), whereas most of them said that they will not do anything nor complain to the school principal. Therefore there is a clear disconnect between the central authoritative power of the village and education.</p>
<p>Diversity, efficacy and resources of institutions are important domains under the structural and institutional mechanism and play a vital part in the development of social capital. The inefficiencies of the government-delivery system are evident from the interview data. Upon being asked the three most critical problems in the village, most of the respondents complained that there was infrequent electricity (only one or two hours a day) as it hampered their work. They also complained about the great distances they needed to travel to visit the nearest hospitals for humans and their cattle. They complained that the hospitals charged them the full rate for medicines and were not subsidized and usually had a shortage of medicine and hospital beds. The third main problem that they often mentioned was the lack of employment in the village because of which they needed to travel to other states and become daily wage earners. Inadequate water and roads were also mentioned. Again, very few people mentioned that the low literacy rate was a major problem in the village. Upon being asked if the teachers were sufficient in number in the school, they readily replied that there were two teachers for grades 1 to 5 and that this was sufficient. Large class sizes had become a norm in the village.</p>

<sec id="section12-0021909611430191">
<title>Social and Civic Norms</title>
<p>Social and civic norms as described in the literature are conditions that help to foster collective action. Durlauf states that ‘social capital can be simply defined as an instantiated set of informal values or norms shared members that permit them to cooperate with one another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611430191">2002</xref>: 1). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611430191">Edwards et al. (2003)</xref> narrate that ‘social capital leads people to act in the interests of collective “public” good not just self-interest’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611430191">2003</xref>: 85). The Jhabua data presents a negative side of social norms. For example, one of the questions was ‘do men and women both attend the panchayat meeting?’, and a respondent replied that ‘they call the women if there is a special meeting on women’s programs. They are called then’. This norm has been institutionalized, which deters the women to participate in any village level decision. In a Janpadh<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0021909611430191">6</xref></sup> meeting in Ranapur block, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO, earlier called the Block Development Officer [BDO]) presided over the meeting with the elected Janpadhs. A government mandate requires 33% of elected members to be women. In the meeting, the elected Janpadh women came with their husbands who occupied the front row and made all the decisions, while the women kept silent. During the data-collection process, gender norms were made clear when I was not allowed to talk to women directly without the men of the households being present. Female respondents first checked with their husbands whether their answers were correct or not. Norms included restriction on meeting people; for instance, I asked a female respondent if she spoke with others in the village, she replied ‘no, I don’t go outside. Men go outside, women stay at home’. In another instance, I asked ‘if there needs to be some development work in the village, who will you contact?’. The reply was ‘my husband will go to the Janpadh’. Women with posts are also not regarded with much esteem. In one of the villages, I asked if the panchayat meetings were held regularly and the respondent replied by saying ‘No. A lady is the sarpanch and she has no clue, her husband does everything’.</p>
<p>An unsaid civic norm is not to visit the hamlets where the Dalits reside. The Dalits, also called <italic>harijans</italic> are among the ‘lower’ categories of Hindus and have been traditionally been referred to as the ‘untouchables’. During my transect walk in one of the villages, I was asked if I needed to go to the Dalit side of the village. It was sort of a warning signal as they wanted me to be aware that the area is not visited frequently. Civic norms in Jhabua foster a negative form of social capital which promotes collective action, but at the same time excludes women and some sections of the society.</p>

<title>Quadrant II: Governance; At the Intersection of Macro and Cognitive</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611430191">Grootaert and Bastelaer’s (2002)</xref> framework defines this quadrant in terms of governance. For the analysis in this paper, I have adopted a broader view which incorporates the potential uses and benefits of social capital. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021909611430191">Woolcock (2001)</xref> defines social capital under two dimensions: first, by the sources of social capital (e.g., through networks, groups, etc.); second, by the potential uses of social capital (e.g., cooperation, trust, etc.). Quadrant II is best suited to describe the potential uses of social capital that fit the macro and cognitive lens. Potential uses of social capital divided into the following constructs: cognitive abilities, cooperation and coordination, routine activities and social control.</p>
<sec id="section14-0021909611430191">
<title>Cognitive Abilities</title>
<p>The conceptual coding indicated a limited role of this domain with only 11 references in the literature database on this construct, validating the fact that there is a gap in the literature that shows the impact of social capital on cognitive abilities. This domain highlights the link between education and social capital which was first studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021909611430191">Putnam (1993)</xref>, followed by some of his later extension to the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611430191">Helliwell and Putnam, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021909611430191">Putnam, 1995</xref>). His analysis shows that education is one of the most important predictors of political and social engagement. This insight had multiple forms in Jhabua. I visited a school in Ranapur block with only a handful of children sitting in a classroom with no teacher. I asked one of the parents who came to school when they saw me.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Do they feel that the children will benefit from coming to school?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Respondent:</speaker>
<p>It has been 2–3 years and the children don’t even know all the alphabets. Then what is the point of sending the children to school.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>They don’t teach in school?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Respondent:</speaker>
<p>No. The teacher, she teaches, but the head master does not.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Can’t you complain about the master?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Respondent:</speaker>
<p>We don’t understand how to do it. We are not educated.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>So now you don’t send your children to school?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Respondent:</speaker>
<p>There is no benefit. At least in 12 months, my son should be able to write his name. But he still doesn’t know all the alphabets, then what is the point in sending the children to school.</p>
</speech>
<p>The helplessness of the uneducated parent is evident from the response, which increases the probability of his child dropping out of school and promoting the dysfunctional school by this action. The main reason for a lack of interest towards the school system is the low literacy levels of the parents in the village.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0021909611430191">
<title>Cooperation and Coordination</title>
<p>This construct is further broken down into the following domains: diffusion of innovation, economic development, efficacy of collective interest, information dissemination, political efficacy and problem solving. Economic development, or lack of, was a dominant theme in the Jhabua data. Economic development was linked to cyclical migration which the families undertook each year because of lack of employment. Migration is dependent on the networks with agents who guarantee employment to the migrants in the neighboring states. These agents would visit the villages in Jhabua and would promise jobs to potential migrants. When the agricultural cycle ends, the villagers contact the agents and decide on their travel schedules. There was a general belief that over the years their standard of living has increased and this is made possible because of better education. ‘Earlier when a letter used to arrive, we had to go to the nearest town 10 kilometers far for someone to read the letter. Now the situation has improved’. There are more literate individuals in the village now as compared to past years. But job opportunities have not kept pace with the growing needs. The theoretical concept of political efficacy in the data was in the form of going to cast a vote at the time of elections. Almost all the respondents, most of whom were not educated, went to cast their vote.</p>
<p>Information dissemination had both formal and informal sources. The informal sources of information were through the ration shop of the village or in the <italic>haat</italic> (local market places), where people generally met. In one of the villages, the women said that they would know if the teacher turned up in the school or not. While drawing water from a hand pump near the school, they kept a close watch to see what the children were doing in the school. Other respondents mentioned that to get any information about the school, they would go to the school itself and ask the headmaster or the teacher. None of the respondents relied on the parent–teacher associations or village education committee to gain information about the functioning of the school. Nor did any respondent have any informal or casual conversation about their child’s education with each other. Most respondents were not even aware if their local schools had a parent–teacher association. A few mentioned that they were aware of a self-help group which consisted of parents that helped with the midday meal at school.</p>
<p>In contrast, to get information about a government scheme they would be more proactive to take the help of structural government systems like the Sarpanch or the panchayats. Most villages did not have a community hall (panchayat bhavan) or a common place to watch television. Other sources of information like newspapers, radios and private television were rare.</p>
<p>Multiple authors refer to cooperation and coordination in the literature with the main essence being that ‘strong networks enable communities to solve collective action problems by breeding cooperation and easing coordination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021909611430191">Bhrehm and Rahn, 1997</xref>: 999). However, the Jhabua data presents an interesting division between tasks that require coordination and cooperation and tasks that do not. For instance, any school-related problem is usually dealt with individually or within the family. But if the family or individual needed to borrow money, they would ‘ask the neighbors first, if they can’t give [the money] then will go to the market or to some money lender’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0021909611430191">
<title>Routine Activities</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909611430191">Sampson et al. (2002)</xref> discuss that social capital helps people perform their routine activities. If we take into consideration the festivities, yearly carnivals, and activities at the temple, which form a part of their routine activities as described, many elements of social capital are incorporated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0021909611430191">
<title>Social Control</title>
<p>This construct taps into aspects of negative social capital. The concept shares some aspects of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611430191">Bourdieu’s (1970)</xref> concept of cultural capital. In Jhabua, the Sarpanch has the power to exert control over the village. In an interview, I asked ‘have you ever got together to work on some issue?’. The villager leader’s response was ‘No one goes to the sarpanch, I am the only one who speaks up. The people get suppressed easily, so there is no voice’. In the same village, another respondent mentioned that ‘we don’t attend the panchayat meetings since we don’t get along with the Sarpanch’. The village Sarpanch had a notorious reputation of exploiting his power.</p>
<p>Other reported instance of exploitation by the Sarpanch included a case where a household with income below the poverty line<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0021909611430191">7</xref></sup> was not given government-subsidized food grain from the ration stock, claiming that they were above the poverty line.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>You didn’t get ration card?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Respondent:</speaker>
<p>No we didn’t.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Why?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Respondent:</speaker>
<p>Because the sarpanch is corrupt.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Do you collect together and demand for something?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Respondent:</speaker>
<p>No one can go and demand for things collectively as the sarpanch uses violence.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Did you go to the panchayat meetings?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Respondent:</speaker>
<p>No I didn’t go. They are not useful. If I complain, the sarpanch gets drunk and does violence [sic].</p>
</speech>
<p>Schools are not devoid of using their way of exerting control. The respondents in many villages reported that the headmaster would take bribes from the funds that were allotted to the self-help group to prepare the meals. He would take the present representative to the bank and ask him to draw money and the parent not being able to read or write would not know the reason for drawing the money. Other government schemes which promised middle-school girls bicycles to trek to school every day did not come through. Or in some cases, the bicycles would be built using cheap materials and would wear out in no time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611430191">Edwards et al. (2003)</xref> state that ‘here, social ties constitute a means for social control through the generation and sustenance of norms of approved social behavior, and the sanctioning of disapproved behavior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611430191">2003</xref>: 85). Here corruption is actually leading to social reproduction, despite the state’s attempts to mitigate it through social programs for the marginalized. Such behavior would help the education system to maintain its status quo of providing poor-quality education and other linked facilities at the cost of the parents and the children.</p>

<sec id="section18-0021909611430191">
<title>Quadrant III: Local Institutions, Networks; At the Intersection of Structural and Micro</title>
<p>Quadrant III is shared by two constructs: civic engagement and neighborhood-ecological effect. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021909611430191">Woolcock and Narayan (2000)</xref> would characterize this quadrant under the ‘institutional view’ of social capital. The institutional characterization of social capital suggests that ‘this approach argues that the very capacity of social groups to act in their collective interest depends on the quality of the formal institutions under which they reside’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021909611430191">North, 1990</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021909611430191">Woolcock and Narayan, 2000</xref>: 66). In the case of Jhabua, the efficiency of the local government agencies like the panchayat plays a critical role in the participation and trust of the villagers in this formal institution. The following are some of the categories in this quadrant.</p>
<sec id="section19-0021909611430191">
<title>Civic Engagement</title>
<p>The structural group membership construct is further broken down into domains which present different dimensions of the group characteristics: density of membership, type of horizontal and vertical organizations, inclusiveness and diversity and intensity and nature of activities. Civic engagement or social participation is further classified into structural group membership which ‘includes the composition and practices of local level institutions . . . that serve as instruments of community development. Structural social capital is built through horizontal organizations and networks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611430191">Bain and Hicks, 1998</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611430191">Krishna and Shrader, 1999</xref>: 98). These local organizations are unlike the formal institutional structures as described in quadrant 1, but can still be categorized into horizontal and vertical organizations. Indicators of the local organizations are ‘local religious organizations; neighborhood watch programs; block groups, tenant associations, or community council; business or civic groups; ethnic or nationality clubs; and local political organizations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021909611430191">Sampson et al., 1999</xref>: 207). Jhabua data shows that many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are working on primary and adult education, micro-credit activities, vocational training, agriculture related activities like wormi-culture, etcetera. The government has also been active in some of these areas and initiated their work by forming self-help groups that focused on specific social issues. In one of the villages, the key informant was a woman who headed a women’s self-help group formed with the help of the Jhabua Forest Department. The group’s activities included lending money to a family in need, saving a Rupee a day in the combined pool. It was interesting to find gender roles prominent here again, where the women had to take permission from their husbands to be a part of this group. But the group gave them a sense of confidence that they could help their family financially if the need arose. The membership in most NGOs was open and inclusive and diversity in the group was celebrated.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>How did you decide that these are the things on which we can take a loan and we can work accordingly? Did you always have formal meetings?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Respondent 1:</speaker>
<p>First we had a meeting and decided if we will be able to do this or not. All of us said that we can do this and we can work together. We also asked our husbands that they should not drink alcohol and fight with us. They also agreed that we can do this work. We also decided that if any man drinks alcohol, we all women will get together and fight with him.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Respondent 2:</speaker>
<p>The group made a lot of social improvements in the village.</p>
</speech>
<p>Since most of these initiatives were instituted through government policies that changed when different parties came into power, the continuity of the program was thus affected. The same holds for the NGOs as their programs are dependent on the funds they receive. Due to the lack of continuity in any of these programs, there is no sustainability of the activities these programs initiated.</p>
<p>Other local groups like the parent–teacher associations (PTA), self-help parent groups that oversee the preparation of the midday meals, and village education committees were not mentioned as a recognized part of local groups in the village. Some respondents reported that they were aware that a PTA and a self-help group exist, but they were not aware of their roles and duties. This finding is similar to a study in Madhya Pradesh which found that parents and school committees are neither aware of their oversight roles nor participated in school management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021909611430191">Pandey et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0021909611430191">
<title>Neighborhood-Ecological Effect</title>
<p>Neighborhood effect has been widely studied in the literature. Social capital enhancement through neighborhood effect can occur through multiple pathways, one of which is through ‘kinship/friendship, ties [which] measures the number and relative proportion of friends and relatives that respondents reported living in the neighborhood factor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021909611430191">Sampson et al., 1999</xref>: 207). This ‘neighborhood activism’ is broken down into the following domains within family network and ties (indicator–parent–child interactions); informal horizontal relationship (indicator–neighbors chatting with each other); level and density of social ties. This construct attempts to tap into informal networks and associations through the attribute of spatial proximity. Jhabua data indicate a strong level of family ties. Since the family size is usually large (with more than two children each), the children with their families settle down in the same hamlet and work on their family-owned fields.</p>
<p>Regardless of the fact that the hamlets are extremely scattered, the residents of the hamlets had knowledge of their neighboring families in other hamlets. The families would often go to the <italic>haat</italic> together or take part in the Bhagoria festival together. Same cultural practices, rituals and festivals strengthened the social ties. In many of my meetings, informal discussions between individuals would mainly include agriculture-related issues. For instance, Jhabua witnessed one of its worst droughts in the year 2009. Discussions focused around plantations and how the drought was drying out the seeds. However, it was not surprising to find that neither the school nor education broadly was discussed at all. Since there was only a single school in the village, one would imagine that it would naturally be a common concern, but this was not the case.</p>

<sec id="section21-0021909611430191">
<title>Quadrant IV: Trust, Local Norms, Values; At the Intersection of Micro and Non-Cognitive</title>
<p>The label that best describes these attributes is the ‘psychological sense of community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611430191">Lochner et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Social capital, as defined by its principle theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611430191">Coleman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021909611430191">Putnam, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021909611430191">1995</xref>), consists of those features of social organization such as networks of secondary associations, high levels of interpersonal trust and norms of mutual aid and reciprocity which act as resources for individuals and facilitate collective action. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611430191">Lochner et al., 1999</xref>: 260)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This affective construct is broken down into the following components: attitudes, behavior, expectation of reciprocity, group identification, interpersonal trust, predispositions, shared values and beliefs, social cohesion and social relationships.</p>
<p>The literature treats this construct as an important component of social capital, of which institutional and personal trust are a large part. To tap into the institutional trust component, questionnaires used in Jhabua included questions on the trust the individual had on the following entities and their duties: politicians – to fulfill promises; military – to defend the country; police – to enforce the law; state government – to look after the people; newspapers – to print the truth; village panchayats – to implement public projects; schools – to provide good education; hospitals and doctors – to provide good treatment; courts – to meet out justice; and, finally, banks – to keep money safe.

<p>Thirty-nine percent of the responses were positive, closely followed by no trust at all with 37% of the responses. If we look at the categories, they trusted the government, the panchayats and, with less or no trust at all, for politicians, hospitals, police, banks and courts.</p>
<p>A majority of the respondents reported that they trusted each other (82%) on matters relating to borrowing money in times of need, or if they needed some help, they believed that their neighbors would help them. In a few villages (not generalized to all), trust seems to be a function of the tribe. ‘Since there are Patlias here there is trust among people. Trust is the same’ and ‘Yes, I trust my own caste members and not others’. There is a general belief that Patlias are more honest and trustworthy than the Bhils. In a village with only Patlia residents, the respondents reported that they trusted each other because they were from the Patlia tribe. Whereas Bhils, who are said to have been victimized and exploited for many years, reported that they trusted each other while others said that there was no trust, but there were no tribe links to trust in these villages. In the interviews I asked if they trusted the money lenders, since the money lenders are known for charging more interest and thus practicing exploitative practices. The response was again linked to the caste ‘the money lender is from their own caste, so they trust him. Even if they go in the middle of the night, they get the money from him’. Apart from these tribe-based differences, which form a large part of group identification which attributed to social cohesion, the respondents did not complain about any other form of discrimination on the basis of education, income, landownership, etcetera.</p>
<p>In summary, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021909611430191">Table 2</xref> helps to observe the percentage of instances of each of the conceptual and emergent codes. The table indicates that, in each of the villages, there are higher incidences of the following codes: institutional resources, information, institutional efficacy, efficacy of collective interest, economic development and structural group membership and networks. Across all the 14 villages, civic engagement in the form of structural group membership had a considerable number of occurrences. Three villages show a high degree of participation in structural groups among all the villages. Development and lack of economic development also have a higher percentage of occurrences. Positive efficacy of collective interest has a higher number of occurrences for five villages out of the total of 14. Concurrently, four villages that report no action take as a part of the collective interest. Two villages also report negative action was taken as a part of the collective interest. More villages (four) indicate that there is a lack of informal horizontal relationships in the village and those that report presence of informal relationships (three). Social capital in the form of group identification shows higher percentage of occurrence in five villages. Interpersonal trust among the village residents is spread out to a larger number of villages as compared to incidences of lower level of trust. Incidences of social cohesion are present in more than five villages. Social capital in the form of civic norms is indicated in four villages. The efficacy of structural institutions has both positive and negative aspects, both of which have higher percentages of occurrence. Similarly, institutional resources and lack of institutional resources have a higher number of instances as well.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>As mentioned before, the theoretical coding from the literature indicates that, among all the constructs and the domains, the most references were for interpersonal trust (with 56 references), followed by social and civic norms (with 51 references), social control (with 49 references), structural group membership (with 47 references) and neighborhood-ecological effect with 42 references. The data indicates that mutual trust, structural group membership and neighborhood factors form an important part of the social capital construct. Please refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021909611430191">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>The empirical coding data from Jhabua suggest social capital is reflected more in terms of social organizations and their functions. Structural institutional mechanisms including institutional resources and efficacy of the institution are important empirical factors of social capital in the given context. The more affective constructs such as the institutional and interpersonal trust also define social capital in Jhabua. It is interesting to note that the interpersonal trust is a common predominant dimension for both the theoretical as well as the empirical data. Unlike the theoretical data, cooperation and coordination had a higher frequency of occurrence in the empirical data. The main domains were the efficacy of collective interest, information transmission and community dependence for problem solving purposes.</p>
<p>It is worth noticing that the social capital in the context of Jhabua relies more on operational and functional components of social capital. These constructs are cooperation and coordination, institutional and interpersonal trust and the structural and institutional mechanisms where the interpersonal trust is a function of the caste. The structural and institutional mechanisms would largely rely on the constitution and functioning of the local government system, mainly the panchayat. A negative form of social capital exists in the form of a corrupt head of the panchayat, but he/she plays an important role in the community. Literature also points out that all forms of social capital that otherwise play a critical role in facilitating certain actions or resources may become useless or even harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611430191">Coleman, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611430191">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611430191">John and Renzio, 1997</xref>, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909611430191">Pantoja, 2002</xref>). For instance, some social and civic norms – such as women interacting less with others in the community or voluntarily not participating in the village panchayat meetings – may not be beneficial for them or the society in the long run. Other local institutions such as NGOs also played an important role. However, groups linked to the school such as the self-help groups, PTAs and village education committees seem to be generally weak.</p>
<p>The strength of social capital depends on structural group memberships in formal institutional memberships and participation. The institution with multiple vertical and horizontal linkages has higher efficacy. For instance, participating in a PTA is not as effective as participation in the village panchayat as the panchayat has stronger linkages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909611430191">Pantoja’s (2002)</xref> case study on similar lines suggests that civic society and its social capital matter for community development when the government institutions and the general institutional framework of society at large are functioning efficiently. Therefore social capital simply acts as a catalyst to promote development and improve efficiency, but only when other institutional resources are in place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021909611430191">Serageldin and Grootaert, 1997</xref>, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909611430191">Pantoja 2002</xref>). Informal horizontal relationships and social ties improve social cohesion, but do not translate into development, political efficacy or school improvement.</p>
