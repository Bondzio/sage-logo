<abstract>
<p>Using a theoretical framework based on the concept of <italic>sexual proprietariness</italic>, findings from the National Violence Against Women Survey are presented. Prevalence of physical and sexual violence, stalking, threats of violence, and power and control were examined for the overall NVAW sample, for those women abused by an intimate partner in particular, and those who were physically abused during a pregnancy. Results indicate that women who are physically abused during pregnancy also experience higher levels of all other forms of abuse compared to women who are not pregnant when abused, including nearly twice the level of power and control.</p>

<body>
<p>Unlike other authors in this issue who contribute their personal interactions, collaborations, and warm memories of their friend and colleague, Margo Wilson, I never had the pleasure of meeting her. I was not yet active in academia during the years of discourse in conferences and other forums where I might have seen presentations of her work. However, the prolific and compelling work of Margo Wilson and Martin Daly has been a constant and fundamental source of inspiration for my research, teaching, and activism since I was first introduced to it at the beginning of my graduate studies in 2000.</p>
<p>The start of graduate school marked a rather drastic career change for me. While I was confident in my decision and excited by this new direction (and by moving <italic>away</italic> from a field that was wrong for me), I embarked on this new journey with a great deal of uncertainty as to where it might take me. My only certainty was that I had a passion for understanding domestic violence of all types and working toward making a positive impact in this field. I knew nothing about the rich history of scholarship in this discipline. I knew none of the names of the pioneers who had been involved in the movement to bring domestic violence into the mainstream of academic, political, and social discourse. I was completely oblivious to the fact that there was a division in the field of intimate partner violence (IPV) research, one that I would later address in an essay for my doctoral exams. I entered the field with blind faith because it is where I felt I belonged, and soon I was exposed to the work of others that affirmed this decision for me then as it continues to do now.</p>
<p>As I studied IPV in those early days of my new career, the sheer volume of material was at once fascinating, overwhelming, and intimidating. By the time a couple of years had passed, I had a master’s degree in sociology and a graduate certificate in domestic violence. While I had attempted to absorb as much as I could of the decades of literature in the various areas of domestic violence, I was left more with a nagging awareness of how much I <italic>didn’t</italic> know and understand than an appreciation for what I had learned. This awareness became acute and unbearable when, in my new job as a victim advocate, I was plagued by my frustration with the broken criminal justice system, seemingly little or no improvement in the dynamics of domestic violence than what I had studied from research published in the 1970s, and an increasing dissatisfaction with the limited impact I felt I was able to make in the advocate role. I wanted to learn more generally about my field, understand more comprehensively, and contribute in a more far-reaching way.</p>
<p>One of the more troubling patterns I identified in my caseload as a victim advocate was the high number of pregnant women who were victims of domestic violence, especially of the more severe forms of violence. While domestic violence perpetrated against any person is deeply disturbing, there was something particularly heartbreaking about seeing a pregnant woman with black eyes and abrasions on her face and body. One day I accompanied a woman who was more than 8 months pregnant to court and I had to guide her as she walked because her two blackened eyes were too swollen for her to see clearly. Ironically, I was also over 8 months pregnant myself and felt oddly guilty that I was healthy and unabused. Although we were about the same height and build, I weighed at least 20 pounds more and my pregnant belly was much larger–and I was a small pregnant woman. The effects of the abuse were far more conspicuous than this client’s bruises and cuts revealed.</p>
<p>Although I knew that my identification of this pattern was merely anecdotal, I sensed that there might be more to it. I thought back to some of the work I had studied for papers I had written in my MA program (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088767912460238">Block &amp; Christakos, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088767912460238">Campbell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088767912460238">Dobash, Dobash, Wilson, &amp; Daly, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1088767912460238">Radford &amp; Russell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088767912460238">Websdale, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088767912460238">Wilson &amp; Daly, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1088767912460238">1993</xref>). I reread some of that literature, this time through the eyes of a slightly more sophisticated student and as a practitioner. I discovered a more profound understanding of their work and felt a much deeper appreciation for the complexities of research generally, and especially in this particular discipline. This literature, once again, had changed the direction of my path, and would prove to be integral to my next steps, when, 2 years later in 2006, I found myself where I never thought I would be—enrolled in a doctoral program with the goal of becoming a research professor.</p>

<title>The Evolution of Pregnancy-Associated IPV Research</title>
<p>As recently as 2006, pregnancy-associated intimate partner violence (IPV) was still a developing substantive area of research in lethal and nonlethal IPV (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1088767912460238">Ballard et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088767912460238">Goodwin et al., 2000</xref>). Pregnancy-associated violence and homicide are usually defined as occurring during or within 1 year of pregnancy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088767912460238">Campbell, Glass, Sharps, Laughon, &amp; Bloom, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088767912460238">Chang, Berg, Saltzman, &amp; Herndon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1088767912460238">Shadigian &amp; Bauer, 2005</xref>). The studies published in this area are based on a variety of methodologies, making it difficult to compare studies or to agree on prevalence rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1088767912460238">Ballard et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088767912460238">Jasinski, 2004</xref>). In addition, the explanations for pregnancy-associated violence have been few and disparate across studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088767912460238">Jasinski, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Prevalence rates of nonlethal physical IPV against pregnant women are generally reported to be around 8% in studies conducted in the United States. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912460238">Gazmararian et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1088767912460238">Saltzman, Johnson, Gilbert, &amp; Goodwin, 2003</xref>). However, there is no national estimate available for nonlethal or lethal pregnancy-associated IPV, and studies are typically criticized for underestimating the scope of pregnancy-associated abuse. Furthermore, studies are not generalizable due to inconsistencies in sampling and methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088767912460238">McPhail &amp; Toiv, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty of prevalence in nonlethal and lethal (i.e., femicide) IPV, several studies indicate an increased risk in frequency and severity for intimate partner violence among pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088767912460238">Burch &amp; Gallup, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088767912460238">Helton &amp; Snodgrass, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088767912460238">Martin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1088767912460238">Richardson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1088767912460238">Stewart &amp; Cecutti, 1993</xref>). Some studies have also shown an increased risk for femicide during pregnancy and in the postnatal period (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088767912460238">Chang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088767912460238">Horon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1088767912460238">Krulewitch, Roberts, &amp; Thompson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088767912460238">McFarlane et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1088767912460238">Shadigian &amp; Bauer, 2005</xref>). These results lead some to conclude that “homicide is an infrequent event but is a leading cause of death for women of reproductive age” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088767912460238">Chang et al., 2005</xref>, p. 473). Findings such as these supported my impression that pregnancy-associated nonlethal and lethal violence was much more widespread than suggested by my own experience as a victim advocate. After exhaustively reviewing this body of literature, studying the various methodologies, and identifying areas where I might focus in my own research, a clear gap became increasingly apparent to me: the dearth of research on pregnancy-associated IPV and femicide that included psychological abuse specifically measures for power and control.</p>
<p>My decision to focus on power and control along with physical and sexual abuse led me to study again the literature from pioneers in the field who were so prolific in their work identifying power and control as powerful psychological tools used by abusers in both nonlethal and lethal IPV (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088767912460238">Campbell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088767912460238">Stark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1088767912460238">Wilson, Johnson, &amp; Daly, 1995</xref>). The work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088767912460238">Daly and Wilson (1988)</xref> would prove to be particularly useful. In fact, their concept of <italic>sexual proprietariness</italic> would serve as the theoretical framework of my own study of pregnancy-associated IPV and femicide. While this concept has been key in much IPV-related research over the years, it offers a plausible explanation for many of the findings specific to pregnancy-associated IPV and femicide.</p>

<title>Sexual Proprietariness</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088767912460238">Daly and Wilson (1988)</xref> explain that sexual proprietariness refers to a sense of ownership abusive men have over women, where women are viewed as subordinate generally and as property to their mate. Sexuality and reproduction are key tenets of the ownership, and violence, including lethal violence, is used to exercise the “right” to exert and maintain power and control. Jealousy and possessiveness are other key factors within the notion of sexual proprietariness, whereby the abusive man makes claims of infidelity, questions paternity, and displays jealousy over the children, particularly when the children are from a former male partner of the woman (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088767912460238">Campbell, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>With perceived ownership of sexuality and reproduction, and chronic jealousy of other men and children, it is no surprise that abusive men might feel particularly threatened during their partners’ pregnancies. After all, the woman is receiving a great deal of attention, her body size and shape are no longer under his control, and his sexual access to her is often limited. In addition, there might be the inherent opportunity to question her involvement with other men, perhaps even questioning the paternity of the child, especially in cases where the pregnancy was unplanned (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088767912460238">Bacchus, Mezey, &amp; Bewley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088767912460238">Campbell, Pugh, Campbell, &amp; Visscher, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088767912460238">Goodwin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088767912460238">Jasinski, 2004</xref>). In addition, he might also resent the time and attention the baby takes from him during the pregnancy and after the birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088767912460238">Bacchus et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the most revealing connections between sexual proprietariness and pregnancy-associated violence is with findings relative to the method of violence used against pregnant partners. Researchers have found that pregnant women report the abdomen and breasts are attacked by their abusers during violent incidences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088767912460238">Bacchus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088767912460238">Helton &amp; Snodgrass, 1987</xref>). In these cases, the overt physical violence also includes symbolic violence, with the swollen abdomen and harm to the unborn child included in the abuse. In addition, sexual abuse is often found during pregnancy, with the victims of the abuse revealing they believe the abuse generally is related to the pregnancy. These women report feeling that the types of abuse and the ways in which the men carry it out are directly related to their resentment toward her body changes, the baby, and of the lack of control the abuser feels under the circumstances of pregnancy and impending birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088767912460238">Bacchus et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings from the Chicago Women’s Health Risk Study include that pregnant women are at a greater risk for miscarriage when abused during their pregnancies and that the risk for miscarriage increases as severity of violence increases. Additionally, the risk for miscarriage associated with the most severe violence was found only for those women who had also experienced severe controlling behaviors, forced sex, or had a posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088767912460238">Morland, Leskin, Block, Campbell, &amp; Friedman, 2008</xref>). A host of other pre- and postnatal physical and psychological problems are common with abused woman and their babies in addition to miscarriage (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088767912460238">Bacchus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912460238">Pallitto, Campbell, &amp; O’Campo, 2005</xref>). In the more extreme cases, women are killed by their partners during or soon after their pregnancies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088767912460238">Campbell, Garcia-Moreno, &amp; Sharps, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912460238">Pallitto et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088767912460238">Wilson and Daly (1992</xref>, p. 90) refer to femicide as “aggressive proprietariness.” If it is true that the sense of ownership at the core of sexual proprietariness often includes a perceived right to maintain power and control over the woman (i.e., the property), then fatal IPV can be seen as either a final deadly exercise in exerting control, or as an act of defiance in the face of perceptions of lost control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088767912460238">Websdale, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1088767912460238">Wilson et al., 1995</xref>). This may also be the case with pregnancy-associated femicide. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088767912460238">Jasinski (2004)</xref> suggests that in cases of pregnancy-associated femicide, the man may view the <italic>pregnancy</italic> as the ultimate loss of control and may resort to lethal violence accordingly (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912460238">Taylor &amp; Jasinski, 2011</xref> for a full discussion of the paradoxical nature of femicide).</p>
<p>My interest in pregnancy-associated IPV and femicide led me to conduct several studies of pregnancy-associated IPV and femicide during my tenure as a doctoral student (results of which are forthcoming in separate publications). While various theoretical frameworks were evaluated and considered for the research, the work of Wilson and Daly was ultimately instrumental in shaping the theoretical and methodological decisions I made, such as including a wider variety of family dynamics in my variable choices and including multiple dimensions of violence, including sexual violence, stalking, threats of serious harm and/or death, and power and control tactics, in addition to physical abuse. Selected findings from analyses using the National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAW) illustrate the nature of this continuing research.</p>

<title>NVAW and Pregnancy-Associated IPV</title>
<p>The National Violence Against Women Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088767912460238">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000</xref>) consists of a nationally representative sample of 8,000 U.S. women surveyed about a number of forms of violent victimizations suffered over their lifetime. The national sample, as well as the availability of data on multiple forms of abuse, made the NVAW survey data an ideal source for this study of the effects of pregnancy on the various dimensions of violent victimization.</p>

<title>NVAW Violence Victimization</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088767912460238">Table 1</xref> shows frequency distributions of physical, sexual, stalking, and threats of violence, as well as the mean power and control score for the 8,000 respondents generally, and frequencies of violence by an intimate partner (IP) in particular. In the NVAW, IP-perpetrated physical abuse measures were adapted from the Conflict Tactics Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088767912460238">Straus, 1979</xref>), and included questions about 13 forms of physical acts ranging from pushing, grabbing, and shoving, to beating, to threatening harm, or actually using a weapon to attack the respondent. Sexual assault was measured by a combination of variables including vaginal, oral, or anal penetration by penis, tongue, fingers, or objects. Whether or not force or threat of force were used by the perpetrator and whether the acts were attempted or completed were combined with the sexual assault variables to determine sexual violence victimization status for each respondent. Stalking was measured using eight variables pertaining to unsolicited contact, following, and other forms of harassment. Women who reported that any of these forms of victimization had occurred repeatedly, along with having caused her fear of harm, were coded as stalking victims. Threats of harm or death were measured with one question where respondents answered “yes” or “no” to whether they had been threatened with harm or death.</p>

<p>Of the 8,000 NVAW respondents, 2,447 (30.6%) reported <italic>physical abuse</italic> over their lifetime, and 1,503 (61.4%) of those women were victims of IPV in particular. <italic>Sexual assault</italic> was reported by 1,235 (17.6%) NVAW respondents, with 332 (26.9%) of those women reporting IP-perpetrated sexual assault. <italic>Stalking</italic> was reported by 651 (8.1%) NVAW respondents, with 464 (71.3%) of them reporting IP-perpetrated. <italic>Threats of harm or death</italic> were reported by 301 (3.8%) NVAW survey respondents, with 76 (25.2%) of them reporting treats by an IP.</p>

<sec id="section5-1088767912460238">
<title>Pregnancy-Associated IPV</title>
<p>One difficulty with using the NVAW to study pregnancy-associated abuse is that the researchers did not ask all of the 8,000 respondents if they were pregnant during abuse. Rather, they asked only the subset of women who reported having been physically abused if they were pregnant during the abuse.

<p>Of the 150 women abused physically during pregnancy, 26.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 40) had also experienced stalking, 2.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 4) had also experienced threats of harm or death, and 16.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 25) had also been sexually abused, all by a current or former intimate partner. In addition, the mean power and control score of 6.37 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.49) for women abused by an intimate partner when pregnant is nearly <italic>twice</italic> the mean score of 3.34 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.00) for the entire NVAW sample of women.</p>
<p>Next, bivariate analyses were conducted to test the significance of associations between pregnancy-associated physical IP abuse and each of the other types of IP violence. Of the women who had experienced IP-perpetrated sexual assault, 7.5% had also been physically abused while pregnant, compared to 1.6% who had not experienced IP sexual assault (χ<sup>2</sup> = 60.207; <italic>df</italic> = 1), indicating a higher occurrence of IP-perpetrated sexual assault for women also abused when pregnant. Of the women who had been threatened with serious harm or death by a current or former IP, 5.3% had also been physically abused during pregnancy by a current or former IP, compared to 1.8% of women who had not been threatened (χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.787; <italic>df</italic> = 1), again indicating a higher occurrence of serious threats for women who have also endured pregnancy-associated IPV. Of the women who had been stalked by a current or former IP, 8.6% had also been abused when pregnant by a current or former IP, compared to 1.5% of women who had not experienced IP stalking, though the chi-square test was not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Finally, a <italic>t</italic>-statistic was estimated for power and control and pregnancy-associated physical abuse, indicating a significant relationship between the two (<italic>t</italic> = −3.270; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and suggesting that women who have been victims of IPV during pregnancy also suffer higher levels of power and control in their relationships compared to abused women who have not experienced pregnancy-associated IPV.</p>

<sec id="section6-1088767912460238">
<title>Pregnancy Outcomes</title>
<p>In addition to examining the various types of abuse endured, the data allowed for examining the outcomes of the pregnancies of women experiencing IPV while pregnant (see Table 3). Of the 150 (1.9%) women physically abused by an IP when pregnant, outcomes were known for 145 of those cases. Live birth was the outcome for 86.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 129) of their pregnancies. Of the 30 pregnancies not resulting in live birth, 3 (15.0%) resulted in abortion, 2 (10.0%) in still birth, and 11 (55.0%) in miscarriage.</p>

<sec id="section7-1088767912460238">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These findings suggest that women who have been physically abused while pregnant also suffer substantially higher levels of other types of abuse, including sexual violence, stalking, threats of violence and death, and power and control compared to their counterparts who have not been physically abused when pregnant. As purported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088767912460238">Daly and Wilson’s (1988)</xref> explanation of sexual proprietariness, the woman’s sexuality and reproduction are key areas of perceived ownership by her intimate partner. Jealousy, possessiveness, and other dimensions of power and coercive control are common in abusive relationships, but these findings suggest pregnancy might present a particularly heightened period of physical risk and that women who have been victims of physical abuse during pregnancy are subject to other dimensions of abuse during pregnancy and generally. Wilson and Daly (1988) contend that perceived infidelity, uncertainty of paternity, and jealousy over both biological and stepchildren are also common in abusive relationships, and these factors may readily explain the correlation between pregnancy and abuse, particularly when considering the loss of control the male intimate partner may feel during and after the pregnancy (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088767912460238">Bacchus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088767912460238">Campbell et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088767912460238">Goodwin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088767912460238">Jasinski, 2004</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section8-1088767912460238">
<title>Consequences of Pregnancy-Associated IPV</title>
<p>In addition to understanding the prevalence and nature of abuse during pregnancy, it is noteworthy to consider the outcomes of these pregnancies. The consequences of pregnancy-associated IPV to women and their unborn and born babies have been identified in a wide range of empirical studies. Researchers have offered explanations of pregnancy-associated violence and the consequences consistent with Wilson and Daly’s (1988) work. For example, Sheffield (2007, p. 111) contends, “The right of men to control the female body . . . is expressed by their efforts to control pregnancy and childbirth and to define female health care in general.” This perceived right to control reproduction intersects with IPV to affect women in a number of ways. First, interfering with a woman’s access and use of contraceptives may lead to risk of unintended pregnancy, which in turn introduces a significant risk of IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088767912460238">Campbell et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912460238">Gazmararian et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088767912460238">Goodwin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912460238">Pallitto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1088767912460238">Williams, Larsen, McCloskey, 2008</xref>). Second, abusive men may impregnate their partners against their will through rape or coerced sex, expose them to sexually transmitted diseases, force abortion, or demand the continuance of an unwanted pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088767912460238">Family Violence Prevention Fund, 2009</xref>). Although the present study does not include controls for pregnancy intendedness or for factors associated with control over reproduction, these are important factors that should be included in analyses when the data permit or included in the collection process in future research.</p>
<p>In addition to this larger structural intersection of IPV and control over women, several studies have produced findings concerning a number of troubling consequences stemming from pregnancy-associated IPV. The present study and others have identified miscarriage and other negative outcomes as risks in pregnancy-associate abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088767912460238">Jasinski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088767912460238">Morland et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912460238">Pallitto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1088767912460238">Stark &amp; Flitcraft, 1996</xref>), but there are many others, ranging from poor prenatal care, to premature labor and/or delivery, to death of the infant and/or mother (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088767912460238">Bacchus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088767912460238">Centers for Disease Control, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1088767912460238">Dietz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088767912460238">Jasinski, 2004</xref>). Some of these effects on women and babies are a direct result of trauma from abuse, such as blunt force abdominal trauma, while some may be products of the physiological and psychological stress and fear that the pregnant women endure because of the abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088767912460238">Pallitto et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The concept of sexual proprietariness promises to be useful in the developing area of pregnancy-associated IPV and intimate partner femicide. As we struggle with a lack of data availability to study pregnancy and violence, difficulty in comparing results across studies, methodological differences, and inconsistencies in reporting maternal mortality across states, my hope is that this research will lead to changes in data collection and analysis. Improvements such as including measures for pregnancy in surveys of women pertaining to health, abuse, and other social issues; state standardization of definitions of pregnancy in lethality cases and in death certificate reporting; standard examination of the reproductive organs in autopsies for femicide victims; and more precise understanding of the scope of pregnancy-associated lethal and nonlethal violence. These improvements will provide significant and potentially lifesaving implications for research and practice. The important issue, however, is to understand <italic>why it happens</italic> in the first place.</p>
<p>Why do sexual proprietariness and its various consequences, such as jealousy, possessiveness, and power and control, provide us with an understanding of the nature of nonlethal and lethal physical, sexual, and psychological IPV? Wilson and Daly’s work offers a scientifically rigorous explanation for why a man might abuse his pregnant partner. Tested and supported in IPV and femicide studies for decades, sexual proprietariness serves as an interdisciplinary, efficacious perspective for the interpretation of IPV and femicide research generally (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088767912460238">Taylor &amp; Jasinski, 2011</xref>), and specifically pregnancy-associated violence.</p>

<p>In the NVAW, women were asked about a number of victimization types and about a number of offenders for each type of violence when applicable. When victimized by multiple offenders, the detailed questions pertaining to the violence used the most recent offender as the referent offender. Therefore, it is not possible to match a current versus former IP across multiple victimization types (i.e., a former boyfriend could have committed physical violence, with a separate former boyfriend having stalked the woman). Although it is not possible to discern if the same offender committed both the pregnancy-related physical abuse and the other type(s) of abuse a woman might had experienced, and also not possible to discern if the other type of abuse occurred during pregnancy, determining the frequency of other types of IPV suffered by a woman, as well as the significance of the relationships between these victimizations and pregnancy-related violence, is noteworthy.</p></fn>
