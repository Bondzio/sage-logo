<abstract>
<p>Three experiments and a pilot study demonstrated that uncertainty about the self is uncomfortable (Pilot Study) and causes people to change their self-concepts in response to primes (Experiments 1–3), depending on both the nature of the uncertainty and how the self is defined. In Experiment 1, Asian Americans assimilated to a stereotype prime when made to feel uncertain about their collective selves, whereas European Americans assimilated to the prime when made to feel uncertain about their individual selves. Experiments 2 and 3 replicated the assimilation effect with a trait prime, and using individualism–collectivism instead of ethnicity as the moderator.</p>

<p>Most people can recall times when they felt uncertain about themselves. For instance, they may have taken a new job that led them to question their abilities or professional aspirations. Alternatively, they may have moved to a city in which they did not know anyone and questioned their place within social networks. No doubt, people can recall that in response to such uncertainty, they actively sought ways to become more certain of “who they were.” In this research, we suggest that self-uncertainty can lead people to assimilate accessible constructs (e.g., primes) into the self-concept. We also suggest that assimilation to primes depends upon the type of self-uncertainty (i.e., individual-level vs. group-level) that is experienced and upon people’s levels of individualism and collectivism.</p>

<title>Self-Uncertainty and Priming: An Active-Self Account</title>
<p>Self-uncertainty is a psychological state that involves having an unclear or undefined sense of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611411310">Baumeister, 1991</xref>). Though self-uncertainty increases discomfort and reduces self-concept clarity, it generally does not affect overall mood or self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611411310">Hogg, Sherman, Dierselhuis, Maitner, &amp; Moffitt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611411310">McGregor, Zanna, Holmes, &amp; Spencer, 2001</xref>). A number of responses to self-uncertainty have been documented, including increased conviction in personal attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611411310">McGregor et al., 2001</xref>), increased identification with social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611411310">Hogg et al., 2007</xref>), and increased perceptions of material possessions as self-expressive (Morrison &amp; Johnson, 2011).</p>
<p>We suggest that because self-uncertainty is associated with reduced self-concept clarity, self-uncertainty may increase reliance on accessible constructs in defining the self-concept. According to the Active-Self account, assimilation to primes can result from misattribution of primed content to the self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611411310">Wheeler, DeMarree, &amp; Petty, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611411310">2007</xref>). This misattribution is more likely to occur when the self-concept lacks consistency, as people who are confused about themselves are less able to distinguish between self-relevant and self-irrelevant stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611411310">Wheeler et al., 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611411310">DeMarree &amp; Loersch, 2009</xref>). For example, individuals who tend to ruminate about their internal states (e.g., those high in private self-consciousness)—which perhaps indicates an undefined sense of self—are especially responsive to primes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611411310">Hull, Slone, Meteyer, &amp; Matthews, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550611411310">Wheeler, Morrison, DeMarree, &amp; Petty, 2008</xref>), as are individuals with inconsistent self-characteristics (e.g., those who consider themselves both competitive and cooperative; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1948550611411310">DeMarree, Morrison, Wheeler, &amp; Petty, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611411310">Smeesters, Warlop, van Avermaet, Corneille, &amp; Yzerbyt, 2003</xref>). Despite these logical implications, however, the relationship between state self-uncertainty and assimilation to primes has never been directly tested.</p>
<p>In the present study, we test whether uncertainty about the self is uncomfortable and motivates people to resolve the discomfort by misinterpreting primes as self-diagnostic. If this is the case, then people who are uncertain about <italic>important</italic> aspects of themselves may be especially susceptible to priming effects, as these people should feel most uncomfortable in response to the uncertainty. Alternatively, one might expect that self-uncertainty strengthens the magnitude of priming effects because self-uncertainty increases negative feelings, causing people to be more distracted and therefore more susceptible to external influences such as primes. However, this alternate explanation is unlikely, given that self-uncertainty manipulations typically do not affect general mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611411310">McGregor et al., 2001</xref>) and given that the effects of subtle primes tend to be strongest among people who are <italic>less</italic> prone to distraction (e.g., those high in need for cognition; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611411310">Petty, DeMarree, Briñol, Horcajo, &amp; Strathman, 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-1948550611411310">
<title>Individualism–Collectivism and Self-Uncertainty</title>
<p>We suggest that whether self-uncertainty triggers assimilation to primes depends jointly on the type of uncertainty experienced and on how individuals define themselves. Specifically, we argue that when self-definitions are based on group memberships and relationships, as is the case for collectivists (e.g., East Asians; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611411310">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611411310">Triandis, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611411310">1995</xref>), uncertainty about group memberships should be most likely to produce discomfort and assimilation. Conversely, when conceptualizations of the self are based on personal characteristics, as is the case for individualists (e.g., Western Europeans; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611411310">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611411310">Triandis, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611411310">1995</xref>), uncertainty about personal characteristics should be most likely to produce discomfort and assimilation.</p>
<p>Initial evidence that one’s self-definition may affect how one reacts to different kinds of uncertainty comes from previous research examining self-definitions and responses to inconsistencies. For example, for people with weak relational selves (e.g., individualists), having inconsistent individual self-aspects is particularly detrimental to well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611411310">Campbell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611411310">Cross, Gore, &amp; Morris, 2003</xref>). Similarly, research on cognitive dissonance has demonstrated that for collectivists, interpersonal inconsistencies lead to compensatory actions, whereas for individualists, intrapersonal inconsistencies lead to compensatory actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611411310">Hoshino-Browne et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, for those with strong relational selves (e.g., collectivists), thinking of close others leads to resolution of self-uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1948550611411310">Gabriel, Renaud, &amp; Tippin, 2007</xref>)</p>
<p>Most relevant to the current research, a recent set of studies showed that individualists try to compensate for uncertainty about their personal characteristics but collectivists do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550611411310">Morrison &amp; Johnson, 2011</xref>). People’s self-definitions can thus influence whether and to what extent they respond to different forms of uncertainty. However, the possibility that uncertainty about group memberships may affect collectivists more strongly than individualists has yet to be tested.</p>
<p>In this article, we examined whether uncertainty about core aspects of self-definitions (group memberships for collectivists, personal characteristics for individualists) would lead to discomfort (Pilot Study) and assimilation to primes (Experiments 1–3). We operationalized individualism–collectivism (INDCOL) in terms of ethnicity (European American vs. Asian American) in the Pilot Study and Experiment 1, and as a dispositional variable in Experiments 2 and 3.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1948550611411310">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Pilot Study</title>
<p>A total of 64 university students and staff (32 self-identified European Americans and 32 self-identified Asian Americans) were randomly assigned to write about individual-level uncertainty, individual-level certainty, group-level uncertainty, or group-level certainty. Two participants were omitted—one who suspected that the uncertainty manipulation was meant to induce discomfort and one statistical outlier on the discomfort measure (Cook’s <italic>D</italic> = .10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611411310">Fox, 1991</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1948550611411310">2</xref></sup>—leaving 62 participants in the final sample.</p>
<p>Participants had 5 min to write an essay on an assigned topic. In the group-level conditions, participants wrote about the three things that made them feel either most uncertain (group-level uncertainty) or most certain (group-level certainty) about whether they belonged to their social groups (e.g., university, sports team). Example topics included not fitting in with others at school or work, and not knowing many people in their dorm or apartment. This is somewhat similar to manipulations of need to belong (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1948550611411310">Gardner, Pickett, &amp; Brewer, 2000</xref>). However, whereas need to belong manipulations ask participants to think about times when they actually were rejected, which could activate feelings of certainty rather than uncertainty, our manipulation specifically focused on aspects of participants' social lives that made them <italic>uncertain</italic>.</p>
<p>The instructions in the individual-level conditions were similar, but taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611411310">Hogg et al. (2007)</xref>. Specifically, participants wrote about the three aspects of themselves, their lives, and their futures that made them either most uncertain (individual-level uncertainty) or most certain (individual-level certainty). Example topics included traits (e.g., intelligence, attractiveness), career plans, and goals.</p>
<p>Next, participants completed a self-reported affect measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611411310">Elliot &amp; Devine, 1994</xref>). Using 7-point scales (1 = <italic>does not apply at all</italic> to 7 = <italic>applies very much</italic>), they indicated the extent to which 24 emotions currently described them. The dependent variable consisted of the three discomfort emotions from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611411310">Elliot and Devine (1994</xref>; <italic>uncomfortable</italic>, <italic>uneasy</italic>, and <italic>bothered</italic>; α = .84), which were interspersed with several unrelated emotions (e.g., <italic>happy</italic>, <italic>guilty</italic>).</p>
<p>To test whether Asian Americans would experience more discomfort under group-level uncertainty than certainty, and whether European Americans would experience more discomfort under individual-level uncertainty than certainty, participants' discomfort scores were submitted to a 2 (ethnicity: Asian American vs. European American) × 2 (uncertainty type: individual vs. group) × 2 (uncertainty level: uncertainty vs. certainty) between-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA). Participants in the uncertainty conditions (<italic>M</italic> = 3.43, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.53) reported more discomfort than did those in the certainty conditions (<italic>M</italic> = 2.47, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.21), <italic>F</italic>(1, 54) = 8.38, <italic>p</italic> = .005. No other lower-order effects emerged; however, the predicted three-way interaction was significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 54) = 16.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611411310">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The two-way type × level of uncertainty interaction was significant for European Americans, <italic>F</italic>(1, 54) = 15.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and marginal for Asian Americans, <italic>F</italic>(1, 54) = 3.60, <italic>p</italic> = .06. Simple effects tests revealed that European Americans reported greater discomfort in the individual-level uncertainty than certainty condition, <italic>F</italic>(1, 54) = 23.79, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, but Asian Americans did not, <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1. By contrast, Asian Americans reported greater discomfort in the group-level uncertainty than certainty condition, <italic>F</italic>(1, 54) = 5.76, <italic>p</italic> = .02, but European Americans did not, <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1.</p>
<p>The above results demonstrate that self-definitions determine when different types of uncertainty lead to discomfort. Having established this, Experiment 1 examines subsequent responses to individual- and group-level uncertainty.</p>

<sec id="section4-1948550611411310">
<title>Experiment 1</title>
<p>Experiment 1 tested the implications of individual-level and group-level uncertainty for assimilation to primed stereotypes. Building on the Pilot Study, participants in Experiment 1 (European Americans and Asian Americans) were made to feel uncertain about either their individual-level or group-level characteristics. They were then primed with either the elderly stereotype or a control stimulus before indicating their level of conservatism, a component of the elderly stereotype (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611411310">Kawakami, Dovidio, &amp; Dijksterhuis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611411310">Ledgerwood &amp; Chaiken, 2007</xref>). We expected European Americans to assimilate to the stereotype (i.e., report being more conservative in the elderly than control prime condition) under individual-level uncertainty, but Asian Americans to assimilate under group-level uncertainty.</p>
<sec id="section5-1948550611411310">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-1948550611411310">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 85 college students (47 self-identified European Americans and 38 self-identified Asian Americans), recruited from a national web-based pool, participated in exchange for a $5 gift certificate. The participants were randomly assigned to either the individual-level (<italic>n</italic> = 44) or group-level (<italic>n</italic> = 41) uncertainty condition, and to either the elderly stereotype (<italic>n</italic> = 49) or control (<italic>n</italic> = 36) prime condition.</p>
<p>A total of four participants were omitted: one who suspected that the purpose of the study was to influence people’s levels of conservatism; two who took more than 4 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean amount of time to complete the study; and one statistical outlier on the conservatism measure (Cook’s <italic>D</italic> = .09). This left 81 participants in the final sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1948550611411310">
<title>Materials and procedure</title>
<p>Participants completed all experimental materials online. First, they completed an 11-item Personal Need for Structure (PNS) Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611411310">Neuberg &amp; Newsom, 1993</xref>) and several other personality measures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1948550611411310">3</xref></sup> The PNS scale assesses one’s desire for order and predictability (e.g., “I enjoy having a clear and structured mode of life”). Participants responded on a 5-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree), and items were coded such that higher scores reflected a higher need for structure (α = .82; <italic>M</italic> = 3.36, <italic>SD</italic> = .57). Because PNS correlates with political conservatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611411310">Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, &amp; Sulloway, 2003</xref>), we included PNS as a covariate in our analyses.</p>
<p>Next, participants completed either the individual-level or group-level uncertainty manipulation from the Pilot Study, followed by a scrambled-sentence priming manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611411310">Bargh, Chen, &amp; Burrows, 1996</xref>). The prime consisted of 30 sets of 5 words, and participants were instructed to arrange four of the words into a coherent sentence. In the elderly prime condition, 24 of the 30 sets contained a word consistent with the elderly stereotype (e.g., wrinkle, forgetful). In the control prime condition, none of the sets contained stereotype-consistent words.</p>
<p>Finally, to measure our dependent variable (conservatism), participants reported their political views (1 = extremely liberal to 7 = extremely conservative). Participants were then probed for suspicion and debriefed.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1948550611411310">
<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>We hypothesized that assimilation to the elderly stereotype would occur among collectivists (Asian Americans) in the group-level uncertainty condition, and among individualists (European Americans) in the individual-level uncertainty condition. To test this hypothesis, we submitted participants' conservatism scores to a 2 (ethnicity: Asian American vs. European American) × 2 (uncertainty type: individual-level vs. group-level uncertainty) × 2 (prime: elderly vs. control) between-subjects analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), controlling for PNS.</p>
<p>Those high in PNS reported greater conservatism, <italic>F</italic>(1, 72) = 9.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005. Additionally, participants primed with the elderly stereotype reported greater conservatism (<italic>M</italic> = 3.97, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.31) than did those primed with a control stimulus (<italic>M</italic> = 3.11, <italic>SD</italic> = .97), <italic>F</italic>(1, 72) = 10.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005, indicating assimilation to the elderly stereotype. No other lower order effects reached significance. Most importantly, however, the predicted interaction between ethnicity, uncertainty type, and prime was significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 72) = 3.90, <italic>p</italic> = .05 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1948550611411310">Figure 2</xref>). This interaction was decomposed by analyzing European Americans and Asian Americans separately. Although the two-way uncertainty × prime interactions were not significant for European Americans, <italic>F</italic>(1, 72) = 1.95, <italic>p</italic> = .16, or for Asian Americans, <italic>F</italic>(1, 72) = 1.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .17, alternate decompositions of the three-way interaction (i.e., analyzing the prime and control conditions separately) also did not yield significant results (<italic>p</italic>s &gt; .07).</p>

</fig>
<p>To test whether Asian Americans in the group-uncertainty condition and European Americans in the individual-uncertainty condition would assimilate to the prime, we compared the prime and control conditions to each other (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611411310">Bargh et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611411310">DeMarree, Wheeler, &amp; Petty, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611411310">Kawakami et al., 2003</xref>). This allowed us to determine whether—all else being equal—participants thought in more prime-consistent ways when primed versus not primed. Simple effects tests for each type of uncertainty (i.e., individual-level and group-level) revealed that Asian Americans in the group-level uncertainty condition reported greater conservatism in the elderly than control prime condition, <italic>F</italic>(1, 72) = 6.45, <italic>p</italic> = .01, whereas Asian Americans in the individual-level uncertainty condition did not differ across prime conditions, <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1. Conversely, European Americans in the individual-level uncertainty condition reported greater conservatism in the elderly than control prime condition, <italic>F</italic>(1, 72) = 10.02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005, whereas European Americans in the group-level uncertainty condition did not differ across prime conditions, <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1. No other simple effects (e.g., between individual-level and group-level uncertainty within the prime and control conditions separately, for either Asian Americans or European Americans) were significant (<italic>p</italic>s &gt; .15).</p>
<p>Experiment 1 showed that participants from relatively collectivistic backgrounds (Asian Americans) assimilated to a primed stereotype (i.e., the elderly) when they felt uncertain about their group memberships. By contrast, those from relatively individualistic backgrounds (European Americans) assimilated when they felt uncertain about their personal characteristics. These results are consistent with the idea that people may interpret primes as self-diagnostic in response to self-relevant uncertainty. One limitation, however, is that the two-way interactions for European Americans and Asian Americans, though in the predicted direction, were not significant. This may have been because we used ethnicity as an indicator of INDCOL, and there are considerable differences within as well as between cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611411310">Triandis, 1995</xref>). To address this limitation, we measured INDCOL directly in Experiments 2 and 3.</p>

<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p>Experiments 2 and 3 extended the findings of Experiment 1 by examining INDCOL as a dispositional variable. Our general prediction was that collectivists would assimilate when uncertain about themselves as group members (Experiment 2), whereas individualists would assimilate when uncertain about themselves as individuals (Experiment 3). Experiments 2 and 3 also extended our results by examining responses to trait primes (i.e., lucky vs. unlucky numbers).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 44 university students and staff were paid $8 to participate in a lab study. The participants were randomly assigned to either the group-level uncertainty (<italic>n</italic> = 21) or group-level certainty (<italic>n</italic> = 23) condition, and to either the unlucky (<italic>n</italic> = 20) or lucky (<italic>n</italic> = 24) prime condition. Three participants were omitted: one statistical outlier on implicit luckiness (Cook’s <italic>D</italic> = .79) and two who suspected that the purpose of the study was to see how many luck-related words they chose. This left 41 individuals in the final sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1948550611411310">
<title>Procedure and materials</title>
<p>Participants first completed a 32-item INDCOL scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550611411310">Triandis &amp; Gelfand, 1998</xref>), interspersed with other personality measures. This scale contains 16 individualism items (e.g., “I often do my own thing”) and 16 collectivism items (e.g., “I feel good when I cooperate with others”), measured on 7-point scales (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 7 <italic>= strongly agree</italic>). Participants' responses to the individualism items were reverse-scored and averaged along with the collectivism items into a composite. Higher scores reflected greater collectivism, and lower scores reflected greater individualism (α = .69; <italic>M</italic> = 4.09, <italic>SD</italic> = .39). This procedure for calculating INDCOL scores has been used in previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611411310">Choi, Koo, &amp; Choi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611411310">Mealy, Stephan, &amp; Abalakina-Paap, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, participants completed either the group-level uncertainty or group-level certainty essay manipulation from the Pilot Study. They then completed a priming manipulation used in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611411310">DeMarree et al., 2005</xref>). The procedure took the form of a lexical decision task, during which participants were subliminally primed with either a lucky (7) or unlucky (13) number (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611411310">DeMarree et al., 2005</xref>, for a full description).</p>
<p>After the priming manipulation, participants completed an implicit measure of felt luckiness, described as a subliminal language-perception task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611411310">DeMarree et al., 2005</xref>). The task consisted of 14 target trials and 14 filler trials. Participants were told that a word, which their subconscious could perceive, would be flashed on the computer screen. In reality, a nonword (e.g., <italic>bufky</italic>) was flashed for 17 ms, followed by a mask (###) for 75 ms and a list of four words. Participants were instructed to choose which word felt most similar to the feeling they experienced while the word was being flashed. On target trials, the list contained one luck-related word (e.g., <italic>lucky</italic>) and three similar-looking, unrelated words (e.g., <italic>lofty</italic>, <italic>ducky</italic>, <italic>softy</italic>). The dependent measure was the number of luck-related words participants chose.</p>
<p>By having participants choose a word that “feels similar to the feeling [they] experience,” we hoped to detect any changes in self-perceived feelings of luckiness. Similar paradigms have been used to assess implicit mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611411310">Hass, Katz, Rizzo, Bailey, &amp; Moore, 1992</xref>). This, combined with the fact that individual differences (e.g., self-monitoring) have moderated effects on this measure in ways incompatible with simple accessibility accounts, supports that the measure reflects self-views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611411310">DeMarree et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>We hypothesized that collectivists in the group-level uncertainty condition would assimilate to the luck prime by feeling luckier after being primed with number 7 than 13. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Implicit luckiness scores were regressed onto uncertainty condition (0 = group-level uncertainty, 1 = group-level certainty), prime condition (0 = unlucky, 1 = lucky), INDCOL (centered continuous variable), and all interaction terms. The main effects were interpreted in the first block, the two-way interactions in the second block, and the three-way interaction in the third block of the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611411310">Cohen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants in the lucky condition chose significantly more luck-related words than did participants in the unlucky condition (β = .33), <italic>t</italic>(37) = 2.09, <italic>p</italic> = .04. No other lower order effects emerged; however, the expected interaction between uncertainty, prime, and INDCOL was significant, (β = −1.06), <italic>t</italic>(33) = −3.60, <italic>p</italic> = .001 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1948550611411310">Table 1</xref>). Note that, because of the small sample size, the test of this three-way interaction should be interpreted with caution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1948550611411310">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1948550611411310">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>As predicted, group-level uncertainty led to assimilation to a trait prime among collectivists but not individualists. Although the sample size in this study was small, the fact that the results conceptually replicated those found with Asian Americans in Experiment 1 (who assimilated to a prime under group-level uncertainty) is reassuring.

<p>As hypothesized, individualists in the individual-level uncertainty condition chose more luck-related words in the lucky than unlucky prime condition, <italic>t</italic>(68) = 2.96, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005. Individualists in the individual-level certainty condition did not differ across prime conditions, <italic>t</italic> &lt; 1. Collectivists, by contrast, chose more luck-related words in the <italic>unlucky</italic> than lucky prime condition under individual-level uncertainty, <italic>t</italic>(68) = −3.02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005, and showed no effect under individual-level certainty, <italic>t</italic> &lt; 1. Because this unexpected effect was not conceptually replicated in any of our other studies or on self-reported luckiness, it should be interpreted with caution.</p>

<sec id="section24-1948550611411310">
<title>Self-reported luckiness</title>
<p>There were no lower order effects; however, the predicted uncertainty × prime × INDCOL interaction was significant (β = .85), <italic>t</italic>(68) = 1.99, <italic>p</italic> = .05. Paralleling the implicit luckiness results, individualists assimilated to the luck prime under individual-level uncertainty, (predicted values = 4.04 for lucky and 2.78 for unlucky), <italic>t</italic>(68) = −2.57, <italic>p</italic> = .01, but not under individual-level certainty (predicted values = 3.33 for lucky and 3.49 for unlucky), <italic>t</italic> &lt; 1. There were no significant effects for collectivists (<italic>t</italic>s &lt; 1; predicted values = 3.17 for lucky/uncertainty, 3.59 for unlucky/uncertainty, 3.35 for lucky/certainty, and 3.60 for unlucky/certainty).</p>
<p>Experiment 3 built upon Experiment 2 by showing that different types of self-uncertainty can produce assimilation to primes, depending on the characteristics of the prime recipients. When participants felt uncertain about their personal characteristics, individualists (but not collectivists) changed their self-concepts in a prime-consistent direction. Experiment 3 also demonstrated that the effects of trait primes on explicit and implicit self-change measures are consistent with one another.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The present research demonstrates that in response to uncertainty about fundamental aspects of the self (group memberships for collectivists, personal characteristics for individualists), people will assimilate accessible constructs into their self-concepts.</p>
<p>These studies, to our knowledge, are the first to directly show that the state of self-uncertainty, particularly if it is relevant to one’s central self-definition, can increase people’s reliance on subtle external cues (e.g., primes) for information about themselves. Although the results of the Pilot Study suggest that assimilation may arise from motives to reduce the discomfort of self-uncertainty, more research is needed to fully test this mechanism. For example, future studies could measure postassimilation discomfort or self-certainty, to see whether assimilation actually makes people more comfortable or less confused about themselves. In addition, showing that the effects of uncertainty on priming are strongest among people who find uncertainty aversive (e.g., people low in uncertainty orientation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611411310">Sorrentino, Short, &amp; Raynor, 1984</xref>) would provide convergent evidence for a discomfort mechanism.</p>
<p>Future research should also examine whether individualists and collectivists ever exhibit different reactions to self-uncertainty when given alternative options. For instance, collectivists might be especially likely to identify with their social groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611411310">Hogg et al., 2007</xref>), whereas individualists might be especially likely to profess commitment to their personal attitudes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611411310">McGregor et al., 2001</xref>). Such findings would have implications for when uncertainty produces group cohesion versus ideological extremism.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>By showing that self-uncertainty feels uncomfortable and causes people to incorporate subtle situational cues into the self-concept, our research demonstrated that not all forms of self-uncertainty affect all people. Thus, when considering potential effects of self-uncertainty, it is important to be clear about which part of the self (e.g., individual vs. collective) is threatened, and whether it is central to one’s self-definition. Contrary to popular beliefs in Western societies, people do not automatically strive to become more certain about their personal characteristics. Whereas individualists do strive to attain certainty at the individual level, collectivists are better served by becoming more certain about their group memberships. But for collectivists and individualists alike, assimilation to primes appears to be an automatic, yet perhaps motivated response to the fundamental question, “Who am I?”</p>

<p>To be parsimonious, we report our results using an INDCOL composite rather than analyzing IND and COL separately. However, we also conducted hierarchical regression analyses as follows: uncertainty, prime, IND, and COL in the first block; all main effects plus uncertainty × prime, uncertainty × IND, prime × IND, uncertainty × COL, and prime × COL in the second block; and all main effects and two-way interaction terms plus uncertainty × prime × IND and uncertainty × prime × COL in the third block. The results were generally consistent with our INDCOL analyses. In Experiment 2, the uncertainty × prime × COL interaction was significant (β = −1.28), <italic>t</italic>(29) = −2.96, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, with high collectivists (+1 <italic>SD</italic> on COL) assimilating to the prime; and the uncertainty × prime × IND interaction was marginal (β = 1.28), <italic>t</italic>(29) = 1.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .07, with low individualists (−1 <italic>SD</italic> on IND) assimilating. On the implicit luckiness measure in Experiment 3, there was an uncertainty × prime × IND interaction (β = .78), <italic>t</italic>(64) = −1.95, <italic>p</italic> = .056, and an uncertainty × prime × COL interaction (β = 1.26), <italic>t</italic>(64) = 3.47, <italic>p</italic> = .001, with high individualists and low collectivists assimilating. There were no significant effects on self-reported luckiness in Experiment 3.</p></fn>
