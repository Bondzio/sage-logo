<abstract>
<p>Responses to the increased prevalence of childhood obesity are merging, and employed parents will become targets for strategies designed to prevent childhood obesity. This study aimed at describing their perceptions of employed parents about childhood obesity and determining which prevention strategies they would need the most. In this cross-sectional study, 504 employed parents were recruited from 33 child care centers in Sherbrooke (Quebec, Canada) who completed a self-administered questionnaire on their perceptions about childhood obesity and the need for prevention strategies. Logistic regression was used to explore differences in needs for prevention strategies according to participant characteristics. Most participants were female, aged 32.9 ± 4.9 years, and perceived childhood obesity was an important problem. The prevention strategies that seemed most needed were the implementation of (a) physical and nutrition education programs in child care settings and (b) measures that give employed parents more time to cook for and be physically active with their children. Support for specific strategies differed across genders and education levels. Moreover, they depended on the perceived relationship between work and meal preparation. Policy makers should be aware of the needs of employed parents to develop policies that would have the greatest likelihood of success in this population.</p>

<p>In Canada, the prevalence of overweight among children aged between 2 and 17 years increased from 13% in 1978-1979 to 26% in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839911405843">Shields, 2005</xref>). In the United States, recent data showed that 31.7% of children aged 2 through 19 years were at or above the 85th percentile of body mass index (BMI) for their ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839911405843">Ogden, Carroll, Curtin, Lamb, &amp; Flegal, 2010</xref>). Overweight and obese children carry the burden of early discrimination, may suffer from health consequences such as hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and are at risk of becoming obese adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839911405843">Dietz, 1998</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1524839911405843">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Eating habits and physical activity play a role in childhood obesity prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524839911405843">World Health Organization, 2000</xref>). As young children are influenced primarily by their families, child well-being depends on the ability of parents to create home environments promoting good eating habits and physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839911405843">Committee on Prevention of Obesity in Children and Youth, Food and Nutrition Board, &amp; Board on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, 2005</xref>). Barriers reported by parents refer to lack of time for transportation, for preparing healthy food, for implementing physical activity, or for monitoring behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839911405843">Sonneville, La Pelle, Taveras, Gillman, &amp; Prosser, 2009</xref>). In addition, parents mention their need to be informed on how to set limits, cope with child resistance, plan menus, and cook healthier meals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839911405843">Sonneville et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The recent growth in maternal employment has created new challenges to family routines, thus, along with other factors, contributing to the rising prevalence of childhood obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839911405843">Sonneville et al., 2009</xref>). It has become harder for employed parents to engage in physical activity with their children or to prepare home cooked meals because of lack of time and energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839911405843">Devine et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Agencies such as the Institute of Medicine and the American Academy of Pediatrics have provided schools with guidelines to address obesity prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839911405843">American Academy of Pediatrics, American Public Health Association, &amp; National Resource Center for Health and Safety in Childcare and Early Education, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839911405843">Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, 2009</xref>). Now, public policy scholars have to weigh the political feasibility of their policies against the impact on childhood obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911405843">Brescoll, Kersh, &amp; Brownell, 2008</xref>). For example, knowledge dissemination policies, such as teaching meal preparation and cooking skills to children and providing nutritional information to parents about school lunches, would receive favorable hearing from national policy makers but would have little public health impact. For that matter, research needs to produce evidence-based approaches regarding family factors that shape activity patterns, such as the impact of employment on family members’ eating style, food intake, and activity patterns, to guide political and prevention efforts.</p>
<p>An ecological approach, which conceptualizes connections between children, parents, and their environment, is useful in guiding public health professionals and policy makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524839911405843">Story, Kaphingst, Robinson-O’Brien, &amp; Glanz, 2008</xref>). On the other hand, this approach leads to prevention opportunities that could support employed parents in describing perceptions and creating appropriate home environments for preventing childhood obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839911405843">Committee on Prevention of Obesity in Children and Youth et al., 2005</xref>). More specifically, individual-level factors (knowledge, behaviors, biological, demographics) interact with social (family, friends, peers), physical (places where people eat and procure foods), and macro-level environments (food marketing, social norms, distribution systems, price structure).</p>
<p>Issues such as perceptions and the need for support, however, have not yet been addressed with employed parents coping with challenging lifestyles. We hypothesized that their perceptions might be similar to those expressed by the general public. Nevertheless, their needs might be different because of their challenging lifestyles and lack of time. To inform public health professionals and policy makers of effective strategies for preventing childhood obesity designed for employed parents, this study describes (a) parental perceptions toward childhood obesity, (b) parental support for specific childhood obesity prevention strategies, and (c) associations between parent characteristics and support for specific public prevention strategies.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>In this cross-sectional pilot study, a convenience sample of employed parents in the Eastern Township area (Quebec) completed a questionnaire. In Quebec, an estimated 70% of 4-year-olds regularly attend child care centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839911405843">Desrosiers, 2005</xref>). Participants were recruited through public child care centers from various socioeconomic backgrounds. Center managers were informed of the study at a regional meeting that 45 out of 64 attended. Thirty-three managers (73% of meeting attendees) agreed to distribute the questionnaires to and receive them back from participating parents.</p>
<p>Participants had to be French speaking, at least 18 years old, working at least 20 hours a week, parent of a child aged between 2 and 5 years without medical conditions affecting appetite or dietary habits (severe allergies, digestive disorders, etc.), and mainly responsible for feeding the child. The study was blinded for review and all participants gave written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the principal investigator’s organization.</p>
<p>The self-administered questionnaire had 36 questions divided into four sections. The questions were developed based on an extensive literature review on parental perceptions, attitudes, and needs related to child weight. The first section included five questions adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839911405843">Eckstein et al. (2006)</xref> aimed at exploring parental perceptions about the seriousness and consequences of childhood overweight or obesity. Five Likert-type scale response choices were provided for these questions (<italic>strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree</italic>, and <italic>strongly agree</italic>). The second section captured parental support for specific childhood obesity prevention strategies. The choice of strategies was based on a review of childhood obesity prevention strategies that have been proposed or implemented in Quebec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839911405843">Equipe de travail pour mobiliser les efforts en prévention, 2005</xref>). The strategies were divided into individual strategies and physical/macro-level strategies (see table later in text). For the individual strategies, parents had to choose three programs they needed the most. For the physical and macro-level strategies, parents had to choose the three most important actions to initiate. Section 4 included one question inspired from the spillover model for work and food choice proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839911405843">Devine, Connors, Sobal, and Bisogni (2003)</xref> that served as our inclusion criteria. Parents had to describe if their work was demanding and limiting, demanding but manageable, or unproblematic for preparing healthy meals at home. The last section gathered information on sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, education, main occupational status, annual family income). The questionnaire was validated by three content experts and pretested on a convenience sample of 10 employed parents prior to administration. They generally completed it within 20 minutes.</p>
<p>An introductory letter and the questionnaire were distributed by child care center managers to all parents of children aged between 2 and 5 years enrolled in their centers. Parents had to complete and return the questionnaire to the center within a week in a sealed envelope to ensure confidentiality. The letter asked parents to complete the questionnaire <italic>only</italic> if they met the inclusion criteria. A reminder letter was distributed a week later to increase the response rate.</p>
<p>Questionnaire distribution was monitored in 8 of the 33 child care centers. In these centers, 75% of all parents met the inclusion criteria. The main reason for exclusion was not working at least 20 hours a week. In the 33 centers, a total of 1,232 questionnaires were distributed. Of all parents who received a questionnaire, an estimated 924 (75%) were eligible to participate in the study. Of this number, 504 eligible parents returned their questionnaires and were included in the analysis. Eligibility of parents was ensured by checking answers for the fourth section of the questionnaire. The study response rate was then estimated to be 55.4%.</p>
<p>As for descriptive statistics, frequencies and percentages were calculated (presented in tables later in the text). A series of logistic regressions were performed to explore prevention strategy selection that varied according to specific sociodemographic characteristics or the perceived relationship between work and preparing healthy meals. Univariate models are reported since the sample size did not support multivariate modeling. The dependent variable for each regression model was coded as 0 for <italic>not chosen</italic> and 1 for <italic>chosen</italic>. When applicable, independent variables were dichotomized and included gender (1 = <italic>female</italic> and 0 = <italic>male</italic>), family income (1 = <italic>low</italic> and 0 = <italic>medium/high</italic>), education (1 = <italic>less than college</italic> and 0 = <italic>college graduate</italic>), and relationship between work and preparing healthy meals at home (1 = <italic>limiting/manageable</italic> and 0 = <italic>unproblematic</italic>). The following hypotheses were tested: Women are more likely to select each strategy than men; participants from medium-/high-income families are more likely to select each strategy than participants from low-income families; college graduate participants are more likely to select each strategy than participants with less than college education; participants whose work was limiting/manageable for preparing healthy meals at home are more likely to select each strategy than participants whose work was unproblematic for preparing healthy meals at home. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), showing the relationship between the selection of each prevention strategy and each independent variable, were calculated. Statistical significance was set at a probability value of <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05. Analyses were performed using SPSS (Version 13.0).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This cross-sectional study provides a “snapshot” of employed parents’ perceptions about childhood obesity and supported prevention strategies. It also explores the characteristics of employed parents associated with selecting specific childhood obesity prevention strategies.</p>
<p>Participating parents were aware of the increasing prevalence and consequences of childhood obesity. This agrees with the reported growing public concern about this condition, which may result from strategies such as intense media coverage and government warnings about rising obesity rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839911405843">Evans, Finkelstein, Kamerow, &amp; Renaud, 2005</xref>). To increase their success, government initiatives should promote a “healthy weight” as part of a generally healthy lifestyle and include parental involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839911405843">Goodell, Pierce, Bravo, &amp; Ferris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524839911405843">Woodman, Lorenc, Herden, &amp; Oakley, 2008</xref>). However, our results show that women were less interested by <italic>advertising campaigns and legislation governing food advertisements targeting children</italic>. To have a greatest likelihood of success, the target audience for such campaigns should be men rather than mixed genders.</p>
<p>Regarding the individual strategies pertaining to the ecological approach, employed parents who participated in our study supported the implementation of <italic>physical education and nutrition programs in child care settings</italic> as specific strategies to prevent obesity. To our knowledge, previous studies have not interviewed employed parents on that matter. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with a representative survey of U.S. households on public perceptions of childhood obesity in which participants were in favor of requiring schools (a) to teach healthy eating and exercise habits and (b) to incorporate more physical education classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839911405843">Evans et al., 2005</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524839911405843">Tucker, Irwin, Sangster Bouck, He, and Pollett (2006)</xref>, health promotion programs should be affordable, held in easily accessible settings, offer free meals and transportation, and plan activities for the whole family or provide babysitters.</p>
<p>Childhood obesity prevention programs implemented in child care settings, such as in Yuma County (Arizona), resulted in a significant increase in the number of nutrition and physical activity best practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839911405843">Drummond et al., 2009</xref>). Even if the results seem encouraging, further investigation is needed to determine which interventions could be effective in preventing long-term childhood obesity. Our study results indicate that implementing such programs in centers where parents have more education (college graduates) would have the greatest likelihood of success.</p>
<p>In our study, a higher proportion of employed parents identified <italic>menu planning, nutrition label reading, and cooking classes</italic> as the program they would personally need the most, compared with information sessions about nutrition or physical activity. This is consistent with the results of a qualitative study on 41 low-income mothers, who requested practical information and interactive activities to learn how to purchase and prepare healthy food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839911405843">Birkett, Johnson, Thompson, &amp; Oberg, 2004</xref>). Another qualitative study on 20 rural low-income caregivers of toddlers reported that caregivers wanted to attend classes in which they could learn how to prepare simple meals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839911405843">Omar, Coleman, &amp; Hoerr, 2001</xref>). Providing parents with the opportunity to participate in interactive classes combining cognition as well as abilities are more likely to be effective than nutrition education based on knowledge alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839911405843">Contento, 2008</xref>). In fact, hands-on cooking activities are a successful way to overcome barriers and improve skills needed to prepare healthful meals at home. According to our study, women were more likely to support this strategy than men and may be a privileged audience for public health professionals.</p>
<p>As for physical and macro-environment strategies, the majority (63%) of employed parents identified <italic>measures allowing parents to have more time to cook and engage in physical activity with their children</italic> as most important to initiate from. In addition, parents whose jobs were problematic in preparing healthy meals were more likely to select this action. As this was strongly supported by our employed parents, policy makers should consider establishing policies that help employed parents cope with the work–family conflict. Scientific literature pertaining to policies directed toward this population is scarce. Some authors suggest that promotion strategies be family based and directed toward the wider family rather than parents alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839911405843">Pocock, Trivedi, Wills, Bunn, &amp; Magnusson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The second action identified by our respondents as the most important to initiate was setting up <italic>facilities where they could engage in physical activity with their children</italic>. This finding relates to the lack of time reported by parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839911405843">Sonneville et al., 2009</xref>). In a previous qualitative study, a heterogeneous sample of 71 parents suggested providing more facilities as a way to facilitate physical activity for their preschoolers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524839911405843">Tucker et al., 2006</xref>). Family-friendly facilities should be made available and accessible in communities. In our study, we found that women were more likely than men to select this action. In addition to offering family-friendly activities, facilities should offer activities that correspond to women’s interests.</p>
<p>Half of the parents in our study were in favor of providing healthy menus in every child care center. This is consistent with another study reporting that the public supported improvement in the nutritional quality of school meals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839911405843">Evans et al., 2005</xref>). Child care providers are responsible for providing nutritious and healthful food to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839911405843">American Dietetic Association, 2005</xref>). In the United States, menu standards for child care facilities have been provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839911405843">American Dietetic Association, 2005</xref>). Research, however, has revealed significant discrepancies between child care menu policies and state regulations in most states and that menus rarely matched the foods actually served to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839911405843">Benjamin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839911405843">Fleischhacker, Cason, &amp; Achterberg, 2006</xref>). In Canada, knowledge about the quality of food served in child care settings is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839911405843">Romaine, Mann, Kienapple, &amp; Conrad, 2007</xref>). Policy makers should ensure that child care providers receive appropriate and ongoing training in nutrition and food service and that nutrition standards in child care centers are adhered to. Also, health professionals should provide anticipatory guidance on parenting to foster patterns of preference and food selection in children that are more consistent with healthy diets and promote children’s ability to self-regulate intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839911405843">Birch &amp; Davison, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>This pilot study has some limitations that need to be addressed. First, only 54.5% of eligible parents returned their questionnaire. Response rates less than 60% were also reported by authors who surveyed this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839911405843">Aryee, Srinivas, &amp; Tan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839911405843">Musher-Eizenman, de Lauzon-Guillain, Holub, Leporc, &amp; Charles, 2009</xref>). National health surveys, using mailed questionnaires, reported even lower response rates (about 50%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839911405843">Picavet, 2001</xref>). Nonparticipants might have been different from participants and might have chosen different prevention strategies.</p>
<p>Second, our study sample was mostly composed of women of middle- to high-level education. Younger people, males, people with lower socioeconomic and educational background, and individuals with low health status are often underrepresented in large health surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839911405843">Dengler, Roberts, &amp; Rushton, 1997</xref>). Findings in our study cannot be generalized to the whole population of working parents. Larger studies with representative samples are needed to further explore the perceptions of employed parents. Researchers should address the problem of nonresponse in this population and try to find various solutions to decrease it.</p>
<p>Finally, this study presents unadjusted ORs showing the relationship between each independent variable and support for prevention strategies. This methodology was also used in large surveys aimed at exploring public awareness and attitudes about obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839911405843">Evans et al., 2005</xref>). Some parental features potentially associated with their responses (e.g., parent’s BMI) were not taken into account. In addition, the repeated logistic regression increases the chance of type 1 errors (false positives).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Given the fact that childhood obesity depends on multiple factors, multiapproach prevention strategies must be used. A range of programs, at multiple levels, need to be developed, especially for preschool children and their parents, and the most effective and promising ones must be identified. This study can be of value to public health administrators in assessing which childhood obesity prevention strategies would have the greatest likelihood of success among employed parents at the individual, physical, and macro-environmental levels. Government, municipalities, employers, and health professionals should be aware of the needs of employed parents in developing policies that would have the greatest likelihood of success in this population, both at the individual and environmental levels. The results of this pilot study add to the dearth of literature on the working-parent population in relation to childhood obesity prevention. Results may inspire other researchers to validate the questionnaire and design more powerful studies on this topic.</p>
