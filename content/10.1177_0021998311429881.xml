<abstract>
<p>Novel green pulp fiber–based sound-absorbing materials (PSAMs) were produced, and their sound-absorbing performances were investigated in relation to the characteristics of the pulp fibrous models. Decreases in important fiber characteristics (e.g., fiber length, width) after the beating process caused a significant increase in the sound-absorbing properties of the PSAMs. The average sound-absorption coefficients of the PSAMs were found to possess a cubic-degree parabolic relationship with thickness. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that after the beating treatment, many new microfibrils detached from the cell walls and were reconstructed into new nanopores, which led to a decrease of the pore radius and an increase of the pore volume. These new nanopores served as new channels for sound wave movement and contributed to the increased consumption of sound energy. The results suggest that pulp fibers can partially or fully substitute for the inorganic fibers of acoustic materials used in many applications.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311429881" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>As the world nears the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the rapid growth of the world economy has caused considerable environmental damage in many areas of the globe. Noise is also one among the growing list of environmental problems and is fueling increasing concern worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311429881">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311429881">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>To address these problems, society has developed expandable polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, and other plastic foams, in addition to materials based on glass- or mineral-fibers, as acoustic materials. However, some fundamental questions remain unanswered. For example, plastic foams from petroleum resources pose health and ecological concerns; and materials based on glass- or mineral-fibers raise persistent concerns about fiber shedding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311429881">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Considering these circumstances, there is a need for alternative materials with good sound-absorbing properties. Actually, new sound-absorbing materials have already been reported in several previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311429881">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311429881">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311429881">8</xref></sup> Recently, more attention has been paid toward using ecofriendly biodegradable resources for production of bio-based composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311429881">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311429881">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311429881">11</xref></sup> In this context, the use of natural fibers in acoustic materials has particular merit when judged based on recyclability, renewability of raw materials, and low levels of resource requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311429881">12</xref></sup> For example, the industrial waste from natural tea leaves was used to develop a sound-absorbing material having perfect sound-absorbing properties compared to woven textile cloth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311429881">13</xref></sup> Yang and his group used rice straw and wood particles to manufacture bio-based wooden sound-absorbing materials with specific gravity ranging from 400 to 800 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, which had perfect sound-absorbing properties compared to other wood-based materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311429881">14</xref></sup> The ultra-low-density fiberboard made from softwood fibers using the steam-injection pressing method showed considerable sound-absorbing properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311429881">15</xref></sup> The sound-absorbing materials made of <italic>Pinus radiata</italic> fiber or shavings showed appreciable sound-absorbing curves, similar to those of porous fibrous materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311429881">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the fabrication of fibrous sound-absorbing materials, the characteristics of the fibers used play an important role in achieving the desired sound-absorbing properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311429881">16</xref></sup> The common, natural wood fibers, obtained as a residue from the wood industry, have thicker fiber diameters and shorter fiber lengths, which result in unexpected sound-absorbing properties, comparable to those of glass or mineral fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311429881">3</xref></sup> Natural pulp fibers from the papermaking industry, however, have the technological advantages of possessing a thinner diameter and being amenable to the easy control of their geometrical sizes through a beating or refining process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311429881">17</xref></sup> Although pulp fibers have been previously suggested to be promising and applicable for the manufacture of new sound-absorbing materials, until now, no reports have been published in this field.</p>
<p>In the present study, new bio-based pulp fiber-based sound-absorbing materials (PSAMs) were manufactured by the routine papermaking method using bleached softwood Kraft fibers. Different geometrical sizes of the pulp fibers were achieved through the beating process. The changes in the sound-absorbing properties in relation to the fiber characteristics were investigated, and a possible mechanism is proposed.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021998311429881"><title>Experimental</title>
<sec id="sec3-0021998311429881"><title>Materials</title>
<p>The raw material used in this study was commercial bleached softwood Kraft pulp, purchased from the Guangdong Eagle Force Paper Co., Ltd. (Guangdong, China). The initial moisture content of the pulp fibers was about 14 ± 2%. Glass-fiber mats, with fibers of 5–6 μm diameter and 10–200 mm length, were purchased from Langfang Hewei Chemicals Co., Ltd. (Langfang, Shandong). Alumina silicate-fiber mats, with fibers of 2–5 μm diameter and 10–50 mm length, were purchased from Antele ecologic ceramics Co., Ltd. (Jinan, Shandong).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021998311429881"><title>Beating process</title>
<p>The bleached Kraft pulp boards were passed through a high-shear fiber kneader after being soaked in water for 24 h. The resulting pulp suspensions were processed on a Model Mark-V1 PFI mill, for different processing times and at rotating speeds of 5000–14000 rpm to obtain various pulp-drainage levels. The beating degree of pulp suspensions was determined, and the pulp fibers’ characteristics were analyzed as a function of different beating degrees using a KajaaniFS300 Fiber Analyzer (Metso Automation Inc., Finland).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021998311429881"><title>Fabrication of PSAMs</title>
<p>A certain amount of the raw and the beaten pulp fibers (with different beating degrees) were pressed to a 1.5% pulp consistency after being efficiently worked by a high-shear fiber kneader. The raw pulp fiber-based PSAMs samples with different thickness were prepared using the basis weight of 200, 500, 1000, 2000 g/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The beaten pulp fiber-based PSAMs samples with different beating degrees of such 12.5, 20.5, 31.5, 43.0, 59.1, and 67.0°SR, were prepared using the same basis weight of 500 g/m<sup>2</sup>. The abovementioned PSAMs samples were performed on the Model-1600 Econo-space Automated Sheet Formation System (Réalisations Australes Inc., Canada) after removal of water using vacuum or hydraulic pressure molding. After the formation of the sheet, the samples were not squeezed so that pore structures closer to reality could be obtained. The PSAMs samples were dried at 105 ± 2°C using the forced air-drying method to decrease the samples’ moisture content to about 9 ± 1% before analysis. The effects of basis weight, thickness, and beating degrees on the sound-absorbing properties of the PSAMs samples were investigated. For the preparation of the PSAMs in combination with inorganic fibers, a mixture of pulp fibers and glass or alumina silicate fibers (in a respective 1:1 mass ratio) was analyzed.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0021998311429881"><title>Sound-absorption analysis</title>
<p>Sound-absorption coefficients of the PSAMs samples were obtained experimentally at 25°C under 60% relative humidity using a Brüel Kjær pulse analyzer 3560C-E05 (tube type 4206) equipped with two tubes: a tube of 30-mm diameter, which was used for high sound frequencies (from 800 to 7000 Hz); and a tube of 100-mm diameter, which was used for low frequencies (from 90 to 1800 Hz). These tests were carried out using the methods specified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO, 10534-2: 1998; E).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311429881">18</xref></sup> Air-dried PSAMs samples of 200–2000 g/m<sup>2</sup> basis weight were used in these measurements. Average frequencies of 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz were used for determination of the average sound-absorption coefficients of the PSAMs samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311429881">19</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0021998311429881"><title>Scanning electron microscopy analysis</title>
<p>Samples of air-dried pulp fibers were fixed to a metal specimen holder using double-sided sticky tape. Thin-film samples of the PSAMs were sliced using a shape-edged razor. These samples were also fixed to a metal specimen holder with double-sided sticky tape. The samples of the raw and beaten pulp fiber-based PSAMs samples were coated with gold using a vacuum sputter-coater. The fracture surfaces were observed using an S-3700N scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Ltd., Japan).</p></sec>

<p>Surface areas, pore sizes, and pore-size distribution of the raw and beaten pulp fiber-based PSAMs samples were measured using nitrogen adsorption–desorption at 77.3 K using a NOVA 4200 e Quantachrome for measurement (Quantachrome Instruments Co.

<sec id="sec10-0021998311429881"><title>Relationship between material thickness and sound-absorbing properties</title>
<p>The different thicknesses of the raw pulp fiber-based PSAMs samples were achieved using different basis weights. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311429881">Figure 1(a)</xref> indicates that basis weights of 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 g/m<sup>2</sup> resulted in the corresponding thicknesses of 1.35, 3.36, 6.97, and 11.08 mm. The results implied that thickness of the above PSAMs samples had a significant effect on the average sound-absorption coefficient, as already shown in porous fibrous materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311429881">Figure 1(b)</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311429881">5</xref></sup> As the sound wave moves along the pores in the materials, the air in the voids is either compressed against or filtered through the external wall of the pulp fibers, resulting in the conversion of energy between the sound and heat forms. By increasing the thicknesses of the PSAMs samples, the distances through which sound waves move in the voids of the pulp fibers increase, corresponding to an increased consumption of sound energy. The average sound-absorption coefficients of the PSAMs were found to possess a cubic-degree parabolic relationship with thickness, in the range of 1–12 mm, with an <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> value of 1.0000. The relationship can be described by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0021998311429881">Equation (1)</xref> as follows:

<p>The sound-absorption phenomena occurring inside a fibrous or porous material are mainly due to energy-dissipative processes that involve viscosity changes and thermal conduction in the fluid within the materials when they are exposed to sound.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311429881">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The effect of material thickness was investigated by comparing the results for samples that differed primarily in their thicknesses with similar density. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311429881">Figure 1(b)</xref>. The PSAMs had reasonable sound-absorbing properties over a wide range of interest (250–6300 Hz). The sound-absorption coefficients of the raw pulp fiber-based PSAMs samples with 1.35-mm and 3.36-mm thickness increased gradually as the sound frequency increased from 250 to 6300 Hz. When the thickness of the PSAMs was increased to 6.97 and 10.08 mm, the sound-absorption coefficients increased significantly at low sound frequencies ranging from 250 to 1000 Hz; however, the coefficients decreased slightly with a further increase in the sound frequency from 1000 to 6300 Hz. The result suggested that increasing the PSAMs samples’ thickness significantly increased the sound-absorption coefficients at low sound frequencies. These results agree well with those previously reported in porous fibrous composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311429881">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311429881">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311429881">22</xref></sup></p></sec>

<p>The pulp fiber characteristics (such as fiber length, width, curl, and kink index) were controlled through the PFI-refining process.

<p>The pulp fibers had weight-average length of 1–3 mm and weight-average width of 26–28 μm. The beating degree indicates the difficulty level of pulp dehydration on wet end, and further indirectly reflects the level of the cut off, fibrillation of pulp fibers. The beating degree is generally measured by Schopper-Rieger method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311429881">26</xref></sup> Compared to the raw pulp fibers, the weight-average fiber length, width, curl, and kink index of the pulp fibers decreased with an increase in the beating degree ranging from 20.5 to 67.0°SR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311429881">Table 1</xref>). The results agreed well with the study reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311429881">17</xref></sup> Pulp fibers were squeezed and kneaded repeatedly by knife-edges during the PFI-beating process, which results in the crack or tear of pulp fibers. This conclusion was confirmed by the variations in the fiber-length distribution through the beating treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311429881">Figure 2</xref>, the whole weighted-average fiber-length curve shifted to a lower location after PFI refining to 67.0°SR beating degree, compared to the raw pulp fibers with 12.5°SR beating degree. The corresponding location of the maximum fiber-length distribution decreased from about 1.5 to 0.2 mm.

<p>In this case, the external fibrillation of pulp fibers after the beating process causes the detachment of the microfibrils from the cell wall of the pulp fibers and the restructuring of the microfibrils on the surfaces of the fibers.

<p>The beaten fiber-based PSAMs samples with 67.0°SR beating degree had air permeability of 112.9 cm<sup>3</sup>/min, which was much higher than the value 34.1 cm<sup>3</sup>/min of the raw fiber-based PSAMs. The results indicated that the pulp fibers with beating degree of 67.0°SR resulted in decrease of weight-average fiber length, width, curl, and kink index, but increase of fines. This variation of pulp dimension brought narrower pore sizes between constituting elements, which resulted in the increase of air flow resistance, or decrease of air permeability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311429881">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998311429881">28</xref></sup></p></sec>

The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore-size distributions showed that most of the pore radius of the PSAMs was lower than 165 nm, showing a mesoporous structure (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311429881">Figure 3(b)</xref>). The mesopores of the beaten pulp (67.0°SR) fiber-based PSAMs were much smaller than those of the raw pulp (12.5°SR) fiber-based PSAMs, with average pore radius of 82.858 and 112.216 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311429881">Table 2</xref>). The decrease in the pore radius contributed to the increase in the BJH-desorption cumulative pore volume and total pore volume (as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311429881">Table 2</xref>). This trend was also observed in the pore-size distribution curves (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311429881">Figure 3(b)</xref>). These variations of pore structures reflected the generation of increasing numbers of new smaller nanopores within the fibers due to the restructuring by the microfibrils detached from the cell walls.

<p>The same trend was observed with reference to the cumulative surface area of the pores for the PSAMs. The raw pulp (12.5°SR) fiber-based PSAMs showed lower values for the BJH-desorption cumulative surface area (14.379 m<sup>2</sup>/g) and the multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area (10.275 m<sup>2</sup>/g), compared with those of the beaten pulp (67.0°SR) fiber-based PSAMs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311429881">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311429881">Figure 4</xref> shows that the PSAMs had sound-absorption coefficient curves similar to those of porous fibrous materials over a wide range of frequencies ranging from 250 to 6300 Hz.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311429881">5</xref></sup> The beaten pulp fiber-based PSAMs with beating degree of 67.0°SR had higher sound-absorption coefficients than those of 43.0°SR and 59.1°SR, but nearly the similar sound-absorption coefficients with that of 12.5°SR, at lower ranges of sound frequencies ranging from 250 to 1500 Hz. The raw pulp fiber PSAMs with beating degree of 12.5°SR, however, had higher significantly sound-absorption coefficients than those with beating degrees of 43.0, 59.1, and 67.0°SR at higher ranges of sound frequencies ranging from 2000 to 6300 Hz. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311429881">Figure 1(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0021998311429881">Equation (1)</xref> raw pulp fiber-based PSAMs has a mathematic relation to average sound-absorption coefficients. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311429881">Figure 5</xref> indicates that the thickness of beaten pulp fiber-based PSAMs samples decrease significantly with the increase of beating degrees due to the same basis weight of 500 g/m<sup>2</sup>. This is because the decreasing fiber length and width results in a greater compaction ratio due to the smaller pore size between the pulp fibers.
<fig id="fig4-0021998311429881" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Dependence of the sound-absorption coefficient curves on the beating degrees.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311429881-fig4.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig5-0021998311429881" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Effects of beating degrees on the average sound-absorption coefficients and the thicknesses of the PSAMs. Note that pore structures consist of pore<sup>a</sup> (pores between fibers), pore<sup>b</sup> (pores within fibers), and pore<sup>c</sup> (pores between microfibrils).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311429881-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>By considering the thickness resulted from the beaten pulp fiber-based PSAMs samples with different beating degrees, the average sound-absorption coefficients of the raw pulp fiber-based PSAMs samples are calculated according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0021998311429881">Equation (1)</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311429881">Figure 5</xref>). In this regard, the calculated average sound-absorption coefficients of the raw pulp fiber-based PSAMs samples with the abovementioned thickness, were compared to the experimental results of average sound-absorption coefficients of the beaten pulp fiber-based PSAM samples with beating degree of 20.5, 31.5, 43.0, 59.1, and 67.0°SR.</p>
<p>It was surprising that the beaten pulp fiber-based PSAMs samples had better sound-absorbing properties than the raw pulp fiber-based PSAMs at the same thickness. The differences in the average sound-absorption coefficients between the beaten- and raw pulp fiber-based PSAMs were enlarged with an increase in the beating degrees from 20.5 to 67.0°SR. The results suggested that beating treatment is a perfect method to improve the sound-absorbing properties of the PSAMs.</p>
<p>A possible mechanism for the sound-absorption process in relation to the fiber characteristics obtained after the beating treatment is as follows:</p>
<p>The geometric size of the pulp fibers (such as the fiber length, width, curl, and kink index), in addition to the pore size, showed a decreasing trend during the process of beating (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311429881">Table 1</xref>). It indicates that the pores in the beaten pulp fiber-based PSAMs mainly consist of (a) pores both between and within the fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311429881">27</xref></sup> and (b) new nanopores between the microfibrils (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311429881">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>In this process, three stages are assumed to illustrate the mechanism of changes in the sound-absorption process. In stage (1), the sound wave moves mainly in the pores between and within the fibers of the raw pulp fiber-based PSAMs. When the pulp fibers were treated by a primary beating process, as in stage (2), some microfibrils were observed on the surfaces of the pulp fibers. In this stage, the sound-absorbing properties of the PSAMs increased slightly, compared to the values predicted from those of the raw pulp fiber-based PSAMs. In Stage (3), however, when the pulp fibers were beaten to a much higher beating degree (67.0°SR), a few microfibrils were produced, which reconstructed many more nanopores between the microfibrils. This resulted in a smaller pore radius and larger pore volume, in addition to larger surface areas, of the pores. These nanopores served as new channels for the movement of the sound waves. This brings about much higher airflow resistivity of the PSAMs samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311429881">3</xref></sup> In this case, a greater quantity of sound energy is consumed because of the interactions between the many microfibrils and the sound waves per unit volume. According to this theory, new high-sound-absorbing materials consisting of ultra-thin natural fibers can serve as the sources of potential technology in the future.</p></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311429881">Figure 6</xref> shows the effects of the composition of the pulp fiber (P), glass fiber (G), and alumina silicate fiber (A) in the PSAMs samples on the sound-absorbing properties. The result indicated that, compared to inorganic fibers (glass fibers and alumina silicate fibers), the pure pulp fibers had appreciable sound-absorbing properties at all sound frequency bands. The SEM image showed that the inorganic glass- and alumina silicate fibers are plane-surfaced and rigid, whereas the natural pulp fibers are porous, flexible, and easily fibrillated (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311429881">Figure 6</xref>). This natural advantage confers on pulp fibers their perfect sound-absorbing properties caused by the elastic interactions between sound waves and pulp fibers.

<sec id="sec15-0021998311429881" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The use of industrial pulp fibers as the raw materials for developing new biodegradable sound-absorbing materials is reported in this work. Increasing thickness of the materials significantly increased the sound-absorbing properties at lower sound frequencies and had a cubic-degree parabolic relationship with the average sound-absorption coefficients. The results showed that, with increasing beating degree, the pulp fibers’ geometry, including fiber length, width, curl, and kink index, decreased gradually. An increase in the beating degree caused a decrease of the thickness, but an increase of the sound-absorbing properties, of the materials. After the beating treatment, many new microfibrils were detached from the cell walls of the pulp fibers and were reconstructed into smaller nanopores to be used as new channels for the movement of sound waves. Compared to the inorganic glass- and aluminum-silicate fibers, natural pulp fibers have appreciable sound-absorbing properties due to their technical advantages in terms of being porous, flexible, and easy fibrillated. This suggests that natural pulp fibers can serve as potential raw materials for the substitution of inorganic fibers in the future. Further studies will be conducted for the application of these new nanometer-grade pulp fibers for the development of advanced sound-absorbing materials.</p></sec>
