<abstract>
<p>Undesired noise and vibrations have a detrimental effect in many areas. Hence the control of vibrations has become a relevant technological challenge. Active vibration control of structures using smart materials is especially in vogue. This involves sensing the motion of the structure using sensors, generating a control signal using a controller and applying a control force on the structure using actuators. To design the control system of any vibrating structure, the mathematical model of the system is required. However, it is difficult to theoretically construct a model of complex structures. On the other hand, it is relatively simpler to model such systems in a Finite Element (FE) environment like ANSYS<sup>©</sup>. This paper deals with the extraction of the full and reduced mathematical models of a cantilever beam into MATLAB<sup>©</sup> from its FE model. The full model of the beam is reduced by discarding those modes which do not contribute to the overall response. It is found that the frequency and transient responses of the full and reduced models match closely. Hence the reduced model may be used to represent the system which in turn reduces the computational time. The controller is designed using proportional-integral-derivative theory with output feedback. SIMULINK<sup>©</sup> is then used to create a working block diagram of the control system and perform the control action. The transient responses of the controlled full and reduced models are then plotted which are found to be in close agreement. The procedure for the design of the controller described in this paper may be extended to control the vibrations of any real life system.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1077546311406307"><title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>In diverse areas like space and aircraft structures, satellites, cars, bridges etc. undesired vibrations are a major cause of problems. The effects of such vibrations are varied. Minor effects may include annoyance due to noise in automobiles, machines etc. Major effects are felt in areas like space structures where precise behavior of the structure is desired and any deviation from the required behavior may result in major expense. Under such conditions vibration control becomes very important.</p>
<p>Vibration control is an upcoming and challenging branch of mechanical engineering. It has wide ranging applications in diverse fields. A lot of research is being conducted in this area and new methods of control are being proposed and applied to the practical systems. Inparticular, active vibration control using smart materials is generating much interest around the world. Active vibration control is the process of using smart materials for controlling vibrations in real time. Smart materials are materials that respond with significant change in a property upon application of an external driving force. Such materials can act as sensors, which sense the disturbances in the structures, and actuators, which are capable of applying the controlling force. Examples of smart materials include piezoelectric materials, shape memory alloys, etc.</p>
<p>Some recent works are reported here. The active vibration control of simple cantilever beams is studied by many researchers. Piezoelectric patches as actuators are mounted on the beams.

<p>In the present study piezoelectric patches are used as both sensor and actuator to control the vibration of a cantilever beam.

<p>The size of the model can be reduced by discarding those modes which do not contribute to the overall response.

<p>This is the contribution to the transfer function <italic>x<sub>jk</sub></italic> from the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> mode. Summing up all such contributions from individual modes, we get the total transfer function as

The elements used are ‘Solid 45’ for the beam and ‘Solid 5’ for the piezoelectric patches. The location of the piezoelectric sensor-actuator pair is determined based on the location of maximum strain. The Block Lanczos method is used for performing modal analysis of the beam in ANSYS<sup>©</sup> to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors normalized with respect to mass. Ten modes are extracted. These results are then written to a file with extension. eig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077546311406307">Hatch, 2001</xref>). This file is then imported in MATLAB<sup>©</sup> and state space model is formed.

<p>By discarding the five modes which have least dcgain, the reduced model is also formed in MATLAB<sup>©</sup>.

The contribution of each individual mode is also shown.

<p>It is seen that the reduced model response closely follows that of the full model.

<sec id="sec7-1077546311406307"><title>5. Pid based output feedback control</title>
<p>The state space model of the cantilever beam extracted from ANSYS<sup>©</sup> is now used to design the PID based output feedback controller for actively controlling vibrations of the beam. In the PID controller the proportional, integral, and derivative terms are summed to calculate the output of the controller. Defining <italic>u</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) asthe controller output, the final form of the PID algorithm is
<disp-formula id="disp-formula17-1077546311406307"><label>(17)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311406307-eq17.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>K<sub>p</sub></italic> is proportional gain, <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> is integral gain and <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> is derivative gain.</p>
<p>The state space model is formulated in SIMULINK<sup>©</sup> environment. The PID loop accepts input in voltage form. For this reason the signal is passed through a displacement to a voltage converter block. For a piezoelectric patch the relationship between the displacement and corresponding voltage generated is given as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula18-1077546311406307"><label>(18)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311406307-eq18.tif"/></disp-formula>
where, <italic>V</italic> is the voltage generated, <italic>X</italic> is displacement, T is thickness of the patch, <italic>L</italic> is length of the patch and <italic>d</italic><sub>31</sub> is the strain co-efficient for piezoelectric material. Since all the terms in the bracket in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula18-1077546311406307">equation (18)</xref> are constant for a given crystal, the voltage generated is linearly related to the displacement. Thus a linear interpolation block may be used to calculate the values of the voltage corresponding to the displacement. This voltage is then fed to the PID based output feedback loop which consists of three main components; the PID controller block, the sensor block, and a voltage to displacement converter block. The PID controller takes the error signal as input. The error is calculated by the difference between the sensor signal and the input signal. When this error signal is substituted as <italic>e</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula17-1077546311406307">equation (17)</xref> the controlled displacement is given by <italic>u</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). To represent the PID controller system in SIMULINK<sup>©</sup> consider the Laplace transform of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula17-1077546311406307">equation (17)</xref> as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula19-1077546311406307"><label>(19)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311406307-eq19.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>To form the PID block, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula19-1077546311406307">equation (19)</xref> may be represented as the sum of the outputs of three separate blocks as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1077546311406307">Figure 6</xref>. To do so, the error signal may be split up into three branches, to provide input to each of the blocks.
<fig id="fig6-1077546311406307" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>PID controller block.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311406307-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The actuator block may be taken as a linear interpolation block which converts voltage generated to a corresponding displacement. It could be said to be the inverse of the displacement block explained earlier. The output of this block is fed to the ‘Scope’ for plotting the displacement versus time graph for the controlled system. A branch is taken out from this signal for sensor input. This block acts as a feedback for the control system. This signal is then fed to a summation point placed right before the PID based control loop as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1077546311406307">Figure 7</xref>. It subtracts the sensor voltage signal from the input signal to generate the error signal.

<p>An error may occur during the first running of the loop, as there is no output from the sensor. For this reason an initial guess of 0 volts may be taken as the sensor output as shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1077546311406307">Figure 8</xref>. Thus when the loop is run for the first time, at the summation point, this zero is subtracted from the input signal. The systemblock diagram of the PID controller in the SIMULINK<sup>©</sup> environment is shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1077546311406307">Figure 8</xref>.

<p>The performance of a PID based controller loop depends upon the values of the three gains <italic>K<sub>p</sub></italic>, <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>. Thus, these values of the gains should be such that the overall effect would be optimum. For this reason the PID tuning block is used here. This block uses iterative method to calculate the optimum values for the gains. It tests each iteration on all possible instances of control action. The block then determines the most optimum instance and selects the corresponding values of the gains. The output of the PID based control loop is fed to a ‘Scope’ which plots the displacement versus time graph for the controlled system. Depending upon the values of the matrices <italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic> fed, it plots the graph for full and reduced models as shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1077546311406307">Figure 9</xref>.

<p>In this paper, active vibration control of a cantilever beam has been demonstrated by using piezoelectric sensor/actuator and PID based output feedback controller. The mathematical model of the beam required for designing the controller is extracted in MATLAB<sup>©</sup> from the results of its modal analysis done in ANSYS<sup>©</sup>. The transient responses of the MATLAB<sup>©</sup> and ANSYS<sup>©</sup> models are found to be in close agreement which validated the process of model extraction. Model reduction is then performed and responses of full and reduced models are compared which also closely matched. A reduced model can serve to save the computational time required for the analysis. This procedure may be extended to any complex structure. The models of the beam thus obtained are then used to design a PID based output feedback controller in SIMULINK<sup>©</sup>. It is seen that the responses of full and reduced models are in close agreement. Hence by using the softwares such as ANSYS<sup>©</sup> and MATLAB<sup>©</sup> active vibration control of dynamic systems can be efficiently simulated which can give a close insight into the various aspects related to the active vibration control of real life systems.</p></sec>
