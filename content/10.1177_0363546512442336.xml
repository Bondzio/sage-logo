<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are common in athletic populations, particularly in athletes participating in football, soccer, and skiing.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose</bold>: The purpose of this study was to analyze the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Injury Surveillance System (ISS) men’s football ACL injury database from the playing seasons of 2004-2005 through 2008-2009 to determine the incidence and epidemiology of complete injury to the ACL in NCAA football athletes.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Descriptive epidemiology study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: The NCAA ISS men’s football database was reviewed from the 2004-2005 through 2008-2009 seasons using the specific injury code, “Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) complete tear.” The injury rate was computed for competition and practice exposures. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CIs) for the incident rates were calculated using assumptions of a Poisson distribution. Pairwise, 2-sample tests of equality of proportions with a continuity correction were used to estimate the associations of risk factors such as event type, playing surface, season segment, and football subdivision. Descriptive data were also described.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: The ACL injury rate during games (8.06 per 10,000 athlete-exposures [AEs] 95% CI, 6.80-9.42) was significantly greater than the rate during practice (0.8 per 10,000 AEs 95% CI, 0.68-0.93). Players were 10.09 (95% CI, 8.08-12.59) times more likely to sustain an ACL injury in competition when compared with practices. When practice exposures were analyzed separately, the injury rate was significantly greater during scrimmages (3.99 per 10,000 AEs 95% CI, 2.29-5.94) compared with regular practices (0.83 per 10,000 AEs 95% CI, 0.69-0.97) and walk-throughs (0 per 10,000 AEs 95% CI, 0-0.14). There was an incidence rate of 1.73 ACL injuries per 10,000 AEs (95% CI, 1.47-2.0) on artificial playing surfaces compared with a rate of 1.24 per 10,000 AEs (95% CI, 1.05-1.45) on natural grass. The rate of ACL injury on artificial surfaces is 1.39 (95% CI, 1.11-1.73) times higher than the injury rate on grass surfaces.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Between 2004 and 2009, NCAA football players experienced a greater number of ACL injuries in games compared with practices, in scrimmages compared with regular practices, and when playing on artificial turf surfaces. This latter finding will need to be confirmed by additional studies.</p>

<p>Football is one of the most popular sports in the United States and has been played competitively at the collegiate level for over 100 years. Football is a high-impact sport, with injuries occurring via both contact and noncontact mechanisms, and a complex sport, requiring that athletes perform position-specific skills and activities. It is also the leading cause of sport-related injuries, with an injury rate almost twice that of basketball.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512442336">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512442336">24</xref></sup> The demands of the game are such that players’ physical characteristics (eg, height and weight) vary widely, both within a team and among National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) divisions. The large number of athletes involved in NCAA football combined with the variability in their positions and individual characteristics reveals interesting injury patterns.</p>
<p>Over 100,000 injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) occur annually in the United States,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512442336">8</xref></sup> frequently during activities involving cutting, jumping, and pivoting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512442336">13</xref></sup> Sports such as soccer, football, and skiing have been characterized as high-risk activities, with several authors reporting the risk of ACL injury in these sports to be as much as 10 times higher than in other activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512442336">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512442336">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512442336">28</xref></sup> In football players, ACL injuries are relatively common and can often have devastating career consequences. Data from the National Football League (NFL) Combine show that approximately 8% of participants have a history of ACL injury,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512442336">7</xref></sup> ACL injuries represent 35% of all knee injuries previously sustained by participants,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512442336">4</xref></sup> and ACL injury is the number one reason for receiving a medical failure grade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512442336">6</xref></sup> Brophy et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512442336">6</xref></sup> reported that a previous ACL injury was associated with a decreased probability of playing in the NFL, as only 45.9% of patients reporting an ACL injury at the NFL Combine went on to play at least 1 game. Furthermore, injury to the ACL also places patients at an increased risk for development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis, regardless of concomitant meniscal injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512442336">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512442336">19</xref></sup> or whether they undergo surgical reconstruction of the ruptured ligament.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512442336">16</xref></sup> It is important to understand the incidence and causes of ACL injuries in this vulnerable population.</p>
<p>The NCAA Injury Surveillance System (ISS) was developed in 1982 to provide current and reliable data on injury trends in intercollegiate athletics. The purpose of this study was to analyze the NCAA ISS men’s football ACL injury database from the playing seasons of 2004-2005 through 2008-2009 to determine the incidence and epidemiology of complete injury to the ACL in NCAA football athletes. Our goal was to determine the injury rate and risk factors associated with ACL injuries (eg, position, playing surface, activity at time of injury, injury mechanism, game vs practice, and season segment). No formal hypothesis testing was proposed at the time this survey was initiated, so all findings represent post hoc analysis for specific comparisons.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0363546512442336">
<title>Sampling and Methods</title>
<p>Collegiate institutions sponsoring varsity football programs voluntarily participated in the fall NCAA ISS by collecting data annually during the 5-year period from 2004-2005 through 2008-2009. The ISS is a surveillance system that collects a sample of data from a larger population as opposed to a registry that records every event’s occurrence. The ISS uses a convenience sample—the online database permits any institution from any of the 3 NCAA divisions to submit data. This creates a deterministic rather than a random sample but has been deemed an acceptable manner of data collection for monitoring injury trends and patterns because it maintains a representative cross-section of NCAA participants while being courteous to the needs of the volunteering institutions. Since 1982, the ISS has employed stable, basic system definitions and recording methods, served as the basis for NCAA policy, and emerged as a powerful resource for monitoring injuries in NCAA sports.</p>
<p>During the 2004-2005 through 2008-2009 seasons, the ISS collected data on injuries and exposures in NCAA football players that occurred during organized practices and competitions from the first day of preseason to the final postseason competition. Injury data collection was achieved via an online submission form that asked questions pertaining to the basic mechanism of injury, time and place of injury, body part injured, type of injury, severity of injury (time loss and surgical interventions required), and sport-specific questions such as player position and equipment involved. Exposures were collected through a web-based system as they were entered by participating institutions through a 1-page exposure form summarizing the number of practices and competitions, the average number of participants per activity, season (preseason, regular season, or postseason), type of playing surface, and location of competition (home or away).</p>
<p>The Men’s Football Injury Data Set for this 5-year period (2004-2005 to 2008-2009 seasons) was examined using the specific injury code “Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) complete tear.” The number of participating institutions varies each year, but during the time period of this investigation, the overall number of participating institutions ranged from 8.9% to 10.1% of schools sponsoring NCAA intercollegiate football teams. Injuries were reported to the ISS by the team athletic trainers when the injury satisfied 3 criteria: (1) occurred as a result of participation in an organized NCAA intercollegiate practice or competition, (2) subsequently required medical attention, and (3) resulted in restriction of the student-athlete’s participation in practice or competition for at least 1 calendar day beyond the initial day of injury. We also looked at the Men’s Football Exposure Data Set 2004-2005 to 2008-2009 to determine the number of athlete-exposures (AEs) to be used as the denominator when calculating injury rates. A reportable AE was defined as 1 student-athlete participating in 1 practice or competition in which there was the possibility for athletic injury, regardless of the duration of that participation. Of note, preseason intrasquad scrimmages were classified as practices rather than games. Athletic trainers submitted data starting on the first official day of preseason practice, and data collection extended to and included the final day postseason competition.</p>
<p>Once the injury and exposure variables contained in the Men’s Football Injury Data Set 2004-2005 to 2008-2009 and the Men’s Football Exposure Data Set 2004-2005 to 2008-2009 were identified, we included them in the statistical analysis described below to establish the incidence and epidemiology of ACL injuries and the risk factors associated with ACL injury in NCAA football players.</p>

<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-0363546512442336">
<title>Incidence</title>
<p>To be able to make inferences regarding all NCAA football exposures from the convenience sample reflected in these data, the NCAA has created sampling weights, which were used in all analyses. The incidence of injury, that is, the injury rate (the number of injuries divided by the number of AEs), was computed per 10,000 AEs for competition and practice exposures. The AEs for the period of interest were established by looking at the AEs contained in the Men’s Football Exposure Data Set 2004-2005 to 2008-2009. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CIs) for the incidence rates were calculated based on assumptions of a Poisson distribution using the standard large-sample formula as implemented in the ci:poisson() function in the epicalc package of the R statistical program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512442336">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rate ratios were also calculated, as they are useful for determining whether there is an increased rate of injury associated with 1 particular participation type over another. For instance, if the competition injury rate were 14.0 times higher than the practice injury rate, then the competition-to-practice rate ratio would be 14.0. Ninety-five percent CIs were computed for all rates and rate ratios using standard large-sample formulas.</p>

<sec id="section5-0363546512442336">
<title>Descriptive Data on Injuries</title>
<p>Descriptive data were also described, such as player’s activity at time of injury, athlete’s position, side of body, and injury mechanism. These variables cannot be considered risk factors because no data on the relevant denominators were available (eg, how many players at the same field location were not injured).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the 5-year period between 2004-2005 and 2008-2009, a total of 318 injuries to the ACL occurred in NCAA football players during 2,222,155 AEs, accounting for 0.23% of all injuries sustained during this 5-year surveillance period. Thus, the overall incidence rate of ACL injuries in NCAA football players was 1.42 per 10,000 AEs (95% CI, 1.27-1.59). The injury rate was highest during the postseason at 1.55 injuries per 10,000 AEs (95% CI, 0.76-2.57), but this rate was not significantly different from the rates of ACL injury in season (1.45 per 10,000 AEs 95% CI, 1.25-1.66) or preseason (1.34 per 10,000 AEs 95% CI, 1.08-1.63). When divided based on competition type, the injury rate during games (8.06 per 10,000 AEs 95% CI, 6.80-9.42) was greater than the rate during practice (0.8 per 10,000 AEs 95% CI, 0.68-0.93). Players were 10.09 (95% CI, 8.08-12.59) times more likely to sustain an ACL injury in competition when compared with practices. When practice exposures were analyzed separately, the injury rate was significantly greater during scrimmages (3.99 per 10,000 AEs 95% CI, 2.29-5.94) compared with regular practices (0.83 per 10,000 AEs 95% CI, 0.69-0.97) and walk-throughs (0 per 10,000 AEs 95% CI, 0-0.14). Players were 4.8 (95% CI, 3.01-7.68) times more likely to sustain an ACL injury in a scrimmage when compared with a regular practice. The ACL injury rate was highest in Division III football players at 1.56 per 10,000 AEs (95% CI, 1.28-1.87), but this was not statistically different from the rates in Division I (1.45 per 10,000 AEs 95% CI, 1.22-1.71) or Division II (1.17 per 10,000 AEs 95% CI, 0.88-1.48).</p>
<p>Playing surface had a significant effect on injury rates, as there was an incidence rate of 1.73 ACL injuries per 10,000 AEs (95% CI, 1.47-2.0) on artificial surfaces compared with a rate of 1.24 per 10,000 AEs (95% CI, 1.05-1.45) on natural grass. The rate of ACL injury on artificial surfaces is 1.39 (95% CI, 1.11-1.73) times higher than the injury rate on grass surfaces. When artificial playing surfaces were further subdivided, the rate of injury on third-generation surfaces, documented as “artificial surfaces with fill” (1.77 per 10,000 AEs 95% CI, 1.47-2.08), was significantly greater than the injury rate on first- and second-generation artificial surfaces, “artificial surfaces without fill” (1.43 per 10,000 AEs 95% CI, 0.78-2.30) and natural grass (1.24 per 10,000 AEs 95% CI, 1.05-1.45).</p>
<p>Athlete positions were only recorded for game exposures. As a result, athlete positions were missing or not applicable in 186.79 (51.69%) of weighted exposures and were therefore excluded from analysis. Of the remaining injuries for which a position was known, linebackers (7.73%), running backs (7.32%), special teams players (6.32%), wide receivers (5.35%), cornerbacks (3.51%), and quarterbacks (3.2%) were most frequently injured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512442336">Figure 1</xref>). Injuries to safeties (2.8%), defensive tackles (2.68%), defensive ends (2.55%), offensive guards (2.26%), offensive tackles (2.23%), centers (1.17%), tight ends (0.28%), kickers/punters (0.28%), long snappers (0.28%), and holders (0%) composed the remaining ACL injuries during this 5-year surveillance period. In evaluating these numbers, it is important to remember that exposure varies by the number of players at each position during a play.</p>

</fig>
<p>The basic injury mechanism was reported as contact with another player in 53.03% of injuries, while acute noncontact (40.13%) and contact with the playing surface (4.38%) accounted for the majority of the remaining injuries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512442336">Figure 2</xref>). The specific mechanism of injury was undefined, or other, in 45.78% of injuries. Being tackled (20.05%), blocking (11.31%), being blocked (9.66%), tackling (6.6%), being stepped on/fallen on/kicked (5.64%), or contact with a blocking sled/dummy (0.96%) accounted for the remaining injuries. Athletes were most likely to be participating in offensive passing (19.79%), offensive running (18.78%), defensive passing (13.65%), or defensive running (12.75%) plays at the time of injury. General play (10.11%), kick-off coverage (6.42%), blocking drills (4.02%), punt return (3.74%), kick-off return (3.62%), punt coverage (2.93%), tackling drills (1.82%), point after touchdown (PAT)/field goal attempt (0.81%), and PAT/field goal defense (0.40%) account for the remainder of the injuries. There was no difference with regard to laterality, with 48.76% of injuries occurring on the left and 51.24% occurring on the right.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our analysis of the NCAA ISS Men’s Football Injury Data Set from 2004-2005 to 2008-2009 revealed several important findings: (1) players are over 10 times more likely to sustain an ACL injury in games versus practices, (2) players are significantly more likely to sustain an ACL injury in scrimmages compared with regular or walk-through practices, and (3) the rate of ACL injury sustained on artificial turf is significantly greater than on natural grass. We also observed that the vast majority (93.16%) of ACL injuries are caused by player contact or acute noncontact mechanisms and that player position may influence the likelihood of sustaining an ACL injury.</p>
<p>Injuries to the knee are widely recognized as the most common form of musculoskeletal injury sustained by American football players.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512442336">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512442336">10</xref></sup> Dick et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512442336">10</xref></sup> evaluated the NCAA ISS from the 1988-1989 through 2003-2004 seasons and found that knee internal derangement injuries were the most commonly sustained injury in both games and practices. A recent investigation by Bradley et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512442336">4</xref></sup> examined the incidence of knee injury in collegiate football players at the NFL Combine and determined that 53% of the population had sustained a knee injury and an average of 1.3 knee injuries were sustained per player. In this participant population, ACL injuries were the third most common type of knee injury, behind medial collateral ligament and meniscal injuries, and surgical reconstruction of the ACL was the second most common type of surgery, behind arthroscopic meniscectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512442336">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our results indicate that ACL injuries occur over 10 times more frequently in competition than in practice, a finding that is consistent with the current literature. Dick et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512442336">10</xref></sup> reported that the rate of knee internal derangement injuries in NCAA football players was 13 times greater in games when compared with practices. Shankar et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512442336">24</xref></sup> reported injuries were over 6 times more prevalent in both high school and collegiate football games compared with practices, while Bradley et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512442336">5</xref></sup> found that twice as many ACL injuries occurred during competition compared with routine practices. A plausible explanation for this significant trend observed in our analysis and in previous studies is that game conditions involve a less predictable playing environment and greater speeds and intensity. The increase in magnitude and frequency of collisions may increase the risk of injury, particularly given our finding that player contact mechanisms account for over half of all ACL injuries. This theory may likely also account for the increased risk of injury in practice scrimmages compared with regular or walk-through practices; we observed an almost 5-fold increase in ACL injuries in scrimmages compared with regular practices, which was consistent with a previous literature report of increased injury in football scrimmage practices in the Big Ten Conference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512442336">1</xref></sup> Given that the objective of a practice scrimmage is to simulate game-like playing conditions, this similarity in injury rates is expected.</p>
<p>Recent literature reviews have categorized the varying types of artificial playing surfaces, investigated their biomechanical properties, and documented distinct injury patterns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512442336">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512442336">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512442336">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512442336">30</xref></sup> Although it is becoming increasingly clear that playing surface is an important factor in injury incidences and mechanisms, the exact role and ideal surface have yet to be determined. Significantly higher overall injury rates in football have been reported on artificial surfaces compared with natural grass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512442336">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512442336">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512442336">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512442336">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512442336">22</xref></sup> However, current literature examining the rates of ACL injury specifically on artificial surfaces and natural grass has revealed mixed results. Two reports documented no difference in ACL injury rates on artificial turf and grass surfaces,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512442336">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512442336">17</xref></sup> while a different study found increased rates of noncontact ACL injuries on grass compared with artificial turf.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512442336">23</xref></sup> Others still have reported an increased overall risk of ACL injury on turf when compared with grass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512442336">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512442336">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512442336">23</xref></sup> This lack of consensus may be because of the shortage of studies specifically designed to test this hypothesis, an issue further complicated by the widely variable nature of artificial surfaces. First- and second-generation surfaces consist of short nylon fibers, with variable padding, while third-generation surfaces are characterized by longer fiber lengths, rubber synthetic infill, and increased shock absorbency. Our analysis of the data in this survey indicates a greater incidence of ACL injuries in NCAA football players on artificial playing surfaces when compared with grass. Furthermore, the rate of injury on artificial surfaces with fill (third-generation) is significantly greater than both artificial surfaces without fill (first- and second-generation) and natural grass surfaces. A potential cause of this difference might be the unique shoe-surface interaction associated with artificial surfaces. Extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the mechanical properties of artificial turf. Previous studies have indicated that playing surface plays a significant role in peak torque, rotational stiffness, and foot loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512442336">30</xref></sup> Compared with grass, artificial turf surfaces showed higher peak torques and rotational stiffness, potentially explaining the mechanism by which artificial turf might contribute to knee injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512442336">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>A large percentage of injury reports omitted specific data such as player position or injury mechanism. However, our analysis of the available data revealed that linebackers, running backs, special teams players, wide receivers, cornerbacks, and quarterbacks most frequently sustained an ACL injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512442336">Figure 1</xref>). Shankar et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512442336">24</xref></sup> reported similar findings for overall injury rates, noting that linebackers and running backs had the highest rates of injury at both the high school and intercollegiate levels. Similarly, Dick et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512442336">10</xref></sup> found that NCAA running backs, quarterbacks, and linebackers most frequently sustained injuries in games. With regard to the ACL specifically, a review of these injuries in the NFL also reported running backs and linebackers to be among the positions most frequently injured.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512442336">5</xref></sup> Additionally, our study revealed that ACL injuries occurred most frequently during offensive running and passing plays. When combining offense and defense, running plays accounted for 31.53% of all injuries, while passing plays accounted for 33.44% and special teams play for 17.92%. These results were similar to those reported by Bradley et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512442336">5</xref></sup>; in the NFL, ACL injury most frequently occurred during passing plays (32.4%), special teams plays (31.7%), and running plays (28.2%).</p>
<p>Analysis of the data set revealed that the majority of ACL injuries occurred via player contact (53.03%) and noncontact (40.13%) mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512442336">Figure 2</xref>). Given the high-impact nature of football, it is unsurprising that the majority of injuries were caused by player contact mechanisms. Interestingly, though, a large proportion of injuries were caused by noncontact mechanisms. Previous reports have identified a plethora of variables that may contribute to noncontact ACL injuries, including biological, biomechanical, and environmental risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512442336">2</xref></sup> Environmental risk factors include weather, footwear, and shoe-surface interaction. Of the injuries sustained on natural grass, 36.12% were noncontact, while 44.29% of injuries sustained on artificial turf were caused by noncontact mechanisms. This difference, combined with the structural and mechanical differences of natural grass and artificial playing surfaces, suggests the possibility of a playing surface–associated environmental risk factor at play in noncontact ACL injuries.</p>
<p>We did not observe a difference in ACL injury rates between preseason, regular season, and postseason. This observation was in contrast to previous literature reports, which found the rate of preseason ACL injury to be greater than regular season injury rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512442336">5</xref></sup> and the overall rate of NCAA football injuries to be greater during preseason than regular season.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512442336">10</xref></sup> We also did not observe a significant difference in ACL injury rates between Divisions I, II, or III, which was in contrast to a previous study that reported a significantly greater rate of overall injury in Division I compared with Division II.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512442336">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results of this study suggest 3 areas for future investigations and possible interventions aimed at reducing the number of ACL injuries in NCAA football players. The increased injury incidence on third-generation artificial turf may suggest that this surface is not an adequate substitute for natural grass surfaces and should be further investigated. Additionally, both the increased incidence of injury in games versus practices and the large percentage of injuries due to noncontact mechanisms suggest it may be necessary to alter training programs to improve factors such as strength, proprioception, and decision making in response to unexpected stimuli in order to improve overall and game-time biomechanics.</p>
<p>The NCAA ISS is a well-established and sophisticated injury reporting system. Nonetheless, the current findings are subject to several limitations. First, as with any study relying on reported information, it is possible that ACL injuries at participating institutions were unreported or underreported and are therefore missing from analysis. Second, the NCAA ISS pools data from NCAA institutions sponsoring intercollegiate football teams and uses sampling weights to determine overall injury and exposure values. Because a large percentage of schools are not included in this system, actual rates and incidences of ACL injuries may vary from those that are ultimately reported. Finally, nearly 50% of reported injuries were missing data for some categories such as player position or specific injury mechanism. The trends reported here were based off the remaining subset of available information; however, it is still worth noting the large percentage of missing data, which may have ultimately skewed the results. Despite these limitations, we believe the information presented here is the best means of classifying and evaluating incidence and risk factors for ACL injury in NCAA football players.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Between 2004 and 2009, NCAA football players experienced a greater number of ACL injuries in games compared with practices, in scrimmages compared with regular practices, and when playing on artificial turf surfaces. The majority of injuries were caused by contact with another player or acute noncontact mechanisms. The distribution of ACL injury varied with position type and was most often reported in linebackers, running backs, and special teams players.</p>
