<p>I am sure many remember in our younger days the importance of having a certain level of skill on the dance floor in order to impress and catch the eye of a partner. In my case I am talking about a time when <italic>Strictly Come Dancing</italic> was still the glint in the eye of a junior BBC researcher. No sequins and lycra here, just clubs and discos and non-choreographed mayhem.</p>
<p>All educationalists and coaches know that skill needs to be rehearsed and refined but at that time in my life the skills I wanted to rehearse were firmly focused on the sports fields of the West Country and not its dance floors. Nevertheless, there were always one or two people at these discos that could (and I use the parlance of the time) ‘throw some shapes’ that were, it has to be said, pretty impressive.</p>
<p>So what are your alternatives if you are not that gifted a dancer? Very simple: if you cannot dance you go for comedy. Just ask the great Sir Bruce Forsyth, one of the last remaining British performers with his roots in 1950s variety theatre – a dancer, musician and comedian – the complete ‘entertainer’.</p>
<p>Hence the concept of ‘dad dancing’ was born. Safety in numbers was always necessary when attempting ‘dad dancing’ – a minimum of three but no more than six participants. One did not want to raise the dander of the local ‘marines’ in a naval city.</p>
<p>A simple concept, one would simply enter the circle created in the centre of the dance floor for maximum effect and replicate Dad’s dancing at Auntie Margaret’s 50th birthday party to be copied by all participants. Each member took their turn to lead in ever-increasing levels of un-coordinated, non-rhythmical hilarity. Until everyone on the periphery was watching, suitably impressed, or the record ended – whichever came first.</p>
<p>Why this parody of dancing like your father? Well, quite simply, as a teenager the perception was that everything your parents did was ‘un-cool’, whether it was the music they listened to, the clothes they wore or many of their views on how you should live your life. If there were a coolness perception table, parents would undoubtedly be bottom of the league, closely followed by teachers.</p>
<p>So why do many schools still continue to deliver health education via non-specialist teachers? I accept that there is some excellent practice that takes place in many secondary schools in delivering this important message. But let’s be honest, schools’ priorities are about achieving exam results in ever-tighter financial circumstances and in many cases personal, social and health education (PSHE) is a statutory afterthought that is all too often delivered by non-specialists who are uncomfortable or disinterested with the content. This can create, at worst, a scenario where teachers cringe at the thought of delivering PSHE, while the students are slowly sliding down their chairs with embarrassment.</p>
<p>Now bring on the entertainers that will engage and educate: youth health champions (YHCs). This initiative has been piloted by North East Essex Primary Care Trust. It is innovative and uses 15- and 16-year-old students as facilitators of health education and also to act as a signpost for their peers when further professional advice is needed. It is simplicity itself and yet so effective. Who will students listen to if it’s not parents and teachers? Each other, of course. The power of the peer message cannot be underestimated and what is the cost to the school? Nothing. Yes, absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>What is needed is a forward-thinking primary care trust that is willing to invest some of its resources into three days’ intensive training for the YHCs, to educate them on all the relevant health issues that our young people are now faced with. It also requires a school that recognises the value of ‘student voice’ and the benefits of a peer-led approach. At Manningtree High School we already had a strong base of ‘student voice’ with Pupil Observers of Learning (POOL) and an active school council. The YHC was the next obvious step – students leading learning in health education.</p>
<p>This peer-led approach has created a group of 12 well-trained, approachable, easily identifiable students (they wear purple YHC polo shirts on their duty days) who their peers look up to and know that it is them from whom they can seek help.</p>
<p>The YHCs have a year-long coordinated approach in the school calendar with Health Awareness weeks, which include a visual display staffed by the YHC students at different venues around the school site, in conjunction with the delivery of an hour-long targeted health session during a PSHE lesson that week.</p>
<p>The YHCs, in consultation with a lead member of staff, decide the content of the session and which year group it is to be targeted. The YHCs also have a very important signposting role when peers may stop them in the corridor or on the field if there is something they need advice with. The YHCs are fully trained in where their responsibilities start and finish and confidentiality training is paramount. They also have the knowledge that they can refer things to the school nurse when necessary.</p>
<p>The benefits are clear for all to see, whether it is the engagement of the students when working in a small group with a YHC during their PSHE session or the feedback from the students themselves. They clearly advocate this peer approach stating that it is far more relevant and easy to understand when it is delivered by one of their contemporaries.</p>
<p>As with anything innovative, it requires leadership that will overcome the doubting voices, but the argument in this case is persuasive. As the YHCs have become more experienced, their sessions and their involvement have improved. After all, any skill needs to be practised and rehearsed to become accomplished, but most importantly this approach is so effective because it uses the very best resource that any school has: the students themselves.</p>
