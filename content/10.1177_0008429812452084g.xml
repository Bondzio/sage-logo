<p>Ole Bruun’s <italic>An Introduction to Feng Shui</italic> is an ambitious book. In the space of a scant two hundred pages, the author endeavours not only to provide an overview of the history, beliefs and practices associated with the Chinese feng shui tradition, but also to review current scholarly perspectives and debates, and to explore various thematic issues, including the relationship between feng shui and ecology, and the globalization of the feng shui tradition. Given the herculean labour that Bruun attempted to perform, I would contend that he was largely successful, as will be described below.</p>
<p>The book’s most notable feature is certainly the extent to which its various topics are elucidated, expanded upon, and enlivened through the use of clear, pertinent examples from the author’s field research. Whether discussing the presence of feng shui in modern Chinese real estate (128–129), the oracular role of feng shui professionals (77), or their implication in socio-economic contention related to home renovations in rural China (66), Bruun makes exemplary use of ethnographic data. This discursive strategy reaches its apex in the chapter entitled “Environmental Concerns,” which explores the gulf between idealistic academic perspectives on the potential utility of feng shui as an ecological ideology and the realities of life in modern rural China. Therein, Bruun offers a harrowing description of his return to a devastatingly polluted village where he had previously performed fieldwork and his subsequent conversations with farmers and feng shui masters, who did (occasionally) describe their ecological woes in terms derived from the feng shui tradition (181–183). In all of these cases, the author’s decision to explore these issues via both historical/theoretical perspectives and contextualized narratives served to humanize and particularize the material in a most valuable way. Moreover, it is emblematic of a broader pattern within the book, which is at its best when it is concerned with the contemporary period and the issues associated with it.</p>
<p>The book was also characterized by an estimable degree of reflexivity and theoretical sophistication. Instead of presenting a sanitized, reified overview of the material, as is often the case in introductory texts, Bruun consistently highlights its complexity. For example, he devotes an entire chapter to a detailed review of pertinent feng shui literature, which outlines the scope of current academic consensus and contention (84–99). Likewise, his discussion of the role of feng shui in modern Chinese life concerns not only its continued practice, but also the extent to which it has become a field for academic enquiry in China (120–122, 127–128). As a final example, his discussion of western appropriations of feng shui also considers the response of Chinese academics to this phenomenon (156–158). In all cases, these authorial choices serve to highlight the complexities of modern Feng Shui Studies, while simultaneously providing the reader with a clear picture of the field of play within which these issues are being debated.</p>
<p>This is not to say that <italic>An Introduction to Feng Shui</italic> is without issues. For one, its discussion of the religio-cultural antecedents to the feng shui tradition lacks the clarity and cohesion found in the author’s approach to more modern material. As one example, it presents Chinese “popular religion” (a term that is used uncritically) as if it were a monolithic, unchanging and largely atemporal tradition (49–58). For another, the discussion of Daoism is somewhat confusing, given that it vacillates between presenting it as a textual tradition (based on the Daodejing and Zhuangzi) and as a tradition that is more or less synonymous with “popular religion” (17–19). These introductory chapters, which provide the relevant background information for the remainder of the book, are also marred by occasional organizational issues. For instance, the term “popular religion” is used for almost fifty pages before the author acknowledges the difficulties inherent in applying the term “religion” in a Chinese context (53–54) and for almost eighty pages before he proposes the term “popular cosmology” as a more appropriate alternative (78). Finally (and least significantly), the book also suffered from a noticeable number of word-choice issues and infelicitous phrasings. Though they did not generally impede my understanding of the material, they were still somewhat distracting.</p>
<p>To conclude, Bruun succeeds in providing a clear introductory overview of the theory, practice and significance of feng shui, in both its Chinese and its global manifestations. Though the book’s coverage of the historical material was slightly more uneven, this does not negate the accomplishment of presenting such a broad compass of material in so few pages. Moreover, the level of sophistication with which certain theoretical issues were treated would make sections of this book ideal reading for classes of advanced undergraduates.</p>
