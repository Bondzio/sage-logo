<title>Special Issue Call for Papers: Ethics, Corporate Social Responsibility, and Sustainability in Marketing Education Submission Deadline: November 1, 2012</title>
<p>According to the World Economic Forum, the license to operate in a global market requires that an organization become engaged in society, and recent economic, social-political, and natural disasters have all served to highlight the fragility of the global marketplace. A variety of terms have been used to describe companies and their accountability to society in response to a fragile global marketplace: ethical decision making, social responsibility, sustainable development, corporate governance, corporate citizenship, and triple bottom line. Essentially, companies worldwide are being held responsible for issues such as: not harming the environment, treating employees fairly, dealing truthfully and transparently with consumers, fair pricing, ensuring responsible supply chain management, reducing climate change impact, improving education/skills in the community, listening/responding to public concerns, increasing global economic stability, helping reduce the rich-poor gap, reducing human rights abuses, supporting charities/community projects, and solving social problems.</p>
<p>It is no longer questioned as to whether or not companies should be good corporate citizens; rather, the concern in the 21st century is how businesses can become good citizens. Unfortunately, there is little reported formalization and documentation in business education that equips students to matriculate into companies doing business in a 21st century operating environment in which good citizenship is the norm and not the exception. Thus, the overall objective of this special issue of the <italic>Journal of Marketing Education</italic> is to bring together scholarship that addresses how business and society are intertwined in our classrooms and among our students. Manuscripts for this special issue on “Ethics, Corporate Social Responsibility, and Sustainability in Marketing Education” are likely to follow one of the following four formats:</p>
<sec id="section2-0273475312441892">
<title>Pedagogical Tools</title>
<p>This format will focus upon how issues related to these topics can be incorporated into the marketing classroom. Of particular interest will be pedagogical tools that are innovative and have sparked interest within the student population or external relationships with businesses or outside organizations which support student learning in an applied context.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0273475312441892">
<title>Framework for Marketing Curriculum Content</title>
<p>This format is applicable for departments, programs, courses, etc. in which ethics, corporate social responsibility, and sustainability topics provide an overall framework for guiding course and/or content development. Programmatic efforts to bring such issues to the forefront of educational planning are highly encouraged. This work might be related to the AACSB accreditation/reaccreditation process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0273475312441892">
<title>Research Within a Student Population</title>
<p>This format embraces educational research projects that collect data from students with respect to a wide variety of content. Examples might include student mastery of ethics content, social responsibility, and sustainability concepts or other assessment measures of learning or knowledge mastery, perceptions of sustainability, and ethical reasoning, to name a few.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0273475312441892">
<title>Cross-Functional Partnerships</title>
<p>Manuscripts addressing any of the numerous topics are encouraged, and the manuscript does not have to be restricted to the marketing classroom/student. We welcome cross-functional submissions about educating our future business leaders in this domain.</p>
<p>Potential contributors should feel free to contact the co-editors with any questions concerning interest and/or appropriateness of topics and formats. All manuscripts will be judged on their scholarly merits, the soundness of the conceptual and methodological approaches, and overall ability to advance the marketing education literature.
