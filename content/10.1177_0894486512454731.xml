<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the past 20 years, CEO compensation is one of the corporate governance topics that has initiated a lot of public controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894486512454731">Denis, 2001</xref>). One of the prominent research questions in this area is whether firm performance has an effect on CEO compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894486512454731">Barkema &amp; Gomez-Mejia, 1998</xref>). Theoretical arguments for the pay-for-performance debate are principally grounded in agency theory. Agency theory assumes all individuals to be rational, risk adverse, and inclined to take actions that maximize their personal welfare with minimal effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0894486512454731">Gomez-Mejia &amp; Wiseman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0894486512454731">Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976</xref>). As such, to motivate CEOs to act in the best interest of the shareholders, one of the possible actions is to make CEO pay dependent on firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0894486512454731">Murphy, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Most empirical research on pay-for-performance has focused on large, public firms (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894486512454731">Devers, Cannella, Reilly, &amp; Yoder, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0894486512454731">Gomez-Mejia, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0894486512454731">Tosi, Werner, Katz, &amp; Gomez-Mejia, 2000</xref>). Other forms of organizations, such as small privately held family firms, have often been overlooked because it is assumed that pay-for-performance is not relevant because of the absence of separation between ownership and control and thus the absence of agency costs. However, recent literature argues that concentrated (family) ownership and owner-management can also be associated with substantial agency costs, which are mainly engendered by altruism and self-control problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0894486512454731">Lubatkin, Schulze, Ling, &amp; Dino, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0894486512454731">Schulze, Lubatkin, &amp; Dino, 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486512454731">Schulze, Lubatkin, Dino, &amp; Buchholtz, 2001</xref>). Therefore, we argue in this article that the pay-for-performance relationship <italic>is</italic> relevant in private family firms because the complex agency relations make them benefit from performance-related pay. Moreover, several surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894486512454731">Chrisman, Chua, Kellermanns, &amp; Chang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486512454731">Schulze et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0894486512454731">Welles, 1995</xref>) reveal that, in practice, the majority of privately held family firms does indeed offer performance-based pay to their managers.</p>
<p>The scant amount of evidence on pay in private (family) firms finds inconsistent results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894486512454731">Banghøj, Gabrielsen, Petersen, &amp; Plenborg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894486512454731">Barkema &amp; Pennings, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894486512454731">Cole &amp; Mehran, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894486512454731">Cooley, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0894486512454731">Ke, Petroni, &amp; Safieddine, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486512454731">Schulze et al., 2001</xref>). One potential explanation for these mixed results could be provided by the fact that these studies do not examine the effects of potential moderating variables on the pay-for-performance relation. As private family firms cannot be treated as a homogeneous group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0894486512454731">Habbershon, Williams, &amp; MacMillan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0894486512454731">Westhead &amp; Howorth, 2007</xref>), the nature and level of agency costs may vary across different types of private family firms. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine how (and to what extent) the pay-for-performance relation is moderated by the ownership and management structures.</p>
<p>Private family firms are an interesting case to study, because they have some characteristics that deviate from large, publicly traded firms that may be reflected in the design of pay contracts. First, owners in privately held family firms are likely to have different incentives and possibilities to monitor the CEO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894486512454731">Fama &amp; Jensen, 1983</xref>) because of the high level of ownership concentration. Second, compensation policy poses one of the most complex<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0894486512454731">1</xref></sup> and sensitive problems family firms face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894486512454731">Aronoff &amp; Ward, 1993</xref>) because of family considerations such as family history, expectations, and sibling rivalries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894486512454731">Coleman &amp; Carsky, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0894486512454731">Nuno Pereira &amp; Paulo Esperança, 2008</xref>). Third, because private firms are insulated from regulatory pressures to disclose CEO pay, they tend to use less sophisticated<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0894486512454731">2</xref></sup> CEO compensation plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894486512454731">Bebchuk &amp; Fried, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894486512454731">Bitler, Moskowitz, &amp; Vissing-Jorgensen, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Our hypotheses are tested using a cross-sectional sample of 529 private family firms (C-Corporations), gathered by the 2003 Survey of Small Business Finance (hereafter SSBF).</p>
<p>The results suggest that in these firms, objective performance-based measures play a significant role in CEO compensation. Additionally, we find that a CEO’s compensation is more responsive to firm performance in firms with low ownership dispersion and in the controlling-owner stage. Furthermore, the positive pay-for-performance relation is slightly stronger for nonfamily CEOs than for family CEOs. Therefore, our findings suggest that private family firms cannot be considered as a homogeneous group when studying CEO compensation.</p>
<p>As such, our article contributes to the literature in several ways. First, although traditional agency theorists claim the pay-for-performance relation to be irrelevant in the context of private family firms, we provide empirical evidence that suggests the opposite. Second, we respond to recent calls to investigate the conditions or characteristics under which performance determines executive compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894486512454731">Chrisman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894486512454731">Finkelstein, Hambrick, &amp; Cannella, 2009</xref>) by taking into account ownership and management characteristics of the private family firm. Third, although previous studies used samples of both family and nonfamily firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894486512454731">Banghøj et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0894486512454731">McConaughy, 2000</xref>), or both private and public firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0894486512454731">Ke et al., 1999</xref>), we focus on privately held family-owned firms. This focus on private family firms should reveal more clearly the differences within this group of family firms. Fourth, existing literature on executive pay in privately held family firms is scarce, because data has generally not been accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0894486512454731">Ke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0894486512454731">Wasserman, 2006</xref>). In 2003, the Federal Reserve Board released its SSBF, which collected data from a sample of U.S.-based private firms. The survey provides compensation information on a group of firms, which are all 100% family-owned, which is exactly the case where classical agency theorists expect no agency costs. The database also enables us to test the pay-for-performance relationship in firms with a wide range of ownership and management structures. Finally, from a methodological point of view, our findings are an excellent illustration of the importance of the calculation of marginal effects for the interpretation of interaction models as our results show that it is indeed possible that these effects are significant for relevant values of the moderating variable, even if the coefficient of the interaction term is nonsignificant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894486512454731">Brambor, Clark, &amp; Golder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0894486512454731">Kam &amp; Franzese, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The article proceeds as follows. In the next section, we discuss the pay-for-performance relationship theoretically and derive testable hypotheses. We then test these hypotheses using our sample of 529 privately held U.S. family firms. The results and conclusions follow.</p>

<title>Agency Theory on CEO Compensation: The Optimal Contracting Perspective</title>
<p>Agency theory is the theoretical framework that is most frequently used to characterize CEO compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894486512454731">Devers et al., 2007</xref>). This theory focuses on the conflict of interest that arises from the separation of ownership and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894486512454731">Berle &amp; Means, 1991</xref>), often referred to as <italic>Agency Problem I</italic>. This conflict arises because agency theory assumes all individuals (both agents and principals) to be rational, risk adverse, and inclined to take actions that maximize their personal welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0894486512454731">Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976</xref>). As a result of this conflict of interest between managers (agents) and shareholders (principals), agency costs can arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0894486512454731">Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976</xref>). CEOs, as being agents, are thus also assumed to be entirely driven by self-interest and motivated primarily by financial incentives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0894486512454731">Lubatkin, Durand, &amp; Ling, 2007</xref>). This raises the possibility for opportunistic actions by the CEO because she/he might pursue a self-serving agenda, which does not necessarily include the same objectives as those of the shareholders. For example, a CEO might undertake aggressive mergers and acquisitions, with modest or even negative returns to the shareholders, just for increasing the size of the firm and, as a result, increasing the level of CEO pay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0894486512454731">Kroll, Simmons, &amp; Wright, 1990</xref>). When this incongruence of objectives occurs, shareholders will have to find a way to reduce the possibility of opportunistic actions undertaken by the CEO. As such, to motivate CEOs to act in the best interest of the shareholders, agency theory claims that CEO pay should (partly) depend on firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0894486512454731">Murphy, 1986</xref>). An “optimal contract” will therefore tie the CEO’s expected utility to shareholder’s wealth by depending on verifiable performance benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894486512454731">Jensen &amp; Murphy, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0894486512454731">Ross, 1973</xref>). As a result, this optimal contract can reduce Agency Problem I because it encourages CEOs to act on behalf of the shareholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894486512454731">Conyon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0894486512454731">Setia-Atmaja, Tanewski, &amp; Skully, 2009</xref>) and thus aligns the incentives of both parties. In other words, agency theory considers performance-dependent CEO pay as a tool to alleviate agency problems stemming from the separation between ownership and control.</p>
<p>As discussed above, agency theory claims that pay-for-performance contracts are needed to reduce the agency costs resulting from the owner–manager agency conflict. These owner–manager agency conflicts are considered to be prevalent in private family firms when ownership and control are separated, that is, when a nonfamily CEO (without ownership) leads the firm. But the question remains whether there also exist agency problems when ownership and control are coupled (when a family owner-manager leads the firm) in the context of <italic>private family firms</italic>. There are two opposing views regarding this question.</p>
<p>According to classical agency theorists, Agency Problem I is not a major problem in private family firms because family involvement in both ownership and management should align the interests of owners and managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894486512454731">Fama &amp; Jensen, 1983</xref>). The effects of concentrated ownership and owner-management will lead to a minimized, or even zero, level of agency costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894486512454731">Ang, Cole, &amp; Lin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0894486512454731">Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976</xref>). Several authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894486512454731">R. C. Anderson, Mansi, &amp; Reeb, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894486512454731">Ang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894486512454731">Fama &amp; Jensen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0894486512454731">Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976</xref>) argue that family firms are the most efficient form of organizational governance, because the concentrated ownership that characterizes private family firms implies several agency benefits.</p>
<p>Possible acts of self-interest will be tempered by kinship and by altruism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0894486512454731">Schulze, Lubatkin, &amp; Dino, 2003a</xref>). Kinship tempers the acts of self-interest with feelings of loyalty and commitment to the firm and the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0894486512454731">Schulze et al., 2003a</xref>). Altruism reduces information asymmetry (the basis of many agency problems) by increasing the cooperation and communication within the family firm (“the bright side of altruism;” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894486512454731">Daily &amp; Dollinger, 1992</xref>). Additionally, several studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512454731">Karra, Tracey, &amp; Phillips, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0894486512454731">Lubatkin et al., 2005</xref>) suggest that altruism especially reduces agency costs in the early stages of family business. Thus, although family members might be self-interested, this does not mean that they are selfish because feelings of altruism will motivate the family agent to work in the best interest of the owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894486512454731">Fiegener, 2010</xref>) and other family members. The interdependence among family agents is an important agency benefit as well because their welfare is directly linked to firm performance through their employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0894486512454731">Schulze et al., 2003b</xref>). These benefits, together with family ties, loyalty, and stability, can be effective in lengthening the horizons of decision making and in providing incentives for efficient investments in family firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0894486512454731">James, 1999</xref>). Especially privately held family firms are expected to have a long-term perspective since they are not “haunted by quarterly results” and do not have to worry about hostile takeovers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894486512454731">Devries, 1993</xref>). In sum, family control is a potential agency cost-reducing mechanism in itself.</p>
<p>This minimum (or absence) of agency costs will imply that performance-based pay is not needed in privately held family firms, as the main goal of pay-for-performance is to reduce the firm’s agency costs. Moreover, shareholders in private family firms have both the incentive (high ownership concentration) and the opportunity (better access to the CEO) to monitor the CEO more closely than public firm shareholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894486512454731">Fama &amp; Jensen, 1983</xref>). This may further reduce the need to make CEO pay dependent on firm performance.</p>
<p>In the last decennium, however, literature argues that private family firms are anything but immune to <italic>agency problems</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894486512454731">Burkart, Panunzi, &amp; Shleifer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0894486512454731">Lubatkin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0894486512454731">Schulze et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486512454731">Schulze et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0894486512454731">Sharma, 2004</xref>). These studies focus on the negative effects of concentrated (family) ownership and owner-management. The agency costs in private family firms are primarily engendered by altruism and self-control problems. Although <italic>altruism</italic> may be an advantage of family ownership, it does not make a perfect agent of a manager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0894486512454731">Jensen, 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0894486512454731">Lubatkin et al. (2005)</xref> state that parental altruism, combined with private ownership and owner-management, negatively influences the ability of the owner-manager to exercise self-control. Indeed, family logic often overrides business reason (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894486512454731">Devries, 1993</xref>) because families have noneconomic goals as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512454731">Karra et al., 2006</xref>). Altruism can thus engender agency costs generated by, for example, <italic>moral hazard</italic>, which includes free riding, shirking, or consuming perquisites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486512454731">Karra et al., 2006</xref>); by <italic>adverse selection</italic> in the labor market, for example, by hiring family members with insufficient qualifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894486512454731">Chrisman, Chua, &amp; Litz, 2004</xref>); or by <italic>hold-up</italic>, when owner-managers use their power to force agents to accept changes that are not in their best interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0894486512454731">Lubatkin et al., 2005</xref>). For example, a CEO’s altruistic efforts to improve the welfare of his or her relatives via involvement in the family firm can also be considered as an expression of self-interest that may counter the economic interests of the (other) family owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894486512454731">Fiegener, 2010</xref>). Moreover, the emotions associated with family ties may reduce the monitoring effectiveness in family firms as the family status of executives will distort the judgments on the appropriateness of their actions and decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0894486512454731">Gomez-Mejia, Nunez-Nickel, &amp; Gutierrez, 2001</xref>). As such, not only nonfamily managers but also family executives may behave as agents in private family firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894486512454731">Chrisman et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Whereas traditional agency theorists would argue that family agents in private family firms do not need performance-based pay because they do not face any (or very little) agency costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0894486512454731">Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976</xref>), recent theory and evidence thus states that private family firms <italic>do</italic> face agency costs but of a different kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0894486512454731">Lubatkin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0894486512454731">Schulze et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486512454731">Schulze et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0894486512454731">Sharma, 2004</xref>). For example, parental altruism makes it very difficult for family agents to take the necessary disciplining actions in reaction to potential free riding behavior of other family members. A possible solution to this kind of agency problems is “to tie a portion of the family agent’s wage to outcomes that can be effectively monitored, such as firm performance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486512454731">Schulze et al., 2001</xref>, p. 103). Performance-based pay to family agents then serves a double purpose: (a) it eases the risk of moral hazard behavior of these family agents and (b) it reduces the probability that the agent will take altruistic, noneconomic efforts that threaten his or her own welfare as well as those around him or her (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486512454731">Schulze et al., 2001</xref>). Consequently, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486512454731">Schulze et al. (2001)</xref>, we posit that pay-for-performance is an important instrument to mitigate different kinds of agency problems in private family firms, not only when ownership and control are separated but also when ownership and control are coupled. Therefore, we postulate the following:</p>

<title>The Moderating Role of Ownership and Management on the Pay-for-Performance Relation</title>
<p>Previous empirical studies on the influence of firm performance on managerial pay in private (family) firms provide inconsistent results. On the one hand, some authors find evidence supporting optimal contracting theory, in that firm performance has a substantial effect on managerial salary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894486512454731">Cooley, 1979</xref>) or bonus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894486512454731">Barkema &amp; Pennings, 1998</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486512454731">Schulze et al. (2001)</xref> find that a large percentage of the private family firms in their sample offer pay incentives (in the form of cash bonuses) to their agents. Other findings are in contrast to predictions of this theory and find no relation whatsoever between firm performance and CEO pay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894486512454731">Banghøj et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0894486512454731">Ke et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>However, these studies typically do not take into account the heterogeneity of family firms (with the exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486512454731">Schulze et al., 2001</xref>, who differentiate between family and nonfamily agents). Yet research has highlighted that (private) family firms may have various goals, resources, and needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0894486512454731">Habbershon et al., 2003</xref>) as well as diverse ownership and management structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894486512454731">Chrisman, Chua, &amp; Sharma, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0894486512454731">Westhead &amp; Howorth, 2007</xref>). As a result, there seems to be a growing consensus that private family firms should be treated as a heterogeneous entity. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894486512454731">Finkelstein et al. (2009)</xref>, it is therefore much more productive to investigate <italic>the conditions or characteristics under which performance affects compensation</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894486512454731">Filatotchev and Allcock (2010)</xref> confirm this view by mentioning that there is too little attention to the distinct contexts in which firms are embedded. Evidence from meta-analyses by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0894486512454731">Tosi et al. (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0894486512454731">van Essen et al. (2012)</xref> indicate that moderator variables may affect the relationship between performance and total pay.</p>
<p>Since private family firms cannot be seen as a homogeneous group, they will not all face the same type and amount of agency costs. As a result, we must acknowledge this heterogeneity when investigating CEO pay-for-performance in private family firms. After all, the need and impact of performance-related pay will be contingent on the amount and type of agency costs. We distinguish several types of family firms, based on different ownership and management structures, in order to take into account this heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894486512454731">Figure 1</xref>). Hence, we examine whether the pay-for-performance relation depends (a) on the ownership structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894486512454731">Balkin &amp; Gomez-Mejia, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0894486512454731">Lawler, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0894486512454731">Lubatkin et al., 2005</xref>), (b) on the generational stage of the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0894486512454731">Gersick, Davis, Hampton, &amp; Lansberg, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0894486512454731">Lubatkin et al., 2005</xref>), and (3) on whether the CEO is a family member or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0894486512454731">Gomez-Mejia, Larraza-Kintana, &amp; Makri, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0894486512454731">McConaughy, 2000</xref>). With this subdivision, we also respond to a call of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894486512454731">Chrisman et al. (2007)</xref> for further research that investigates whether the pay-for-performance relation in private family firms depends on the level and types of family involvement.</p>

<p>Ownership dispersion has a different effect on (a) the “traditional” agency costs related with diverging interests between the controlling owner and other owners and (b) agency costs associated with self-control and parental altruism. When there is a sole owner, the former agency costs are expected to be minimal whereas the latter could be significant. When ownership slightly disperses, that is, when the family owner is being accompanied by some owners of the same nuclear family, the net outcome of these two agency effects does not materially change: The probability of agency problems of self-control and parental altruism remains significant and the risk of agency problems of diverging conflicts of interest remains rather minimal. But as ownership further disperses, many of the altruistic features that characterize a private family firm including its “dark agency effects” will gradually disappear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0894486512454731">Lubatkin et al., 2005</xref>). As such, ownership dispersion is expected to decrease agency costs related with parental altruism. However, this decreasing effect in agency costs may be weakened by potential emerging conflicts of interest between controlling owners and minority shareholders. Indeed, further ownership dispersion beyond the nuclear family could change the nature of altruism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0894486512454731">Lubatkin et al., 2005</xref>) and may drive a wedge between controlling owners and other family owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0894486512454731">Schulze et al., 2003a</xref>). Furthermore, as the number of owners increases, the existence of passive family shareholders becomes more likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0894486512454731">Jaffe &amp; Lane, 2004</xref>). Consequently, conflicts of interest between controlling owners and these passive family shareholders could arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0894486512454731">Miller &amp; Le Breton-Miller, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We argue that, contrary to agency problems of self-control and parental altruism (e.g., hiring incompetent relatives, allowing free riding), the potential owner–owner agency conflicts could be easily dealt with by family governance (e.g., family council) and corporate governance mechanisms (e.g., controlling board of directors with family shareholders represented). However, pay-for-performance could be used to solve agency problems related to parental altruism and self-control. Therefore, we propose that ownership dispersion will have a diminishing effect on agency costs related to parental altruism and self-control in privately held family firms. Therefore, we posit that performance-based pay is a more important instrument when agency costs associated with self-control and parental altruism are highest in private family firms, that is, when family ownership is more concentrated. Or, stated otherwise:</p>
<list id="list2-0894486512454731" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Ownership dispersion will moderate the relationship between firm performance and CEO compensation in such a way that firm performance will have a less positive effect on CEO compensation when ownership disperses.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although the former hypothesis focuses on the division of ownership, no matter what stage the firm is situated in, ownership dispersion is often assumed to be entangled with the generational stage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0894486512454731">Gersick et al. (1997)</xref> distinguish three broad stages of ownership across generations: (a) the controlling-owner stage in which the founder also exercises control rights, (b) a sibling partnership in which ownership is in hands of several members of a single generation, and (c) a cousin consortium in which ownership is further fractionalized when it is passed on to third and later generations.</p>
<p>As a consequence of parental altruism, the controlling-owner stage may suffer from potential moral hazard and free riding behavior of family members on the controlling owner’s equity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0894486512454731">Schulze et al., 2003b</xref>). Although sibling partnerships are not immune for this kind of agency problems, more extended sibling partnerships are expected to anticipate the dysfunctional effects of altruism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0894486512454731">Lubatkin et al., 2005</xref>). We expect that these dysfunctional effects will further disappear in the cousin consortium stage because more outside family members (not employed by the firm) become shareholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0894486512454731">Jaffe &amp; Lane, 2004</xref>) and, hence, behave more as rational diversified investors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0894486512454731">Schulze et al., 2003a</xref>). Moreover, many of the altruistic attributes, which make family firms theoretically distinct, will disappear during the cousin consortium stage. Hence, and in line with the previous hypothesis, we posit that since agency costs associated with self-control and parental altruism will be higher in the controlling-owner stage than in later generational stages (sibling partnership and cousin consortium stage), we expect the relation between firm performance and CEO compensation to be stronger in the controlling-owner stage than in later generational stages. Or, stated differently:</p>
<list id="list3-0894486512454731" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Generational stage will moderate the relationship between firm performance and CEO compensation in such a way that firm performance will have a less positive effect on CEO compensation in later generational stages compared to the controlling-owner stage.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The relationship between firm performance and CEO compensation might also depend on the CEO’s relation with the controlling family, that is, whether the CEO is a member of the controlling family or a nonfamily CEO. In case of a <italic>family CEO</italic>, traditional agency theory proposes that there is no need for performance-based pay because their interests are aligned to those of the owners and because their personal wealth is already closely tied to the value of the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0894486512454731">Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0894486512454731">Schulze et al., 2003a</xref>). This is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0894486512454731">McConaughy (2000)</xref> refers to as the “family control incentive alignment hypothesis”: family CEOs derive superior incentives for maximizing firm value and therefore have less need for incentive compensation to align their interests with the firm than do nonfamily CEOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0894486512454731">Gomez-Mejia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0894486512454731">McConaughy, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet surveys by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486512454731">Schulze et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894486512454731">Chrisman et al. (2007)</xref> reveal that private family firms’ managers are partly rewarded in the form of cash bonuses. There are several reasons why this may occur. First, contrary to traditional agency theory, private family firms do face significant agency costs associated with altruism (hold-up, adverse selection) and issues of self-control. Because family CEOs have noneconomic goals as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486512454731">Schulze et al., 2001</xref>), they may behave suboptimal in terms of firm performance. For example, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0894486512454731">Gomez-Mejia, Haynes, Nunez-Nickel, Jacobson, and Moyano-Fuentes (2007)</xref>, family managers are willing to accept a significant risk to their performance in order to avoid losses of their socioemotional wealth. Hence, it is likely that the other family shareholders will prefer that a portion of the CEO’s salary will be tied to firm performance in order to reduce the possible negative effects on firm performance. Second, including firm performance in the family CEO’s compensation contract will give a sign of professional management and increases the firm’s attractiveness toward banks, lenders of federal sources, and perhaps individual investors or private equity funds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894486512454731">Chrisman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0894486512454731">McConaughy, 2000</xref>). Finally, even though family CEOs are likely to have a great deal of wealth through share ownership compared to their compensation, performance-based pay might have a sizable impact on the cash available for them to spend, given the illiquidity of their shares (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0894486512454731">McConaughy, 2000</xref>). Therefore, performance-based pay may be a relevant incentive mechanism for the family CEO.</p>
<p>In case of a <italic>nonfamily CEO</italic>, significant agency costs are expected to prevail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0894486512454731">Lubatkin et al., 2005</xref>). After all, as a nonfamily CEO generally has no (or very low) ownership, his personal wealth is not essentially tied to firm value. The owners of the firm will therefore try to ensure that the nonfamily CEO makes effort to maximize firm value and will therefore reward him with performance-based compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0894486512454731">McConaughy, 2000</xref>). A possibility to minimize this owner–manager conflict of interest is thus via an “optimal contract,” which ties CEO compensation to firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894486512454731">Jensen &amp; Murphy, 1990</xref>). Nonfamily CEOs, as any other agents, are expected to be risk-averse, and one might thus expect them not to be keen on performance-related pay. However, they will have less influence on the pay-setting process compared with family CEOs because they are expected to have less power in the firm and will typically be less entrenched in their position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0894486512454731">Shleifer &amp; Vishny, 1997</xref>). Moreover, nonfamily CEOs might not necessarily be opposed to receiving performance-related pay because they typically have a short-term focus. After all, a nonfamily CEO will not necessarily stay in the family firm for the rest of his or her career. Therefore, it is important for him or her to be able to leave the firm with a successful track record and thus with results of strong short-term performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894486512454731">Block, 2011</xref>). Therefore, linking compensation with short-term firm performance will be in line with their short-term focus.</p>
<p>In conclusion, both private family firms with a family CEO as well as those with a nonfamily CEO have various motives to offer their CEO performance-based compensation. However, the strength of the pay-for-performance relationship is not expected to be similar for both CEO types. While nonfamily CEOs mainly have a short-term focus, family CEOs usually have a longer-term focus because family ties, loyalty, and stability will lengthen their horizon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0894486512454731">James, 1999</xref>). As shorter CEO horizons are found to be related with higher agency costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894486512454731">Antia, Pantzalis, &amp; Park, 2010</xref>), we expect the relation between short-term firm performance and CEO compensation to be weaker for family CEOs, compared with nonfamily CEOs. Thus,</p>

<sec id="section6-0894486512454731">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>This study draws on data of the 2003 SSBF, which is sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board. This survey provides detailed information on more than 4,000 private, nonfinancial, nonagricultural, small (fewer than 500 employees) businesses in the U.S. economy. The sample was designed to represent the population of about five million small privately held U.S. firms in 2003. The SSBF database provides us with the necessary information on family firms, including performance, compensation, ownership, and management characteristics.</p>
<p>We impose several restrictions on the database. We exclude all firms that do not fit our definition of a private family firm, being “a non-publicly traded firm which is exclusively (100%) owned by members of the same family (where family refers to spouses, parents/guardians, brothers, sisters, or close relatives).” Although there exists a lot of different opinions about what exactly defines a family firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894486512454731">Chua, Chrisman, &amp; Sharma, 1999</xref>), this definition suits the purpose of our study. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894486512454731">Astrachan, Klein, and Smyrnios (2002)</xref>, the employed definition of a family firm should measure what it intends to measure and assists in providing reliable research results. By using this definition, we are able to keep our focus on those firms that are entirely owned by members of the same nuclear family. As a result, there are no nonfamily shareholders who can influence the firm’s compensation policy (e.g., individual investors, venture capitalists, etc.). This is exactly the case where agency theory expects agency costs (and thus, the pay-for- performance relationship) to be irrelevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0894486512454731">Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976</xref>), which we question. In conclusion, this definition provides us with the opportunity to test whether there is a pay-for-performance relationship and, more specifically, for which specific types of family firms there is a pay-for-performance relationship. Next, we exclude all proprietorships, partnerships, and S-corporations from our analyses, because we want to compare firms of similar organizational form<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0894486512454731">3</xref></sup> in order to avoid possible bias in both the compensation and performance measures. Thus, our final sample entirely consists of C-corporations. Finally, we exclude firms with missing data, because they did not know or refused to disclose the information needed to obtain our variables of interest. These restrictions leave us with a final sample of data on 529 privately held U.S. family firms.</p>

<p>Our baseline hypothesis tests whether CEO compensation is related to firm performance. A high pay-for- performance sensitivity in an econometric model means that total compensation contracts contain high-powered incentives (e.g., variable pay incentives such as cash bonuses) and therefore are often called high-powered total compensation contracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0894486512454731">Li &amp; Srinivasan, 2011</xref>). For example, when all total compensation contracts in a sample only contain fixed salary, there will be probably a weak or even no significant relationship between total compensation and performance. Thus, when a CEO compensation contract contains a high percentage of variable pay, there will be a strong statistical relationship between total compensation and firm performance (<italic>ROA</italic>), revealing the existence of high-powered compensation contracts.</p>
<p>The subsequent hypothesis examine whether this relation is moderated by the ownership and management characteristics of the firm (number of owners, generational stage, and CEO family status). Therefore, interaction terms <italic>Owners * ROA, Generation * ROA</italic>, and <italic>FamilyCEO * ROA</italic> are used to test, respectively, Hypothesis 2 (H2), Hypothesis 3 (H3), and Hypothesis 4 (H4). This yields the following four regression models:</p>

<p>Although the objective of our study is to investigate the impact of firm performance on CEO compensation, firm performance itself can also be dependent on CEO compensation. According to agency theory, a pay-for-performance contract might also lead to improved firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0894486512454731">Thach &amp; Kidwell, 2009</xref>). However, most previous research only considered the impact of performance on pay, without considering the simultaneous effect of pay on performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894486512454731">M. C. Anderson, Banker, &amp; Ravindran, 2000</xref>). Yet ignoring this simultaneous relationship might cause simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions to lead to biased and inconsistent coefficients because <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> (the regressor) and <italic>u</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> (the error term) are correlated and OLS picks up both forwards and backwards effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894486512454731">M. C. Anderson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486512454731">Bascle, 2008</xref>). Simultaneous causality is a form of endogeneity that is common in accounting and finance research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894486512454731">Chenhall &amp; Moers, 2007</xref>) and can be adequately addressed by applying instrumental variable methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486512454731">Bascle, 2008</xref>). Specifically, instrumental variables methods focus on the variations in <italic>X</italic> that are uncorrelated with the error term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486512454731">Bascle, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>First, we need to find valid instruments in order to produce consistent and efficient estimators. That is: the instruments should be relevant and exogenous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486512454731">Bascle, 2008</xref>). To instrument for “ROA,” we used sales growth and leverage, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894486512454731">Banghøj et al. (2010)</xref>. We argue that sales growth is a good instrument for ROA in private family firms, as it is often used as a proxy for firm performance and positively correlated with ROA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0894486512454731">Maury, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0894486512454731">Schulze et al., 2003</xref>). Intuitively, it is very unlikely that a CEO’s present pay can influence the firm’s past sales growth and therefore we believe this instrument is valid. We added “leverage” as an instrument because leverage is often indicated to as an important determinant of ROA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894486512454731">Campello, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0894486512454731">Maury, 2006</xref>). Again, we do not expect a CEO’s pay to influence the firm’s leverage. Second, we performed a Hausman test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894486512454731">Cruz and Moreira, 2005</xref>), which confirmed our theoretical predictions that there is indeed an endogeneity issue with the pay–performance relation (<italic>p</italic> value of .008) and thus that our hypotheses should be tested via an instrumental variables method. To produce consistent and efficient estimators, instrumental variables estimation requires that the relevance and exogeneity conditions are fulfilled. The results from the 2SLS regression indicate that our instruments are relevant (the Kleibergen-Paap LM statistic of 5.18 with a <italic>p</italic> value of .07) and exogenous (the Hansen <italic>J</italic> statistic of .30 with a <italic>p</italic> value of .58). Yet the low first-stage <italic>F</italic>-statistic (2.85) shows that our instruments have relatively weak explanatory power in the first-stage regression. 2SLS with weak instruments can suffer from finite sample bias and thus yield misleading estimates of statistical significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894486512454731">L. M. Cruz &amp; Moreira, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0894486512454731">Hahn &amp; Hausman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0894486512454731">Murray, 2006</xref>). Therefore, we use Fuller’s modified LIML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0894486512454731">Fuller, 1977</xref>), which is robust to weak instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486512454731">Bascle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0894486512454731">Stock &amp; Yogo, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Dependent variable</title>
<p><italic>CEO compensation</italic> is described in the SSBF questionnaire as total CEO compensation. This measure contains one figure that comprises both base salary and cash bonuses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0894486512454731">4</xref></sup> This dependent variable is also in line with the majority of previous studies investigating the pay-for-performance relation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894486512454731">Capezio, Shields, &amp; O’Donnell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0894486512454731">Iyengar, Williams, &amp; Zampelli, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0894486512454731">Ke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0894486512454731">Ozkan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0894486512454731">Tosi et al., 2000</xref>). For example, in their meta-analysis of 137 CEO pay studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0894486512454731">Tosi et al. (2000)</xref> conclude that total CEO compensation was used as a dependent variable to measure the pay-for-performance relation when available. Additionally, the use of total CEO compensation seems to be fully justified in the particular case of private family firms since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0894486512454731">Schulze et al. (2003</xref>, p. 478) define pay incentives as “tied transfers that make a portion of an agent’s pay contingent upon some performance objective, usually firm performance.” As explained in the beginning of this Research Design section, it is unnecessary to distinguish the portion of pay that may be incentive based to test the pay-for-performance relationship, as high-powered compensation contracts (contracts with a significant part of variable pay) will be displayed by a strong statistical relationship between total CEO compensation and firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0894486512454731">Li &amp; Srinivasan, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894486512454731">Conyon (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0894486512454731">Ke et al. (1999)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894486512454731">Cheng and Firth (2006)</xref>, we take the logarithm of the CEO compensation variable to reduce the impact of outliers. Additionally, the log transformation is the most common way to correct for nonnormality, especially when the variable has a positive skewness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894486512454731">Hair, Anderson, Tatham, &amp; Black, 2006</xref>), which is the case for our variable CEO compensation (<italic>CEOcomp</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0894486512454731">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p><italic>Firm performance</italic> is operationalized through the accounting return measure “return on assets” (<italic>ROA</italic>, income after expenses excluding taxes divided by total assets) because the majority of studies investigating the pay-for-performance relation use ROA as the measure of firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894486512454731">Banghøj et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894486512454731">Basu, Hwang, Mitsudome, &amp; Weintrop, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894486512454731">Capezio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894486512454731">Finkelstein &amp; Boyd, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0894486512454731">Gomez-Mejia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0894486512454731">He, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894486512454731">Jensen &amp; Murphy, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0894486512454731">Ke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0894486512454731">Werner &amp; Tosi, 1995</xref>). Using <italic>assets</italic> in the denominator makes this measurement less influenced by poor or outstanding performance than other denominators such as, for example, <italic>sales</italic>. This is because sales tend to decrease (increase) when firms are performing poorly (outstanding), which will make return on sales an underestimation (overestimation) of firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0894486512454731">Harris &amp; Helfat, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Ownership structure</italic> is measured by the variable <italic>Owners</italic>, which indicates the number of shareholders. We use the natural logarithm of the number of owners to account for the nonlinear effect of an increasing number of owners. We expect that the relationship is stronger at smaller values of the variable “number of owners,” for example, increasing the number of owners from 1 owner to 2 owners is expected to have a stronger effect than increasing the number of owners from 9 to 10.</p>
<p><italic>Family CEO</italic> is operationalized by the dummy variable <italic>FamilyCEO</italic>, which equals one if the CEO is a member of the controlling family and zero if the firm has a nonfamily CEO. As per definition, <italic>family member</italic> refers to spouse, parent/guardian, brother, sister, or close relative. As the database defines a family firm as a firm that is exclusively owned by members of one family, nonfamily CEOs thus have no ownership share in the firm.</p>
<p>The <italic>generational stage</italic> is measured by a variable indicating whether the family firm was established by the current ownership, purchased, inherited, or acquired as a gift. We classify this variable into two groups to obtain a dummy variable that proxies for <italic>Generation</italic>. This dummy equals one for firms that are in a later generational stage (inherited or acquired as a gift), whereas the dummy equals zero if the firm can be classified as a controlling-owner firm (established or purchased by the current owners).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0894486512454731">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>Consistent with prior studies, we include several control variables in our model to account for other factors that might affect CEO compensation (see reviews of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894486512454731">Finkelstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0894486512454731">Gomez-Mejia &amp; Wiseman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0894486512454731">Tosi et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Firm size</italic> has proven to be of large impact on CEO compensation. Results of a meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0894486512454731">Tosi et al. (2000)</xref> even show that firm size accounts for more than 40% of the variance in total CEO compensation. Larger firms are assumed to require more talented and costly management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0894486512454731">Rosen, 1982</xref>), and thus several authors document that larger firms pay their executives more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894486512454731">Baker, Jensen, &amp; Murphy, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894486512454731">Banghøj et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894486512454731">Basu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0894486512454731">Gomez-Mejia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0894486512454731">Ke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0894486512454731">Young &amp; Tsai, 2008</xref>). We use the natural logarithm of the total number of employees (<italic>Totemp</italic>) as a proxy for firm size, as this measure is less likely to suffer from collinearity problems than “total sales,” which is often used in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894486512454731">Brunello, Graziano, &amp; Parigi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894486512454731">Ciscel &amp; Carroll, 1980</xref>). Analogous to the studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0894486512454731">Schulze et al. (2003a)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0894486512454731">Wasserman (2006)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0894486512454731">He (2008)</xref>, we add a variable that contains information on <italic>firm age</italic>. We take the natural logarithm to reduce heteroscedasticity concerns (<italic>Firmage</italic>). To control for possible <italic>industry</italic> effects, we add seven dummy variables based on the firm’s SIC code (mining and construction; manufacturing; transportation and public utilities; wholesale trade; retail trade; insurance and real estate; and services). Firms with a high <italic>credit risk</italic> ranking may be monitored more by financial institutions. As this may impact the level of their compensation and the pay-for-performance sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894486512454731">Brunello et al., 2001</xref>), we include three dummy variables that are based on the Dun &amp; Bradstreet credit score: high credit risk (score 0-25), moderate credit risk (score 26-75), and low credit risk (score 76-100).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0894486512454731">5</xref></sup> We also need to control for the <italic>CEO’s job complexity</italic>, as higher managerial talent is required when a firm’s CEO has to make more complex decisions. According to the managerial talent hypothesis, higher quality management will have higher compensation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0894486512454731">Finkelstein &amp; Hambrick, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0894486512454731">Rosen, 1982</xref>). Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0894486512454731">Gomez-Mejia, Tosi, and Hinkin (1987)</xref> note that complexity is a potentially important omitted variable in their analysis of CEO compensation. In an attempt to capture additional effects of a CEO’s job complexity that are not already included in the variable measuring firm size, we add a variable <italic>Sites</italic> that measures the number of sites, offices, plants, or stores the firm has.</p>

<p>Although the Pearson correlation matrix (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0894486512454731">Table 2</xref>) shows no high correlations among the variables, we checked for the possibility of multicollinearity to ensure that our results are not affected by it.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0894486512454731">Table 3</xref> reports Fuller’s LIML estimations for the impact of firm performance (ROA) on CEO compensation, moderated by the investigated ownership and management characteristics. Robust standard errors are calculated in order to correct for heteroscedasticity. The coefficient of determination, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>, is not reported because it has no real meaning in models using instruments and it can even be misleading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0894486512454731">Wooldridge, 2002</xref>). Moreira’s CLR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0894486512454731">Moreira, 2003</xref>) is considered to be the test of choice when checking the validity of a Fuller’s LIML regression, because it gets around the weak instruments problem by relying on a conditional approach. Contrary to the other estimators, Moreira’s CLR critical values used to yield a correct significance level are not constant, but conditioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486512454731">Bascle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0894486512454731">Murray, 2006</xref>). By using this approach, it draws correct inferences, independent of the strength of the instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894486512454731">Andrews, Moreira, &amp; Stock, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486512454731">Bascle, 2008</xref>). The discrepancies of Moreira’s CLR estimators and those obtained by Fuller’s LIML are very reasonable, and thus there is no indication of a finite-sample bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0894486512454731">Yogo, 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>Models 2, 3, and 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0894486512454731">Table 3</xref> report the interaction models that are used to test the impact of <italic>Owners, Generation</italic>, and <italic>Family CEO</italic> on the pay-for- performance relationship. Even though the use of interaction models is quite common in different disciplines of research (such as in finance and management literature), the interpretation of these models differs in an important way from linear additive models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894486512454731">Brambor et al., 2006</xref>). In an interactive model, the effect of an independent variable <italic>X</italic> on the dependent variable <italic>Y</italic> is not any single constant. The effect depends on the coefficients (betas) of the independent variable <italic>X</italic> and of the interaction term <italic>XZ</italic>, as well as on the value of the moderating variable <italic>Z.</italic> For example, the marginal effect of <italic>X</italic> in the following interaction model:</p>

<p>So the effect of <italic>X</italic> on <italic>Y</italic> depends on the value of the conditioning variable <italic>Z</italic>. We cannot infer whether <italic>X</italic> has a meaningful conditional effect on <italic>Y</italic> from the magnitude and significance of the coefficient on the interaction term. For certain relevant values of <italic>Z</italic> (the moderating variable), the marginal effect of <italic>X</italic> on <italic>Y</italic> can be significant even if the coefficient on the interaction term is insignificant. Thus, to correctly interpret these combined effects, the relevant elements of the variance–covariance matrix can be used to recalculate the standard errors, which are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0894486512454731">Table 4</xref> and represented graphically in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0894486512454731">appendix</xref>. By doing so, we obtain insight into these substantively meaningful marginal effects.

<p>All four models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0894486512454731">Table 3</xref> strongly support the positive impact of performance (ROA) on CEO compensation (Hypothesis 1). This stands in stark contrast with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0894486512454731">Ke et al. (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894486512454731">Banghøj et al. (2010)</xref>, who did not find any significant relationship between ROA and CEO compensation for their sample of 43 private U.S. insurance companies and 125 private Danish companies, respectively. It confirms, however, results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894486512454731">Barkema and Pennings (1998)</xref>, who found a strong positive impact of firm profitability on executive compensation (more specifically, bonus) for a sample of 143 Dutch private firms. Our results, which are based on a large sample that is representative for U.S. private family firms, are also in line with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486512454731">Schulze et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894486512454731">Chrisman et al. (2007)</xref>, who find that private family firms make significant use of agency cost control mechanisms, such as incentive compensation. In sum, contrary to the predictions of agency theory, which assumes that the agency costs in private family firms will approach zero, our results suggest that these firms do use explicit management compensation contracts with objective performance-based measurements as a governance mechanism.</p>
<p>Model 2 shows the regression results for Hypothesis 2, which predicts a weaker influence of firm performance on CEO compensation as ownership becomes more dispersed. Therefore, we include the interaction variable <italic>Owners * ROA.</italic> To infer whether the number of owners has a meaningful conditional effect on the pay-for-performance relationship, we look at the marginal effects and standard errors. We calculate the marginal effects by taking into account the relevant elements of the variance–covariance matrix and recalculate the standard errors as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894486512454731">Brambor et al. (2006)</xref>. With respect to Hypothesis 2, we present the results of the calculation of these marginal effects in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0894486512454731">Table 4</xref> (Panel A). A graphical representation can be found in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0894486512454731">appendix</xref>.</p>
<p>Panel A in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0894486512454731">Table 4</xref> and the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0894486512454731">appendix</xref> show that the positive relationship between ROA and CEO compensation is only significant if the number of owners varies from 1 to 2. For 3 or more owners, the moderating effect becomes nonsignificant. We thus find support for Hypothesis 2, indicating that concentrated ownership leads to a stronger pay-for-performance relation in private family firms. This result implies that, indeed, performance-based pay might be a more important instrument when agency costs associated with self-control and parental altruism are highest in private family firms (i.e., when family ownership is more concentrated).</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3, discussing the moderating influence of the generational stage, is tested using the interaction variable <italic>Generation * ROA.</italic> Analogous to the method used to interpret the results of Hypothesis 2, we interpret the interaction coefficient by looking at the marginal effects and recalculating the standard errors (displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0894486512454731">Table 4</xref> [Panel B] and graphically in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0894486512454731">appendix</xref>). Panel B in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0894486512454731">Table 4</xref> shows that the coefficient of the controlling-owner stage is positive and significant. This result reveals, consistent with our Hypothesis 3, that the positive relationship between performance and CEO compensation is only present in the controlling-owner stage. Our findings thus suggest that the higher agency costs associated with parental altruism in the controlling-owner stage will be mitigated by using pay-for-performance contracts.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 4 predicts that the positive pay-for- performance relation will be weaker for family CEOs, compared with nonfamily CEOs. After recalculating the standard errors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0894486512454731">Table 4</xref> [Panel C], and graphically represented in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0894486512454731">appendix</xref>), we can conclude that for both a family CEO and a nonfamily CEO, firm performance has a significant positive effect on CEO compensation. A test of differences of the beta coefficients in Panel C indicates that these beta coefficients are significantly different (<italic>p</italic> value of .03). Thus, although for both family and nonfamily CEOs performance has a significant positive effect on CEO pay, the pay-for-performance sensitivity for a family CEO is weaker than for a nonfamily CEO. This is in line with our Hypothesis 4, which argues that both private family firms with a family CEO as well as those with a nonfamily CEO have various motives to offer their CEO performance-based compensation. Our findings thus support the hypothesis that the effect of firm performance on CEO compensation will be less strong for family CEOs.</p>
<p>The control variable <italic>firm size</italic> has the expected positive (significant) effect on the level of CEO compensation. Firm age does not seem to have a significant effect on compensation. Firms with high credit risk pay their CEOs significantly less than firms with a low credit risk. Additionally, CEOs working in the transportation, public utilities, and retail trade industry earn significantly less than their colleagues in other industries. A CEO’s job complexity has a positive, but insignificant, effect on the compensation he receives.</p>

<title>Summary and Conclusions</title>
<p>This study addresses the effect of firm performance on CEO compensation in privately held family-controlled firms. Its central finding is that firm performance is positively related to CEO compensation in private family firms. This finding stands in contrast to predictions of traditional agency theory, which claim that pay-for-performance is irrelevant in the case of private family firms because of minimal (or zero) agency costs. Additionally, our study argues that the relationship between firm performance and CEO compensation is contingent on ownership and management configurations. We distinguish several types of private family firms, based on their ownership structure and management position. We find that the positive relationship between firm performance and CEO compensation is only significant if the number of owners is small. This result implies that performance-based pay is a more important instrument when agency costs associated with self-control and parental altruism are highest in private family firms, that is, when family ownership is more concentrated. In line with this finding, our results also suggest that the positive relationship between performance and CEO compensation is only present in the controlling-owner stage. Hence, the agency costs associated with parental altruism appear to be much lower in the later generational stages. Finally, we find that both family firms with a family CEO as well as those with a nonfamily CEO have various motives to offer their CEO performance-based compensation, but that the pay-for-performance sensitivity is stronger for nonfamily CEOs.</p>
<p>As such, our study makes an important contribution to the family business literature. It provides additional evidence that private family firms do indeed face agency costs, because they seem to use performance-based compensation for their CEOs. Although our article uses an agency framework to investigate the compensation decisions in private family firms, other theoretical models such as socioemotional wealth or distributive justice theory may offer some additional explanations for the use of performance-based incentive pay in family firms as well. For example, family firms may reward their family managers with performance-base incentive pay, because it may also increase the justice perceptions of the nonfamily managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894486512454731">Barnett &amp; Kellermanns, 2006</xref>). Additionally, our study also indicates that private family firms cannot be considered as a homogeneous group when studying compensation behavior, seen the significant moderating effects of ownership and management characteristics. For management consultants and HR managers, this study also provides some interesting implications as there is almost no other research available on the design of CEO compensation contracts in private family firms. For example, our study confirms the need to consider the ownership structure and the CEO family status of the private family firm, in order to design a CEO compensation package which is in line with the type of agency problems the firm faces.</p>
<p>There are a number of limitations associated with this study that should be acknowledged. First, our data are cross-sectional, so we cannot examine the factors that are associated with changes of the pay-for-performance over time. Next, our compensation measure is limited to reported CEO cash compensation. In some cases, the manager may also have earned some deferred or stock-based compensation. Fortunately, implications from previous work suggest that this limitation should not be a significant problem, as family firms place much less weight on stock-based compensation than do public or nonfamily firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894486512454731">Achleitner, Rapp, Schaller, &amp; Wolff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0894486512454731">Park, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the results of this study lead to some interesting avenues for future research in this domain. Our understanding about the effects of ownership and management characteristics on the relationship between performance and CEO compensation would be enhanced if they were generalized across different countries. Our results are quite promising and therefore call for larger and more detailed research.</p>

<p>In the context of private family firms, establishing a compensation policy is a difficult and sensitive matter because of the institutional overlap of family and business, which makes the development of a compensation policy even more complex than it already is in nonfamily firms. For example, deciding on the level and type of compensation contract of family members versus nonfamily members, and within the group of family members, can be a very sensitive matter. We refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0894486512454731">Lansberg (1983)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894486512454731">Aronoff and Ward (1993)</xref> for a more elaborate discussion on this topic.</p>

<p>The composition of a CEO’s pay package tends to be less sophisticated in privately held firms compared with publicly held firms, for example, because they generally make no use of stock options or other sophisticated financial instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894486512454731">Bitler et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>More specifically, the database contains executive compensation that is reported on IRS form on Form 1120(A) Line 12 (C-corporations). Additionally, the IRS requires corporations to include an estimate of any stock-based compensation as well, and this line should thus reflect “all” compensation paid to the CEO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894486512454731">Cavalluzzo &amp; Sankaraguruswamy, 2000</xref>). Our cash compensation measure is thus one figure that comprises base salary, bonus, and stock-based compensation.</p>

<p>The SSBF database contains six credit risk categories, based on the Dun &amp; Bradstreet credit score. As some categories contain few cases, we reestimated the regressions using four categories (in which we combined Categories 1 and 2, and 5 and 6) and using three categories (high-moderate-low). Regardless of the categorization used (6, 4, or 3 categories), the results stay the same.</p>
