<p>The period leading to the menopause can be a challenging time for some women as well as their partners. There is a raft of medical and non-medical publications on how this period affects women’s health and wellbeing but little about how these changes affect the relationship with husbands and partners.</p>
<p>The medical profession have for some time reported the benefits of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for women approaching the menopause and the positive effects HRT will have on bones, heart disease, cognitive function, effect on the libido and indeed in the reduction of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>At the same time the media and others counter-argue about the risks to women using HRT, especially in relation to breast cancer.</p>
<p>The author highlights the increasing number of women living beyond the menopause and this will add to the knowledge of woman’s experience.</p>
<p>Whilst the author has highlighted that the Western view of the menopause is largely biomedical, it is pleasing to note that they acknowledge the low incidence of vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes) associated with the menopause amongst Asian and Japanese women. The author did not advance any reason for this difference and it is possible that diet could be assumed to play a role?</p>
<p>The purpose of the study was to investigate whether a relationship exists between the perimenopause and menopausal symptoms and the marital/long-term relationship. The author reported from her practice the number of divorces in this age group and speculated that there may be a link.</p>
<p>The most interesting aspect of the study for me was the observation that married women had a greater loss of desire, felt angry and resentment towards their husband/partner whilst those in new relationships were more positive and experienced less symptoms associated with the menopause.</p>
<p>This is an important observation for clinicians who may continue to ‘treat’ women with hormones when in fact the relationship needs the treatment.</p>
<p>The paper highlights the importance of sexual intimacy within a relationship, almost regardless of the age of the woman. This aspect may not get the attention needed in some menopause clinics where the emphasis is on using ‘medication’ to address the issues.</p>
<p>It was clear from the study that husbands and partners were not as aware of the issues related to this period in their lives and this is not surprising as the menopause is frequently seen as a ‘woman’s’ issue and not to be discussed widely.</p>
<p>This study should add to the body of knowledge on the menopause and in particular the effects of this on sexual intimacy as well as the recommendation by the author to involve husbands and partners in discussions.</p>
