<abstract>
<p>Youth sports have been recognized as an arena for men to meet increased cultural expectations of being involved in their children’s lives. Indeed, in contrast to other child care practices, many men are eager to take part in their children’s organized sports. Drawing on an ethnographic study of middle-class families in the United States, this study examines how men juggle two contrasting cultural models of masculinity when fathering through sports—a performance-oriented orthodox masculinity that historically has been associated with sports and a caring, inclusive masculinity that promotes the nurturing of one’s children. Through a detailed analysis of how fathers’ sports involvement unfolds on the ground, we show how men, in order to portray themselves as “good” fathers, attempt to strike a balance between pushing their children to excel and supporting them regardless of their performance. We propose that although men may value inclusive masculinity when fathering through youth sports, at the same time they exercise orthodox masculinity in other domestic domains.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>While parent involvement has been associated historically with “intensive mothering” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891243212446370">Hays 1996</xref>), the rise of dual-earner families and women’s increased participation in the paid labor force has contributed to higher expectations that men take greater responsibility for childrearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891243212446370">Lupton and Barclay 1997</xref>). Even though “good” fatherhood is still connected to breadwinning, men are expected to be emotionally present and involved in their children’s everyday lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891243212446370">Marks and Palkovitz 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891243212446370">Townsend 2002</xref>). Many American middle-class men seem to adhere to these cultural notions of a caring fatherhood; they value their families more than their careers and expect to do their fair share of housework and child care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0891243212446370">Pleck and Masciadrelli 2003</xref>). Yet their contribution to child care is still small compared to that of mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891243212446370">Coltrane 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891243212446370">Gottzén 2011</xref>). One area, however, where men appear eager to assume responsibility is youth sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891243212446370">Root and Perry 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891243212446370">Shows and Gerstel 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Organized youth sports constitute a unique arena because of its contrasting inclusive and competitive aspects. On one hand, youth sports are supposed to be open to all children regardless of their athletic abilities. This is particularly true in the earlier years when being active and having fun are emphasized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891243212446370">Messner 2009</xref>). On the other hand, there are implicit and, with age, increasingly explicit expectations that children excel and succeed in their sports activities. This emphasis on children’s sport performance is part of a general belief among American middle-class parents that children must continuously improve and acquire new skills in order to be prepared for adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891243212446370">Gutiérrez, Izquierdo and Kremer-Sadlik 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891243212446370">Kremer-Sadlik, Izquierdo, and Fatigante 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891243212446370">Lareau 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The unique dual character of youth sports, we argue, influences the way in which men father their children through sports. The competitive aspects of sports participation, with its emphasis on performance and on exclusion of those not athletic or talented enough, render fathers more demanding and challenging. They desire to see their children getting playing time and contributing to the game. We associate this kind of fatherhood with what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891243212446370">Anderson (2009)</xref> calls “orthodox” masculine values, such as risk-taking, tolerance of pain and injury, and competiveness (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891243212446370">Coakley 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891243212446370">Connell 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891243212446370">Fine 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891243212446370">Messner 2002</xref>). The inclusive aspect of sports participation envisages men as supportive of their children regardless of their performance, acting on the belief that this reinforcement is important for their self-esteem and confidence. This nurturing, we suggest, is associated with a caring fatherhood and with an “inclusive” masculinity that is expressive and encouraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891243212446370">Anderson 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing on a large ethnographic study of middle-class families in the Los Angeles area, we examine men’s discourses about and during their children’s sports activities. We argue that in order to portray themselves as involved and morally “good,” fathers need to strike a balance between a performance-oriented and a caring fatherhood. In other words, we suggest that fathering through sports involves negotiation and juggling between two contrasting cultural models of masculinity, between orthodox and inclusive masculinities.</p>

<title>Fathering, Sports, and Masculinity</title>
<p>Critical research on men, masculinities, and fathers’ involvement in youth sports is limited. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891243212446370">Kay (2007)</xref> has noted, gender and masculinity scholars have studied men and sports but to a great extent neglected to examine how sports relates to fatherhood. However, recent research in the fields of family and leisure studies suggests that participation in youth sports is central to men’s parenting in three particular ways (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891243212446370">Coakley 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891243212446370">Harrington 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891243212446370">Kay 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891243212446370">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891243212446370">LaRossa 2005</xref>). First, fathers’ sports participation is often motivated by a desire to spend time with their children and is seen as one of the main venues for fathers to get involved in their children’s everyday lives (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891243212446370">Doucet and Merla 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891243212446370">Harrington 2006</xref>). Youth sports are often viewed as a fatherly “duty” that at times is prioritized above work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891243212446370">Kay 2007</xref>). For instance, findings from a study of shift workers in the automobile industry suggest that in order to have time to be involved in youth sports, fathers ask coworkers to cover absences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891243212446370">Root and Perry 2008</xref>). When not able to resolve this work–family conflict, sometimes these men prioritize attending their children’s games at the risk of losing their jobs.</p>
<p>Second, youth sports are central to fatherhood as a means for men to develop close relationships with their children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891243212446370">Harrington 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891243212446370">Jenkins 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891243212446370">Kay 2007</xref>). Sports offer fathers and children a common interest to talk about and do together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891243212446370">Harrington 2006</xref>). Sports interactions may extend to topics beyond the athletic activity that is unfolding, such as children’s emotional well-being and everyday conflicts and problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891243212446370">LaRossa 2005</xref>). Fathers use this time to bond with their children and develop friendships that will last into the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891243212446370">Kay 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, fathering through sports offers men opportunities to teach their children skills and values. This is closely connected to the notion that sports participation contributes positively to children’s physical, cognitive, and moral development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891243212446370">Eccles et al. 2003</xref>). Through involvement in formal and informal sports activities, fathers are seen as contributing to children’s socialization to values useful in adult life, such as competitiveness, self-esteem, responsibility, and collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891243212446370">Coakley 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891243212446370">Harrington 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891243212446370">Kremer-Sadlik, Izquierdo, and Fatigante 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891243212446370">Kremer-Sadlik and Kim 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that fathering through sports is a manifestation of a contemporary phenomenon of middle-class parenting in the U.S. among white and non-white middle-class families: the increased parental investment in children’s lives and the heightened concern with their academic and extracurricular success (Kremer-Sadlik and Gutierrez, in press; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891243212446370">Lareau 2003</xref>). This involvement is understood to reflect a parental anxiety regarding the ability of their children to become members of the middle class. The heart of this argument is in the perception that, unlike lower and upper social classes, where membership is almost guaranteed by birth, to gain membership in the middle class one has to invest years in education and training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891243212446370">Ehrenreich 1989</xref>). In other words, middle-class parents invest much time and effort in order to prepare their children for the long haul toward middle-class status. Yet, they still view their children as vulnerable and in need of protection. This dual role of parents as caring and protecting while at the same time pushing one’s child to achieve and succeed has become a common reality of middle-class mothers and fathers (Kremer-Sadlik and Gutierrez, in press). While both parents may experience angst and uncertainty about the best ways to raise their children to succeed, we argue in this article that for fathers this new reality is particularly challenging as it coincides with “new” perceptions of masculinity and increased expectations of “hands-on fathering” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891243212446370">Marks and Palkovitz 2004</xref>). Thus, in juggling their parenting roles, fathers also struggle with defining their ways of acting and being men. It is interesting to note that although men of different classes and ethnic backgrounds adhere to notions of father involvement, white middle-class men are less egalitarian than, for instance, Black (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891243212446370">Kamo and Cohen 1998</xref>) and working-class men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891243212446370">Shows and Gerstel 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The gendered aspect of paternal engagement in sports has received some attention; a number of studies suggest that fathers’ sports involvement is prioritized over participation in housework and child care (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891243212446370">Doucet and Merla 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891243212446370">Shows and Gerstel 2009</xref>), thus reproducing traditional gender identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891243212446370">Connell 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891243212446370">Fine 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891243212446370">Messner 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891243212446370">2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891243212446370">Shows and Gerstel (2009)</xref> demonstrate how white middle-class men tend to participate in “public” child care, such as sports activities, letting their wives assume the majority of domestic work. Involvement in youth sports offers men a way to parent while distancing themselves from feminine styles of caring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891243212446370">Doucet 2006</xref>). Gendered identities are further reinforced when comparing parents’ involvement in youth sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891243212446370">Chafetz and Kotarba 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891243212446370">Messner 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891243212446370">Messner (2009)</xref> observes that when both parents volunteer in their children’s sports organizations, fathers often volunteer as coaches or assistant coaches, while mothers often become “team moms,” which involves practical and traditionally female chores. The few mothers who become coaches volunteer in their younger children’s teams where “kids knowledge” rather than “sports knowledge” is more relevant. As a result, Messner argues, children are introduced to a gender-segregated world where it is considered natural that men are leaders, managing the sports activities, and mothers are responsible for the care work around these activities.</p>
<p>Fathers are drawn to their children’s sports activities in part because youth sports constitute a “comfort zone” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891243212446370">Harrington 2006</xref>), with practices that men are likely to be familiar with and master (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891243212446370">Coakley 2006</xref>). Men draw on their past experiences and transfer “sports skills” into the child-rearing domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891243212446370">Messner 2009</xref>). Further, sports have been shown to be a male-dominated and masculinist arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891243212446370">Coakley 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891243212446370">Connell 2000</xref>), where competitiveness, physical ability, homophobia, and other orthodox values are dominant (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891243212446370">Messner 2005</xref>). However, recent studies suggest that among young white, middle-class male athletes and students, orthodox values and practices are giving way to a more inclusive masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891243212446370">Anderson 2009</xref>). Young men today express softer and more emotional forms of masculinity, for instance, on college soccer teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891243212446370">Adams 2011</xref>), on rugby teams, in fraternities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891243212446370">Anderson 2009</xref>), and in high schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891243212446370">McCormack 2011</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891243212446370">Anderson (2009)</xref> associates this change with declining homophobia, anti-femininity, and heteronormativity. He introduces his inclusive masculinity theory in response to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891243212446370">Connell’s (1995)</xref> notion of hegemonic masculinity, which he criticizes for not leaving room for masculinities other than a “traditional” masculinity to gain dominance. While Connell’s concept tends to equate a gender stereotype with the hegemonic process, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891243212446370">Anderson (2009)</xref> asserts that orthodox masculinity includes certain values and identities that may be, but are not, necessarily hegemonic. Inclusive masculinity theory enables the possibility of multiple, “less oppressive” masculinities to become hegemonic in line with Connell’s more recent discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891243212446370">Connell and Messerschmidt 2005</xref>, 833). While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891243212446370">Anderson (2009)</xref> argues that inclusive masculinity is present in sports, he emphasizes that it has not yet gained hegemonic status, and that its existence and proliferation do not necessarily guarantee that sexism or other orthodox values would disappear. Instead, Anderson proposes, orthodox and inclusive masculinity currently exist side by side with “equal appeal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891243212446370">Anderson 2011</xref>, 569), enabling men to express either form of masculinity without being stigmatized. The two masculinity archetypes constitute ideals, but are not prescriptive for all men and therefore are not dominant in the same way as when one masculinity archetype is hegemonic.</p>
<p>Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891243212446370">Anderson (2009)</xref>, we identify a prevalence of inclusive masculinity in men’s relation to their children’s sports participation. But rather than being motivated by new perceptions of sexuality, we associate this behavior with increased expectations of men to care for, and develop emotional closeness with, their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891243212446370">Lupton and Barclay 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891243212446370">Marks and Palkovitz 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891243212446370">Townsend 2002</xref>). When fathering through athletic activities, we suggest, sports skills are not sufficient; rather, men also need caring skills. The duality of orthodox and inclusive masculinities seems to be at the heart of contemporary middle-class fatherhood. When fathers strike a balance between caring and performance-oriented aspects of youth sports, they negotiate different discourses of fatherhood and masculinity (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891243212446370">Lupton and Barclay 1997</xref>). Thus, to be “good” fathers men need to find equilibrium between the contradicting discourses and manage the ambivalence between different masculinities.</p>

<title>A Study on Parenthood in Los Angeles</title>
<p>This article draws on data collected as part of a large, interdisciplinary ethnographic research project conducted by the UCLA Center on Everyday Lives of Families (CELF) in 2002-2005. The CELF endeavor studied how Los Angeles parents and their children approach the challenges of balancing the demands of work, school, and family life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0891243212446370">1</xref></sup> To be eligible for participation in the study, both parents had to work at least 30 hours outside the home, have two or three children (with at least one child between the ages of seven and 10), and pay a mortgage on their own home. Families were recruited through an advertisement in local newspapers and flyers in schools. Thirty-two families participated in the study, of which two were same-sex parents. For this article, data were analyzed from the 30 heterosexual families in the study. The CELF families live in the greater Los Angeles area and represent a variety of ethnic backgrounds, with a majority of white fathers (82 percent) and mothers (66 percent). In most households, at least one parent had a college degree, and out of the 60 parents, 82 percent had a college or graduate degree.</p>
<p>A number of different methods have been used in order to document the lives of our families. For this study, we draw on a four-day ethnographic video recording of family members’ daily activities and interactions inside and outside the home from the moment they woke up until the children went to bed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0891243212446370">2</xref></sup> We also draw on semistructured interviews with parents in which they discussed their family’s daily routines and their beliefs, goals, and practices related to issues of education and health. These interviews provided numerous opportunities for parents to discuss their children’s sports activities and the meaning parents attached to these activities. The richness of analysis would not have been possible without the authors’ ethnographic knowledge and participation in data collection.</p>
<p>All interviews were transcribed and a collection was made of the passages when parents discussed children’s sports activities. The topic of sports was typically brought up spontaneously by parents in the context of talking about family members’ schedules, children’s extracurricular activities, and the fostering of healthy habits. All the ethnographic video recordings were transcribed and coded for activities captured on tape. These activity logs were used to identify and create a collection of segments when fathers were engaged in sports activities with their children.</p>
<p>Interactions in the interviews and between fathers and children captured on tape were analyzed within the framework of discourse analysis, which views language as a form of social action and a resource for “making sense” of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891243212446370">Garfinkel 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891243212446370">Potter 1996</xref>). In this sense, fathers’ talk about and around children’s sports offers insights into their interpretation of cultural norms and ideals regarding fatherhood as well as their understanding of their own practices. The observational data enable an analysis of how they enact and negotiate fathering on the ground and orient toward what they perceive to be the “right” way to be a father. The analysis of excerpts points to aspects of talk that highlight a father’s particular positioning vis-à-vis children’s sports activities.</p>

<title>Being an Involved Father</title>
<p>In the past decades, the notion of fatherhood has shifted, with fathers being expected to shoulder more responsibility for child care and prioritizing time with their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891243212446370">Townsend 2002</xref>). Many fathers in our study adhered to this notion, stating that they prioritize spending time with their children sometimes even over their jobs. This is summed up well by Arturo, a 43-year-old father of a 5-year-old boy and 8-year-old girl: “Work is important for me, but to me family is more important and my kids are more important.” For many fathers, prioritizing children was done through participation in their children’s organized sport activities. A number of our fathers volunteered for important roles in at least one of their children’s sports teams; others participated through driving their children to practices and games, and standing by the sideline cheering. Of the 60 school-age children in the 30 families, 43 children from 24 families participated in organized sports activities (72 percent) during the time of data collection. Of the 24 fathers whose children played sports, six volunteered as coaches, assistant coaches, and referees. Seven additional fathers drove their children to their practices and stayed to watch during weekday afternoons and evenings. All 24 fathers attended their children’s games and matches. The majority of fathers whose children play sports (20 out of 24), including all fathers that regularly volunteer or drive their children to their practices and all fathers that are used as examples in this article identified themselves as Caucasian.</p>
<p>David, a 35-year-old father of 8-year-old Josh, for example, was selected to be the coach of Josh’s baseball team. He explains that he enjoys coaching because it enables him to spend time with his son. In a joint interview, Julia, David’ s 40-year-old wife, emphasizes the notion that through coaching David is fathering Josh in a particular way that they both believe in:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Julia:</speaker>
<p>It’s also about family, though. It’s not you being separated from the family. It’s you interacting with Josh and doing something that I think also contributes to the whole thing that we’re trying to do with having our kids trust us, and being able to come to us, and knowing that, you know, we specify time for them and that we specify. . . . Like Josh—you wouldn’t have become a coach had Josh not wanted to play Little League.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it feels good in a number of ways.</p>
</speech>
<p>Julia supports David’s choice to coach Josh’s team and explains that for her this is a form of fathering. Julia highlights how coaching offers David the opportunity to achieve a certain relationship with their son that both she and her husband strive for: a bond of trust with Josh, who experiences an available and attentive father. David confirms that the experience is rewarding.</p>
<p>But spending time coaching one’s children’s teams is time-consuming and not always easy to manage. Derrick, a 42 year-old father of two sons, ages 7 and 9, and a daughter, 11, suggests that his preference for being with his children and spending time involved in their sports activities may hurt his business (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891243212446370">Root and Perry 2008</xref>). On Saturday morning, Derrick is in his home office going over work files, when he admits to the videotaping researcher that he neglects certain tasks important for his business in order to spend time on his coaching duties. “I’m supposed to do payroll tonight or tomorrow,” he says, “so I’m stalling it out by doing baseball.” Though, in his eyes, he is doing the right thing, he recognizes that this choice to ignore his business responsibilities carries additional fallout. While still in the home office, the researcher asks Derrick if he needs to spend time on his paid work while at home, and Derrick answers that he should, but he does not.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I should [holds his hand to his mouth as if telling a secret]. But it comes to the point where I don’t. And I get yelled at from my wife. Um, you know, after twelve years it’s, I’ve had enough [gesturing “enough” with his hand]. Plus, I really enjoy spending time with the kids doing the baseball stuff.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Derrick admits that he does not spend sufficient time on his paid work, and suggests that this choice causes tension with his wife. A few days later, during an interview with Derrick and his 43-year-old wife, Karita, this tension becomes apparent when he declares how much he enjoys spending time with the kids:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, I like just being active with the kids in their sports. That’s what I enjoy doing, and spending time with their friends and trying to teach them how to play the different games and being . . . good sportsmanship type things, competing, teamwork and all that kind of stuff. So most of the activity I try to be around spending time with the kids to, even just being a good dad like that. So, my dad wasn’t around very much. So, I always think it’s pretty neat.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Derrick equates being involved in his children’s sports with being a good father. He is proud that in spite of his own experience of a relatively absent father, he is present in his children’s lives through sports. Derrick emphasizes how through his involved fatherhood he is able to develop close relations with their children. Karita, however, responds critically to Derrick’s positive self-presentation by pointing out that he does not spend time helping around the house. As in the majority of the families in the study, Karita is responsible for most household work and child care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891243212446370">Good 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891243212446370">Good and Gottzén 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891243212446370">Gottzén 2011</xref>). Defensively, Derrick evokes the idea that spending time coaching the children is just as demanding:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Derrick:</speaker>
<p>Well, I mean, I don’t get the laundry, but I spend time with the kids. I’m coaching them and that takes effort too. You know, so if I’m schlepping and going to practices and picking the bases and throwing the baseballs and dealing with twelve other kids, then after that’s over then we’ll come home and eat and I’m pretty exhausted too. So, I mean, it’s not like I’m not doing nothing [<italic>sic</italic>]. I’m just not doing the laundry.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Karita:</speaker>
<p>Or cooking or cleaning or whatever. We can fight about that all night [laughs sarcastically].</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Derrick:</speaker>
<p>Good. Then you go coach the kids and I’ll cook a dinner. Big deal. I’ve asked you to go coach them. You can go coach Pam’s team.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Karita:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, well, I have enough work to do. Working two jobs already, so don’t want to do that.</p>
</speech>
<p>By detailing the “work” of picking bases and throwing balls and the resulting exhaustion, Derrick suggests that his wife and he are doing comparable things. He equates his coaching the children’s baseball teams to his wife’s household responsibilities, and even suggests that they could trade places.</p>
<p>While Karita recognizes that Derrick is a good father when it comes to doing sports with the kids, she argues that it forces her to assume the less amusing duties of parenthood:
<disp-quote>
<p>Oh, absolutely, he’s a great dad when it comes to that. That’s no problem. I try to be a good mom too. I, you know, make sure that the homework is being done. I’m probably more the nagging part of the mom and dad relationship, you know, because that’s probably what I do, you know, “Clean up! Do this! Do that!” But that’s part of being a mom. So . . . and he’s . . . he’s trying to be the fun dad instead, you know? That’s fine. That’s fine.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0891243212446370">West and Zimmerman (1987)</xref> remind us that when parents perform household work, they produce not only household services and child care but also gendered identities. Thus, the discussion between Derrick and Karita is not only a negotiation about who is supposed to do what but also a gendered construction of parenthood that is accomplished through categorization work where the mother is considered to be responsible for housework and child care while the father mainly spends time with the children. Karita’s statement that Derrick is a “great dad,” followed by her admission that she <italic>tries</italic> “to be a good mom too,” weakens her moral position vis-à-vis Derrick, who appears to be successful as a parent in comparison. Her definition of a “good mom” as the one responsible for overseeing children’s homework further strengthens Derrick’s image of a good dad, since both education and extracurricular activities are part of parental strategies to prepare children for adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891243212446370">Kremer-Sadlik and Gutiérrez, in press</xref>). Finally, Karita admits that she becomes the “nagging” parent, while Derick is the “fun” one. In this view, “good” fatherhood does not necessarily include contributing a fair share of domestic work (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891243212446370">Shows and Gerstel 2009</xref>). Instead, it primarily means being with the children and involved in their lives. While enacting an inclusive fatherhood in relation to sports, Derrick maintains orthodox practices in other parenting areas.</p>

<title>Caring Through Sports</title>
<p>Jerry Reis, a 45-year-old father of 8-year-old Allison, explains that his fathering through sports “probably comes from the fact that that’s something I can get involved with.” Specifically, sports affords Jerry a space where he can care for his children, offering them security and support.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The coach should be the one that can be nasty and critical, so the one . . . my role should be to provide them with security or as close to that as I can. You know, and to cheer them on and not to yell at the referees and not do all that other stuff that horrible athletic parents do—sports parents. But to just simply encourage them, you know. Let someone else be the bad guy, you know. . . . I should be the safe person.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, Jerry orients toward an inclusive masculinity by differentiating between himself as the father and the coach. While the coach may be “nasty and critical,” Jerry should provide support and safety, qualities that have traditionally been ascribed to female parenthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891243212446370">Hays 1996</xref>). By separating himself from what he calls “horrible athletic parents,” Jerry presents caring fatherhood as an ethical choice, one that he views as imperative (“I should”).</p>
<p>Our ethnographic observations confirm Jerry’s commitment to supporting his children with positive reinforcement and advice. In the following exchange, Jerry is watching his daughter’s first basketball game of the season. When the opportunity arises, he calls her to come to him.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Jerry:</speaker>
<p>Come here one second. Hurry up. [Motions for Allison to come over.] Come here. [Allison runs to her father.] You’re in the right place, you’re doing all the right things, but when you shoot you’re rushing it. So just take a little teeny second and just make sure you’re set right and then shoot. Okay? [Jerry raises his hand for a high-five.]</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Allison:</speaker>
<p>[Nods and gives her father a high-five.]</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jerry:</speaker>
<p>Go.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Allison:</speaker>
<p>[Runs back to the court.]</p>
</speech>
<p>Jerry makes sure to complement Allison twice, saying that she is doing “all the right things” before suggesting that she is doing one thing wrong, thus reducing the weight of his criticism. He further diminishes Alison’s error by pointing out that she “just” has to do a “little teeny” change, depicting the correction as a minor change in Allison’s already very good performance. Jerry ends his little interlude with a high-five that invites Allison to collaborate with him both by high-fiving him back and following his advice.</p>
<p>Jerry’s supportive behavior is not a unique case; many of the fathers in our study stood by the sideline during matches and games continuously shouting encouraging comments (e.g., “good job,” “good try”) to their children and the team in general. In the following segment we meet Travis, a 40-year-old father of eight-year-old Jonah, who spends his Saturday mornings cheering his son from the sideline of the soccer field. At a quarter-time break Jonah comes to his father to get a drink of water when Travis compliments him: “Oh my God, Jonah. I saw you almost score two goals. That was awesome, dude. You were so close. . . . Good playing, Jonah. Way to follow it a second time. It’s exciting to watch.” Travis positively reinforces Jonah’s playing in a number of ways. He starts by recognizing Jonah’s contribution to the team by noting how he almost scored twice. He then compliments him on his “good playing” and adds a specific detail (“way to follow it a second time”), thus elevating his compliment from mere parental support to a “knowledgeable” recognition of skill demonstration. Travis makes a point of telling Jonah that his playing is pleasurable to the spectators, further depicting his skills as remarkable. With this message of support and trust, Jonah returns to the game for another quarter.</p>
<p>Some fathers encouraged their children even when their performance was not so praiseworthy. Consider, for example, Thomas, a 46-year-old father of 11-year-old twins, a boy, Reese, and a girl, Kayley, who, together with his wife Roberta and Kayley, was watching Reese play a soccer match with his club team. The game was tough and Reese’s team lost. In addition, Reese received a “yellow card” when he fouled a player in the heat of the game. Reese gets off the field at the end of the match fuming at the referee. While Roberta immediately responds by telling Reese in a stern voice, “Don’t complain about the ref,” Thomas is much more sympathetic—he gently caresses his head and back, agreeing with Reese that “the ref has been unfair.” And when Reese walks away, Thomas follows him and continues in a warm tone, “Don’t worry about getting a [yellow card] once in a while. That’s OK. . . . just keep doing what you’re doing.”</p>
<p>Reese goes on to describe to his dad how he tackled one of the players, thus revealing that the yellow card was rather deserved. Thomas’s response is supportive, complimenting Reese on his strategy: “That’s one nifty trick because . . . that’s one nifty trick because you make the other guy mad.” Then rubbing Reese’s back, Thomas concludes, “You played well. You played great. Sorry you guys lost. You played well.” While Thomas’s support could appear as a form of competitiveness and Thomas could be viewed as an ambitious father who is eager for his son’s team to win, Thomas’s gentle and intimate voice and continued physical warmth toward his son signals a greater concern for Reese’s well-being rather than a care for the game.</p>
<p>Thomas’s high attunement to his children is also evident when talking about his daughter’s sports activities. Sitting on the floor on the side of the basketball court, Thomas is watching Kayley’s team’s game. The researcher who is filming comments that Kayley is playing well and that she has already scored a few baskets. Thomas’s response reveals that he has been examining Kayley’s athletic abilities:
<disp-quote>
<p>She’s not found her athleticism yet. But I see it in there. Um, the way she was running around here in the yard shows that she’s starting to create a little bit of strength in her body to . . . to run. [ . . . ] So I think we may have found something that works for her sports-wise.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thomas continues to tell the researcher how he took Kayley to a Lakers game, how much fun it was, and how they regularly watch games on TV together. All these activities, he suggests, have already improved her game. He then elaborates, revealing a completely different motivation for having Kayley participate in sports:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think she’s a child who’s going to be extremely moody in her teenage years. Um, she’s got a lot of passion and she seems to have quite a lot of anger too. And, you know, anger is usually a product of not knowing how to express yourself. And I think if she can take out some of her aggression and passion directly into this, it should help.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thomas orients toward an inclusive masculinity by presenting himself as an involved father who watches his daughter very closely. The talk about Kayley’s athleticism reveals that Thomas understands her potential and can help her find her “sports.” But at the same time we learn that he is aware of his daughter’s traits beyond basketball. His ability to predict difficulties in Kayley’s teenage years suggests that Thomas knows his daughter well, that he has an intimate understanding of her personality. By presenting basketball as a tool for helping Kayley, Thomas’s interest in her athletic abilities is framed not as an interest in sports or in competition, but rather as a form of care for his daughter.</p>

<sec id="section6-0891243212446370">
<title>Applying Pressure to Perform</title>
<p>As we have seen, fathers regularly display an inclusive masculinity by supporting and caring for their children, recognizing the effort they put forth and the skills they demonstrate, and encouraging them to continue even when the results are not always favorable. However, our observations also show that fathers frequently want to see their children’s performance improve. While Travis encourages Jonah during the soccer game, he also comments to the videotaping researcher that nowadays kids Jonah’s age have it easy because they do not have to perform well to be on a sports team.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>You know, back in the old days, it was this, like, you know, you didn’t get picked for the baseball team ’cause you couldn’t play baseball. You know, nowadays it’s all about fairness and it’s all, it’s different, you know? And so, umm, his experience is really coddled, you know, in every aspect. Not just in the school. Like, he’s been playing soccer since he’s been five. But they don’t keep score until under ten-year-old. So they have a . . . he’s an under eight, so they still don’t, officially don’t, keep score in those games. So, you know what I’m saying? It’s like, we never did that. I mean, you know, three strikes and you’re out kind of stuff as I remember.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At first Travis seems to appreciate the change that’s occurred in the way children’s sports activities are managed today. He notes that in comparison to the way things were when he was a child, today there is an emphasis on fairness. However, as Travis continues, it becomes clear that he evokes his childhood experiences as a model that he prefers. He describes children’s experiences today as “really coddled,” selecting to use a term that carries a negative connotation and depicts them as being treated with indulgence. This stands in contrast to the past, when kids are described as tougher and able to handle more pressure to perform, because if they did not, it was “three strikes and you’re out.” Travis’s desire to be supportive and to be less “coddling” merge as the whistle blows and Jonah comes off the field for half-time break. Travis compliments him again but now he adds some advice about how to improve his playing.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Travis:</speaker>
<p>What an exciting game. So close. [Laughs.] I saw you almost scored another goal. Hey, I have a brilliant idea [using a bright and positive intonation]—if you guys pass the ball, I think you guys could score a goal. Instead of all bunching together?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jonah:</speaker>
<p>[In a serious tone] That’s the problem. No one ever passes the ball. They try, but the other team stops them. The other team’s too fast and they always stop . . . they always stop them.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Travis:</speaker>
<p>You guys are . . . the ball is mostly in their end. You guys are keeping it down there. It’s good.</p>
</speech>
<p>Congratulating Jonah again for almost scoring is both a compliment and a reminder that the team needs to score. Travis then uses a cheerful tone to suggest a solution, thus treating the lack of goals as a problem. While the repeated mention of scoring goals highlights the importance Travis puts on scoring and winning, by keeping a light tone of voice he signals that the lack of goals is not a serious matter. Yet, once he makes this comment, Jonah treats the matter seriously and, a bit discouragedly, suggests that the other team does not make it possible for them to pass and score. Travis appears not to want the discussion to take a negative turn; he rejects Jonah’s assertion that the other team may be better and reverts immediately to complimenting Jonah’s team for keeping the ball on the other team’s side. The lack of scoring and the possible need for improvement are brushed aside. This dialogue illustrates well the thin line fathers attempt to straddle between, on one hand, showing support for their children no matter how well they perform and, on the other hand, expressing an expectation that their children improve and play more skillfully.</p>
<p>Keeping this kind of balance between wanting their children to succeed and wanting to show care and support was not always easy for some of our fathers, who found it difficult to control their competitive nature and desire to push their children to excel in sports. John, a 43-year-old father of 12-year-old Adrian and 11-year-old Austin, spent the previous morning being the assistant coach during his sons’ baseball game. The team did not play well and lost the game badly. Here Adrian is sitting at the dining table doing his homework while his father is sorting some mail next to him. Austin is in the other room, but within hearing distance. At one point Adrian jokingly attempts to throw a plastic bottle cap at his father and misses.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Adrian:</speaker>
<p>It didn’t work. [Picks up the cap under the table.]</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>John:</speaker>
<p>Standard [in a sarcastic tone, keeping his focus on his mail and not on Adrian].</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Adrian:</speaker>
<p>What? [in a mocking, indignant tone]</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>John:</speaker>
<p>You heard me [continuing to sort through his mail, not looking at Adrian].</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Adrian:</speaker>
<p>[Flicks the cap at his father again and misses.] I missed.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>John:</speaker>
<p>I saw [still not looking at Adrian]. It’s about as good as you played baseball yesterday.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Adrian:</speaker>
<p>What? [In a mocking, indignant tone]</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Austin:</speaker>
<p>Oh-oh! [Shouting teasingly at Adrian from the other room]</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Adrian:</speaker>
<p>[Shouting back at Austin] Look who’s talking!</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Austin:</speaker>
<p>What?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>John:</speaker>
<p>[Looking at Adrian] Oh, stop!</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Austin:</speaker>
<p>[In an argumentative tone] [xxx] the whole time.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Adrian:</speaker>
<p>So?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>John:</speaker>
<p>I was just kidding, man. If it wasn’t for you, Benny would have had a no-hitter.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Adrian:</speaker>
<p>[Shouting triumphantly back at Austin] Aahhh!</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Austin:</speaker>
<p>[Shouting to Adrian] Hey, I still got a single.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>John:</speaker>
<p>[Shouting to Austin] Yes, you did.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Adrian:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, but it was off an error on them. [Gets up from the table.]</p>
</speech>
<p>While during the game John did not criticize his sons, the discussion among the coaches at the end of the game revealed that they were frustrated with their team’s overall performance. This frustration seems to come through when John sarcastically comments on Adrian’s poor throw of the plastic cap, equating it to his performance at the baseball game. While the two brothers and their father maintain a joking tone of voice, portraying the exchange between them as a tease, John’s choice to bring up the game and to criticize Adrian’s performance not only puts Adrian on the defense but also shames him publicly. His criticism offers Austin an opportunity to outperform his older brother by gleefully stating that he, in contrast, scored during the game. The pressure to perform well and have one’s action carry positive consequences for the team is evident from the father’s responses to both boys; he moderates his criticism of Adrian by noting that he was valuable for the team, and he recognizes Austin’s score. But John’s acknowledgement of the boys’ positive contribution does not resolve the competition that he put in motion between the two boys. The sequence ends with Adrian noting that Austin’s score was actually not due to his skillful performance but rather to the other team’s mistake. Such exchanges remind us that while children may enjoy spending time with their fathers and sharing their interest in sports activities, this may come with a price, as these involved fathers continuously evaluate and potentially criticize their performance and pressure them to do better and contribute to their team (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891243212446370">Coakley 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies have shown that parents view children’s participation in sports not only as opportunities for excelling in particular athletic skills but also as ways for learning important values such as toughness, discipline, teamwork, and sportsmanship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891243212446370">Dunn, Kinney, and Hofferth 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891243212446370">Gutiérrez, Izquierdo and Kremer-Sadlik 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891243212446370">Kremer-Sadlik, Izquierdo, and Fatigante 2010</xref>). Fathers who were involved in their children’s sports activities witnessed their children’s behavior, assessed whether it complied with sports values, and criticized them if it did not. These judgments were another form of pressure put on children to act in accordance with sports culture and expectations. In the following excerpt, David, whom we introduced earlier as the coach of his son’s baseball team, had just said goodbye to a teammate and his mother who had stopped by the family home to drop off some forms. While the boy and his mother are in the foyer talking to David, Josh, his son, ignores them, sitting in the living room, snacking and watching TV. Once the visitors leave, David, disappointed, reprimands Josh:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>[In an irritated tone] Could you be any less friendly to your teammate?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Josh:</speaker>
<p>What?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>[In an irritated tone, walking toward Josh] Could you be any less friendly to your teammate?! Josh, that is your teammate, on your team. And you just, like, couldn’t pause this long enough to, like, say hello and stand there with him and . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Josh:</speaker>
<p>I did.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>. . . see how he’s doing, how his shoulder is and . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Josh:</speaker>
<p>[In a quiet tone] I was hungry.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>[Bends down toward Josh and, in a harsh tone] You were that hungry? You were going to starve if you don’t eat? You have to ignore your friend? [Walks away.]</p>
</speech>
<p>David, repeating the word “team” four times, emphasizes the fact that Josh was not exhibiting good sportsmanship by disrespecting his teammate. By listing all the actions that he expected Josh to perform—pause the TV, say hello, get up and stand by the boy, ask how he was doing and how his shoulder was—David further depicts Josh’s choice to continue his own activities as unacceptable. David sarcastically rejects Josh’s meek excuse that he was hungry. A few minutes later, as David sits at the dining room table, Josh gets up and approaches his dad.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Josh:</speaker>
<p>[Approaches his father and gives him a hug.]</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>Look at me.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Josh:</speaker>
<p>Yeah?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>[In an intimate tone] Next time you be with your teammate. Okay? And forget your food and your TV. Okay?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Josh:</speaker>
<p>[Nods vigorously as his father speaks.]</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>David:</speaker>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</speech>
<p>If David was angry and scolding earlier, now that Josh hugs him as if showing remorse, David takes advantage of the moment to create an intimate space within which he connects with Josh and teaches him the importance of treating one’s teammate with respect, making sure that Josh understands how to behave next time. While David still maintains his critical attitude, he makes sure to reprimand Josh in a caring and supportive way.</p>
<p>Fathers’ orientation to orthodox values, especially expressing expectations that their children improve their skills and play hard, can have a counterproductive effect, if they are not balanced with support. Matthew, a 43-year-old father of Fiona, 17, and Brandon, 9, admits in a joint interview with his 41-year-old wife, Silvia, that things did not turn out as he had hoped.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Matthew:</speaker>
<p>I think I probably actually drove Fiona out of soccer.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>Why?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Silvia:</speaker>
<p>’Cause he’s pretty demanding on her.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Matthew:</speaker>
<p>Well, not really, I just . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Silvia:</speaker>
<p>He wanted her to be more aggressive and she wasn’t.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Matthew:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, she was just sort of running around out there and, you know, wasn’t doing anything really, you know, uh, you know, to better herself or, you know, to try to take the game to her, get to the game and all that. And, uh, I don’t know, she’s just . . . you know, the coach was always saying, “Yeah, we’re just having fun” and everything. And that’s fine in your first year, that’s like baseball too. But once you’re in your second year or something like that, you want to try and, you know.</p>
</speech>
<p>Matthew takes the blame for Fiona dropping soccer. His disappointment is not with Fiona, but with himself; the disjunctive adverb <italic>actually</italic>, upgrading his responsibility from <italic>probably</italic> to certainty, functions as a comment that reveals that Matthew did not anticipate that his actions would lead to this result (as if saying, “Contrary to my intentions, I was the one who drove Fiona out of soccer”). And when Silvia explains that he was responsible because he was too demanding and competitive, Matthew acknowledges that indeed there was a disjuncture between Fiona’s attitude and performance and his own desire for her to work hard and excel. Fiona addresses the issue of her father’s competitiveness more explicitly:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I used to play soccer, he would always just be, like, really hard on me, you know, like, “You’re not doing it good” and, like, “You need to try harder,” you know? And all I would hear when I got off the field was what I did bad, you know? And . . . and he’s like that with my brother. I think that’s why he doesn’t want to play. Like, he gets discouraged. And I think that kind of made me get discouraged from soccer. . . . I played soccer for two years. I was probably about 11, and I was like, “I can’t deal with this,” you know, he’s always on me about everything.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fiona describes past events when she used to play soccer and how her father’s competitive and demanding personality drove her to quit, and she suggests that her younger brother, who also quit soccer, experienced the same pressure. But most damaging is her last comment, “He’s always on me about everything”—said in the habitual present tense, depicting Matthew’s fathering as permanently deficient.</p>
<p>Matthew seems to be aware of the cost of this character flaw. In another interview, he explains that he believes parents should be involved with the kids: “I think it’s . . . you know, if you help your kids, I mean, it’s . . . the parents have to be involved.” He continues, “I guess Silvia’s been handling most of the, um, you know, the scholastic part. I’ve tried to handle the sporting part.” In contrast to the way Matthew describes his wife’s responsibility as “handling” the education part, he depicts himself as <italic>trying</italic> to handle the sports part, that is, making an effort to handle it, but not guaranteeing success. And indeed his intense involvement, high expectations, and overt critiques have driven his children away from sports. While Matthew wants to be involved in his children’s lives, he recognizes that he has failed in this parental task. Not only has he lost sports as an area where the children and he can connect and share interests but his competitive and demanding character has also dampened his overall relationship with his children.</p>

<title>Discussion: Finding a Balance</title>
<p>In line with previous research on fatherhood and sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891243212446370">Harrington 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891243212446370">Jenkins 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891243212446370">Kay 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891243212446370">2009</xref>), we have shown that youth sports give men opportunities to spend time with their children and provide emotional support. The prevalence in our study of caring-oriented fatherhood through sports also resonates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891243212446370">Anderson’s (2009)</xref> argument that, while historically values connected to orthodox masculinity were endemic in youth sports, today this model of masculinity is being challenged by inclusive practices and values that oppose the central tenets of orthodox masculinity. Anderson bases his theory mainly on studies of men and sexuality in sports in educational settings, convincingly demonstrating that inclusive (e.g., college athletes’ distancing themselves from homophobia) and orthodox (e.g., coaches expressing homophobic and misogynic attitudes) masculinities currently coexist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891243212446370">Anderson 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891243212446370">2011</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891243212446370">Adams 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891243212446370">Cavalier 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891243212446370">McCormack 2011</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891243212446370">Adams (2011)</xref> found this coexistence in his study of college soccer players; while they display inclusive behaviors such as being emotionally and physically close to their friends off the field, they also exhibit orthodox traits such as being aggressive and taking physical risks on the field.</p>
<p>Our study adds to this research by examining masculinity in a new setting, that is, middle-class fathers’ involvement in their children’s sports activities. In this setting, inclusive masculinity traits are valued and emphasized not only as an ideology (recall Jerry, the father who stated that his job was to support his kids in sports) but also in practice (recall Jerry, Travis, and Thomas, who stood by the sideline encouraging their children). Matthew’s case serves to illustrate the consequences of not adopting inclusive practices, at least not sufficiently. Though he acknowledged that he needed to provide support and encouragement when he was engaged in his children’s sports, he did not manage to create a good balance between his desire to care for them and his high expectations. His prioritizing orthodox competitive traits resulted in a tarnished image as a father, and his excessive competitiveness in a paternal failure.</p>
<p>Even though parental failure has always been a potential risk, several commentators argue that contemporary fatherhood is increasingly “risky,” suggesting that it is a manifestation of the detraditionalization of social relations more generally (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891243212446370">Giddens 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891243212446370">LaRossa 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891243212446370">Miller 2011</xref>). What were previously regarded as traditional, common ways of fathering are now being questioned, leading to an increased uncertainty about one’s fathering ability and choices, and doubts about one’s moral worthiness as a “good” father (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891243212446370">LaRossa 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891243212446370">Miller 2011</xref>). The risk of failing as a parent, even when fathering through sports, raises the question whether sports is indeed such a “comfort zone” for men’s parenting (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891243212446370">Coakley 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891243212446370">Harrington 2006</xref>). As noted earlier, this may be a safe domain, as fathers are likely to be familiar with sports practices, but with the changing culture of fatherhood, being versed in sports culture is not sufficient as fathers must adhere to novel standards of balancing competitiveness and pressure with care and support.</p>
<p>While inclusive masculinity may be an ideal when fathering through sports, it may not necessarily be the case in other parenting practices. Our data reveal that inclusive practices, as manifested when fathering through sports, can be embraced without challenging orthodox practices in other domains. Even the most “inclusively masculine” fathers in our study still maintained some orthodox practices at home. For example, systematic observations of housework and child care activities revealed that the women in our study did the lion’s share of these tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891243212446370">Good 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891243212446370">Good and Gottzén 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891243212446370">Gottzén 2011</xref>). Women may be unhappy about this inequality, but at the same time they value their partners’ alignment with the parental involvement ideology, even if it is mostly manifested on the soccer field. Recall that while Karita criticized Derrick as a spouse for not doing his share when it came to household chores, at the same time she recognized him for being a “great dad” involved with and connected to the children. Moreover, by expressing a wish to also be a “fun” parent, Karita attributed greater importance to Derrick’s role of a parent over that of a spouse and indirectly got Derrick “off the hook,” allowing the local gender order to persist.</p>
<p>Involvement in youth sports, thus, may be used to account for middle-class men not taking responsibility or being involved in other parenting practices and household tasks, while simultaneously enacting “good” fatherhood in line with cultural expectations for father involvement (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891243212446370">Shows and Gerstel 2009</xref>). We therefore need to differentiate between men’s values and practices in relation to their children, on one hand, and in relation to their partners, on the other. Considering that for several decades now fathers have been expected to take on more responsibilities in the home (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891243212446370">Marks and Palkovitz 2004</xref>), it appears that inclusive masculinity has gained ground at a slower pace in the household realm than in sports.</p>
<p>In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891243212446370">Anderson (2009)</xref>, our findings also indicate that among sports-involved middle-class fathers, inclusive and orthodox values and practices coexist. While embracing inclusive traits of caring and support for their children, the same fathers still displayed orthodox characteristics by orienting toward the score and expecting their children to play hard. We, thus, suggest that the two masculinities cannot be found simply in the same context for fathers to “choose” their own preference, but rather their coexistence means that fathers must adopt both and in a very particular balance. As we have shown, it is problematic for the fathers in our study to orient only toward competitiveness in youth sports; they should and often want to provide emotional support and caring. In a way, there is a different kind of hegemony going on, that of a balanced masculinity of the two archetypes. This resonates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891243212446370">Gramsci’s (1971)</xref> perspective on hegemony. He notes that hegemony is maintained through incorporating opposing forces or different interests and thus attaining consent and building alliances, and goes on to suggest that in order to maintain cultural power, it is necessary to generate social support as it strengthens the appeal of the hegemonic values (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891243212446370">Howson 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study of middle-class fathers’ involvement in children’s sports illustrates how hegemony is created through negotiation between two opposing models, orthodox and inclusive masculinities, to result in a balanced alliance, that is, an incorporation of both into a new ideal of fatherhood. It is important to note, however, that this is domain-specific (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891243212446370">Adams 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891243212446370">Anderson 2009</xref>). This form of masculinity is relevant to fathering and relationship with children (not only in sports), but as we discussed earlier, it is not evidenced in these men’s relationships with their partners, where orthodoxy still seems to be predominant. The cultural power of this model of fatherhood is well illustrated in the support it received from the mothers in our study. Recall Karita, who acknowledged that her husband Derrick was a “good dad” for being very involved in his children’s sports, and Julia, who was very supportive of her husband’s volunteering to coach their son’s team.</p>
<p>We conclude with the stipulation that in order to enact “good” fathering, men must maintain an “unstable equilibrium” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891243212446370">Gramsci 1971</xref>, 256) where the accomplished masculinity is neither too orthodox nor too inclusive. Youth sports is an arena where men can achieve this balance. Middle-class fathers may continue to expect their children to perform and pressure them to excel in their sports activities as long as they complement these orthodox masculinity traits with a supportive attitude and a caring, nurturing parenting.</p>

<p>Parents and children gave researchers permission to conduct the research procedures by signing consent and assent forms respectively. Videographers followed family members at home and outside the home. To protect family members’ privacy, videographers would never entered a room when a door was closed and advised family members that they could demand that filming be stopped at any time. However, such an event never occurred during data collection.</p>
