<p>Found amidst the teachings of Stephen JA Ward’s captivating whirlwind of cutting-edge knowledge lies the profound subterranean thinking of journalism ethics. <italic>Global Journalism Ethics</italic> manoeuvres through discombobulated territory to devise an informed and mediated ethical method for a global journalism. Motivated by a new era of technology, Ward lays down philosophical foundations, and progressively navigates through obstacles to achieve a unique ethical infrastructure, advancing through themes such as naturalism, ethical flourishing, and cosmopolitanism.</p>
<p>For Ward, journalism faces a contemporary crisis as journalists ‘struggle to maintain a credible ethical identity as they sail the rolling sea of wired and wireless media, a postmodern version of Heraclitus’s world of flux where nothing can be known because nothing stays the same’ (p. 3). Through the internet, regular citizens are able to become journalists and corporate media teams often turn to these entities for current information due to their ability to provide lightning-fast updates on global events. In this climate of citizen journalism and widespread participation in the breaking of news, the longstanding power of traditional media is diffused. Traditional news outlets are now seen as a small component of the cosmic world of journalism. Ward uncovers how these changes contribute to this journalism crisis, and ultimately arrives at a global journalism ethics.</p>
<p>As a response to the practical problems plaguing modern journalism, Ward delves deep into the philosophical underpinnings of ethics in relation to modern human existence, and the ways in which ethics interacts with our lives. Ethical flourishing is at the epicentre of Ward’s infrastructure, presented as an essential ingredient for the success of a global journalism ethics. Woven succinctly throughout the book, it refers to a human development that results in the maximization of good in one’s life while minimizing strife and negativity. It stands for an egalitarian humanity and helps create ethical standards that can ensure the creation of a global community of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>To maximize human and ethical flourishing, Ward suggests the adaptation of cosmopolitanism to allow for the incorporation, appreciation, and accuracy of reporting on global events. Ward poses a challenging yet inspiring question: ‘if you accept the principle of an equal and common humanity, how does that fit with the fact that your family and country mean more to you?’ (p. 156). Ward inspires an additional dimension to the question of global journalism, which is the idea of patriotism within the global sphere: how is it possible for journalists to carry out their democratic duty of investigating and uncovering information from a perspective that does not favour or exhibit motives that work for the betterment of their own country? The ease with which journalists are able to report and share global news stories online is dualistic, as it provides for a wide breadth of information that is accessible to global citizens, while posing questions of framing issues and reporting ethics due to national patriotism. Regardless of the varying types of patriotism, it is a fact of life that must be confronted for the success of a global journalism ethics.</p>
<p>However, Ward believes that it is possible to overcome this issue and achieve cosmopolitanism among journalists, while still paying homage to beliefs and experiences of one’s own family and community. This perspective calls upon journalists to exercise their role within a democratic society as ambassadors of information and freedom. While living in an increasingly globalized world, journalists must look beyond the traditional borders of news media and no longer conduct themselves on a local or national scale, but instead from a global perspective. Therefore, Ward recommends that one must separate oneself from predispositions and personal expectations of others and allow for the role of a journalist to take the reins. That is, one must no longer hold on to prejudicial thinking that may plague one’s personal viewpoint of another country, or let go of motives that may work to fuel personal initiatives, political associations, or special interests.</p>
<p><italic>Global Journalism Ethics</italic> is an amalgamation of interesting views and techniques to influence journalism’s ethical standards, moving closer to a world in which a global journalism ethics can succeed. It is an essential read for all journalists and news media personnel. Ward offers realistic thinking and attainable goals to complement his ideals by providing advice on how to integrate techniques that can lead to improved ethical thinking and practices among journalists. Ward also explores potential weaknesses and evaluates the chances of these ethics actually being accomplished within the journalism industry, admitting potential limitations and setbacks of his view of how to face this journalism crisis. His ideal framework is not likely to be reached in full, and his efforts may not be adapted entirely by all journalists around the globe; however, this book provides a springboard of knowledge into the depths of understanding ethical journalism.</p>
