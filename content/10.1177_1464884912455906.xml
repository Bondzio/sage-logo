<abstract>
<p>This study tests the proposition that hostile interpretations of media content can be reduced through news media literacy training. Within the context of the controversy over the adoption of biofuels as an energy source, we employ a web-based experimental design that manipulates subjects’ exposure to media literacy training and then presents them with news coverage on the issue of biofuels. We find strong support for the notion that media literacy affects individuals’ perceptions of media credibility. Exposure to a media literacy video led to increased ratings of story credibility, as well as increased trust in the media to cover both the issue and the news more broadly. Implications of these results are discussed.</p>

<p>Claims of media bias are the order of the day. Diverse social commentators, advocacy groups, and political organizations decry that news coverage is not only biased, but biased against their side. Americans’ assessments of news accuracy and fairness have reached the lowest levels in decades. The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press estimates that in 2009 only 29 percent of Americans trusted the media to ‘get the facts straight’, and only 18 percent felt the media ‘deals fairly with all sides’ – the lowest figures in a downward trend since 1985 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884912455906">Pew, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Part of this frustration with news media may be related to the reconstitution of the media environment created by new communication technologies and the impact of these technologies on news ownership, production, and distribution. However, another component of this reduced trust in media can be traced not to biased news reporting, but rather to citizens’ biased processing of news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912455906">Gunther, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>While news outlets are often accused of being biased toward one side or another, empirical evidence shows that individuals’ perceptions, experiences, and involvement with an issue affect perceptions of ‘bias’ even in an ‘unbiased’ news story. This tendency for people, particularly those with strong feelings on an issue, to perceive articles on that issue as biased against their view has been conceptualized in the literature as the hostile media effect, or HME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884912455906">Gunther and Schmitt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912455906">Perloff, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884912455906">Vallone et al., 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Extant research has broadened our understanding of when and why these hostile interpretations of media occur, but little is known about how these biased perceptions can be prevented. The normative importance of reducing these perceptions of bias cannot be overstated. Democracies depend on people being able to rely on the news for information, but if audiences dismiss information in the media because it is hostile to their views, content that could increase knowledge and acceptance can instead lead to greater misunderstanding and polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884912455906">Lord et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912455906">Perloff, 1989</xref>). As a result, individuals may reinforce their own viewpoints while criticizing the other side and the media for hostility and bias.</p>
<p>To address this problem, the current study explores how hostile interpretations of media content can be reduced. Specifically, this research tests whether exposure to a media literacy video, which highlights the news process, its integrative efforts, and its importance for democracy, can reduce perceptions of bias and enhance news media credibility.</p>
<p>Media literacy education has taken on many forms in the United States. One strand in particular has focused on the importance of media literacy for participation in democratic practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912455906">Kellner and Share, 2005</xref>), suggesting that a better understanding of how the media operate and of their role in society should increase perceptions of media credibility by ‘teaching’ audiences that coverage of a variety of views, even those opposed to their own, is necessary for a functioning democracy. Further, if a short media literacy training video can limit perceptions of hostility and boost perceptions of credibility, issue-specific media trust, and general media trust, then more sustained efforts, such as formal and informal education, for example, could lead to a more lasting understanding of and trust in the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884912455906">Hobbs, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>To test this proposition, we examine the issue of biofuels, fuels derived from plants, which advocates have heralded as a clean energy solution that would reduce humans’ impact on climate change. However, critics question the efficiency of existing biofuel technologies, ethanol in particular, and point to the potential negative impacts of massive biofuel production on the food supply, as land and agricultural products become ‘bio-crops’.</p>
<p>The controversy over the utility of widespread biofuel adoption is particularly well suited for our purposes, considering this is an issue for which most people have limited access to non-mediated information and one that gained national prominence when energy became an important issue in the 2008 presidential campaign. But it is also an issue for which traditional heuristics for issue positions, such as political party identification, are not well developed. Thus, the biofuels controversy provides us with an opportunity to focus more closely on the relationship between media literacy and subsequent information processing. In doing so, this study does not advocate for an uncritical interpretation of news, but rather investigates how an improved understanding of the news process and its role in society can reduce biased processing.</p>

<title>The hostile media effect</title>
<p>Research into the hostile media effect began with the idea that people demonstrate biases in processing information. Early research into biased assimilation, or the ability of exposure to a two-sided message to produce polarization, indicated that individuals engage in motivated reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884912455906">Kunda, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884912455906">Lord et al., 1979</xref>) and actively counter-argue against information that disagrees with their attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884912455906">Kunda, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884912455906">Taber and Lodge, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Research into the HME developed around this idea of biased processing, looking specifically at how people respond to news coverage of controversial issues. With media, we see a reversal of this trend to interpret content as supportive of our own views: partisans, defined as those with strong views about or deep involvement with an issue, consistently rate news coverage as biased against their position, even when neutral observers rate the same coverage as unbiased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912455906">Gunther, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912455906">Perloff, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884912455906">Vallone et al., 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>The endurance and strength of HME has been demonstrated through the variety of topics and techniques by which it has been observed. Including both experimental and survey research and spanning different contexts and topics, partisans rate news coverage as hostile to their position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912455906">D’Alessio, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884912455906">Gunther, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912455906">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884912455906">Gunther and Schmitt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884912455906">Vallone et al., 1985</xref>). Furthermore, it applies regardless of whether individuals are asked to rate a particular story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912455906">D’Alessio, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912455906">Perloff, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884912455906">Vallone et al., 1985</xref>) or to give their perceptions of the media more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912455906">Eveland and Shah, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884912455906">Gunther, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912455906">1992</xref>). That HME has been observed in such a range of settings speaks to its robustness and pervasiveness.</p>
<p>This widespread occurrence makes it necessary to understand the mechanisms and conditions that produce HME. Selective categorization of information appears to be the central mechanism by which HME occurs, as people with different perspectives rate the same information as hostile to their views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884912455906">Gunther and Liebhart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884912455906">Schmitt et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, HME is contingent on specific message characteristics: a more professional source (i.e. a journalist compared to a student) or a larger expected audience for the message both produce greater HME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884912455906">Gunther and Liebhart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884912455906">Gunther and Schmitt, 2004</xref>). In other words, individuals are more likely to perceive bias in a message when they assume others will see it, suggesting that expected influence is another mechanism producing HME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912455906">Perloff, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond message characteristics, individual differences play a role in predicting HME. Research has consistently demonstrated that strength of involvement with an issue is one of the strongest predictors of hostile perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912455906">Gunther, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912455906">Perloff, 1989</xref>). Involvement encourages categorization of information as hostile to one’s position, based on differing perceptions of ‘neutrality’. Personal predispositions that foster hostile media perceptions include attitude extremity, interest, partisanship, and political ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912455906">Eveland and Shah, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912455906">Gunther, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912455906">Perloff, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884912455906">Schmitt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884912455906">Vallone et al., 1985</xref>). Many HME studies seek out respondents who have opposing positions on an issue, demonstrating that partisans on both sides rated the messages as biased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884912455906">Gunther and Schmitt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912455906">Perloff, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884912455906">Vallone et al., 1985</xref>). A strong position and emotional engagement produce hostile interpretations of media messages and their source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912455906">Gunther, 1992</xref>).</p>

<title>News credibility</title>
<p>The HME literature focuses on perceptions of hostility in media content, but hostility is only one component in a range of media perceptions. Extensive research into perceptions of the media has developed the concept of media credibility, which combines ratings of bias, trustworthiness, balance, accuracy, completeness, and fairness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884912455906">Fico et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884912455906">Meyer, 1988</xref>). A story is considered ‘credible’ when respondents trust the content because it tells the whole story fairly and without bias.</p>
<p>Although much of the research into the hostile media effect has dealt specifically with ratings of bias, some research has expanded this definition to deal with concepts like trust and fairness. This research suggests that these concepts fit nicely with HME: partisans tend to rate the media as less trustworthy and fair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912455906">D’Alessio, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912455906">Eveland and Shah, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884912455906">Gunther, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912455906">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912455906">Perloff, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884912455906">Vraga et al., 2009</xref>). These findings suggest that when considering the HME, it is important to look beyond perceptions of hostility toward the specific content because multiple components of credibility may be implicated in the HME.</p>
<p>While perceptions of hostility and credibility have largely been examined separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912455906">D’Alessio, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912455906">Eveland and Shah, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884912455906">Fico et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884912455906">Gunther, 1988</xref>; Meyer, 2004), it seems plausible that these two ideas are more closely linked than previous literature has generally acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884912455906">Choi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464884912455906">Tsfati and Cohen, 2005</xref>). Some studies have begun exploring this possibility. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464884912455906">Tsfati and Cohen (2005)</xref> demonstrate that hostile media perceptions about the Gaza settlements are negatively linked to trust in media, which further impacted trust in democracy. Furthermore, while ratings of issue-specific media trust can differ from ratings of the media as a whole, they remain closely linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912455906">Gunther, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884912455906">Hwang et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, before testing the effects of media literacy, we are interested in establishing whether perceptions of story bias, story credibility, trust in the media to cover an issue and general media trust are indeed empirically different constructs (Research Question 1).</p>
<p>In looking both at perceptions of story-specific credibility and at broader media credibility, we can also begin to explore whether story-specific perceptions lead to more general perceptions of media trust, or, on the contrary, whether broader media level perceptions serve as conduits to improved ratings of a particular story (Research Question 2). Previous research has suggested that this relationship can occur in either direction: that perceptions of a specific story can feed into perceptions of the media at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912455906">Perloff, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884912455906">Rouner et al., 1999</xref>) or that perceptions of the media can alter our views about a particular story, particularly for issues in which people are deeply involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884912455906">Chia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884912455906">Giner-Sorolla and Chaiken, 1994</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1464884912455906">
<title>Social judgment theory</title>
<p>To explain how exposure to media literacy training could reduce the biases that cause HME, we draw on social judgment theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884912455906">Gunther, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884912455906">Stamm and Dube, 1994</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1464884912455906">1</xref></sup> According to this theory, individuals judge messages depending on whether they fall into the latitude of acceptance, non-commitment, or rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884912455906">Eagly and Chaiken, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884912455906">Sherif and Hovland, 1961</xref>). Ego involvement plays a fundamental role in determining where these latitudes occur, shifting people’s response to a message. If HME functions because partisans differently categorize information as hostile to their beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884912455906">Gunther and Liebhart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884912455906">Schmitt et al., 2004</xref>), this closely aligns with social judgment theorists’ understanding about acceptance versus rejection of a message.</p>
<p>Therefore, the media literacy training could function by adjusting the latitudes of acceptance, non-commitment, and rejection for partisans on an issue. By highlighting the role of the media and the audience in promoting engaged citizenship and informed political debate, the training should render the news story, including its incongruent viewpoints, more acceptable by lessening the latitude of rejection for the message because it is when the message falls within this latitude of rejection that people should perceive the message as hostile or not credible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1464884912455906">
<title>Media literacy</title>
<p>If people’s perceptions of media credibility and bias are related to their position on an issue, it would appear that journalists can do little to reduce hostile interpretations of their work. However, a better understanding of how the media function and of their integrative role in society should increase perceptions of media credibility by highlighting that coverage of a variety of views is necessary for democracy and per se does not entail media bias. In fact, research suggests this type of training can reduce perceptions of bias in a subsequent news story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884912455906">Vraga et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although media literacy is not an easily defined concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884912455906">Hobbs and Jensen, 2009</xref>), media literacy education often focuses on teaching students how to analyze and deconstruct media messages and understand the process of message construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884912455906">Brown, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884912455906">Hobbs and Frost, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912455906">Kellner and Share, 2005</xref>). Research suggests that a combination of general and issue-specific media literacy training can have immediate and enduring effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884912455906">Austin and Johnson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884912455906">Livingstone, 2004</xref>), leading to more analytical evaluation of media messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884912455906">Tobias, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Some media literacy education deals specifically with news construction and consumption, developing the notion that critically evaluating the news is required for audiences to assess the credibility of information. In an early work on media literacy, Masterman argued that ‘Widespread media literacy is essential if all citizens are to wield power, make rational decisions, become effective change-agents, and have an effective involvement with the media’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884912455906">1985</xref>: 13). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884912455906">Mihailidis (2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884912455906">2008b</xref>) has argued that media literacy education should focus on informed and engaged citizenship. The media literacy approach in this study follows this line of thinking, highlighting the relationship between media, democracy and engaged citizenship and extending our previous research into the potential of media literacy for reducing HME. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884912455906">Mihailidis (2008b)</xref> makes the case for media literacy education that stresses the value of an independent and free press as an essential part of democracy, and, similarly, we highlight these elements in the media literacy stimulus in this study.</p>
<p>Thus, we argue that citizens need to understand the news process and imperatives behind journalistic work to analyze the news effectively. We propose that the lack of understanding of news processes can contribute to decreased perceptions of media credibility for the wrong reason: not based on how the media actually fare in their reporting, but rather through personal biases. Informing individuals of journalists’ goals and roles in a democratic society should increase their knowledge of the context in which media content is produced and this, in turn, may reduce hostile media perceptions and increase credibility perceptions. Previous research suggests media literacy training can achieve this potential: in one study, a media literacy presentation extolling the importance of a diverse press and the role of its audiences limited perceptions of hostility in a subsequent news story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884912455906">Vraga et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we expect that exposure to media literacy training can play a role in reducing hostile interpretations of the specific media content and boost ratings of story credibility (Hypothesis 1).</p>
<p>But media literacy training will be less useful if it only affects perceptions of a particular story, because the hostile media phenomenon applies to perceptions of the media generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912455906">Eveland and Shah, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884912455906">Gunther, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912455906">1992</xref>). Because our media literacy training focuses on the role of the media more broadly and because perceptions of a particular story are linked to perceptions of the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884912455906">Chia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912455906">Perloff, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884912455906">Rouner et al., 1999</xref>), we expect that exposure to a media literacy video will increase issue-specific and general media trust (Hypothesis 2).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>To test these hypotheses and research questions, this study utilized an experimental design embedded in a web-based questionnaire. Participants were recruited from groups of individuals who are highly involved in the debate over biofuel implementation.</p>
<p>To assemble a sample of people involved with the issue of biofuels, we recruited members of biofuels-related interest groups and college students from a large Midwestern university enrolled in topically relevant classes. Starting in spring 2009, participants were recruited from several national and state energy special interest groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1464884912455906">2</xref></sup> Publics representing a range of interests in the biofuels debate were recruited, such as Midwest Agnet (a Midwestern-based agricultural website) and Biofuels Digest (a biofuels news site).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1464884912455906">3</xref></sup> In early fall 2009, additional participants were recruited from advanced undergraduate environmental studies courses covering issues of energy, environment, and agriculture, such as ‘The Global Warming Debate’ and ‘Renewable Energy Solutions’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1464884912455906">4</xref></sup> Of the participants (<italic>N</italic>=83), 63 percent were male and the mean age was 34 (<italic>SD</italic>=15.5; <italic>Min</italic>=18; <italic>Max</italic>=76); 22 percent were Republican, 18 percent were Independent, 59 percent were Democrat; and 49 percent were students (<italic>N</italic>=41). Our analysis suggests our recruitment of engaged partisans was effective: a pre-test measure of agreement with the statement ‘biofuels should be used as an alternative energy source’ was folded so that a higher score indicated a stronger position on the issue, producing a mean of 3.13 on a scale from 0 to 5 (<italic>SD</italic>=1.83).</p>
<p>Subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental group or a control group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1464884912455906">5</xref></sup> In the experimental group, participants were exposed to a three-minute presentation on media literacy and the news process. The presentation was a video that combined a text-based Powerpoint presentation with key points highlighted, with a female narrator lecturing on this topic (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1464884912455906">Appendix A</xref> for a transcription of the narrator’s script). Although it is difficult to find a consensus on what constitutes proper media literacy education, this presentation focused on the value of the press to democracy and the construction of news stories, pulling from two key strands of most media literacy education. The control group did not receive the presentation.</p>
<p>Immediately after the control group completed the pre-test and after the experimental group watched the media literacy video, participants were asked to read a brief news article attributed to the Associated Press that covered the advantages and disadvantages of wide-scale biofuel implementation. The Associated Press was chosen as a source because it is a widely used wire service contributing to both liberal and conservative media outlets. The article presented arguments for and against biofuel implementation (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1464884912455906">Appendix B</xref>). After reading the article, participants were asked a series of questions about their perceptions of bias and credibility of the news story, trust in media related to this specific issue, and general media trust.</p>
<sec id="section7-1464884912455906">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>For manipulation checks, we used two single-item indicators: asking respondents to rate how strongly they agreed with the statements: ‘I have a good understanding of the concept of media literacy’ (<italic>M</italic>=6.15, <italic>SD</italic>=2.14) and ‘An independent press will present a variety of views’ (<italic>M</italic>=6.93, <italic>SD</italic>=2.53).</p>
<p>To examine perceptions of hostility of the particular story, we used a single item asking respondents to rate their agreement on an 11-point scale with the statement: ‘The news story I just read is hostile to my stand on the issue of biofuels’ (<italic>M</italic>=3.90, <italic>SD</italic>=2.72).</p>
<p>To test the perceived credibility of the story, we used a standard media credibility battery, which involves rating six concepts – fairness, balance, accuracy, bias, trustworthiness, and completeness – on 11-point scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884912455906">Fico et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884912455906">Meyer, 1988</xref>). These items were averaged into a credibility index (Cronbach’s alpha=0.87, <italic>M</italic>=5.38, <italic>SD</italic>=2.09).</p>
<p>To measure issue-specific media trust, respondents were asked two questions about how fairly the media covers the biofuels debate and if the media present all sides of the issue. Participants rated their agreement with each statement on an 11-point scale, which was averaged to create an index (<italic>r</italic>=0.64, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001, <italic>M</italic>=3.96, <italic>SD</italic>=1.97).</p>
<p>To evaluate general media trust, respondents were asked to rate their agreement with three statements regarding the trustworthiness, balance, and completeness of media coverage generally. Participants ranked their agreement with each statement on an 11-point scale (Cronbach’s alpha=0.85, <italic>M</italic>=4.28, <italic>SD</italic>=2.00).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1464884912455906">
<title>Controls</title>
<p>Participants were asked two questions about their political ideology in terms of social issues and economic issues.

<p>To measure issue-specific media use, individuals answered a single item which asked them how much attention they paid to news stories about energy/environmental issues on an 11-point scale (<italic>M</italic>=8.20, <italic>SD</italic>=1.98).</p>
<p>To measure issue strength, a single item was used asking respondents to rate on an 11-point scale their agreement with the statement, ‘biofuels should be used as an alternative fuel source’ (<italic>M</italic>=7.41, <italic>SD</italic>=2.83). This item was folded, so that a higher number indicated a stronger position on the issue, ranging from 0 to 5 (<italic>M</italic>=3.18, <italic>SD</italic>=1.91).</p>

<title>Manipulation checks</title>
<p>Before testing our research questions and hypotheses, we performed manipulation checks to ensure that respondents paid attention to the media literacy video. In this, and in all subsequent analyses, we included two controls: ideology and environmental media use. The first control is meant to ensure that the effects of our manipulation occur independently of ideological leaning, given the differences between liberals and conservatives in their perceptions of media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912455906">Eveland and Shah, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884912455906">Gunther, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912455906">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884912455906">Vraga et al., 2009</xref>). Issue-specific media use is also important to control when considering media perceptions. Even in an experimental design, controls ensure that an experimental condition is not confounded with other factors in accounting for criterion variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884912455906">Keppel, 1991</xref>). These controls are necessary to correct for randomization errors and because they are significantly correlated with two of our dependent variables: story hostility and credibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1464884912455906">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Using a one-way ANCOVA, we found a significant effect of exposure to the media literacy video on respondents’ ratings of their understanding of media literacy, (F(1, 75)=11.489, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.01, η<sup>2</sup>=0.139). Those who saw the media literacy presentation (<italic>M</italic>=7.24, <italic>SE</italic>=0.44) reported having a greater understanding of media literacy than those in the control condition (<italic>M</italic>=5.31, <italic>SE</italic>=0.34).

<title>Research question 1</title>
<p>Before examining the effects of our experimental manipulations on perceptions of the story and the media, we turn to answer research question 1 and explore whether perceptions of bias, story credibility, media credibility and general media trust are indeed empirically distinct constructs.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464884912455906">Table 1</xref> demonstrates, factor analysis suggests that it is more appropriate to consider these as two factors, rather than four separate variables: one dealing with perceptions of the story (both hostility and credibility) and the second indicating media trust (both issue specific and general).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1464884912455906">7</xref></sup> Therefore, we use the indicators for each of these variables to create two factors: ratings of the story, with a higher score indicating the story was more credible (and less hostile) (Cronbach’s alpha=0.84, <italic>M</italic>=5.27, <italic>SD</italic>=1.87) and ratings of the media, with a higher score indicating more trust (Cronbach’s alpha=0.89, <italic>M</italic>=3.96. <italic>SD</italic>=1.93).</p>

<title>Hypothesis testing</title>
<p>To test our hypotheses, we performed a series of one-way ANCOVAs. Our first hypothesis predicted that those exposed to media literacy training would rate the story more highly than those who did not see the training. Our data support this hypothesis: a significant main effect of exposure to the media literacy training emerged (F(1, 82)=6.673, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.05, η<sup>2</sup>=0.079); those who saw the training rated the story as significantly more credible (<italic>M</italic>=5.87, <italic>SE</italic>=0.31) than those in a control condition (<italic>M</italic>=4.82, <italic>SE</italic>=0.25).</p>
<p>Our second hypothesis suggested that exposure to the media literacy video would heighten ratings of media trust. Our results supported this hypothesis: we found a significant main effect for exposure to the training (F(1,75)=11.649, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.01, η<sup>2</sup>=0.141), with those who saw the training expressing greater trust in the media (<italic>M</italic>=4.95, <italic>SE</italic>=0.34) than those in the control condition (<italic>M</italic>=3.43, <italic>SE</italic>=0.27).</p>

<sec id="section13-1464884912455906">
<title>Additional analyses</title>
<p>While we selected our sample from among an engaged audience, we performed additional analyses to ensure that our effects were not limited to the least-partisan of this group. Therefore, we re-ran our analyses for both hypotheses using only the most partisan respondents – those who had a score of 3 or higher out of 5 on our measure of issue strength, a total of 65 percent of the sample. Among this group, our results are replicated: strong partisans exposed to the media literacy training showed significantly higher ratings of story credibility (F(1, 52)=7.717, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.01, η<sup>2</sup>=0.139) and media trust (F(1,46)=14.281, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001, η<sup>2</sup>=0.254).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1464884912455906">8</xref></sup> Thus, we feel confident that our media literacy training was effective for even the most partisan of this highly engaged group.</p>

<sec id="section14-1464884912455906">
<title>Research question 2</title>
<p>Our results suggest that the media literacy training functioned as predicted, heightening perceptions of story credibility and increasing ratings of trust in the media more generally. However, we were also interested in disentangling these relationships, especially among story-specific and general media ratings. Therefore, our final research question examines the potential for mediation as a result of exposure to the media literacy training.</p>
<p>We tested these competing models using path analysis performed with the MPlus software package. Because we are uncertain which – if either – model would provide a better explanation for possible mediation between the literacy training, ratings of story credibility, and perceptions of media trust, we begin by examining the model fit statistics for each model. Model 1 tested whether perceptions of the story mediated the relationship between the training and ratings of media trust; Model 2 tested the inverse: whether ratings of media trust mediated the effects of the training on perceptions of the story. Neither model provides an adequate fit for the data (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884912455906">Table 2</xref>): the chi-square statistic is significant, the RMSEA does not reach the critical value of 0.05, and neither the TLI nor the CFI reach the desired level of 0.95.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1464884912455906">9</xref></sup> Therefore, it appears that mediation did not occur between exposure to the media literacy training, ratings of story credibility, and perceptions of general media trust.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The public’s reduced trust in the news they consume is no longer a novel finding, but few solutions have been offered to address the normative problems for democracy that distrust in media can create. However, research into the application of media literacy suggests that giving people a more thorough understanding of the functioning of the news and inviting them to become critical consumers may encourage them to control their biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884912455906">Mihailidis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884912455906">Tobias, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884912455906">Vraga et al., 2009</xref>). This study examined whether exposure to a media literacy video could affect individuals’ perceptions of hostility and credibility of a particular story and trust in the media overall.</p>
<p>Our study produced support for these hypotheses. Exposure to a media literacy video increased perceptions of story credibility and trust in the media. Furthermore, the shifts in perceptions were sizeable: averaging more than a one-point increase on an 11-point scale.</p>
<p>These shifts in media perceptions occurred despite the fact that the audience was selected for their engagement with the issue of biofuel use. It is these involved partisans who should believe news media are hostile to their point of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912455906">Eveland and Shah, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912455906">Gunther, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884912455906">Vallone et al., 1985</xref>). This study suggests that media literacy training may be able to counteract these biases by encouraging individuals to consider the processes by which news is made and the democratic functions it is designed to serve.</p>
<p>Reviewing the rationale by which the media literacy video may work clarifies this argument. Partisans should have the most extreme and broad latitudes of rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884912455906">Eagly and Chaiken, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884912455906">Sherif and Hovland, 1961</xref>), making it difficult for them to accept a message with contrary viewpoints. But if the media literacy training functioned by increasing the latitude of acceptance – or at least non-commitment – for messages including diverse viewpoints, it should be powerful among partisans. However, we remain unsure whether the media literacy training increased acceptance of the incongruent arguments themselves or whether it worked by highlighting the appropriateness of the media to include these arguments. We suggest that the context in which individuals are exposed to media literacy training needs to be carefully considered when gauging response to media content. Further, research into the HME and its functioning would benefit from more careful consideration of the contributions of social judgment theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884912455906">Gunther, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884912455906">Stamm and Dube, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>This study also provides a bridge between HME and research into perceptions of media credibility and trust. Much of the previous research into the HME has focused on evaluations of the story and the hostility of the content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912455906">Eveland and Shah, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884912455906">Gunther and Schmitt, 2004</xref>). But we suggest, and our findings support, that perceptions of hostility may be one component of a more general view of media credibility. Our media literacy training worked to enhance ratings of the story both in terms of its lack of hostility and its credibility, as views of story hostility and credibility were indistinguishable among this audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884912455906">Fico et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884912455906">Meyer, 1988</xref>). Although some previous research into the HME has examined other constructs related to credibility, such as trust and fairness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912455906">D’Alessio, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884912455906">Gunther, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912455906">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912455906">Perloff, 1989</xref>), little research has bridged these two fields. This study is a step in this direction, a direction that holds great promise for a more insightful understanding of how media perceptions fit together, what affects those perceptions, and what can be done to encourage the audience to consider media fairly and critically.</p>
<p>Our study also attempted to disentangle the relationship between ratings of a specific story and views of the media more generally. Our analyses confirmed that exposure to the media literacy training boosted both ratings of the story and trust in the media separately. With this confirmation, we tested competing models to determine whether mediation occurred, examining both the possibility that ratings of the story influenced views of the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912455906">Perloff, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884912455906">Rouner et al., 1999</xref>) or that shifting views of the media led respondents to rate the story more favorably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884912455906">Chia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884912455906">Giner-Sorolla and Chaiken, 1994</xref>). Neither model provided an adequate fit to the data, suggesting that mediation did not occur. Instead, it appears the media literacy training functioned to boost perceptions of the story and of the media separately.</p>
<p>Naturally, this study has limitations that need to be addressed. The measurement of some of our variables is not ideal. One concern is our use of a single-item measure of hostility. Although our factor analysis in response to research question 1 led us to combine ratings of hostility and credibility into a single measure of story ratings, it is possible that with a more nuanced measurement of hostility, perceptions of story credibility and hostility would be distinct. Future research needs to re-examine the linkages between perceptions of hostility and credibility to clarify this relationship. Further, this study included exposure to a single news story on a single topic and particular care was taken to ensure the story maintained journalistic norms of balance and objectivity. Not all stories adhere to this norm and the ideological cue of a source remains influential. Future research should examine other topics and contexts in which media literacy training could be effective.</p>
<p>Our results for the mediational analysis also remain limited by our sample size. Given the small sample, only relatively simple models were feasible using path analyses. A larger sample or a more complex model may illuminate new pathways between media literacy and ratings of media credibility and trust, a possibility that future research should explore.</p>
<p>In addition, it remains to be seen if media literacy training goes beyond reducing the perceptual biases in the news consumer. The balance we strove to maintain in the story led individuals to view the story as not particularly hostile; even in the control condition, the story only received a rating of 4.40 out of 10 in terms of its hostility. While the media literacy training reduced perceptions of hostility even further, it is possible that the training would not be as effective with a story perceived as more hostile. As previous research suggests, even a story seen as balanced and objective by neutral others can provoke hostile media perceptions among partisans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912455906">Perloff, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884912455906">Vallone et al., 1985</xref>); it is possible that this study did not fully stimulate hostile media perceptions. However, respondents with stronger attitudes on the issue (i.e. those who had a score of 3 or higher out of 5 in terms of attitude strength) did rate the story as substantially more hostile (<italic>M</italic>=4.37, <italic>SD</italic>=2.95) than those with less strong attitudes (<italic>M</italic>=3.07, <italic>SD</italic>=2.05) – a difference that is statistically significant (<italic>t</italic>=2.097, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.05). Therefore, while the story was not rated as especially hostile, those with more extreme attitudes on the issue do rate the story as more hostile, as predicted by HME.</p>
<p>Further, we would not want media literacy training to blind people to actual biases that may exist in news coverage. If the training discourages critical consumption of news that truly displays a bias, it would raise concerns about its value. In this study, we do not have the means to test this. Future research needs to evaluate critical thinking after media literacy training and consider multiple news stories, including biased stories, to answer these questions.</p>
<p>That our sample included both college students and community members is an important aspect of this study suggesting that the potential for media literacy to contribute to the societal integration that media trust enables is not limited to college populations. That said, all of our respondents had relatively high levels of education and our media literacy training was tailored for this audience, including sophisticated terminology. We suspect that media literacy training would need to be customized, based on the knowledge of the audience, and encourage future research to build presentations suitable for a variety of audiences, including middle, high school, and college students – those most likely to be exposed to media literacy in a formal setting.</p>
<p>In addition to formal classroom education, in both primary and secondary education and college, media literacy education can be incorporated into more informal settings. To date, most media literacy education has occurred in the classroom or other formal settings, but we believe that content could be developed for both formal and informal training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884912455906">Hobbs, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884912455906">Knight Commission, 2009</xref>). For example, developing public service announcements (PSAs) promoting media literacy that can run on television and as sidebar content online is one way to target individuals outside the classroom. A recent digital and media literacy report suggests that PSAs and other informal educational approaches should be used to promote media literacy outside of the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884912455906">Hobbs, 2010</xref>). The content from our media literacy presentation could be used as a PSA and placed on relevant websites. In addition, similar content focusing on the same themes could be developed. While these methods may not function as effectively as extensive classroom training, creating media literacy education content for both formal and informal education extends the range of opportunities for promoting media literacy and exposes a wider range of people to the message. This study is a first step in testing media literacy training in an experimental condition. Understanding the impacts of this type of training is important before embarking on large-scale efforts to create media literacy materials and curricula.</p>
<p>A limitation of our study is that we cannot test whether these beneficial effects persist beyond the experimental session. We encourage future research to investigate the potential for literacy education to influence perceptions of news on a variety of issues, as well as the endurance of these perceptions.</p>
<p>We are not arguing that citizens should place blind trust in the news, but simply rejecting coverage that does not agree with their viewpoints is also dubious. Given the importance of a free press to a functioning democracy, it is important to understand the underpinnings of audience perceptions of media content. This study suggests that media literacy training focusing on the benefits of a free press, the need for representation of diverse views, and the role of the critical consumer could be an important way to improve citizens’ understanding of the journalistic process, reducing perceptions of bias and hostility. By encouraging critical and fair consumption of news, we are promoting the functioning of a healthy democracy. Crafting media literacy training that does not fall victim to the audience’s prior beliefs, while maintaining a balance between healthy skepticism and overly critical consumption, may prove difficult; nevertheless, it is a task that seems increasingly necessary.</p>

<title>Appendix A: Media literacy presentation text</title>
<p>Media literacy is an emerging field that has gained momentum in the last decade. One area of media literacy deals specifically with the news process. Today’s short media literacy tutorial explores the steps involved in how a news story begins, to how it is interpreted by you, a news consumer.</p>
<p>It is often said that democracy is about a plurality of ideas and opinions that are in competition with one another. In a democratic society, people are free to express their opinions and ideas, and there is an accepted tolerance for this exchange. The press is one place where a variety of ideas can be expressed. In most news stories, a person can expect to find things that he or she doesn’t agree with or doesn’t like, because it is the role of the press to present multiple viewpoints. Journalists, for the most part, strive to present all sides of a story.</p>
<p>There are many ways journalists go about getting different sides of a story. First, when journalists are given a story, they must go out and find relevant sources that represent various viewpoints on the issue. They then have to balance the responsibilities of their profession and yet do this while working under the constraints of a deadline. Despite having their own perspectives, diligent journalists strive to present an accurate, well-rounded story. In addition, there are some checks and balances in the system, including an editing process with fact checking and review by multiple editors. Also there is a code of ethics that journalists operate under that stresses reliable and credible reporting. However, no matter what journalists do, in the final analysis, your viewpoints and experiences as a news consumer are equally relevant.</p>
<p>There are three key concepts in media literacy education that are important to consider when you read and interpret a news story. The concepts are: (1) all media messages are constructed; (2) different people experience the same message differently; and (3) media professionals, including journalists, conform to a set of industry norms.</p>
<p>When you watch the news or read the newspaper, you bring your own interpretations. These personal preferences influence your understanding of a story. For example, you choose what news stories to read based on your own taste and interests, while avoiding other stories. Two people reading the same story can focus on different aspects and may interpret the story differently. As a reader, you should weigh arguments carefully and understand that, in the press, a variety of views will be presented. Engaging with the various sides of an issue is an important step in forming your own opinion.</p>
<p>So it’s a relationship: on the one hand the journalist striving to provide accurate information and, on the other hand, you the news consumer striving for a fuller understanding of specific issues and concerns.</p>
<p>Freedom of the press and freedom of expression are two of the founding principles of democracy. The public’s right to understand and know what’s happening in their world or with their leaders is essential to a functioning democracy. Ultimately it is the job of the press and the public to work together to foster inclusive debate necessary for democracy.</p>

<title>Biofuels: Green Dreams</title>
<p>By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS</p>
<p>Biological fuels, or biofuels, have been around as long as the automobile. Cheap and plentiful oil products have kept them off the market and out of the minds of consumers. But the recent spike in oil prices, along with a growing concern about global warming and the worldwide food supply, has caused stories about biofuels to become more and more common.</p>
<p>For Americans, supporters say the biggest advantage of biofuels is the potential to reduce or eliminate the need for foreign oil while opponents say they cost more than they are worth. The United States imports 1.6 million barrels of oil each day to support its 2.9 million barrels per day usage. Biofuels could decrease oil imports for years to come because, unlike oil reserves, the nation produces the crops for biofuels already. But in many cases, the energy levels needed to produce one gallon of ethanol, a biofuel made from corn, are greater than those used to create one gallon of gasoline. Similarly, the production of other biofuels uses more coal and natural gas than the biofuel would replace.</p>
<p>Supporters believe that biofuels can be developed into a sustainable fuel supply for the entire country and create more food for starving nations. Opponents say taking food supplies, such as corn, and turning them into energy will hurt global food supplies and cause the prices of existing food stocks to rise. Since biofuels use current crops, they don’t threaten to destroy animal habitats or preserved land when harvesting them. Traditional fossil fuels are extracted from the ground and create the possibility of environmental damage from digging and mining during the process or an environmental catastrophe, such as an oil spill, destroying natural habitats. Biofuels will allow the use of current cropland and could be replenished annually.</p>
<p>But that use of cropland could come at the cost of global food supplies. Modest usage of biodiesel could consume almost all the cropland in the United States. If other countries convert crops to biofuels, it could decrease global food supplies and cause countries that are food exporters to become food importers. Recent riots in Africa and India suggest that even modest use of biofuels can decrease food supplies for the countries that need food the most and could lead to political instability worldwide. Believers in biofuels say this problem could be fixed if more countries commit to biofuels and use more land for growing crops, creating more food than before and possibly lowering food prices. But that commitment could be too late to fix worldwide hunger problems.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounding biofuels is not likely to go away anytime soon as there are legitimate arguments both for and against them. Unfortunately, no simple solution exists to answer the world’s energy problem.</p>
