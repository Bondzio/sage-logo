<abstract>
<p>This study examined whether sex offender residence restriction policies were associated with the clustering of registered sex offender (RSO) residences in 3,056 upstate New York block groups. RSO clustering was measured as the average distance between an RSO and the five closest RSO neighbors, and was aggregated to the block group level. Controls were included for structural characteristics of block groups as well as regional differences within the study area. Results indicate that block groups with relatively newer residence restrictions had decreased RSO clustering (i.e., RSOs living farther apart from each other) compared to block groups without such policies. However, block groups that had residence restrictions for longer than about 2 years had similar RSO clustering levels to block groups without such policies. Results suggest a nonlinear relationship between how long a residence restriction is in place and RSO clustering levels. Implications for future research and policy are discussed.</p>

<p>Residence restrictions are policies meant to protect community members from registered sex offenders (RSOs). To do this, residence restrictions prohibit RSOs from living within a given distance of certain places where children might gather (e.g., schools, daycares, parks, and playgrounds), referred to collectively as “child congregation locations.” In doing so, the expectation is that RSOs will have a harder time finding and approaching young children they could sexually assault, thus decreasing rates of sexual recidivism (and rates of recidivistic sex crimes). First passed in 1995 at the state level and in 2005 at the county and local level, residence restrictions have become extremely popular throughout the United States in a relatively short period of time.</p>
<p>However, prior research has found that residence restrictions can cause numerous unintended consequences for RSOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887403412445613">Bonnar-Kidd, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0887403412445613">Levenson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0887403412445613">Socia &amp; Stamatel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0887403412445613">Soule &amp; Earl, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0887403412445613">Walker, 2007</xref>). One such unintended consequence stems from limiting housing options for RSOs who are returning to or relocating within a community. By limiting housing options in certain neighborhoods, a residence restriction may influence the spatial distribution of RSOs. This is particularly salient when considering relatively small geographic units such as Census block groups, which have been used as proxies for “neighborhoods” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412445613">Grubesic, Murray, &amp; Mack, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0887403412445613">Schaible &amp; Hughes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0887403412445613">Socia, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>As a result, residence restrictions may lead RSOs to live closer to other RSOs, resulting in increased RSO clustering. Alternatively, this may result in RSOs becoming less clustered, as they disperse into rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0887403412445613">Socia, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0887403412445613">2011b</xref>). In either case, it may have consequences not only for successful RSO reentry and rehabilitation but also for efforts to informally and formally monitor these RSOs, and for the residents who live near these RSOs.</p>
<p>This study examines whether the presence of a residence restriction is associated with RSO clustering in upstate New York Census block groups. This study utilizes data on sex offender residences, structural characteristics, and residence restrictions implemented at both the county and local level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0887403412445613">1</xref></sup> The theoretical model draws on the association between RSO residences and residence restrictions, indicators of social disorganization, housing availability and affordability, and the spatial characteristics of neighborhoods.</p>
<sec id="section1-0887403412445613">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Residence restrictions first began at the state level in 1995 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0887403412445613">Levenson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887403412445613">Meloy, Miller, &amp; Curtis, 2008</xref>), and spread to the county and local level in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0887403412445613">Wetterling &amp; Wright, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0887403412445613">Zandbergen, Levenson, &amp; Hart, 2010</xref>). County and local-level residence restrictions exist throughout the United States regardless of whether a state-level residence restriction is present. Residence restrictions can vary in size (i.e., the minimum distance RSO residences must be from certain child congregation locations), scope (i.e., the child congregation locations subject to the “buffer zones” of restricted housing), and inclusivity (i.e., the types of RSOs subject to these laws). Holding other things equal, residence restrictions that are larger in size and/or more comprehensive in scope will restrict more housing options for RSOs.</p>
<p>Numerous prior studies have examined how proposed or actual residence restrictions can affect RSO housing options. These studies, typically conducted at the county level, find that residence restrictions limit available and affordable RSO housing options, especially in dense, urban neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0887403412445613">Barnes, Dukes, Tewksbury, &amp; De Troye, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403412445613">Berenson &amp; Appelbaum, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887403412445613">Chajewski &amp; Mercado, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403412445613">Grubesic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887403412445613">Levenson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0887403412445613">Levenson &amp; Cotter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0887403412445613">Red-Bird, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0887403412445613">Socia, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0887403412445613">Zandbergen &amp; Hart, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0887403412445613">2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0887403412445613">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0887403412445613">Zgoba, Levenson, &amp; McKee, 2009</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887403412445613">Grubesic, Mack, &amp; Murray 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As a result of these limited housing options, residence restrictions may negatively affect the ability of RSOs to successfully reenter the community. For example, residence restrictions may cause RSOs to seek unrestricted housing in more rural neighborhoods, particularly those that still offer housing that is both affordable (i.e., low rent) and available (i.e., vacant rental units). If such areas offer less access to employment opportunities, treatment facilities, and/or supportive family members, this could negatively affect RSOs’ reentry and rehabilitation opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0887403412445613">Barnes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403412445613">Casady, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887403412445613">Center for Sex Offender Management [CSOM], 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887403412445613">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887403412445613">Levenson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0887403412445613">Levenson &amp; Cotter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887403412445613">Minnesota Department of Corrections [MNDOC], 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0887403412445613">Zandbergen &amp; Hart, 2006</xref>). This is supported by research that shows that finding housing is one of the key factors in the successful reentry of ex-felons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887403412445613">Andrews &amp; Bonta, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887403412445613">Colorado Department of Public Safety [CDPS], 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887403412445613">CSOM, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0887403412445613">Roman &amp; Travis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0887403412445613">Solomon, Visher, La Vigne, &amp; Osborne, 2006</xref>; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0887403412445613">Visher, La Vigne, &amp; Travis, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as noted by Police Chief <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403412445613">Tom Casady (2009</xref>, p. 18), “Put bluntly, nobody really cares if sex offenders are inconvenienced, relegated to under employment, or limited to fewer and poorer housing choices.” Thus the relevance of this issue lies in how residence restrictions can indirectly influence <italic>residents</italic> through an effect on RSO clustering.</p>
<p>For instance, while there is little evidence that RSO clustering increases recidivism, there is some anecdotal evidence that when RSOs live close to one another, they may act as informal monitors of deviant behavior. As one RSO explained to a newspaper reporter, “Being clustered like this, we’re a support group for each other . . . You find a guy acting strange, you say, ‘Hey, what are you doing?’ We kind of keep each other in check” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887403412445613">Bain &amp; German, 2006</xref>, p. 3). Similarly, increased RSO clustering may also make it easier for law enforcement to monitor these RSOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403412445613">Casady, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887403412445613">Goldman, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, a study in Colorado found that RSOs in shared living arrangements appeared to be a “frequently successful mode of containment and treatment for higher risk sex offenders and should be considered a viable living situation for higher risk sex offenders living in the community” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887403412445613">Colorado Department of Public Safety, 2004</xref>, p. 4). Thus, if residence restrictions result in RSOs living closer together, they may be indirectly increasing the levels of informal and formal social control exerted over these RSOs. This could result in either decreased recidivism rates or increased detection rates, and potentially increasing the safety of nearby residents.</p>
<p>However, there are also downsides to RSO clustering. First, residents who live near “clusters” of RSOs may experience increased fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887403412445613">Beck &amp; Travis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887403412445613">Caputo &amp; Brodsky, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887403412445613">Craun, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887403412445613">Kernsmith, Craun, &amp; Foster, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0887403412445613">Kilgannon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887403412445613">Pope, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0887403412445613">Zevitz, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0887403412445613">2004</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0887403412445613">Beck, Clingermayer, Ramsey, &amp; Travis 2004</xref>) as well as decreased housing values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0887403412445613">Larsen, Lowrey, &amp; Coleman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0887403412445613">Linden &amp; Rockoff, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887403412445613">Pope, 2008</xref>). Thus living near RSOs can have tangible effects on the mental and financial health of residents. When RSOs live closer to each other, it may magnify these effects for residents who live near these clusters of RSOs. This may also lead nearby residents to inflict vigilante justice against clusters of RSOs. For example, shortly after four RSOs moved into a home in Suffolk County, NY, a resident attempted to burn that home to the ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887403412445613">Kilgannon, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, living near more RSOs may increase victimization risks for residents, even if they do not increase individual RSOs’ risk of recidivism. That is, criminals interact more with individuals they live near (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0887403412445613">Brantingham &amp; Brantingham, 1981</xref>). Furthermore, the literature on routine activities, distance decay, and journey-to-crime suggests that victims are targeted based on the routine interactions of the potential offender, which are frequently based around where they live (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887403412445613">Beauregard, Proulx, &amp; Rossmo, 2005</xref>). If residents who live near clusters of RSOs are more likely to interact with RSOs and/or have an RSO as an acquaintance, then clustering RSOs closer together may increase the risks of sexual victimization for residents who live near these clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0887403412445613">Greenfield, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0887403412445613">Tewksbury, Mustaine, &amp; Covington, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0887403412445613">2</xref></sup> Overall, this suggests that when RSOs live closer together in certain areas, residents in these areas will not only be more likely to interact with RSOs, but as a result, more likely to be sexually victimized, compared to residents who live near fewer (or no) RSOs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0887403412445613">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, when RSOs are more clustered, this can concentrate the mental, economic, and victimization consequences on a limited number of residents. Policymakers may see this as less desirable than distributing consequences more equally among community residents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0887403412445613">4</xref></sup> For example, in a press release regarding a bill meant to stop RSOs from living near one other, New York Republican Assemblyman Fred W. Thiele, Jr. wrote, “‘Clustering’ [of RSOs] puts the residents of affected communities at an increased risk and I am unwilling to stand by while public safety is increasingly compromised” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0887403412445613"><italic>US States News</italic>, 2008</xref>). In a similar vein, policymakers like Assemblyman Thiele should be interested in knowing whether residence restriction policies either increase or decrease RSO clustering. If residence restrictions <italic>do</italic> affect RSO clustering, it could generate unintended effects that indirectly influence residents in the neighborhoods most likely to contain clusters of RSOs.</p>
<p>However, much of the prior research has measured RSO clustering as the number or rate of RSOs living in a given area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887403412445613">Grubesic, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887403412445613">Grubesic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0887403412445613">Hipp, Turner, &amp; Jannetta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887403412445613">Hughes &amp; Burchfield, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0887403412445613">Hughes &amp; Kadleck, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0887403412445613">Mustaine &amp; Tewksbury, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0887403412445613">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0887403412445613">Mustaine, Tewksbury, &amp; Stengel, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0887403412445613">Red-Bird, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0887403412445613">Socia &amp; Stamatel, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0887403412445613">Tewksbury &amp; Mustaine, 2008</xref>). Less research has focused on how close individual RSOs lived either to each other or to potential victims (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0887403412445613">Morgan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0887403412445613">Tewksbury &amp; Mustaine, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0887403412445613">Walker, Golden, &amp; VanHouton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0887403412445613">Zandbergen et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, many of these studies focused on examining structural differences between restricted and unrestricted areas, rather than on how residence restrictions affected actual RSO clustering.</p>
<p>In fact, only two studies defined RSO clustering as how close RSOs are living <italic>to each other</italic>. These studies found that RSO clustering had <italic>decreased</italic> after the implementation of local-level residence restrictions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0887403412445613">Morgan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0887403412445613">Youstin &amp; Nobles, 2009</xref>). That is, local-level residence restrictions resulted in RSOs living <italic>farther apart</italic> from each other (decreased RSO clustering), had led RSOs to disperse into the more rural, less restricted areas, and resulted in RSOs becoming more dispersed throughout the study area as a whole. Thus this suggests that residence restrictions may be valuable in more equally distributing the consequences of living near RSOs among residents in a community, but at the same time may make it harder for law enforcement to monitor these RSOs.</p>
<p>However, other studies show that RSOs continue to live in violation of residence restrictions for extended periods of time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403412445613">Berenson &amp; Appelbaum, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887403412445613">Hughes &amp; Burchfield, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0887403412445613">Tewksbury &amp; Mustaine, 2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0887403412445613">Youstin &amp; Nobles, 2009</xref>). These results call into question the overall effectiveness of these policies at influencing the spatial distribution of RSOs and suggest more research is needed on the association between residence restrictions and how they affect RSO clustering over time.</p>
<p>On a related note, the effects of residence restriction may be temporal in nature. That is, residence restrictions may have more influence on RSO clustering shortly after they are passed and less influence over time as enforcement and compliance wanes. Conversely, their influence may increase over time, as compliance rates increase with continued enforcement. In either case, the presence of a temporal (or a nonlinear) effect has not yet been specifically examined in the prior literature and has important implications for how a residence restriction affects RSO clustering and, ultimately, how these policies may be influencing both reentry success and resident safety.</p>
<p>Overall, the existing research suggests that RSOs appear to become <italic>less</italic> clustered (i.e., more dispersed) after a residence restriction is implemented. However, given the limited geographic coverage of the prior studies, and the examination of a single, relatively new residence restriction in each study, these results are still tentative. Furthermore, given the apparently widespread violation of these policies by many RSOs, it is unclear whether the findings of these studies were influenced by how recently the residence restriction was implemented. Thus more research is needed that covers large geographic areas, compares differences in residence restriction policies, and examines the temporal and nonlinear effects of these policies.</p>

<title>Other Characteristics Related to Sex Offender Housing</title>
<p>In considering how a residence restriction affects the RSO clustering, one must account for other characteristics that are unrelated to residence restrictions but that also influence where RSOs are most likely to reside. For instance, there is consensus in the existing literature that RSO residences are frequently located in areas that exhibit indicators of social disorganization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0887403412445613">5</xref></sup> This is not surprising, as disorganized areas typically offer some of the most available and affordable housing in a county (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0887403412445613">Socia, 2011a</xref>) and both the availability and the affordability of housing are key concerns for ex-offenders returning to communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887403412445613">Andrews &amp; Bonta, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887403412445613">CDPS, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0887403412445613">Roman &amp; Travis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0887403412445613">Solomon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0887403412445613">Visher et al., 2004</xref>). In upstate New York, the most disorganized areas typically also have the highest population density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0887403412445613">Socia, 2011a</xref>), a characteristic that may also be related both to RSO housing options and to how close RSOs live to each other. Therefore, without considering the effects of a residence restriction, it is likely that RSOs are more likely to be found (and more likely to be clustered) in areas offering more affordable and available housing, which are also more likely to be densely populated (meaning residents are living closer together) and socially disorganized.</p>
<p>Therefore, in examining whether and how residence restrictions are associated with RSO clustering, measures of social disorganization, housing availability, housing affordability, and population density must also be considered. If the presence of a residence restriction is associated with RSO clustering <italic>after</italic> controlling for these characteristics, then these policies may also be affecting the reentry and rehabilitation of RSOs as well as the housing values, fear levels, and overall safety of nearby residents.</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>The current study explores whether residence restrictions are associated with RSO clustering in upstate New York block groups, controlling for other structural characteristics related to RSO housing options. As noted earlier, RSO clustering is measured in this study as how close RSOs are living to their nearest RSO neighbors, with increased distance between RSOs indicating less RSO clustering. Despite a number of studies finding various unintended consequences that result from residence restrictions, surprisingly few studies have focused on whether these policies are associated with this type of RSO clustering. Knowing whether these policies are associated with RSO living closer together or farther apart is important, as it informs on the larger policy issue of how these policies may be affecting recidivism rates and reentry experiences, residents’ mental and economic health, and overall community safety.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0887403412445613">
<title>Data and Sample</title>
<p>The sample for this study consisted of data from 3,056 Census block groups in 53 upstate New York counties. The Census block group was selected as it can represent a proxy for a “neighborhood.” This is because the block group represents the smallest aggregate area that includes relevant Census data on structural characteristics, and its use allows for more diversity between “neighborhoods” than if Census tracts were used instead (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887403412445613">Goodman, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0887403412445613">Socia, 2011a</xref>). Using Census boundaries as a proxy for neighborhoods also has an established precedence in the existing literature on sex offender residence restrictions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0887403412445613">Barnes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887403412445613">Grubesic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0887403412445613">Red-Bird, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0887403412445613">Schiavone &amp; Jeglic, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0887403412445613">Socia, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0887403412445613">Zgoba et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The sample was restricted to counties in the upstate New York area (including Putnam County).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0887403412445613">6</xref></sup> This excluded counties in the New York City area, as the inclusion of the large number of extremely urban block groups from the New York [City] Metropolitan Statistic Area (NYMSA) may have overshadowed conclusions regarding the rest of the state. This is because block groups in the NYMSA are much more dense and numerous (per county) than in the rest of the state and therefore are much more likely to both be affected by a residence restriction and to influence the results on a county-by-county basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0887403412445613">Socia, 2011a</xref>). Further, counties and neighborhoods in the NYMSA simply don’t “look” like those in the rest of the state (i.e., upstate). Thus, results are expected to be generalizable to the upstate New York area, but not necessarily the more urban NYMSA area.</p>
<p>While New York does not have an existing state residence restriction, it does contain many different county and local-level policies throughout the state (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403412445613">New York State Office of Sex Offender Management [NYS OSOM], 2010a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0887403412445613">7</xref></sup> This “patchwork” of restrictions is similar to many other states with county and local policies in place. Local and county-level residence restrictions were first passed in New York in 2005.</p>
<p>Presently, residence restrictions in New York range from 500 to more than 2,000 feet in size, with the most common size being 1,000 feet. The scope of residence restrictions in New York range from conservative scopes that includes only parks and victims’ residences and workplaces (e.g., Nassau County), to comprehensive scopes that includes virtually any location where children might potentially congregate (e.g., Orange County). The majority of residence restrictions include some combination of schools, daycares, parks, and/or playgrounds in their scope. There is little variation in terms of inclusivity, as most county and local-level residence restrictions in New York apply to all risk Level 2 and 3 sex offenders living in the jurisdiction who were not otherwise grandfathered when the policy was originally implemented. Overall, this means that when comparing the effects of residence restrictions across the upstate New York area, differences for size and scope should be accounted for in the analyses. A list of the locations of county and local-level laws in New York as of December 3, 2009 is available from the author.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0887403412445613">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Data for the study came from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0887403412445613">U.S. Census (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403412445613">NYS OSOM (2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0887403412445613">2010b</xref>), the Office of Housing and Urban Development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0887403412445613">HUD, 2010</xref>), and from prior analysis with Geoda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887403412445613">Anselin, Syabri, &amp; Kho, 2006</xref>). Data on RSO residences were first Geocoded using a three-step process involving both parcel and address points, analyzed using a Nearest Neighbor Analysis (NNA), explained in more detail below, and finally aggregated to the block group level. More information regarding the Geocoding of RSO addresses in this study is available from the author on request. The measurements and data sources for all variables are summarized in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0887403412445613">appendix</xref>, and are explained in more detail below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0887403412445613">
<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>The dependent variable measures the RSO clustering as of September 2010 by using Nearest Neighbor Analysis (NNA), and this measure is aggregated by Census block group. NNA is used to calculate the average distance between pairwise combinations of points for a given number of nearest points. For this study, the NNA essentially measures how close, on average, an RSO is to their nearest five RSO neighbors. Specifically, the NNA measure first calculated the mean distance, in feet, of the five nearest RSO neighbors for every RSO with a valid residential address in the study area (upstate New York). Once the NNA measure was calculated for each RSO in the study area, this measure was aggregated to the block group level by taking the mean NNA for all RSOs in the block group. For block groups with a single RSO, this meant the block group NNA measure was equivalent to that of RSO’s NNA measure. For block groups with multiple RSOs, the block group measure was the mean NNA measure of all RSOs located within that block group. In short, the dependent variable is a measure of the average distance, in feet, of the nearest five RSO neighbors, and is averaged for all RSOs located within each block group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0887403412445613">9</xref></sup> To ensure a normal distribution suitable for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, this measure (the dependent variable) was increased by 1 and then logged.</p>
<p>Because a NNA measure was not available in Census block groups that did not contain any RSOs, this excluded a total of 2,800 block groups in the upstate New York area. The final analyses included a total of 3,056 Census block groups in upstate New York, each of which contained at least one RSO residence, and accounted for approximately 6,615 total RSOs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0887403412445613">10</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0887403412445613">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>Given the logged dependent variable, to ease the interpretation of the coefficients, and to ensure a more normal distribution of the residuals, some of the independent variables were also transformed in a similar manner. In cases where the original distribution of a variable included values that were negative or zero, all values for that variable were increased by the smallest whole number needed to ensure all were positive nonzero values prior to the log transformation. The specific measurement of each variable and, if appropriate, the method of transformation, has been noted in more detail below.</p>
<sec id="section8-0887403412445613">
<title>Residence Restriction Indicators</title>
<sec id="section9-0887403412445613">
<title>Months of residence restriction</title>
<p>The presence of a residence restriction in a block group was measured as the number of months that any residence restriction had applied to the block group as of September 2010. This measure was deemed more appropriate than a dichotomous present/not present measure, as it accounts for differences in the exposure time of a residence restriction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0887403412445613">11</xref></sup> This measure is used in the first model, which tests for linear effects, as well as in the second model, which tests for nonlinear effects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0887403412445613">
<title>Months of residence restriction, squared</title>
<p>Given the potential for a nonlinear relationship between how long the policy has been in place and the effects on RSO residences, the square of the months of residence restriction measure was included in the second model to test for this nonlinearity. The inclusion of both the original variable and the squared (quadratic) variable is a standard way to measure for nonlinearity. As long as potential multicollinearity is considered (as will be discussed later), this should not represent a problem in terms of interpreting overall results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0887403412445613">
<title>Months of residence restriction, 1-23/24-47/48+</title>
<p>An alternative test for a nonlinear relationship uses dichotomous indicators representing the length of time a residence restriction was in place in a block group as of September 2010. In the third model, these indicators are substituted in place of the months and months-squared terms noted previously. There are three such indicators, one for residence restrictions in place between 1 and 23 months, one for residence restrictions in place between 24 and 47 months, and one for residence restrictions in place 48 months or longer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0887403412445613">
<title>Size and scope controls</title>
<p>Dichotomous controls were included in all models to account for the size of the largest residence restriction the block group was subject to as of December 2009 (1,000’ or less, greater than 1,000’), and to identify residence restrictions with comprehensive scopes (i.e., a policy that included locations other than the “typical” set of schools, daycares, parks, and/or playgrounds). These three dichotomous control variables account for differences in the size (1,000’ or less, greater than 1,000’) and scope (presence of a comprehensive scope), which may influence how these policies are associated with RSO clustering.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0887403412445613">
<title>Nearby residence restrictions</title>
<p>Nearby residence restrictions may also influence RSO clustering. For instance, residence restrictions in nearby areas could force RSOs to relocate from nearby block groups in search of housing. Alternatively, nearby residence restrictions may keep RSOs from moving into the general area due to a perception of widespread housing restrictions. In either case, nearby residence restrictions could influence RSO clustering. Given that residence restrictions are passed at the county and local level, and apply to large swaths of block groups at a time, any block group with an existing residence restriction will have at least one adjacent block group with an identical restriction (i.e., a block group from the same town, city, or county). Therefore, it is important to identify block groups that <italic>do not</italic> have their own residence restriction, but that are <italic>adjacent</italic> to block groups that had such a policy as of December 2009. Thus this indicator identifies block groups that lie just outside of the political boundaries of a residence restriction law and, while not directly subject to a residence restriction, may still be indirectly influenced by the policies of their neighbors.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section14-0887403412445613">
<title>Structural Characteristics</title>
<p>As noted earlier, in identifying the association between residence restrictions and RSO clustering, one must account for structural characteristics that are also associated with RSO residences and/or residential clustering. These characteristics include social disorganization (i.e., concentrated disadvantage, residential instability, and ethnic heterogeneity), available and affordable housing, and population density. The structural social disorganization measures of concentrated disadvantage, residential instability, and ethnic heterogeneity were calculated through factor analyses of multiple social and demographic indicators in a manner consistent with prior studies of social disorganization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0887403412445613">Sampson, Raudenbush, &amp; Earls, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0887403412445613">Socia &amp; Stamatel, in press</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section15-0887403412445613">
<title>Concentrated disadvantage</title>
<p>This measure was a factor score based on the following block group characteristics: percent living in poverty, percent unemployed, percent female heads of household with children, and percent non-Hispanic Black residents. All values were first increased by one and then logged.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0887403412445613">
<title>Residential instability</title>
<p>This measure was a factor score based on the following block group characteristics: percent owner-occupied homes and percent residents 5 years and older who have lived in the same house for at least 5 years. All values were first increased by two and then logged.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0887403412445613">
<title>Ethnic heterogeneity</title>
<p>This measure was a factor score based on the following block group characteristics: percent Hispanic residents and percent foreign born residents. All values were first increased by three and then logged.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0887403412445613">
<title>Housing availability</title>
<p>This measure was calculated as the percent of vacant rental units in the block group. All values were first increased by one and then logged.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0887403412445613">
<title>Housing affordability</title>
<p>This measure was calculated as the block group’s median gross rent in 2000, divided by the fair market rent in that housing market for a two bedroom apartment in 2001. Housing markets were defined using data from Housing and Urban Development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0887403412445613">HUD, 2010</xref>). All values were first increased by one and then logged. Furthermore, to ease interpretation, the log-transformed values were reverse coded (multiplied by negative one), so that larger numbers indicate greater affordability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0887403412445613">
<title>Population density</title>
<p>This measure was calculated as the residents per square mile. This measure was logged. While physical land area may also influence RSO housing and the effects of a residence restriction, this measure was highly correlated (<italic>r</italic> &gt; .90) with the population density measure, and substituting one measure for the other did not affect overall results. As such, physical land area was excluded from the final models.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section21-0887403412445613">
<title>Region Controls</title>
<p>Counties in upstate New York have important regional differences that might bias conclusions. For instance, counties in some regions of the state are very rural (e.g., The Adirondacks), while others are generally more urban (e.g., Hudson Valley), and these characteristics influence how close individuals live to one another. To control for any underlying differences between the characteristics of block groups in nine different regions of the state, eight dichotomous indicator variables were included in each models (the ninth was dropped for comparison purposes). Each indicator represented a unique region of the state: Chautauqua-Allegheny, Niagara Frontier, Finger Lakes, Thousand Islands-Seaway, The Adirondacks, Central Leather-Stocking, Capital-Saratoga, The Catskills, and Hudson Valley. A list of the counties contained in each region is available from the author.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section22-0887403412445613">
<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>The analyses utilized multivariate Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression models. With OLS regression, the dependent variable and the standard errors should exhibit a fairly normal distribution, with skewness near 0 and kurtosis near 3. As noted earlier, this required modification of the dependent variable, as well as modification of some of the independent (control) variables (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0887403412445613">appendix</xref>). Furthermore, robust standard errors were used for all model estimates to account for problems stemming from any remaining skewness and kurtosis in the variables as well as for potential bias that could be caused by omitted variables.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0887403412445613">Table 1</xref>, while results from the regression analyses are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0887403412445613">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0887403412445613">3</xref>. Model 1 tests for a linear relationship involving the number of months a residence restriction policy was in place, while Model 2 tests for a nonlinear relationship by the inclusion of the months-squared term (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0887403412445613">Table 2</xref>). Model 3 provides an alternative test for a nonlinear relationship by substituting three dichotomous indicators of how long a residence restriction was in place, in place of the months and months-squared variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0887403412445613">Table 3</xref>). Models present both beta (β) and exponentiated (<italic>e</italic><sup>β</sup>) coefficients, with standard errors provided in parentheses under each coefficient. After all independent variables were included, each model explained 74% of the variation in the dependent variable. Results are discussed in more detail below.</p>

<p>Analysis of the correlation matrix (available from the author) indicated that while some of the control variables had strong correlations (<italic>r</italic> &gt;.60), the only correlation above .80 was between the months of a residence restriction measure and its square.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0887403412445613">12</xref></sup> Further, an analysis of the Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) for each model suggested that aside from the expected collinearity between months of a residence restriction and its squared term in Model 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0887403412445613">Table 2</xref>), multicollinearity is unlikely to be a concern.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0887403412445613">13</xref></sup> As such, it seems is unlikely that model estimates suffered from serious multicollinearity issues, aside from the inclusion of the squared term in the Model 2. However, this also suggests that it will be relatively harder to find significance for the months and months-squared coefficients in Model 2, due to the potential for increased standard errors. This issue will be discussed in more detail later on.</p>
<p>It should be noted that due to the transformation of some of the variables (including the dependent variable), interpretations of the coefficients will vary. For nontransformed independent variables, the most straightforward interpretation method involves examining exponentiated coefficient (<italic>e</italic><sup>β</sup>). That is, by subtracting 1.00 from the exponentiated coefficient and multiplying by 100, one can calculate the expected percent change in the dependent variable (average nearest neighbor distance) given a one-unit change in the independent variable. For the log-transformed independent variables (all structural characteristics), coefficients can be interpreted as elasticities. That is, given coefficient β for the log-transformed variable X, an <italic>N</italic> percent change in log(X) will be associated with a 1-[(<italic>N</italic>/100+1)<sup>β</sup>] percent change in the dependent variable.</p>

<title>Linear Residence Restriction Effects</title>
<p>Results from Model 1 suggest that the presence of a residence restriction was significantly associated RSO clustering at the block group level. However, the overall relationship depended on how long the residence restriction was in place. That is, for every additional month a residence restriction was in place in a block group, RSOs in that block group were expected to live about 1% <italic>closer</italic> to their nearest five RSO neighbors. Thus the longer a residence restriction was in place, the closer RSOs were expected to live to their nearest RSO neighbors. This suggests increased RSO clustering over time.</p>
<p>However, one must also consider the coefficients of the dichotomous indicators of residence restriction size. In Model 1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0887403412445613">Table 2</xref>), the presence of a residence restriction of 1,000’ or less in a block group was associated with RSOs living 22% farther apart, compared to block groups without any residence restrictions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0887403412445613">14</xref></sup> The presence of a residence restriction greater than 1,000’ in a block group was associated with RSOs living 17% farther apart (Model 1, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0887403412445613">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>When these findings are interpreted in combination with the results from the months of residence restriction variable, it suggests that in block groups with relatively <italic>newer</italic> residence restrictions, RSOs lived relatively <italic>farther</italic> apart compared to block groups without residence restrictions. However, every additional month a residence restriction was present was associated with RSOs living 1% closer together.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0887403412445613">15</xref></sup> Thus block groups with residence restrictions older than between 17 and 22 months (depending on the size of the residence restriction) were expected to have RSOs living relatively closer together compared to block groups with relatively newer restrictions, and RSOs living about the same distance apart from each other as in block groups without such restrictions. After this time period, RSOs were expected to become <italic>more</italic> clustered than even the block groups without such restrictions.</p>
<p>Assuming this effect was, in fact, linear in nature (i.e., consistent over time), this suggests that the longer a residence restriction was in place, RSOs were expected to become more and more clustered.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0887403412445613">16</xref></sup> A graph of this linear relationship is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887403412445613">Figure 1</xref>, and shows the percent difference in how close RSOs lived to each other based on the number of months a residence restriction was in place, with the baseline comparison being as the average RSO clustering level in block groups that did not have a residence restriction.</p>

<title>Examining Nonlinear Effects</title>
<p>It seems unlikely that a residence restriction’s effects on RSO clustering would remain consistent month to month for years on end. If this was the case, then after a few decades of a residence restriction, RSOs would all be expected to live in the same house!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0887403412445613">17</xref></sup> Thus it seems more plausible that the effects of a residence restriction change over time. In other words, the effects of a residence restriction on RSO clustering may exhibit a nonlinear relationship. The presence of nonlinear effects was measured in two ways.</p>
<p>The first test for nonlinearity involved the inclusion of a squared term in the analysis based on the number of months a residence restriction was in place (Model 2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0887403412445613">Table 2</xref>). The differences in coefficient signs between months and months-squared (negative and positive, respectively), suggests the <italic>potential</italic> for a nonlinear effect. However, the months-squared term did not reach significance at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 level. Thus measuring nonlinearity using the month-squared term does not allow for confirmation of a nonlinear relationship.</p>
<p>However, as noted earlier, this may be due in part to the very high collinearity between the months and months-squared terms, as indicated by both the correlation matrix and the VIF scores for Model 2 (available from author). As such, one would <italic>expect</italic> difficulty in finding significance in the month-squared term, due to the increased standard error resulting from this multicollinearity.</p>
<p>Given this problem, this study examined an alternative test for nonlinearity in Model 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0887403412445613">Table 3</xref>). In Model 3, dichotomous indicators of the length of time a residence restriction was in place were substituted for both the months and months-squared variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0887403412445613">Table 3</xref>). In essence, the inclusion of these three indicators identified four distinct categories of block groups. The comparison group was block groups without any residence restrictions, while the three indicators represented block groups with residence restrictions between 1 and 23 months old, between 24 and 47 months old, and 48 months or older.</p>
<p>In contrast to the results of Model 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0887403412445613">Table 2</xref>), the results of Model 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0887403412445613">Table 3</xref>) suggest that there <italic>is</italic> a nonlinear temporal relationship between residence restrictions and RSO clustering. That is, in considering the three indicators of residence restriction age, as well as the two indicators of residence restriction size, those block groups with residence restrictions less than about 24 months old were expected to have RSOs living 18% to 24% <italic>farther apart</italic> (i.e., less clustered) compared to block groups <italic>without</italic> residence restrictions. The exact difference depended on whether the size of the residence restriction was small (1,000’ or less) or large (more than 1,000’). However, block groups with residence restrictions older than 23 months (either between 24 and 47 months old, or 48 months or older), were expected to have RSOs living about the <italic>same</italic> distance apart compared to the block groups <italic>without</italic> such restrictions. A graphical example of this nonlinear relationship, based on the three categories of residence restriction age and two categories of residence restriction size, is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0887403412445613">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Effects of residence restrictions on RSO clustering in different time periods.</p>
<p>Note: Residence restriction is abbreviated as RR. Results calculated based on the results of Model 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0887403412445613">Table 3</xref>). RSO clustering represents the average nearest neighbor distance for RSOs. Thus positive values indicate increased distance and reduced RSO clustering, while negative values indicate decreased distance and increased RSO clustering. On the Y axis, 0 is the average nearest neighbor distance for RSOs in block groups without residence restrictions.</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0887403412445613-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>Thus the results of Model 3 suggest there is an initial effect of residence restrictions that tends to decrease RSO clustering (i.e., increase the distance between RSOs). However, this effect diminishes over time, so that after the policy has been in place for about 24 months, RSO clustering has returned to pre-residence restriction levels. However, in contrast to the linear interpretation (Model 1, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0887403412445613">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887403412445613">Figure 1</xref>), <italic>after</italic> RSOs return to their pre-residence restriction levels of clustering, they do not <italic>continue</italic> to become more clustered. Thus the initial effects of the policy (decreased RSO clustering) appear to fade away over time, rather than reverse and continue ad infinitum.</p>

<sec id="section26-0887403412445613">
<title>Residence Restriction Scope</title>
<p>The indicator of a comprehensive scope of a residence restriction policy was not significant in any of the models. This suggests that very comprehensive residence restrictions are not associated with significantly more or less RSO clustering.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0887403412445613">
<title>Nearby Residence Restriction</title>
<p>Block groups that did not have their own residence restriction, but were spatially proximate to at least one block group that did have one in place, were not expected to have RSOs living significantly closer together (or farther apart) in any of the models. This is an important finding, and suggests that simply being <italic>near</italic> locations subject to residence restrictions may not be associated with RSO clustering.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0887403412445613">
<title>Structural Characteristics</title>
<p>As expected, structural block group characteristics were related to RSO clustering in significant and substantive ways, and were also significant as a group (analysis not shown). Specifically, RSOs were expected be significantly more clustered (i.e., live closer together), in block groups exhibiting greater concentrated disadvantage, residential instability, housing availability, housing affordability, and population density. This suggests that structural characteristics can influence the spatial distribution of RSOs, which is not surprising given the prior research on ex-offenders’ limited housing options. However, it also indicates that these are important controls when examining RSO clustering.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0887403412445613">
<title>Region Controls</title>
<p>The region controls in the model were significant as a group in each model (analysis not shown). This suggests the presence of regional differences in terms of RSO clustering in upstate New York, and also suggests that future studies involving very large geographic areas should consider similar controls for different regions. Due to space limitations and for clarity purposes, individual region coefficients are not shown in the results tables, but are available from the author on request.</p>

<sec id="section30-0887403412445613" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The prior literature has suggested that residence restrictions can influence RSO clustering by restricting housing options (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887403412445613">Chajewski &amp; Mercado, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403412445613">Grubesic &amp; Murray, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0887403412445613">Morgan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0887403412445613">Youstin &amp; Nobles, 2009</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403412445613">Berenson and Appelbaum, 2011</xref>). As noted earlier, living near clusters of RSOs may negatively affect residents’ mental and economic health as well as their risk of victimization. However, most studies have focused on large areas (e.g., cities, counties) rather than on subcounty areas like Census tracts or block groups. Furthermore, researchers have found that many RSOs live in violation of the restrictions, which questions the overall association between these policies and RSO housing. This study explored the association between residence restrictions and RSO clustering (i.e., how close RSOs were living to each other) for block groups in upstate New York, while controlling for other characteristics potentially associated with RSO housing.</p>
<p>Findings indicated that residence restrictions were associated with RSO clustering although this association is temporal in nature. That is, new residence restrictions (less than 24 months old) were associated with RSOs living farther apart (decreased RSO clustering), but after about 24 months RSO clustering returned to pre-residence restriction levels as the effects of residence restrictions faded away. These findings make sense given that a new residence restriction may initially leave RSOs with few viable housing options in an area, particularly if law enforcement officials are diligent in enforcing the new restrictions. Such restrictions could lead RSOs to seek housing in rural areas, resulting in increased distance between individual RSOs. Such an explanation is consistent with the earlier findings of both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0887403412445613">Youstin and Nobles (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0887403412445613">Morgan (2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>Thus the effects of residence restrictions appear to be time limited. That is, RSO clustering was only expected to have decreased for the first 2 years a residence restriction was in place, and then RSO clustering returned to pre-restriction levels, but not did continue to increase beyond that. There are three main reasons that may account for this finding.</p>
<p>First, RSOs may become better able to find unrestricted housing the longer a residence restriction is in place. This would likely occur from trial and error, as probation and parole officers deny or accept petitions to move to certain addresses, thus informing RSOs about which streets and homes fall within the restricted buffer zone, and which do not. An interesting future study could examine how RSOs found acceptable housing in areas with residence restrictions and whether this knowledge came from housing approvals and denials, or instead, from other RSOs who were more familiar with the local restrictions.</p>
<p>Second, it is possible that the longer a residence restriction is in place, the fewer resources are devoted to enforcing it. If this were the case, then there should be many instances of RSOs being denied housing or forcibly evicted from existing restricted housing (assuming no grandfathering provision) in the months following the passage of a residence restriction in an area, and then these events should trail off gradually over time as enforcement wanes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0887403412445613">18</xref></sup> There appears to be no research examining whether the enforcement of residence restrictions has changed over time, and this represents an opportunity for future research. This also raises the question to policymakers of whether law enforcement “buy in” to the policy and allocate sufficient resources to enforcing it. That is, if enforcement typically wanes over time, policymakers may need to seek ways to keep enforcement efforts up over time.</p>
<p>A third and related explanation may lie in the relatively high proportion of RSOs found to be living in violation of a residence restriction. For instance, prior research has found compliance rates with residence restrictions to be around 50% or less in some areas (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403412445613">Berenson &amp; Appelbaum, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887403412445613">Hughes &amp; Burchfield, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0887403412445613">Tewksbury &amp; Mustaine, 2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0887403412445613">Youstin &amp; Nobles, 2009</xref>). In fact, noncompliance may be a problem for much of upstate New York, as has been suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403412445613">Berenson and Appelbaum’s (2011)</xref> examination of two upstate New York counties. After initial efforts to come into compliance, RSOs may increasingly fall out of compliance with residence restrictions over time, and if combined with decreased enforcement efforts, violations should increase dramatically. If this is the case, then it is not surprising that block groups with older residence restrictions do not appear much different in terms of RSO clustering than block groups without such restrictions. This could be confirmed with an analysis of whether RSOs who were subject to older residence restrictions were more likely to be out of compliance compared to RSOs subject to relatively newer ones.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0887403412445613">19</xref></sup> Unfortunately, this would require an offender-by-offender analysis of compliance with existing residence restrictions, which is outside the scope of the present study.</p>
<p>One interesting finding was that although the <italic>presence</italic> of a newer residence restriction appeared to be associated with decreased RSO clustering, <italic>differences</italic> in the size and scope of the residence restriction had little influence. This may seem counterintuitive, as larger, more comprehensive policies may be expected to restrict more housing, and thus have a unique influence on RSO clustering. Yet given that even moderately sized residence restrictions can result in a severe shortage of unrestricted housing (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0887403412445613">Socia, 2011a</xref>), it may be that the most restricted block groups simply had no RSOs living in them, and were thus excluded from the present study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0887403412445613">20</xref></sup> However, a block group-level analysis of the size or scope of the residence restriction compared to the presence or absence of any RSOs found no clear evidence that this was the case (analysis not shown). Instead, it may be that size and scope of a residence restriction were less important than its mere presence because of the relative similarity of residence restriction sizes and scopes across upstate New York.</p>
<p>Overall, the results of the study indicate that while residence restrictions were initially associated with decreased RSO clustering, this association depended on the length of time a residence restriction was in place. That is, the presence of a residence restriction was associated initially with RSOs living farther apart, but for every additional month the residence restriction was in place, RSOs were expected to live closer and closer together. In fact, block groups with residence restrictions at least 2 years old did not look much different block groups without any residence restrictions. However, the effects of residence restrictions appear to be nonlinear. After about 2 years, RSOs have returned to pre-residence restriction clustering levels, but RSO clustering does not continue to increase beyond that period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-0887403412445613">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study suffers from a few distinct limitations. One such limitation concerns the assumptions about RSO compliance that were previously addressed in the discussion. Specifically, residence restrictions only affect RSO clustering to the extent that RSOs comply with the restrictions, which may be an untenable assumption. Unfortunately, these data would have to be calculated on an offender-by-offender basis due to various grandfathering provisions in residence restrictions, specific exemptions to compliance, and other factors that cannot easily be determined for such a large and geographically dispersed population of RSOs. As such, obtaining these data was not feasible given the wide area of coverage in the study, and so it was assumed for the purposes of this study that compliance rates with residence restrictions were, if not substantial, then at least fairly similar across the study area.</p>
<p>The generalizability of these findings is another limitation. Given that the area under study included only block groups in the upstate New York area, it is unclear whether these findings can be generalized to areas outside of this region. However, given that this is one of the largest studies of its kind, and the findings generally support the findings of the prior literature, there appears to be a common (albeit temporary) link between residence restrictions and RSO clustering. This suggests that the findings of the present study <italic>may</italic> be generalizable to other areas of the country, or at least those that share similar social, legal, and spatial characteristics.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important limitation involves the lack of historical/longitudinal data when examining the association between residence restrictions and RSO clustering. Unfortunately, historical data on RSO residences were unavailable at the time of the study, and thus this study was limited to examining <italic>association</italic> rather than <italic>causation</italic>. Future research can address this limitation by comparing RSO clustering between two or more time periods. Researchers are cautioned to plan ahead for such studies to ensure that historical data on RSO residences are available to analyze.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-0887403412445613">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>This study has called for a number of different avenues of future research. One such avenue involves replicating this study using data from other states and/or longitudinal data on RSO residences. Such research would both help support the findings and generalizability of the current study as well as help confirm the nonlinear temporal relationship between residence restrictions and RSO clustering. Another avenue for future research involves examining the compliance rates of RSOs across many different types of areas and over time to see if noncompliance, while likely high, is stable or otherwise consistent. A third avenue for future research involves examining the enforcement of residence restrictions over time to see whether enforcement measures (e.g., forced moves, citations for noncompliance) trail off the longer the restriction is in place. A fourth avenue for future research involves interviewing RSOs to understand how they discover suitable housing options, whether that comes from trial and error in submitting potential addresses to probation or parole officers, from discussing housing issues with other RSOs, or from the help of friends and family.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section33-0887403412445613">
<title>Policy Implications and Conclusions</title>
<p>Perhaps the most important finding of this study is that while residence restrictions are initially associated with decreased RSO clustering, this association depends largely on the length of time a residence restriction is in place, and appears to be nonlinear in nature. Thus, while a residence restriction may initially benefit some residents as RSOs become less clustering, in terms of decreased levels of fear or victimization risk and increased housing values, this effect would be short lived.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while some residents would benefit from decreased RSO clusters near their homes, other residents may experience unintended consequences if these relocating RSOs move into their neighborhoods. In short, the potential benefits of a residence restriction to some residents would come at the expense of other residents. Decreased RSO clustering may also increase the burden on law enforcement officials who are monitoring these RSOs.</p>
<p>However, if there are unintended consequences to living closer to RSOs, then residence restrictions may be useful in distributing these consequences across a wider geographic area as RSOs move farther away from each other. Residence restrictions may thus initially support some researcher’s calls for spatial equity in the distribution of RSOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403412445613">Grubesic &amp; Murray, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887403412445613">Hughes &amp; Burchfield, 2008</xref>). However, this does not mean that these policies would have long-term effects.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether policymakers are interested in distributing the risks more equitably among residents, this study suggests that residence restrictions’ effects on RSO clustering are inherently short term in nature. Thus, while implementing these policies may be a sound political move supported by constituents, they do not appear to have <italic>long-term</italic> effects on RSO clustering. Thus the potential consequences or benefits of a residence restriction may eventually be nullified as RSO clustering slowly returns to pre-residence restriction levels.</p>
<p>This means that policymakers should not expect their decision to implement a residence restriction to have long-term beneficial effects on the mental health, economic health, or physical safety of their constituents. As noted earlier, it also suggests that policymakers should work to keep enforcement efforts up over time. This may require working closely with law enforcement officials when considering and drafting these laws, so that the final policy has sufficient buy-in to be enforced for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>The findings of the present study also reinforce the need to study the effects of policies <italic>before</italic> they are implemented. It is only with carefully considered research evidence that the effects of these policies can be predicted. Furthermore, this study found that the long-term effects of these policies are hard to predict and are likely nonlinear in nature. These effects must also be disentangled from regional and/or structural characteristics that may also be associated with RSO clustering. The full consequences of these policies are only just now emerging, and the results of this study suggest their overall effects on RSO clustering may be time-sensitive and inherently short term.</p>
<p>Overall, it seems hard to justify the implementation of residence restrictions given the results of this study. While the passage of a residence restriction may result in potential benefits for certain residents as a result of the initial decrease in RSO clustering, these benefits would likely disappear within just a couple of years as RSO clustering reverted to pre-restriction levels. Furthermore, it may create burdens on law enforcement officials. One must also acknowledge the lack of evidence showing that these policies reduce RSO recidivism, the potential unintended consequences they can have on RSOs’ reentry success, and the potential legal issues they can raise. When these consequences are examined in light of the results of the present study, it seems that policymakers who implement these policies may see the initial benefits disappearing rather quickly, and would then have to deal with numerous unintended consequences that remain. Thus, residence restrictions appear to be, at best, a short-term solution to a community’s problems, but may also be, at worst, a largely symbolic political gesture devoid of any long-term benefits.</p>

<p>The upstate New York area was specifically selected so that the results of the analyses would be more applicable to the “average” Census block group found throughout most of the state (and throughout the United States), rather than being overly influenced by the vast number of extremely dense block groups contained within the counties in and around New York City (i.e., the New York Metropolitan Statistical Area; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0887403412445613">Socia, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0887403412445613">Stage &amp; von Meyer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0887403412445613">U.S. Census, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, Upstate New York is a useful setting for the study, as it contains counties with a wide variation of demographic, social, and geographic characteristics, and it has a mixture of counties and local-level jurisdictions with and without residence restrictions in place.</p></fn>

<p>This is explained with routine activities theory: when more RSOs live near an individual resident (due to increased RSO clustering), the odds that the resident interacts with an RSO increases, which also increases the odds that an acquaintance of the resident is an RSO. Even if the risk of recidivism for individual RSOs does not increase with increased RSO clustering, the resident would be exposed to more <italic>potential</italic> motivated offenders, thus increasing their chances of sexual victimization. The author would like to thank an anonymous reviewer for raising this issue, and Walker and colleagues (2001) for making this connection explicit.</p></fn>

<p>However, one study found that RSOs were more likely to travel to other neighborhoods in search of potential victims to reduce the likelihood that they would be recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887403412445613">Minnesota Department of Corrections, 2003</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>Alternatively, some policymakers may believe that limiting the number of residents exposed to these consequences represents a benefit to the community overall, despite being a detriment to a small number of individual residents. Although it seems unlikely that a policymaker would actually say this out loud and be reelected.</p></fn>

<p>While Putnam County is technically located within the NYMSA boundaries, and thus would normally be grouped together with other New York City counties, it is actually much closer demographically to counties in upstate New York (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0887403412445613">Socia, 2011a</xref>), and is thus included in the present study.</p></fn>

<p>As noted previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0887403412445613">Socia (in press-a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0887403412445613">in press-b)</xref>, technically New York does have a state residence restriction that applies only to RSOs on probation or parole that are either designated high risk (i.e., Level 3) or whose victims were under 18 at the time of offense (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0887403412445613">New York State Executive Law</xref>, Article 12B § 259-c(14); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887403412445613">New York State Penal Law</xref>, Title E § 65.10(4-a)). However, this restriction only prohibits offenders from knowingly <italic>entering</italic> school grounds, and while the definition of school grounds includes public areas (parks, parking lots, stores, etc.) and/or vehicles located within 1,000 feet of the boundary line of a school, it does not appear to include private residential housing located within this “buffer zone.” As such, the law does not appear to be an actual <italic>residence</italic> restriction, but rather a movement and/or loitering restriction.</p></fn>

<p>NYS OSOM (2010a) declares that the compilation of local residence restriction laws is for information purposes only, and the accuracy cannot be guaranteed. Nevertheless, it represents the most complete and thorough compilation of county and local laws available for the state. As of early 2011, the list of laws was no longer hosted on the NYS OSOM web site, but is available from the author on request.</p></fn>

<p>In calculating the mean distance to the five closest RSO neighbors for a given RSO, the RSO neighbors did not have to live in the same Census block group to be considered by the measure. Limiting the NNA to the five nearest RSO neighbors ensured the NNA considered only the closest RSOs, rather than all RSOs in the study area or only RSOs in the Census block group.</p></fn>

<p>One of the limitations of this measure is that it does not provide any results for neighborhoods that do not contain any RSO residences. However, since RSO clustering is unlikely to be a concern for neighborhoods without <italic>any</italic> RSOs, the results should be more relevant for those neighborhoods that are actually affected by such clustering.</p></fn>

<p>Since RSO residences were measured as of September 2010, while residence restriction legislation indicators were gathered as of December 2009, the minimum amount of time any residence restriction was in place in a given neighborhood or county in this model was 9 months. This minimum time period allows for the residence restriction to affect RSO clustering even if these effects take some time to develop. While it is possible that some changes to a small minority of residence restriction policies occurred between December 2009 and September 2010, it seems unlikely that were would have been enough time for these changes to significantly influence results.</p></fn>

<p>Specifically, the mean VIF was 2.55 for Model 1 (the linear model), and 6.65 for Model 2 (the nonlinear model). In Model 2, the only variables with VIF scores above 6.0 or with tolerances below .10 were months of residence restriction and the squared term. In Model 3 (the alternative nonlinear model) the mean VIF was 2.68, with no variables with VIF scores above 6.0 or with tolerances below .10.</p></fn>

<p>This percent change was calculated by taking the exponentiated coefficient for the “RR size 1,000’ or less (1.22), subtracting 1.00 from it, and multiplying the result by 100. Since (1.22 – 1.00) × 100 = 22, this indicates a 22% increase in the dependent variable when a residence restriction of 1,000’ or less is present, ceteris paribus.</p></fn>

<p>While a 1% change per month this does not sound like a large effect, consider that RSO were expected to live 12% closer to their five nearest RSO neighbors for every additional year a residence restriction was in place in a block group. After 5 years, RSOs would be expected to live 60% closer to their neighbors.</p></fn>

<p>Examinations of the differences in average physical size between neighborhoods that did and did not have a residence restriction in place found no significant differences (analysis not shown). Furthermore, as differences in the population density were controlled for in the analysis, these differences in RSO clustering do not appear to be the results of differences in the “types” of neighborhoods that are more or less likely to pass residence restrictions.</p></fn>

<p>However, if this hypothetical house was located outside of their jurisdiction, it is likely that at least <italic>some</italic> policymaker would support this outcome. As noted by Georgia Representative Jerry Keen, “If [the effects of the laws] become too onerous and too inconvenient, [RSOs] may want to live somewhere else . . . and I don’t care where, as long as it’s not in Georgia” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887403412445613">Badertscher, 2005</xref>, p. B1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887403412445613">Geraghty, 2007</xref>). Indeed, the “not in my backyard” mentality concerning where RSOs live has been noted by a number of scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0887403412445613">Levenson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0887403412445613">Yung, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0887403412445613">Zgoba, 2011</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>This, of course, depends on the validity of the registry information. If RSOs who were not in compliance with residence restrictions were less likely to either initially register or keep their registry information updated, then this may influence any findings regarding compliance rates that use registry data. The author would like to thank Dr. Elizabeth Brown for her helpful comments regarding this issue.</p></fn>

<p>Indeed, the average neighborhood size in the study is only about nine square miles, and so a 1,000-foot residence restriction, when applied to a single location, can restrict up to 5% of the neighborhood (analysis not shown). A 1,500-foot policy could result in up to 11% of the neighborhood, while a 2,000-foot policy could restrict up to 20% of the neighborhood (analysis not shown). Given that neighborhoods likely have multiple schools, daycares, parks, and other child congregation locations within their boundaries, even a moderate-sized residence restriction may lead to a severe shortage of unrestricted housing (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0887403412445613">Socia, 2011a</xref>), and thus a higher probability of containing no RSOs and thus being excluded from the present study.</p></fn>
