<p>Rebalancing is the latest buzzword in macroeconomics. It is used as a catch-all term to describe the adjustments necessary to transition from the Great Recession to full economic recovery. Yet as the country forecasts show in this issue of the <italic>Review</italic>, achieving rebalancing with the current set of economic policies is very far from assured.</p>
<p>Rebalancing is also at the centre of the UK government's strategy for growth. The <italic>Plan for Growth</italic> states that the economy became seriously unbalanced and heavily indebted, citing high house prices and low household savings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-002795011222000103">1</xref></sup> There is indeed a broad agreement that prior to the crisis households increased borrowing and house prices rose sharply. Yet there are important differences in the interpretation of these trends. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) points out that the rise in household borrowing has been matched by a rise in financial assets and so it plays down the need for rebalancing. It forecasts that the ratio of household debt relative to income will rise each year over the forecast period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-002795011222000103">2</xref></sup> By contrast, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) presents an empirical study of similar periods of rising debt and house prices and shows that they are usually followed by weaker consumer spending and a shift to lower debt to income ratios.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-002795011222000103">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The decline in global real interest rates, associated with central banks' response to globalisation, clearly provided a favourable backdrop for borrowing. This <italic>Commentary</italic> suggests that the rise in households' income inequality may have been an additional cause for the emergence of imbalances. In the years prior to the crisis income inequality widened, which does not appear to have been matched by wider consumption inequality. For total consumption to rise in line with income this requires more saving to be intermediated from high to low income households. This process provides an explanation of why the volume of financial flows grew well in excess of output growth. Innovations in mortgage market finance provided a means of connecting lower income households with the pool of savings of the higher end of the income distribution. This suggests that there may be more to imbalances than implied from the aggregate data.</p>
<sec id="section1-002795011222000103">
<title>The story so far</title>
<p>To put household imbalances into context it is useful to start with the international investment position (IIP).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-002795011222000103">4</xref></sup> This is the difference between total external assets and liabilities and indicates overall national net indebtedness. For most of the past three decades national saving has been less than domestic investment, requiring foreign borrowing to meet the shortfall. The IIP of −£348bn in 2010 is the difference between two very large stocks, but shows that we are increasingly becoming a nation of net debtors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-002795011222000103">5</xref></sup> However, around £300bn of the fall in the IIP occurred in the six years leading up to the crisis, largely as a result of successive current account deficits. To put this into context, if the UK were not to rely on net foreign borrowing, the average national savings rate of 13 per cent over the past three years, together with the capital—output ratio of 2.2 and an assumed depreciation rate of 4 per cent is consistent with steady state growth of less than 2 per cent per annum.</p>
<p>While the UK is becoming increasingly indebted as a nation, whether this necessitates rebalancing depends on what the borrowed funds were used for. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-002795011222000103">Figure 1</xref> shows the accumulation of financial assets and liabilities as a share of output for each sector of the economy. The difference in the accumulation of assets and liabilities for each sector must equal net foreign borrowing. The most striking observation is that from the late 1990s until the crisis households ran down their net financial assets, in other words they were dis-saving. Over this period the average household saving rate fell from 9.5 per cent in 1997 to only 2.7 per cent when the crisis began, even before taking account of depreciation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-002795011222000103">6</xref></sup> Yet this trend was offset by the increasing accumulation of net financial assets in the corporate sector. Some economists argue that since households largely own the corporate sector (leaving aside foreign ownership), the financial health of households is in fact much better than it first appears and simply looking at the dis-saving of households creates a false impression as the corporate sector is effectively saving on their behalf. Once animal spirits revive, corporate cash balances can be drawn down in an investment led recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-002795011222000103">7</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>However, even the financial flows across sectors which subtract debits from credits do not reveal total indebtedness. When the solvency condition of borrowers is questioned the absolute size of credits and debits is of first order significance. Some households may be asset rich and others highly indebted and there is no automatic mechanism by which one negates the other. Even countries with enormous holdings of net foreign assets, such as Japan, can obviously have debt crises, only the dynamics play out in a very different manner. If the degree of financial innovation in the past decade has affected the real economy then one would expect the aggregate financial flows, the sum of assets and liabilities, to have risen in proportion to output over time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-002795011222000103">Figure 2</xref> shows debt relative to GDP for the three domestic sectors of the economy. National saving has indeed been less than investment for decades, yet the sharp rise in gross private non-financial (households and firms) borrowing began in the late 1990s. The rise in borrowing between 2000 and 2006 was £1.4tn (£0.7bn in the household sector), far in excess of the rise in output or net borrowing from the external sector.</p>

</fig>
<p>The cause for this rise in debt is usually ascribed to the prolonged decline in global real interest rates associated with the so-called ‘global saving glut’. With respect to the household sector, two interpretations have emerged. The benign view is that the increase in borrowing was matched by financial and real asset accumulation and there was no consumption boom as spending as a share of GDP was broadly stable. The only fly in the ointment is that the banking sector is impaired, which will limit the supply of credit. This roughly characterises the OBR view.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-002795011222000103">8</xref></sup> The more malign view is that the increase in borrowing to finance house purchases is a leveraged investment and consumption rose faster than income as the saving ratio fell.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-002795011222000103">9</xref></sup> When house prices fall this creates a loss for households and a possible loss for the lending bank and a higher cost of credit. Only when the debt to income ratio is much lower will consumers be able to spend freely again and bankers feel comfortable lending. The IMF highlight this process in the latest <italic>World Economic Outlook</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-002795011222000103">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Household budget constraints</title>
<p>If the cause of the increase in borrowing was only the decline in real interest rates then it is difficult to see why this persistent trend would lead to the deepest recession for eighty years. An alternative hypothesis is that the persistent rise in income inequality created the incentive for a rise in financial intermediation between high and lower income households over and above any change in aggregate saving. These trends have lead to parallels being drawn in the US between the Great Depression of the 1930s and this Great Recession.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-002795011222000103">11</xref></sup> The current Bank of England Governor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-002795011222000103">King (1994)</xref> emphasised that debt deflation depends critically on the distribution of debts. Kumhof and Ranciere (2010) present a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model linking inequality to greater financial intermediation and leverage in household balance sheets.</p>
<p>Income inequality in the UK has had two distinct phases, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-002795011222000103">figure 3</xref>. The first phase began at the start of the 1980s where the Gini coefficient for household disposable income rose from 0.25 to 0.33 a decade later, then fluctuated and edged marginally higher. The rise in inequality was across the income distribution and common to other Anglo-Saxon countries. The second phase was much more concentrated, with the top 1 per cent of earners having an increasing share of total disposable income. The top 0.1 per cent of earners shows a similar path and this trend is common across many countries. Note that the phases occur at different times. Broad inequality rose sharply throughout the 1980s, but increased only slowly since the early 1990s. In contrast, inequality at the top continued its strong upward trend into the 2000s.</p>
<fig id="fig3-002795011222000103" position="float">
<label>Figure 3.</label>
<caption><p>UK income inequality</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_002795011222000103-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The rise in income inequality was not matched by a similar rise in consumption inequality. Blundell and Etheridge (2010) use the Family Expenditure Survey (FES) to show that while inequality between different levels of consumption rose (although not for all measures), this has been much less pronounced than the increase in income inequality. Again there appears to have been two separate phases. Consumption inequality rose throughout the 1980s, albeit slower than income inequality, but has barely increased since then. In theory at least, if families at the top and bottom of the income distribution swap places each year, consumption smoothing over time would be consistent with widening income and constant consumption inequality. However, this level of mobility is not seen in the data. According to the OECD, the UK has very low income mobility (and has failed to improve).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-002795011222000103">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rising income inequality (without mobility) and constant consumption inequality can happen only if those at the bottom of the income distribution borrow more and/or those at the top of the distribution save more. This indeed appears to have been the case. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-002795011222000103">Van de Ven (2011)</xref> uses the FES and selects families with heads aged 25 to show that the saving ratios of those in the lowest income quintile fell steadily during the period of widening income inequality and sharply in the decade before the crisis, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-002795011222000103">figure 4</xref>. This result is not generally sensitive to the age of the family. A forthcoming NIESR study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-002795011222000103">Lucchino and Morelli (2012)</xref> shows that the saving ratio of the lowest income quartile households of all ages is negative and declining, indicating an increase in borrowing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-002795011222000103">13</xref></sup> This corroborates evidence from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), which shows a steady decline of the (negative) saving rate of the lowest income quintile in addition to a rise in the saving ratio at the highest income quintile. If the decline in the real interest rate was a common shock then there is no reason to see this divergent behaviour unless this is due to lower income households becoming less credit constrained. Analysis by Crossley and O'Dea (2012) using the BHPS shows that between 2000 and 2005 financial assets of households above median income rose sharply with almost no change for those below median income.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-002795011222000103">12</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>The rise in income inequality relative to consumption inequality creates the demand and supply conditions for greater financial intermediation. If lower income households increase their borrowing, even if this leaves aggregate household saving unchanged (offset by higher income households increase in saving), then this creates a credit from one household to another. This process is entirely consistent with the increase in financial intermediation relative to GDP since the late 1990s. Because there is both a demand and supply for credit many usual indicators such as the price of credit would give an ambiguous signal. This is perhaps a ‘micro’ example of Hyun Shin's (2011) suggestion that the crisis has been a ‘global banking glut’ (emphasising the role of shadow banking) rather than a ‘global savings glut’.</p>
<p>It also explains why aggregate data may indeed show stable financial net worth yet at the same time many lower income households became heavily indebted.</p>

<sec id="section3-002795011222000103">
<title>Financial intermediation process</title>
<p>An increase in the volume of loans to households who are saving less or borrowing more requires access to additional funds to prevent the cost of borrowing from rising. The evidence suggests that the incremental borrowing was by households with lower incomes. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-002795011222000103">Financial Service Authority's (2011)</xref> excellent review of mortgage markets provides some clear examples of how mortgage terms were eased to allow greater access to mortgage finance without simply resorting to benchmarks such as loan to values. For example, 43 per cent of outstanding mortgages today are interest-only loans of which around two-thirds do not have repayment vehicles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-002795011222000103">14</xref></sup> Perhaps most striking is the sheer volume of mortgage products shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-002795011222000103">figure 5</xref>. On the eve of the crisis there were 12,000 different mortgage products of which two-thirds were for credit-impaired borrowers. Both examples suggest that the borrowers were increasingly concentrated below the mean in the income distribution.</p>

</fig>
<p>This is certainly not the same old story of banks just taking on too much credit risk. Some economists point out that because loan to value ratios were not excessive, and that losses on banks' mortgage loan books have been relatively low, credit conditions were not overtly lax.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-002795011222000103">15</xref></sup> These facts may be correct, but the interpretation may not. The innovation in banking finance over the past decade is how loans are funded. It is no longer an issue of the riskiness of an asset given the deposits in place, but the risk of the joint decision on asset quality and method of funding. For UK banks it was not the mortgages in the banking books which housed the big risks but the method by which mortgages were funded (and securities subsequently held in trading books). This allowed low cost mortgages to be supplied to meet the demand for credit.</p>
<p>This transformation in the UK housing finance system is consistent with this recycling of saving. The UK mortgage backed securities grew to become a £280bn market in eight years to 2008. This is equivalent to funding 40 per cent of the total increase in mortgages over that period. According to the government's independent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-002795011222000103">Mortgage Finance: Interim Analysis (2008)</xref>, around 65 per cent (or £182bn) of the securities were sold overseas (the cumulative current account deficit over this period was £223bn). This may also have been one of the reasons why the UK ran persistent current account deficits without pressure on sterling. A large proportion of the investor base was the so-called leveraged investor community (including the banks themselves) who were prepared to buy short-dated securities from banks' structured investment vehicles. These vehicles enabled borrowers to tap into a savings pool of which a significant source of the funds would ultimately be savings from higher income households. The risk for the issuing banks was in creating a series of short-term liabilities to fund fundamentally long-term mortgage loans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-002795011222000103">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The case for income inequality as an additional cause of the rise in household imbalances leaves some questions open. It is unclear that the impact of rising inequality can be identified as a separate influence from global real interest rates on the emergence of household imbalances. There are benefits of this hypothesis over real interest rates: first, it explains the differences in spending behaviour across income groups; second, it provides a reason for the rise in the volume of financial transactions relative to national saving; and third, it is consistent with the observed process of financial intermediation. There is also an intriguing question of whether the recycling was of saving in mortgage finance (through shadow banks), and was demand led from lower income households or supply led from the higher income households. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-002795011222000103">Rajan (2010)</xref> argues that in the US financial deregulation was a policy response to appease the consequences of rising inequality. An alternative suggestion from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-002795011222000103">Acemoglu (2011)</xref> is that the financial deregulation enabled the creation of products to meet the needs of those with funds to invest which in turn lowered the cost of borrowing. In the UK the timing is certainly more consistent with the supply-led interpretation.</p>

<title>Zombie households</title>
<p>The OBR's assessment is entirely consistent when looking only at the aggregate data. Our concern is that this masks the significant distributional consequences. Just as in Japan, the aggregate figures can be very misleading. Prospects for the household sector are very different depending on which segment of the sector one considers. This is also true across regions in the UK. The Bank of England's latest mortgage repayment data show no sign of any change in mortgage repayment behaviour. Of course it may be the case that this is because households do not feel any need to rebalance or reduce their debt. This interpretation would be at odds with surveys showing consumers' assessment of their personal financial situation either at, or close to, the lowest on record. The FSA's analysis of sample datasets collected between 2005–8 of mortgage borrowers looked at how much money households had left after paying living expenses and mortgage payments. They found that 46 per cent had no money left or a shortfall. Based on these figures the assumption that households are about to increase their liabilities to income ratio out of choice strikes us as optimistic.</p>
<p>If this analysis is valid and the increase in borrowing was more than usually skewed towards the lower end of the income distribution, then there is a risk of stasis in parts of the housing market. According to the FSA's <italic>Forbearance Review</italic> for the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee, between 5–8 per cent of all mortgages outstanding could be subject to lenders' forbearance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-002795011222000103">17</xref></sup> This has a familiar ring of the zombie firms in Japan which were insolvent but the banks would not close loans to avoid crystallising a loss. This merely makes credit conditions worse for the rest of the economy. In this situation banks have little incentive to crystallise losses and almost zero opportunity cost in maintaining the loan. This comes down to a gamble on recovery benefiting lower income households. If the gamble does not pay off, the result will be a very low activity equilibrium in the housing market in certain parts of the country.</p>
<p>How could a government wedded to austerity improve this situation? This is the perfect opportunity to reform the UK system of housing finance. The next move in official interest rates will be a tightening, so there is no time like the present. This should involve a three-step simultaneous process. First, banks that are owned by tax payers must be made whole without the continuing support of the state. Failure to do so will lead banks to continue to gamble on the ‘one-day-a-full-recovery’ and not close on bad loans. Second, a review of which mortgages really need modification (part forgiveness) to enable them to be repaid. There may be few or many. For all the cries of moral hazard, debt crises always end up with burden sharing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-002795011222000103">18</xref></sup> Both of these steps require additional capital, but then the shortage of capital is already a contingent liability of the government. And third, we need a transparent, regulated and robust mortgage securitisation market suitable for the decades ahead. This must deliver securities attractive to the domestic and long-term investor base. Canada and Australia offer good examples of how governments can support (without subsidising) development of such markets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-002795011222000103">19</xref></sup> The UK financial system requires Roosevelt-like vision and reform to create a system that best serves the interests of households and businesses.</p>
