<p>Although I am firmly in the “sandwich” period of my life, the pressures in our family are not the typical child-rearing/parent-care balancing act. Rather, our adult daughter is the caretaker of an elderly woman, while my husband and I try to manage his father’s similar needs from 125 miles away. With this in mind, I read <italic>Forced to Care: Coercion and Caregiving in America</italic> with interest. What might Glenn provide that would elucidate why caregiving in the United States is typically provided by women, most often women of color, who are underpaid and underrespected? Further, despite the need for a wide variety of skills, these women are doing work that virtually no one deems professional.</p>
<p>In this well-written and carefully researched book, Evelyn Nakano Glenn, professor of women’s studies and ethnic studies at UC Berkeley, looks at historical, cultural, and social events that have driven our expectations around caregiving. Whether the care is provided in the home, in a home-like setting, or in a facility/institution, the job quality characteristics are the same: low pay and marginalized work. How did this happen? Why is our model so different from other countries? Glenn begins by looking at current trends and ends by posing future possibilities. In the first chapter she examines who is doing the caregiving, and she finishes the book by considering alternatives that could move us toward a truly “caring society.”</p>
<p>In between, Glenn examines social and legal precedents from colonial and early republican times when slavery and indentured servitude were the norm. Thus began the pattern of care as women’s work, albeit unpaid whether provided by slaves or members of the family. From post-Civil War and into the twentieth century, people of color and women were limited in educational opportunities and the types of jobs they could hold. Paid caregiving became firmly entrenched as women’s—particularly poor women’s—work.</p>
<p>In addition to the legal precedents, early in the twentieth century there was a broad move to use homemaking and caregiving as a way to reform women and girls, including those who were incarcerated or paroled, Native American girls, and new immigrants. These programs typically included “outplacement” in white homes as unpaid domestic help, furthering the practice of caring work being done by those with less. In an interesting historical side note, records show that the reform movement did not carry over into African American communities, and in fact that African American families kept their children in school, rather than send them to work at a young age, at a much higher rate than poor white or immigrant families. The realization that the path out of poverty was through education appeared very early in this community.</p>
<p>From the 1920s through the 1980s, courts upheld the obligation of a wife to care for her husband even in the presence of a contract suggesting otherwise. What began as a moral duty became a legal obligation. This family obligation has been furthered by legislatures, compensation boards, and courts who are frequently at odds about whether, how much, and when to pay a spouse or family member for caretaking. While there has been improvement in using social services funds to pay for care provided by a family member, the record is inconsistent, and frequently those giving care have to do without themselves, as there are rarely health care, retirement benefits, or overtime pay, regardless of the hours worked.</p>
<p>
<italic>Forced to Care: Coercion and Caregiving in America</italic> provides a thorough and fascinating look at the evolution of how our culture considers and compensates caretaking. Looking at where we are today, even with the advent of unionization of many in-home caretakers, there has been little change from our history of relegating care work to those with less education, little cultural capital, and who are primarily female.</p>
<p>This book would be an excellent reference for organizers and labor educators who work in and with the caregiving community. It explains how we arrived at our current state and provides suggestions and encouragement to begin a social revolution, legally and culturally, to change how we view, value, and compensate those who care.</p>
