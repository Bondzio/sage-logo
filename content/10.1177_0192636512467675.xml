<abstract>
<p>This qualitative study examined the actions of district and school leaders in changing from a traditional age-based grade-level structure to a standards-based student grouping model in a Western school district. Based on interview, observation, and artifact data collected over 5 years, the findings identify specific leadership actions that advanced fundamental cultural, structural, and procedural changes in schools and classrooms across the district regarding student achievement of the state’s learning standards, as well as the challenges encountered in the change process. Because of the variance in size, diversity, and socioeconomic status of the three communities that comprised the school district, the findings address community and district contextual factors that promoted or impeded the change process.</p>

<p>Helping every student demonstrate achievement of learning standards has been the focus of educators since the adoption of the No Child Left Behind reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Schools Act of 2001 over a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192636512467675">Vogel, 2010</xref>). A plethora of reform initiatives have been implemented during that time, ranging from teacher quality and effectiveness policies to the restructuring of schools that have not demonstrated the required adequate yearly progress of student achievement, changing the people who teach and run these schools, and the adoption of a multitude of new reading and math programs in districts across the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192636512467675">Ravitch, 2010</xref>). Only a handful of districts have implemented the basic structural change at the classroom level of grouping students according to the standard level that each student is working toward proficiency on, providing targeted instruction on the elements of that standard at that level, and then allowing students to move on to the next standard level once proficiency has been demonstrated at any time during a semester or year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192636512467675">Vogel, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This study examines leadership of the change process regarding the implementation of standards-based student groupings. While leading change at the district and school levels is always essential for continuous school improvement, the implementation of standards-based student groupings is perhaps even more critical in its potential to more fully meet students’ learning needs and increase student achievement. The context of standards-based educational reform will first be discussed, followed by a description of how the case study district in this study was identified, a description of the methodology used, and a detailed description of the case study district. Findings are then presented, followed by a summary and recommendations for secondary school leaders.</p>
<sec id="section1-0192636512467675">
<title>Standards-Based Educational Reform and Student Grouping</title>
<p>Although No Child Left Behind was revised in 2011, the federal push for schools to show greater student achievement continues, with changes to the legislation allowing for more flexibility in how student achievement is determine and how states hold schools accountable for student learning. With the recent adoption of the Common Core Standards by a majority of states, the implementation of standards-based educational practices to increase student achievement promises to continue. Standards-based student grouping is a relatively low-cost strategy that more schools might adopt in the quest for greater student proficiency of the Common Core Standards. While some may regard this initiative as a new name for the old practice of tracking, the ability of students to move fluidly through standards at their own pace is a critical difference that increases both the potential and the challenge of this change.</p>
<p>Traditional tracking systems place students in relatively static groups based on demonstrated ability levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192636512467675">Hattie’s (2009)</xref> meta-analysis of 500 studies on ability grouping, including over 300 meta-analyses, found the practice of tracking to have minimal positive effects on student performance and negative effects on equity outcomes. With the effect size of 0.4 to 1.2 classified as having a high effect, the average effect size of ability grouping was 0.1 (p. 90). Overall effects on math and reading performance were 0.02 and 0.00, respectively. High-tracked students benefitted the most with a 0.14 positive effect; there was a negative 0.03 effect for middle-tracked students and a 0.09 effect for low-tracked students. Prior research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192636512467675">Oakes, Gamoran, and Page (1992)</xref>, as well as other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192636512467675">Dornbusch, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192636512467675">Haller &amp; Davis, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192636512467675">Loveless, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192636512467675">Oakes, Ormseth, Bell, &amp; Camp, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192636512467675">Rosenbaum, 1980</xref>), has underscored the reality that more poor and minority students are placed in lower tracks while students from affluent and dominant race backgrounds are placed in higher track classes. Students placed in tracked classes rarely have the opportunity to change tracks, except at the end of a school year. The lack of movement among groups is what differentiates tracking classes from the Moving Forward (the name given to the standards-based student grouping initiative) student groupings in which students are constantly assessed and can move to another group at any time with an instructional emphasis on demonstrating learning at one level and moving on to the next level remaining constant across groups.</p>
<p>Changing from traditional age-based student grouping to standards-based groups that allow and promote student movement among groups requires a significant rethinking of how students are taught and how they are assessed. It also requires a change of how resources within a district are used to staff and support each classroom and how schools facilitate student movement to higher standard levels throughout a school year. These changes constitute a second-order change in which new paradigms and learning are required, and the system is transformed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192636512467675">Bergquist, 1993</xref>). Implementing change is a tricky process in any organization and perhaps particularly difficult in educational organizations, which seem highly resistant to substantive change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192636512467675">Bryk, Sebring, Allensworth, Luppescu, &amp; Easton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192636512467675">Evans, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192636512467675">Fink, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192636512467675">Fullan, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192636512467675">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192636512467675">Hargreaves &amp; Shirley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192636512467675">O’Toole, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192636512467675">Payne, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192636512467675">Sarason, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192636512467675">Tyack &amp; Cuban, 1995</xref>). Implementing such a fundamental structural and philosophical change as standards-based student grouping in a school district is a monumental endeavor and the focus of this qualitative case study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0192636512467675">
<title>Identification of Case Study District</title>
<p>The field of education has been plagued with a reputation for numerous reform efforts that have resulted in little actual change in what occurs in classrooms and student learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192636512467675">Cuban, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192636512467675">Meier &amp; Wood, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192636512467675">Payne, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192636512467675">Fink, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192636512467675">Sarason, 2002</xref>). A study was initiated in 2005 to document the implementation of standards-based instructional practices in eight demographically and geographically diverse school districts. With stable to increasing student achievement, one district serving three economically and culturally diverse communities emerged as the most progressive implementer of standards-based instructional practices. Despite increases in at-risk student populations, this district had mindfully planned cultural, structural, and procedural changes to support student learning of the state standards since the adoption of those standards in 1997, including publicity campaigns and public meetings; administrator and teacher trainings in a variety of curriculum, assessment, and pedagogical areas; changes in personnel functions; educational processes (e.g., ability to retake assessments until mastery is demonstrated); and allocation of time during the school day.</p>
<p>The researcher maintained contact with the leadership and teachers in the district after the first study formally concluded, initiating another study in 2011 to continue the documentation and analysis of the district leadership’s efforts to create a standards-led educational system. The most recent change implemented in this district was the development of standards-based proficiency groupings of students in math and language arts across all grade levels in place of the traditional grouping of students according to age. This change was articulated by district leaders in 2006 as the “inevitable next step” in implementing standards-based education (SBE), allowing for fluid movement of students through material as well as targeted support for students not making adequate progress, and, in 2011, had come to be viewed by many educators in the district as the natural and logical progression of the district’s mission to help every student achieve his or her full academic potential.</p>
<p>Implementation of significant change brings challenges for both leaders and classroom teachers, of course. By examining the perceptions of administrators and teachers experiencing this current change within the context of the district’s past development of standards-based educational practices and philosophy, educational leaders can perhaps more fully understand the critical behaviors and structures that support change, as well as how to respond to the challenges that might be encountered. Leadership of the change process and the perceptions of the change process by educational leaders and teachers in the implementation of standards-based student groupings are the subject of this qualitative study.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This analysis of the change process in one Western school district implementing standards-based student groupings in math and reading in kindergarten through 12th grade was based on qualitative data collected in 2011. The examination of this innovation focused on the leadership actions that facilitated changes in the educational culture, structure, and procedures in schools across the district. The research questions guiding this study were the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0192636512467675" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: What are the strategies used in the implementation of standards-based competency–level groupings by district and school leaders?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: What are the perceptions of district and school administrators and teachers of the change process in the implementation of standards-based competency–level groupings?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These research questions were selected to explore what actions district and school leaders took in order to implement the change to standards-based student groupings and to understand the experiences of these educational leaders as they went through the change process. Change theory informed the research questions and data analysis, specifically the comprehensive discussion of change theory by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192636512467675">Burke (2011)</xref> and the complexity of change in education discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192636512467675">Fullan (2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192636512467675">Hargreaves and Shirley (2009)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192636512467675">Whitaker (2010)</xref>. As noted earlier, implementation of change is a necessary and essential function of educational leaders. Insights gained from the analysis of the actions and perceptions of district and school leaders in implementing a nontraditional student grouping initiative to increase students’ success in a standards-based learning environment can be used by other educational leaders to inform their own standards-based educational reforms.</p>
<p>The description of the district’s earlier efforts to implement SBE was drawn from both the current data collected in 2011 and a prior study conducted in 2005. In the 2005 study, two middle schools were selected by the researcher based on student achievement, one school demonstrating high student achievement and the second school demonstrating lower student achievement based on state assessment data from 2003 through 2005, as part of a larger, multidistrict research study that examined the implementation of standards-based instructional practices. Two district administrators and the principals of each school were interviewed. Core subject eighth-grade teachers in math, language arts, science, and social studies were interviewed and observed in their classrooms twice at each school for a total of eight teacher participants from the Verde Valley district. This initial study spanned 3 years, and the researcher remained in contact with the participants regarding district-wide standards-based initiatives after the formal investigation was completed early in 2009. The historical context of the current standards-based change initiative is drawn from the interviews and classroom observations of this earlier study, as well as from interview and observation data obtained in the 2011 study.</p>
<p>In 2011, the current study was initiated to examine the implementation process of the Moving Forward initiative in the Verde Valley district. Three district administrators were interviewed for the 2011 study, as well as all 10 principals in the district (excluding alternative and charter schools who were not implementing standards-based student groupings), and two to three teachers in each school who taught reading or math, for a total of 24 teacher participants. The teachers who participated in the study were recommended by the principals of each school and at least one classroom observation was conducted with each teacher participant.</p>
<p>District administrators and principals were interviewed prior to the beginning of the 2011-2012 school year in which standards-based student groupings was to be implemented while the teachers were interviewed early in the first semester of implementation. The participants were asked open-ended questions during the interviews and were also e-mailed a series of open-ended follow-up questions at the end of the first semester of implementation. Teacher participants were observed during at least one instructional period during the first semester of implementation. Interviews and e-mails focused on the participants’ perceptions of the change and the implementation process, their readiness to implement the change, and perceptions of the both the reasons for and potential and current outcomes of the change. Observation field notes focused on instructional strategies and teacher and student communication, as well as physical artifacts observed in the classroom.</p>
<p>Artifacts were collected throughout the time period from 2005 through 2011. These included district and school documents (such as newsletters, school reports, announcements, and articles on district and school websites), community news articles, assignments given out by teachers, and a variety of data available through the state’s department of education website, as well as census data describing community demographics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.census.gov/">http://www.census.gov/</ext-link>). Artifacts collected in 2011 were used to triangulate themes identified in the 2011 interview and observation data, while earlier artifacts were used to substantiate the events leading up to the current change initiative that were identified through the earlier (2005) interview data.</p>
<p>After an initial review of all artifacts, district and school leader interview transcripts, and teacher interview transcripts and observation notes collected in 2011, text segments of the qualitative data were coded using an open coding system. Categories of responses pertaining to change and the district’s standards-based student grouping initiative were then identified based on the coded text segments. The coding followed the process outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192636512467675">Creswell (2008)</xref>, in which codes were divided into text segments, segments labeled with codes, and codes were examined for overlap and redundancy and “collapse[d] into broad themes” in order “to make sense out of the text data” (p. 251).</p>
<p>The four themes that emerged included the following:</p>
<list id="list2-0192636512467675" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Rationale for change: beliefs relative to culture, procedures, and structures</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Groundwork: actions taken by district and school leaders to prepare for the implementation of the standards-based student groupings in math and reading relative to both new structures and procedures</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Changes in practice: teacher behaviors in and out of the classroom relative to procedures</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Challenges: current and anticipated obstacles for the implementation of standards-based student groupings in math and reading relative to procedures</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Administrative and teacher responses within each theme were compared, with a focus on leadership actions and responses within the change process.</p>
<p>The district contexts will first be explained to situate the change within the dynamics of the demographic, cultural, and structural forces leading up to the implementation of standards-based student groupings in the Verde Valley school district. Each theme will then be explained and illustrated with examples and comments from administrators and teachers, followed by an analysis of positive and negative aspects of the implementation process in Verde Valley and implications for educational leaders.</p>

<sec id="section4-0192636512467675">
<title>District Context</title>
<p>The Verde Valley school district enrolled 5,212 students in the 2010-2011 school year, including 215 nonresident students, and is the 31st largest of the state’s 181 districts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0192636512467675">1</xref></sup> The majority (52%) of students served were Latino (2,713), with another 3% of students classified as members of a minority racial group. There were 1,442 English Language Learners (ELLs), 420 special education students, 2,149 students who qualify for Title I funds served in the district, and 41.6% of all district students qualified for free or reduced lunches, a proxy indicator of student low socioeconomic levels. The district’s student mobility rate was 22.6%, the same as the district’s Hispanic student mobility rate, with ELL student mobility at 26%, 22.8% mobility rate for White students, and 12.2% mobility rate for students classified as economically disadvantaged but 23.9% for Title I students. The district’s overall dropout rate was 1.8%, but the dropout rate for ELL students was 4.2% and it was 3.1% for Hispanic students. The dropout rate for White students was 0.7% and 0.2% for economically disadvantaged student. In 2010-2011, no Title I students were reported as dropouts.</p>
<p>The district had four elementary schools, three middle schools, and three high schools, as well as one charter school and one alternative school (neither of which participated in this study because they were not required to implement standards-based student groupings). Minier elementary and middle schools had the largest percentage of students qualifying for free or reduced lunches (64.4% and 61.3%, respectively), but the schools in the district also had between 38% and 55% of their students also qualifying for free and reduced lunches. Blossom Creek’s high school was the notable exception, with only 16.3% reported as qualifying for free or reduced lunches.</p>
<p>Minier schools had the most diversity of student population, with the elementary and middle schools reporting 76% Hispanic enrollment and the high school reporting 58 Hispanic and 40% White enrollment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/14475">http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/14475</ext-link>). Pinewood and Blossom Creek elementary schools reported 52% and 54% (respectively) of their student enrollment to be Hispanic. Pinewood Middle Schools also reported 51% Hispanic enrollment, but Pinewood High School reported only 40% Hispanic enrollment. Blossom Creek reported the Hispanic enrollment as 38% at the second elementary school in the community, 36% at the middle school, and 31%, the lowest Hispanic enrollment in any school in the district, at the high school. Diversity and the number of ELL students were greatest then at the elementary levels, particularly at schools in the Minier community, and lowest in the Blossom Creek community. The dropout rates were the highest in the district at Pinewood middle and high schools for White, Hispanic, and ELL students. Student mobility was higher than the district average at every school in the district except for all three schools in the Pinewood community.</p>
<p>Three schools in the district were also awarded the Distinguished Improvement award recognizing the top 8% of schools in the state in 2011, Pinewood elementary and middle schools and Blossom Creek High School. Minier Middle School received the award in 2010. Achievement by non-ELL students in 2011 on the state assessments in Grades 3 through 10 was quite strong with 85% to 91% proficient or advanced in reading, 68% to 80% proficient or advanced in writing, and 54% to 90% proficient or advanced in math. Achievement by ELL students showed much room for growth, however, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192636512467675">Table 1</xref> illustrates. Similar percentages are reflected in a comparison of the number of Hispanic and White students scoring in the proficient and advanced categories in each subject area, as well as a comparison of the performance of students eligible for free and reduced lunches and those students who did not qualify for free and reduced lunches.</p>

<p>The district is clearly very diverse, although the level of racial and socioeconomic diversity varies among the schools. The educators in Verde Valley face the same challenges faced in districts across the nation, namely, to educate all students to a level of proficiency on the state’s learning standards. Although success in terms of student growth has been shown in most of the schools in the district, closing the achievement gap between minority and White students, as well as ELL and native English-speaking students and low and high socioeconomic students remains an elusive goal. This goal, however, was the impetus behind the district’s long-standing commitment to standards-based educational practices and, most recently, the implementation of standards-based student groupings in reading and math.</p>

<title>A Brief History of Standards-Based Educational Practices in Verde Valley</title>
<p>The journey down the road of SBE of the Verde Valley district is in many ways inseparable from the career and educational vision of the superintendent, Abby McDougall. The Verde Valley school district adopted the state’s learning standards in 1997, the year they were finalized. The current superintendent of Verde Valley was then just 2 years into her tenure as the district’s assistant superintendent, a position she held for 10 years. For her, the standards movement began in 1987 when the middle school she was teaching at started looking at what students need to know and be able to do in order to demonstrate learning in core subject areas. No longer was she able to teach the state’s history in her fifth-grade classroom because the state recommended that subject matter be taught in fourth grade. She obtained her principal license and became the principal at Pinewood Middle School, focused on developing a standards-based learning environment where all students understood what, why, and how they needed to learn. After commuting for 8 years from her home over an hour away from Pinewood, Abby McDougall was offered a position as principal in her home community. The night that she was going to tender her resignation to the Verde Valley Board of Education, she was offered the position of assistant superintendent and she accepted the challenging new role in the district.</p>
<p>While at Pinewood Middle School, one administrator in the district observed that Abby brought the teachers at the school together to craft a strong culture that was committed to standards-based student achievement, which he feels still exists today. The assistant superintendent explained,<disp-quote>
<p>This school had teachers who are committed to staying until 5 p.m. every night, if necessary. The principal there said that he has a teacher who stands up at the beginning of the year and reminds teachers that they are there to do everything they can for the kids.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Pinewood Middle School became in many ways the model for the district once Abby became the assistant superintendent. The superintendent at the time, Wally Fredericks, selected her because of her knowledge of curriculum and instruction, commitment to standards-based educational practices and student achievement, and ability to work effectively with teachers. While Abby was the assistant superintendent, the district provided teachers with professional development on developing standards-based common classroom assessments and rubrics, implemented common team planning time focused on analysis of student data (particularly common classroom assessments), and developed an electronic standards-based report card that was first adopted by the elementary schools in the district, then the middle schools, and finally the high schools. Multiple assessment opportunities were also given to students at all levels as part of the district leadership teams’ vision, as well as the requirement that students demonstrate proficiency of eighth-grade learning standards before being promoted to high school. Wally firmly supported Abby’s ambitious initiatives until he retired in 2006 and Abby became the new superintendent.</p>
<p>The changes that Abby facilitated during her time as assistant superintendent in Verde Valley were substantial, so she had a great deal of experience behind her as she tackled what both she and Wally had viewed as the “inevitable next step” in implementing standards-based instruction, standards-based student groupings. The prior initiatives had also laid a firm groundwork of belief in standards-based instructional practices, student achievement, and trust in Abby’s educational vision among teachers and administrators in the district, particularly at the middle schools. Throughout the previous initiatives, district leaders had provided the training, support, and resources that were necessary to try the new things that they asked of the teachers and principals in the district, and even though there were always those who grumbled about the changes, the changes had been viewed as beneficial and eventually had become part of the district’s culture. The leadership of Verde Valley was, indeed, no stranger to innovation.</p>
<p>From 2007 to 2010, most of the elementary and middle schools in the district began grouping students in language arts classes by the level of the learning standards the students were working on. One Pinewood principal recalled that the district received a grant 12 years ago to level groupings in reading and was part of the Read-Achieve grant for 9 years. With these extra funds, trainers were brought in to the elementary and middle schools and the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills testing process was added to the Developmental Reading Assessment and district assessments used by these schools. As the Pinewood principal explained, “The trainings brought in a culture that this is how we do things here now.”</p>
<p>The SBE philosophy also influenced human resource decisions that further supported the emerging culture. Principals throughout the district were selected for their experience with and dedication to standards-based instruction. The principal at Minier Middle School had previously worked in an Alaskan school district that had implemented standards-based student groupings nearly a decade earlier; however, most of the principals had been with the district for several years and were part of the standards-based culture of the district. The principal at Minier’s elementary school had been a teacher at Pinewood Middle School while Abby was a principal there, and the principal of Pinewood Middle School had been a teacher there, as well. The principal of Blossom Creek Middle School demonstrated success with increasing student achievement in reading through “leveling” student groupings and was promoted to the positions of assistant superintendent in 2009. His assistant principal succeeded him to the position of principal at Blossom Creed Middle School. The person in charge of district assessment worked with Abby at Pinewood Middle School, and her children also attended the school. Through her selection of school leaders, Abby was able to maintain and strengthen site-based leadership of her standards-based vision.</p>
<p>In the 14 years preceding the district’s implementation of standards-based student groupings in reading and math, the culture of the district had changed to embrace standards-based educational practices. The strength of this culture varied, of course, appearing the strongest at the district level and at the middle schools where the superintendent and assistant superintendent had served as principals. The new initiative, coupled with the adoption of new state learning standards based on the Common Core Standards from the federal department of education and a new electronic grade book, required structural and procedural changes, as well.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The themes identified from the data were the rationale for change, groundwork for the change, changes in practice, and challenges. These themes and the subthemes identified within each theme are graphically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0192636512467675">Figure 1</xref>. The implementation strategies of developing a rationale for change and laying the groundwork for the change will be discussed first, followed by the perceptions of teachers and administrators regarding the change process and changes in practice that they experienced as part of the Moving Forward initiative. Although changes in instructional practices were reported by participants to be limited to having students track their own progress on demonstrating proficiency of specific essential learning objectives (ELOs) and a greater instructional focus on the ELOs, most of the changes reported by teachers occurred outside of the classroom. These changes were often viewed as challenges by participants and include significant time spent entering data, figuring out the new electronic grade book system, and sharing resources across classrooms and schools. An additional challenge that is reported in this section is the concern that the new student groupings will become a tracking system if students do not move through the levels fluidly, whether because of scheduling difficulties, student motivation, or a lack of appropriate instruction to accelerate the learning of students who are currently performing below grade level.</p>

<title>Developing a Rationale for Change</title>
<p>Verde Valley has invested resources in standards-based educational practices for over 15 years. Within that time, teachers and administrators have been selected based on the district’s philosophical support for SBE, in vary degrees among schools. Conceptually and philosophically, teachers and administrators in the district who participated in this study agreed that standards-based student groupings is a logical “next step” in SBE for the district in meeting student needs, although they may disagree with how this next step should be taken. A Blossom Creek Elementary School teacher explained,<disp-quote>
<p>The district is doing Moving Forward because it fits into the conceptualization of SB teaching around the premise that every student learns at their own development pace and the education system should not force a child to go faster than their own pace.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The goal of student-centered learning emerges as well as a deeply held belief in SBE, as she continues,<disp-quote>
<p>I do believe in the system of SB. I think the whole system is powerful. Eventually will come the point when the child is the master in charge of the system, not the teacher. The child will say, “I like this. Give me more, or I’m not ready.” When the child has that power and understands the power of that, the concept of that is great. Kids in elementary are not ready to set their educational goals, but as they progress through, they will wake up to that fact.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The history of SBE in the district was referred to by almost 60% of participants in the study. A principal in Blossom Creek related how he used an overhead that had been created in 1997 to show parents how Moving Forward fits into the overall SBE philosophy of the district. “They agreed that it was the next logical step in the process, to make sure kids are moving ahead,” he added. Another principal in Pinewood agreed, saying, “As I pitched this concept to parents and staff, it became clear to me that we our changing less than we are just keeping what works.” One teacher attributed Moving Forward to encouragement the district received from the state’s department of education. “They were looking at what we were doing right and what we could improve on and this is part of their recommendation . . . that we take the next step,” she explained.</p>
<p>Almost every respondent (with only one exception) emphasized that the goal of Moving Forward was to meet the learning needs of students more effectively—both students who were performing below grade level and those who were performing above grade level on the state assessments. A middle school math teacher felt that “students have been pushed through when they aren’t ready. We lose kids in high school, particularly the Latino population.” Another teacher echoed this idea by saying,<disp-quote>
<p>Our philosophy is to educate every kid and to have them reach their own potential. It kind of stems from No Child Left Behind and the philosophical sense that we don’t want anybody passing on when they haven’t met the standards they need to for each level. It has an additional focus, as well—I think for kids that are moving at a faster rate, not just kids who are catching up. They’re doing it to let the kids advance the way they need to and give kids support that are behind grade level—and to give kids who are above grade level or feel that they are being held back by teaching to everyone the opportunity to advance as quickly as they’d like.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A high school teacher put it this way:<disp-quote>
<p>We’re having students coming to high school with less than they skills they need to be a successful student. We really believe their needs to be a mechanism in place for us to be able to slow down and say, “Wait! You aren’t ready to go. You don’t know this. You don’t have mastery.” So this is a way of saying that mastery is important to us rather than social promotion.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some educators in the district philosophically support the change but are unsure of how it will “play out” procedurally, particularly at the high school level where each principal expressed some level of concern. One high school principal supported Moving Forward, saying, “It is about the learning and not about the time, so we’ll get over it. I am okay with some ambiguity. I am a little worried about the change—but it is the right thing to do for kids.” A second high school principal in the district sees Moving Forward as not a great change from the high school process of some students selecting advanced placement or honors courses and others taking remedial courses. His main concern with the change was structural, regarding the resources of his school in terms of the number of teachers and the number of students coming in to his school who were functioning below the ninth-grade level. A math teacher at another high school pointed out, “we have always gotten kids who are below grade level and we dealt with them. Now we will have a formal process and plan to make sure they know the material they need to.”</p>
<p>One high school principal in the district is not in favor of Moving Forward but says, “It will do no harm. And in any case, it’s kind of an order, so we have to do this anyway.” He bases his concern on the research conducted on tracking and retention summarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192636512467675">John Hattie (2009)</xref> in <italic>Visible Learning</italic>: “I think the good news is that the effect size of what we’re about to do is zero. No one will use the word retention and no one will use the word tracking, but those are both parts of Moving Forward.”</p>
<p>Even while they support the philosophy of SBE and Moving Forward, several teachers throughout the district also expressed concerns about possible unintended consequences of student grouping and these will be discussed under “Challenges.” Most of the teachers who expressed concerns also voiced support and faith in the school and district’s leadership. The value of this rapport in the midst of change was clearly articulated by one middle school teacher who explained that there were<disp-quote>
<p>a lot of discussions [2 years ago] with everyone as to worst fears and best hopes. We [as a school] didn’t want to go that way. We were worried that we would lose depth and complexity, the whole child focus, and character education. We want to be able to teach a book and understand the theme, not just for a multiple choice test. The principal really knew change theory, though, and listed the different stages. We had faith in the principal, the superintendent, the assistant superintendent, and the other principals in the district. They weren’t all about just moving kids through to the test.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A Minier principal expressed his trust in the district leadership by saying, “This is a superintendent who sees what’s possible. It’s always about kids and learning.”</p>
<p>None of the administrators or teachers interviewed in this study disagreed with the underlying standards-based philosophy of the change to standards-based student groupings, and only one administrator voiced concrete reservations about the change, underscoring the strong cultural consensus in Verde Valley. This is depicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192636512467675">Whitaker (2010)</xref> as the core element of an organization that must be changed in order for structural and procedural changes to be sustainable. This cultural consensus on the benefits of SBE to students and the logic of implementing standards-based student groupings as a natural outgrowth of SBE demonstrates an understanding of the need for the change, as well as a clarity of the “what” and “why” of the change, as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192636512467675">Fullan (2001)</xref>. This clarity establishes a level of “readiness” that enables administrators and teachers to advocate and support the change, as well as endure the discomforts associated with learning to work within new structures and new procedures associated with the implementation of change (p. 75).</p>

<sec id="section8-0192636512467675">
<title>Groundwork for Moving Forward</title>
<p>During the 2009-2010 school year, the groundwork began for the implementation of standards-based student groupings in reading and math in all school in the Valley Verde district, informally called “leveling” by principals and teachers and formally named as the “Moving Forward” initiative by the district. The previous year, district administrators and selected principals and teachers had visited another district in the state that had begun implementing standards-based student groupings, taking away ideas of what appeared to be working and things they wanted to avoid, particularly the development of classrooms that were “packet driven” where students worked individually through a series of worksheet packets. How the new groupings would be implemented was left to the discretion of each building because each school had a different history of student groupings, particularly in language arts.</p>
<p>Typically, teachers and principals placed students into groups based on the students’ performance on the state’s assessment of the learning standards that had been in place since 1997, as well as student performance on district assessments in some schools. Students were performing below grade level were put into the “Catching Up” groups and students performing at grade level were in the “Keeping Up” groups, while the students performing above grade level were placed in the “Moving Up” groups. At the high school level, students who scored at the seventh-grade level on the state assessment were allowed to physically move to the high school from their middle schools but were placed in the Catching Up” groups. These initial groupings were to be fluid, meaning that students who were assessed as proficient or advanced on the standards being covered by the group they were in originally would be moved to another group to work on the next level of standards in that subject area; however, most schools decided that no group would have more than a 3-year difference among the students. Thus, the core of Moving Forward was a structural change.</p>
<p>The district formed a committee made up of a math and language arts teacher from every school to develop new ELOs for the new Common Core standards that had been adopted by the state. The teachers were given small stipends for their work from money left from a grant the district had received a few years before. This group also created pre- and postassessments for each ELO based on the new standards. The members of this group, along with the principals, were responsible for keeping the other teachers at each school informed about the Moving Forward initiative. In anticipation of teachers having to more specifically differentiate their instruction for students working on different ELOs or at different levels in one classroom, the district provided “Classroom Instruction That Works” training for all teachers who wanted to participate. The district also began developing a new electronic grade book that would record student achievement for each new ELO, as well as numerous other functions, such as a student self-assessment area where they can indicate if they are ready to assess or reassess and a Facebook-like profile. Communication protocols were also set up where teachers could access Google sites to post questions and comments or seek information. One teacher noted that the superintendent sends out detailed e-mail notes responding to the concerns and questions that teachers post. An elementary teacher recounted that both the superintendent and the assistant superintendent met with the school’s staff at different times<disp-quote>
<p>to talk to us about some of the steps that are being implements and we did some activities. The newsletter that Abby send out weekly is great. We’ve gotten a fair amount of information about the steps for Moving Forward through that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While every principal in the district identified the various methods employed by the district to prepare teachers for SBE student groupings, not all teachers recalled this preparation. The teachers who were on the ELO and assessment development committee of course discussed that process with several of these teachers, particularly at the high school level, noting that their work was perhaps done too hastily and that they have discovered assessments that are invalid as they have been used this year in the classroom. All but two teachers mentioned the emphasis on differentiation within a classroom and specifically the Classroom Instruction That Works trainings. Only one high school teacher in her second year in the district felt that the district had done little to prepare teachers for the new grouping system.</p>
<p>While the change in actual student groupings can be seen as a structural change, many of the activities identified by participants as laying the groundwork for this year’s implementation of standards-based student groupings were more procedural. These procedural changes resulted more from the adoption of new state learning standards rather than the Moving Forward initiative. The two most significant procedural changes were the new ELOs related to the common core standards and the new grade book. Activities associated with the new ELO assessments and the new grade book were the most frequently mentioned change that teachers in the study reported in their own behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0192636512467675">
<title>Changes in Practice</title>
<p>Over 80% of the teachers in the study and particularly those who taught at the middle school level felt that an observer would see very little change in their instructional practices this year as compared to last year. Several attributed this lack of change to the leveling of groups that had been taking place in their buildings for several years in reading. One Blossom Creek elementary teacher explained,<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t feel that it’s that different actually in my classroom. I’m still teaching. I may be teaching new ELOs, but the basic concepts are still the same. We separated fourth grade last year as a sort of test so I did this last year. If I go back to the year before, I think as a teacher I am now more focused.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A Minier elementary teacher said that she is “more diligent about ‘What are your instructional goals?’” A Pinewood middle school teacher observed that she felt more of “a sense of urgency that the kids may pick up on. Kids are held more accountable and lower kids are showing more growth.” Having students track their own progress on ELOs was an outgrowth of this focus and urgency, with some teachers asking students to record their progress in their notebooks or on the classroom wall. During one classroom observation, the teacher helped each student celebrate his or her success and to keep trying to improve, whether the student had demonstrated proficiency or was still striving toward that goal.</p>
<p>The changes that have occurred, whether in the grouping structure or in classroom procedures, have been accepted by parents because, as an elementary principal in Blossom Creek pointed out, “It’s a bigger change for the teachers than it is for the child” and, as a high school principal in Pinewood observed, “The difference to the staff is that this time we really mean it—such as guaranteeing the curriculum for each child.” Although the three communities in Verde Valley are pretty diverse, administrators and teachers reported a high level of parental support for Moving Forward among both White and Latino parents, although for different reasons. Both groups of parents understand the schools’ grouping decisions when the details of students’ performance are clearly identified and articulated to them. Several teachers and administrators also commented on small groups of affluent parents in each community, particularly in Pinewood, who had voiced concerns that their students were not moving ahead as fast as they had hoped they would.</p>
<p>The changes in practice teachers discussed that took place outside of the classroom—lesson planning and entering assessment information in the new electronic standards-based grade book—were seen as challenges and will be discussed as part of that theme.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0192636512467675">
<title>Challenges</title>
<p>Any change brings new challenges as individual are forced to learn a new way of doing things. As mentioned earlier, the new ELO assessments and new grade book were the most often discussed challenge by both principals and teachers. Before school began, a Blossom Creek principal made the following prediction:<disp-quote>
<p>There’s going to be a whole lot put on teacher’s plates. Perceptions aren’t necessarily accurate, but they are real. I think we’ll spend a lot of our time making those perceptions accurate for both the community and teachers. The strength of the system will be making really clear the “what” students need to know and what it looks like when they know it. Then we will be successful.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She went on to detail the interplay between the new curriculum and new assessments, explaining,<disp-quote>
<p>We’re giving an assessment based on standards that haven’t been taught yet. The expectation is that they will be mostly the same [as the former standards], but it’s still an unknown. It’s perceived as a new curriculum so assessments for new instruction are going to take time for teachers to understand and see the changes. We’ve got a good core group of teachers [who] have been working on these things, but until everyone has it in front of them and understands the expectations, there is going to be that adjustment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<sec id="section11-0192636512467675">
<title>Scheduling</title>
<p>The initial challenge for school leaders was to create a schedule that accommodated student grouping needs. While this was not identified by any principal as an overwhelming task, the question of how student mobility among levels throughout the year would be handled had yet to be definitely answered. A few felt that students would be moved into other classrooms, if appropriate, when the students were ready to move. Others felt that student movement would take place at the end of each of three segments of ELOs within each level and that students would generally progress as a group with a small percentage of outliers who would not make the expected progress or make greater progress than expected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0192636512467675">
<title>Curriculum</title>
<p>For teachers, the first challenge they faced was learning what ELOs were in each section for the levels that they taught and creating lesson plans to teach the new ELOs. Several teachers at the middle and high school levels said that they were only a week or two ahead of their students in planning their lessons. A high school teacher told the story of one of her colleagues who broke her leg but came back to school the next day because she did not have the next lessons planned for her classes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0192636512467675">
<title>Differentiation</title>
<p>Differentiation was another immediate challenge teachers faced in this first year of implementation. A middle school principal expressed this concern, saying,<disp-quote>
<p>We knew that we had kids of varying needs in each room before, but now we have a structure that says even if I get you the kids that are the most similar in the school, you still know that they have very different needs and it is challenging at best, if not impossible, to meet every kid’s need at every moment of every day. Teachers take on an enormous amount of pressure to try and figure that out. There’s a lot of coaching that has to go in I think that will not make it perfect but better.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A Pinewood high school teacher linked the challenge of differentiation to the anticipated mobility of students among levels and classrooms, as well:<disp-quote>
<p>I have actually had a couple of kids who, when they came to the [high] school, they were in an 8A class because of their state assessment scores and because of the evidence they had in their classrooms and assignments last year. They moved ahead and are now in my 9A class. They came in maybe a week ago [early October]. The questions is, “Do you go back with them and start over with two students when you are this far into your unit?” They’re picking up where they came in at, but they don’t have the body of evidence [of learning of the ELOs already covered] that my other students have already started to build. It’s going to be the same thing if a new student comes in from outside the district. It’s going to be a differentiated classroom with these people on segment 9A, these people on segment 9B, and other people moving on to C.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Classroom instructional methods varied across the district during the observations conducted with much more whole group instruction taking place in the high school classrooms. Elementary and middle school classroom included more diversity among whole group, small group, and individualized instruction, with the majority of elementary instruction taking place in small groups or “centers.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0192636512467675">
<title>Data entry</title>
<p>High school teachers also voiced a concern over the time that it took to enter all of the required assessment data in the new grade book, as well as constraints within the grade book structure itself. One teacher explained that students<disp-quote>
<p>take tests and the test don’t coordinate with the grade book system. I have to hand enter 10 scores per child and then 14 fields per child in the grade book. Hand enter them and then multiply that by 65 and you’re well over 1,000 data entries each time I give a pretest and a posttest. That takes an incredible amount of working time. It has some pretty big consequences in terms of teacher stress and teacher time. Teacher costs. I was here until 9:30 p.m. Monday night doing data entry.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another high school teacher identified the lack of teacher familiarity with the new standards as being restrictive:<disp-quote>
<p>I had a student who did extremely well on the pretest for the district assessment and scored well in all areas except for one. Ideally, I should be looking at what standards in our segment B overlap with our segment A standards and start moving him into those other standards. But because we don’t have the curriculum built, it’s really difficult to do that. I’m already spending my lunch period working with the students who already aren’t staying on schedule with assignments.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0192636512467675">
<title>Grade book structure</title>
<p>One high school math teacher captured the frustration expressed by several teachers regarding the restrictiveness of the grade book, saying,<disp-quote>
<p>Because of the rigidity of the tracking, even though there is a lot of correlation with the eighth- and ninth-grade standards, you must cover them in sequential order. I understand the concept that you have to learn this part of math to learn the next part, but many of the topics that were chosen, like defining irrational numbers, really have nothing to do with your success in other math areas.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The new grade book is currently constructed so that a teacher cannot enter assessment results for a student in any level above the one she or he is placed at until the student demonstrates proficiency on all the ELOs in that level. Another constraint of the new grade book that teachers identified as a challenge was that the levels were developed into three parts that did not match the quarter or semester grade reporting schedule. An elementary teacher who also voice similar frustrations with the new grade book also recalled that it took time for teachers to get used to using the first iteration of the district’s electronic standards-based grade book. “Now, everyone thinks it was wonderful!” she laughed, saying that she expected the second iteration would just take time for teacher to get used to using and to get all of the “kinks out.” A Pinewood middle school teacher recounted how the first standards-based report card adopted by the district in 2006 “drove your instruction, kind of forced you to do it whether you were on board or not. People worked on backward design and lesson planning but it was all linked to the first grade book.” She also anticipated that the frustrations with the new grade book would subside with time and use, as well as any modifications that the district might make based on teacher feedback, similar to her experiences with the first grade book.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0192636512467675">
<title>Resources</title>
<p>Teachers and principals both expressed concerns regarding resources. The principals focused more on the resource of teachers to adequately serve all the learning levels that needed to be addressed. Again, the high school level appeared to be experience the most stress on the area of classroom staffing because all students who had demonstrated proficiency in the ELOs at the sixth-grade level, based on the former standards and assessments (administered at the state, district, and classroom levels), were physically allowed to move to the high schools. This meant that high teachers were teaching Levels 7 and 8, in addition to the traditional levels of 9 through 12, with no additional faculty resources. A decrease in K–12 educational funding from the state increased administrative fears that faculty resources may eventually have to be decreased, as well.</p>
<p>Teachers also expressed concerns regarding the resource of classroom instructional materials. A middle school teacher described her situation where “if you need to teach a seventh grader at a fifth-grade level, you’re now using the fifth-grade materials and so you have to shuffle the materials between all the teachers who need to use them.” She added, “It is just organizing it and getting the big picture of who needs what and when and when do we have time to get together to get this organized and talk about what does it look like.” Her comment highlights another challenge that both principals and teachers identified: time, particularly for collaboration.</p>
<p>At the elementary and middle school levels, results teams were an established part of the schools’ functioning. Two teachers at one of the Blossom Creek elementary schools attributed both their success and the success of their students to the great results team that they were a part of. “We couldn’t do it without our team. One person will do the preassessment and then another will do the data analysis, so we don’t each have to do everything.” At the high schools, these kinds of teams and networks did not seem to exist, and everyone expressed frustration over having to do more than ever without any additional support, such as time to collaborate.</p>
<p>Elementary teachers across the district expressed two additional concerns. First, teachers at the early elementary levels were tackling language objectives for the first time. While they had always had learning objectives, some teachers were concerned that the language objectives would be too difficult for ELL students and might “hold them back.” There was also concern express regarding “the wee ones” having all these different teachers in a day and whether students will build the relationships and sense of community that they former had developed. One teacher said, “We don’t’ want to turn into a middle school!” while another explained, “Some kids that you have in your homeroom, you don’t teach language to or you don’t have for math or literacy. It’s difficult to build those relationships.” She also expressed concern that when student test scores on the state’s assessments were reported, the homeroom teacher’s name was the one listed, even though the homeroom teacher may not have taught the core subjects to any of the student in her homeroom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0192636512467675">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Tracking</title>
<p>The final area of concern expressed by several principals and teachers across the district and across grade levels was the possibility of standards-based student groupings turning into a traditional tracking system where students do not move forward or move into a de facto racial segregation system. One teacher articulated the former concern by discussing why she felt her school had been successful:<disp-quote>
<p>We were keeping our kids in their homeroom and we pulled everybody up. We had the same expectations for everybody. Yes, you’d give supplemental materials and supportive challenge to those kids who needed it. But in these groups, they’re in groups with the kids where some kids will rise to the lowest that’s expected so we’re concerned that they are not going to have those others to model and help pull them up to the higher expectations.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Regarding racial segregation, a middle school teacher in Pinewood observed that even at the start of the year, she has only three Latino students in all of the advanced classes she teaches throughout the day whereas another teacher who teaches all lower level classes has only one White student. One middle school principal mentioned that a reason he thinks affluent parents in his community supported Moving Forward was the parents’ belief that Latino students will be in the lower levels and the White students in the higher levels.</p>
<p>While ability tracking and racial segregation were not the intended consequences of the Moving Forward initiative, it is too early in the implementation process to ascertain if either might be a result. Fluidity of student movement, student achievement—particularly among students identified as below grade level—and racial composition of classes are factors that will undoubtedly determine whether standards-based student groupings accomplish the articulated goal of helping all students achieve their learning potential in the long term. While Moving Forward is only in its first year of implementation, there are several lessons that other educational leaders can learn from, whether they are contemplating initiating the same change or another major change, as to what to do to successfully promote change and what to avoid doing to impede the change process.</p>

<title>Summary and Recommendations</title>
<p>During this first year of implementing standards-bases student groupings in reading and math across the Verde Valley school district, the most “push back” or opposition to the change has come from high school teachers. In the November 2011 school board elections, several new board members were elected who are not familiar with the Moving Forward initiative, except for what they have heard from disgruntled high school teachers. While some teachers in the study viewed the mill levy override that was on the same ballot as an indication of support for Moving On and the superintendent, one of only two overrides that passed in the entire state in that election, the future of Abby McDougall as the district’s leader appears to be in question. A community newspaper article published in late November juxtaposed the future of the superintendent with the state department of education’s support for Moving Forward. “While much of the focus in the [Valley Verde district] is on the future of its superintendent, the district is catching the eye of state education officials,” they reported, citing the presentation of a supportive letter by an education department official to the new school board. The state education department executive field officer read from his letter to the district’s leadership:<disp-quote>
<p>I urge you to continue with the thoughtful work that you and your talented staff have begun around standards, mastery and moving all kids forward in achievement as these are initiatives that the department is working to support around the state.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The district’s leadership for the past 15 years has nurtured and supported the growth and establishment of a standards-based professional culture among educators in the district. This “sustainable leadership” is one of four “catalysts for coherence” in educational change described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192636512467675">Hargreaves and Shirley (2009)</xref>. This kind of leadership has existed but appears to be in jeopardy. This leadership has been able to develop two other elements of coherence, often cited as a much needed but often lacking essential part of educational change, including differentiation and diversity and responsibility before accountability. To some extent, the final element cited as necessary for coherent and sustainable change, integrated networks, was also developed under the guidance of the current superintendent. However, those networks that have been developed appear to mainly be within schools, particularly at the elementary and middle schools, rather than across schools and at all levels.</p>
<p>Many changes in education have been implemented but were not sustainable because the groundwork was not sufficiently or appropriately laid for the educators to fully understand, embrace, or have the capacity to integrate the changes into their daily routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192636512467675">Fullan, 2005</xref>). Often, the urgency of implementation takes precedence over the learning that must take place for the change to be sustainable. While the prior changes that were implemented in the Verde Valley district were preceded by widespread, repeated professional development for teachers and public meetings with parents and community members, the district’s efforts to prepare teachers and community members for Moving Forward were perhaps not as great as what was needed. Prior changes—and the learning necessary to implement those changes—were not responses to external accountability pressures but rather were a result of the vision that the district’s leaders held for how SBE could help all students achieve at higher levels. The only sense of urgency was a moral one articulated by the superintendent and assistant superintendent.</p>
<p>Prior initiatives also were rolled out more incrementally, particularly the first standards-based electronic grade book. That first grade book caused stress among teachers and was often referred to as “an airplane being built in the air” by educators in the district at the time because the district could find no models that already existed that fit with what they were trying to accomplish, reporting all student progress in terms of the learning standards. The “airplane being built in the air” metaphor was also used by many educators, particularly teachers, in 2011 regarding the Moving Forward initiative, as well as the new grade book and associated new assessments. While all change is likely to produce some level of angst among those who participate in the change, the amount of discomfort is greater for those who must learn to function within more new structures and procedures than for those who must learn to function with fewer new structures and procedures. While the district’s leadership had built a solid culture in support of SBE, perhaps the degree of change, particularly at the high school level where the supporting professional networks, SBE philosophy, and SBE structures had not been built as strongly as in the elementary and middle schools, may make the Moving Forward initiative unsustainable.</p>
<p>Many of the teachers who are critical of the implementation of SB student groupings at the high school level expressed the view that Moving Forward should have been implemented incrementally, starting at the elementary school level and then moving to the middle school levels. Two possible rationales support this view. First, an incremental process of implementation would have allowed more students in the elementary schools to be brought up to their age equivalent grade level before they moved on to the middle schools and, similarly, more middle schools students would be prepared to enter high school, eliminating the need to stretch high school resources to teach students at the 7th-grade through 12-grade levels. Second, any lack of mobility among groups (i.e., tracking) or racial segregation that might occur among segments or levels could be addressed early, before the trend might appear across the district. While the state department of education supports the district’s efforts, a narrower focus of initial implementation would also have allowed for data to be collected and analyzed, determining if this system of student grouping and instruction does increase the achievement of all students and narrow the achievement gap, particularly between Hispanic and White students in Verde Valley.</p>
<p>A more incremental implementation could also have provided the district with time to build stronger professional networks across school levels, perhaps increasing the support of high school educators. Success at the elementary and middle school levels could also have been touted at public informational meetings, as well as across the district. A longer implementation period would also have allowed high school teachers more time to understand the new Common Core-based learning standards and the development of appropriate lessons, lessening the amount of change they would have ultimately experienced at any one time. The grade book also could have been piloted by the elementary and middle schools first, with difficulties addressed early. Because the elementary and middle schools generally had already implemented SB student grouping in reading, these changes would not be as great to them as to the high school teachers.</p>
<p>Accountability systems that mandate the demonstration of increased student achievement on an annual basis do not foster educational changes that are incremental so the effects can be analyzed and addressed at earlier rather than later stages of implementation. The argument that the achievement gap needs to be addressed sooner rather than later is difficult to disagree with, unless more mindfully planned and critically analyzed and revised strategies can be proven to ultimately increase the learning of all students more effectively. Few districts are likely to wager their accreditation status on such a possibility, however.</p>
<p>In Verde Valley, a great deal of essential groundwork had been put in place, supporting SBE, prior to the implementation of the Moving Forward initiative. Whether the initiative will be sustained or how it might be modified in response to educator or political pressures remains to be seen. As one teacher reported after the new school board was elected, “It has been a most contentious fall, but we seem to have soldiered forward and the kids are keen . . . The staff has fixated on ‘what’s best for the kids.’” The lessons for educational leaders to be learned are to use as much time as possible to teach others what they will need to be able to do to make any change successful and minimize the number of changes that individuals in an organization will have to make at any one time, basically incrementally scaffolding the learning of those in the organization. The power of an organization’s culture should not be underestimated, however, and even if the district experiences a change in leadership and Moving Forward is discontinued, significant elements will continue in the elementary and middles schools where teachers firmly believe in SBE, have demonstrated increased student achievement with SB student groupings, and continue to strive to do what they feel is “best for kids.”There are many lessons that secondary school principal can learn from the events in the Valley Verde school district regarding how to navigate change and specifically the implementation of standards-based grouping, including the following:</p>
<list id="list3-0192636512467675" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Encourage teacher participation in district planning committees. This increases the knowledge of teachers to lead on-site informational sessions, answer questions, and assist in the school implementation process, building capacity for the change process. It also increases teachers’ opportunities to express their opinion, whether it is in support or is critical of the proposed change.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Communicate frequently with faculty regarding the change, both before and during implementation. In order to prepare teachers to implement a change with both understanding and support, school leaders need to hold frequent formal and informal informational sessions so that teachers can ask questions and express their opinions in a safe environment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Encourage implementation at lower grade levels prior to high school implementation. This allows for more time for high school leaders to coordinate the proposed change with what is already occurring at the secondary level, whether it is in structure or in content. Implementing a change later also allows for more discussion with elementary and middle school leaders to troubleshoot possible problems that might hinder implementation at the high school level.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Advocate for planned, sequential change to avoid teacher overload in learning new processes. Taking one step at a time and making sure that each step is as thoroughly planned out and tested is ideal in any change process. Particularly when the change affects the basic structure of how schools are organized and operate, as in the case of standards-based student grouping, preventing teachers from being overwhelmed is essential for successful implementation of the change.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Support any concerns or criticisms of a proposed change with research. All arguments that are grounded in factual data that have been gathered outside of the local school context are more persuasive. If local data are available, make sure that they have been gathered using sound research methods to avoid any implications of bias in the data collection.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Be sure the proposed change fits within your definition of what is best for students. School leaders will not be as successful implementing a change that they do not believe is beneficial to students as they would be in implementation a change that they wholeheartedly support. Principals need to be honest with themselves and with district leaders as to their buy-in to a proposed change. If school leaders cannot ethically support the proposed change, then they must decide if they will work to stop the change, whether through persuasion of district leadership or by organizing a critical mass of constituents, or must relocate to a district that is a better philosophical fit with their educational beliefs. Either decision is difficult, of course, and requires much reflection.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In implementing standards-based groupings at the high school level, be sure to provide a great deal of instructional leadership to teachers to ensure that both whole and small group instruction is still included in classroom. If teachers feel overloaded with a heightened demand for differentiation, self-paced “packet” instruction is a likely consequence.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Visit other high schools that have implemented standards-based groupings to learn what has worked and what has not worked in other contexts. While every school community is different, the basic structures of most high schools are very similar. Observing other systems and learning the challenges that other high school encountered in implementing the same change are always beneficial so that one can learn from the successes and mistakes of others.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Carefully discuss staffing requirements with district leadership for the addition of core subject sections in the implementation of standards-based groupings. As most districts and schools are experiencing a decline in resources, simply asking teachers to teach more students at different levels will not result in high-quality instruction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Develop a schedule that will allow standards-based grouped students to enroll in vocational and enrichment courses. Low-performing students may need extra instruction in core subjects but still need the opportunity to develop other interests and skills in which they might excel and heighten their overall engagement with schooling.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Leading the change process is a difficult undertaking, even when the philosophical rationale for the change has been established, as can be seen by the example of the Valley Verde school district. Standards-based student grouping is one option for the implementation of standards-based educational practices in schools, but the details of the process and the preparation of teachers are essential elements in successfully enacting this change. School leaders are the critical link between such district-level initiatives and successful school implementation, requiring leaders to be thoughtful critics, effective communicators, and highly involved instructional leaders. Laying the groundwork for standards-based student groupings, as well as the actual implementation of groupings, can be used by school leaders to strengthen both the professional learning culture and student performance, but as with any major change initiative, building capacity and knowledge and planning for incremental implementation are essential.</p>
