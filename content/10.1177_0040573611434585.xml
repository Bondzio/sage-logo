<p>The following is a lecture, which Prof. Dr. Jürgen Moltmann gave for the Reformation Day Celebration at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia. It has an ecumenical direction, beginning with Martin Luther and ending with Charles Wesley’s verse “Sun of Righteousness, Arise!” The lecture moves from Martin Luther in the sixteenth century and his treatise on “The Freedom of a Christian” to Martin Luther King Jr. in the twentieth century, and the inscription on his grave: “Free at last. At last free!”</p>

<body>
<p>This lecture for Reformation Day has an ecumenical direction. That is in line with the day itself, with this place, and with my own way of thinking. Because it is Reformation Day, I am beginning with Martin Luther. Because the Candler School of Theology is a Methodist foundation, I am ending with Charles Wesley’s verse “Sun of Righteousness, Arise!” And because this is the city of Atlanta, my thoughts in this lecture move from Martin Luther in the sixteenth century and his treatise on “The Freedom of a Christian” to Martin Luther King Jr. in the twentieth century, and the inscription on his grave: “Free at last. At last free!”</p>
<p>As a preparation for the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, which will take place in 2017, the Lutheran churches have proposed for this year a study of Luther’s treatise on freedom. So I shall begin with an analysis of the reasons he gives for the freedom of men and women in their faith in Christ.</p>
<p>Together with his writing on “The Babylonian Captivity of the Church” and his “Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation,” Luther’s “Freedom of a Christian” belongs to his great Reformation writings of 1520. It was immediately widely circulated at the time, and has moved the Christian world down to the present day. It made Protestant Christianity “the religion of liberty,” as Hegel extolled in the nineteenth century. It taught us to discover the experience of God in fellowship with Christ as being a tremendous experience of freedom.</p>
<p>But what is freedom? Is it inward freedom or outward freedom? Or is freedom always a whole, and all-comprehensive?</p>
<p>And freedom from what? Of course from sin. But only from the evil we do, or from the evil we suffer as well?</p>
<p>And freedom for what? For the selfless service of personal love for our neighbor, or also for public righteousness, which is to dwell on earth?</p>
<p>And lastly and first of all: freedom through what and through whom? How does faith in Christ make us free?</p>
<p>The world-shaking effect of this little “tract,” as Luther called it, is not immediately evident. It is dedicated quite provincially to a municipal administrator in the little town of Zwickau, where a Master Agran was already preaching Protestant sermons in 1520. Luther was still an Augustinian monk and was still calling himself one. His tract is set out quite academically, like a disputation. He put forward two theses (<italic>praepositiones</italic>) which seem to contradict each other: “A Christian is a free lord over all things, and subject to no one”; and “A Christian is a dutiful servant of all things and subject to everyone.” With these two theses Luther set out to develop “the freedom which Christ has won for us and conferred on us,” won on the cross and conferred on us in word and sacrament.</p>
<p>He then solved the seeming contradiction between his propositions in 30 sections in order, in the thirtieth to proclaim a conclusion which sounds like a shout of jubilation: “Behold, this is the true, spiritual, Christian liberty which frees the heart from sins, laws and commandments, and which surpasses all other liberty as the heaven surpasses the earth.” I shall briefly trace his train of thought and apply it to our situation today. But then, in the second part, I shall go on to complement Luther’s teaching about the liberation of sinners through Christ through my idea about the liberation of the victims through Christ. For I have the impression that in the Christianity of the West we are orientated in a one-sided way towards the perpetrators, and forget their victims. For the slaves of sin, Catholics have the sacrament of penance, and Protestants the forgiveness of sins in faith. But where the victims of sin are concerned, we seem to be at a loss, as has now become evident from the cases of sexual abuse that have been discovered in the Catholic Church and in schools and children’s homes. After the justification of sinners, we need a justification of the victims, for God does not only put the sinners right; he first of all creates justice for those who suffer violence, as the Psalms in the Old Testament tell us.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0040573611434585"><title>1. Luther’s Train of Thought</title>
<p>In order to solve the contradiction between freedom and “dutiful service,” Luther first talked about the two natures of every Christian: the spiritual, inward nature, and the bodily outward one. Where his soul is concerned, a Christian is called a “spiritual, new, inward human being,” but according to his flesh and blood he is a “bodily, old and outward” one.</p>
<p>Here, Luther brought the Platonic soul–body dualism together with the Pauline conflict between the new and the old human being, the “spirit” and the “flesh” (and like Augustine, too, confuses them).</p>
<p>What he wanted to say is that nothing external can either make the human being inwardly free or imprison him. Freedom and wickedness are neither bodily nor external: “Neither of these things can reach as far as the soul, to liberate it or to take it captive, to make it good or evil.” Whether one wears sacred garments or unholy ones, neither helps nor damages the soul. Up to this point, this does not sound biblical, but what Luther wanted to make clear is that in heaven and on earth there is nothing about the soul, where in the soul is “good, free and Christian” except the holy gospel, the word of God, preached by Christ. Where the soul has God’s word, it is free and blessed.</p>
<p>But what is this word of God? It is “the word of Christ, which tells you that you should surrender to him in firm faith. Then all your sins will be forgiven you for your faith’s sake, your condemnation and sadness will be set aside, and you will be just and free.” True faith in Christ brings with it all blessedness and takes all unhappiness away from us.</p>
<p>But what is true faith? Here Luther was not thinking of faith in a passive sense, but as something which is supremely active. Among men and women, loyalty and faith count.</p>
<p>If I say, I believe you, then I accept you, I consider that you are sincere, and through my trust I acknowledge you fully. I am saying that you are right and am honoring your name.</p>
<p>If I mistrust someone, I consider him to be false, faithless, and unreliable; and that is the greatest insult I can give him; I am rejecting him. So if I believe God, I trust him, say he is right and justify him in his word. It is faith in God of this kind, which fulfills the first commandment. This is the justification of God by the faithful.</p>
<p>And now comes Luther’s breathtaking conclusion about the reciprocal character of God and faith: “If, then, God sees that the soul acknowledges his truth and hence honors him though its faith, then he for his part honors the soul, and holds it to be good and true.” The soul justifies God through its faith in him and God justifies the soul through his grace. The instrument is the word of God, in which Christ comes to the soul. “Whoever clings to the word with true faith, that person’s soul will be so wholly united with God that all the virtues of the word will also become properties of the soul, and thus the soul will be like God” (on the tenth point).</p>
<p>In the twelfth section, Luther brought this idea about the union of the soul with God in faith to its climax. According to the good Augustinian tradition, he took up the mystic image of the marriage of the soul to its heavenly bridegroom Christ. If the soul is “one with” the divine word, then faith also unites the soul with Christ himself as “a bride is united with her bridegroom.” They become one body. But it is a union through reciprocity: what belongs to Christ becomes the property of the soul, and what belongs to the soul becomes the property of Christ. Christ possesses everything that is good and blessed, and these things become the property of the soul: all vices and sins lie upon the soul, and they become the property of Christ.</p>
<p>That is the famous “merry exchange” in Christian faith: Christ takes upon himself the sins, the damnation and the sadnesses of the soul and drowns them; through its faith the soul is freed from all its sins and receives the righteousness of Christ:
<disp-quote>
<p>Is that not a merry business, when the rich, noble and godly bridegroom Christ takes in marriage the poor, despised, wicked little whore, strips her of all evil and adorns her with all good things? Thus it is not possible for the sins, to condemn her, for they now lie upon Christ and are swallowed up in him.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To add my own comment, Luther began his treatise with the Augustinian ring round God and the soul. He then deepened the image by drawing in the medium that joins God and the soul: God’s word and the soul’s faith. The soul takes the impress of God’s word and becomes like the word in form, its faith recognizes God’s faithfulness and acknowledges his truth. From this follows the mutual justification of God and the soul. In Christ, God and the soul come together and become one. But for Luther this was not a transcendental soul mysticism; it was a real, concrete knowledge of Christ. In his suffering and dying on the cross, Christ takes upon himself the sins of the world in order to give believers the freedom of his resurrection and the fullness of life. The “merry exchange” does not take place at the solitary peak of the soul, where it touches the mystery of the eternal God, as in medieval mysticism or modern meditation practices. It happens in faith, in that Christ draws the believing soul into his passion and his resurrection. In his cross he takes upon himself the soul’s condemned sins, in his resurrection he gives it his freedom and the breadth of his life. With this, Luther broke the spell of Augustinian soul theology. In the twelfth section, we can see his reforming breakthrough to Christ theology.</p>
<p>Will the Christian of the future have to be a mystic or cease to be as Karl Rahner maintained? I don’t think so. I am convinced, rather, that “the Christian of the future” will be a Christian. He will know Christ, who frees him from all sins, condemnations and sadnesses, and takes him with himself on his path of resurrection and the fullness of life. The Christian of the future will live in faith from the experience of Christ. The whole burden of sin and grief will leave her, and she will be just “good, whole, and beautiful,” as Elisabeth Moltmann-Wendel said for feminist self-confidence.</p>
<p>To come back to Luther, “A Christian is a free lord over all things and subject to no one” was his first thesis. Do we now know how the thesis should be understood? It is not a formula for ruling the world. “It is not that in our bodies we have power over all things so as to possess them or make use of them, as men and women do on earth, for we have to die, and no one can escape death.” It is a spiritual lordship that is meant, and an inner strength to live. Through faith all Christians are with Christ “kings and priests,” highly exalted above all things, for all things are made subject to them inasmuch as they are “an aid towards blessedness.” For this Luther quoted the relevant words of Paul:
<list id="list1-0040573611434585" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>“All things are yours, whether the world or life or death, but you are Christ’s and Christ is God’s” (1 Cor 3:21, 23).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“All things work together for good to those who love God” (Rom 8:28).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus” (Rom 8:38–39).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>For Luther, the deepest reason why all things are “subject” to the Christian, in that they are bound to contribute to blessedness, is the resurrection victory of life over death and the powers of death (1 Cor 15:54, 57): “Death is swallowed up in victory … Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” So what is meant is not political world power by way of an empire or through globalization, it is a supreme life experience in faith: “All things”—that means everything I encounter or do: living and dying, joy and sorrow: “Thus nothing is so good or so evil that it does not have to serve to me for good. See, that is a precious Christian liberty and power,” said Luther. We are reminded of Augustine, who asked himself skeptically, “Even my sins?” and replied, with faith, “Yes, even my sins.”</p>
<p>Through faith, all Christians are, with Christ, “kings and priests.” They are kings because everything works for their good. They are priests because they come before God and intercede for others. “Through his kingship he [a Christian] has power over all things. But through his priesthood he has power over God, for God does what he desires and asks for” (on the sixteenth section).</p>
<p>But can we really expect such great things of human faith? How far can people then go in faith? Theologically, Luther expected of faith everything we have listed up to now, but he is also aware of the weakness of faith as it is actually experienced. So he trusted to the beginning in faith and to its growth and increase in the vista of the completion in the world to come. “On earth there is and remains only a beginning and a growing, which will be finished in that world.” “Faith must always grow, until we come to that life.” I think John Wesley would like to come in here. For here believers experience only “the first fruits of the Spirit.” But then, what does this growing and increasing in faith consist of, since in Christ faith already has everything? Here Luther’s second thesis began: “A Christian is a dutiful servant of all things and subject to everyone.” Although a person is completely justified through faith, he is nevertheless still on earth, must rule over his body, and has to do with other people. “There the works begin.” Because the Christian is already just and blessed in faith, he performs these works “freely and for nothing, out of love” for the sake of his neighbor. One no longer performs good works in order to endorse oneself, and not to win recognition either; for one’s own self is already just and good, already accepted and happy in faith. Now one does everything only for the sake of one’s neighbor. That is pure, selfless love.</p>
<p>For this Luther used the image of the good tree and its good fruits, and distinguishes the person from their works. Good works no longer make a good person, but a good person does good works. What he said at the beginning about the soul now applies to the person of the man or woman. The person must first be good and godly, before all the good works, and good works proceed from the godly and good person. Hence good or evil works make the man or woman as person neither good nor bad, but the person makes the works good or bad (the 23rd section).</p>
<p>A good house does not make a good builder, but a bad builder makes a bad house. But the person becomes just, free, and good through faith in Christ. “So even as faith makes the person just, so it also makes the works just.”</p>
<p>I would comment here: I believe that this distinction between person and work is important today, too. We always identify another person with his or her works. The person who once tells a lie is a liar, the person who once commits a murder is a murderer. By this we are fixing the persons to what they are, tying them to what they did. In the eyes of Christian faith all this is quite different: we distinguish the person from their evil works, condemn the evil acts but respect the person, whom God loves and for whom Christ dies. To put it in general terms, we respect the human dignity of every person, quite irrespective of whether they are sitting in prison or in the House of Representatives. By this we are giving them the chance to change their life. We are opening the future for them.</p>
<p>To come back to Luther, all good works are performed out of selfless love for one’s neighbor. That is what is meant by saying that the Christian should be “subject to everyone.” The Christian serves his neighbor for the neighbor’s sake, because in faith he or she has lost all self-love and all self-hate. So they are “wholly free” to become the willing servant of their neighbor and to act towards that neighbor as God in Christ has acted towards them. “See, out of faith there therefore flows love and joy in God, and out of that love a free, willing, joyful life, to serve our neighbor without reward” (the 27th section). God has helped us “for nothing,” so we also help “for nothing,” freely, not out of reciprocity—as you do to me, so I do to you. Love is always prevenient—it runs ahead, and in doing so it is free, creative, and giving.</p>
<p>Finally comes the summing up of the treatise:
<disp-quote>
<p>A Christian does not live in himself, but in Christ and his neighbor: in Christ through faith, in his neighbor through love. Through faith he is carried beyond himself into God, from God he moves again back to himself through love, and yet always remains in God and in divine love.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To put it simply, a Christian is beside oneself, beside oneself through faith in God—beside oneself through love in beloved human beings. A Christian is beside oneself for happiness, the happiness of having been found by Christ and of being loved by God.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040573611434585"><title>2. The Complement Justification of the Victims of Sin</title>
<p>In this second part, I shall try to translate Luther’s “Freedom of a Christian”—to carry it over from the freedom in faith of the perpetrators of sin to the freedom in faith of the victims of sin. The justification of the people, who commit the sin, must go together with the justification of the victims of that sin, if God’s righteousness and justice is to be spread on earth. The gospel for the sinners is clear, but is there a gospel for the victims, too? In the tradition of the Roman culture, we are oriented towards the perpetrator in a one-sided way. We fight evil by punishing the evil-doers. And where are the victims? God doesn’t forget the victims of evil, for Christ himself was the victim of evil’s godless forces.</p>
<p>Yet even the apostle Paul, to whom Luther felt himself to be particularly indebted, was oriented towards the perpetrators and forgot the victims. So in his letter to the Romans he confessed self-critically and honestly: “I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I that do it, but sin which dwells within me” (Rom 7:19–20). Here he declared that sin is a trans-personal power and that he himself is its slave. He lamented his slavery in sin and extols Christ, who has freed him of this slavery. That is right, but why is he concerned only about himself, and not also about the victims, the people, whom he has wronged, and to whom he has failed to do good? What emerges here is a great gap in Christianity’s doctrine of grace, from Paul to Luther.</p>
<p>If we compare what Paul said about the “sin which dwells within me,” and whose slave he is, with the Jesus of the Gospels, we notice that Jesus’ first glance was directed to the poor, the sick and the outcasts among his people, and that he “had compassion” on them (Matt 9:36). He doesn’t look at the slaves of sin, but at the victims, and he brings them the liberating message about the kingdom of God, which is already theirs.</p>
<p>If we turn to Israel’s Psalms, we find that God’s righteousness is a righteousness which creates justice for the victims of “injustice and violence.” “He works justice for all who are oppressed” (Pss 103; 146). God’s righteousness is not merely a righteousness which lays down what is good and what is evil, nor is it a righteousness which repays good with good and evil with evil; it is a creative righteousness which brings about justice, a righteousness which puts things right. That is what the Protestant Reformers meant by “just-ification”: <italic>justitia justificans</italic>.</p>
<p>Let us now ask about the justification of the victims of sin.
<list id="list2-0040573611434585" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>In his treatise on freedom, Luther had in mind from the beginning only the perpetrators of sin and the people enslaved by sin. So he also saw human beings only as the determining subjects of their good and evil acts. He did not look at their sufferings as a result of the evil acts of other people. For Luther, everything proceeds from within to without, from the soul to the body, from the tree to its fruits, from the person to their works, not in the reverse direction.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>But the victims of injustice and violence are not the determining subjects of their actions; they are made the objects of the action of other people outside them. They don’t act in accordance with their own wills, but are at the mercy of the evil wills of other people. Their souls are wounded by action from outside. They are exposed to humiliation, insults, violation, torture, and the destruction of their self-respect. In their persons they are not “superior to” the evil works of the people who inflict violence on them; they are delivered over to these people. Their souls are traumatized by what is done to them against their will. How are victims of sin to become free from the godless power and the sin which destroys their humanity? How does God bring about justice for those who suffer violence? Are they redeemed from their humiliation by Christ?
<list id="list3-0040573611434585" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Luther said that the soul was bound to God through his word. But it is bound to God through his Spirit, too. Through his Spirit, God also participates in the joys and pains of the soul, for God is love, and the spirit of love is sympathy. A stronger word for divine sympathy is God’s com-passion, his feeling with us and his suffering with us. God is not an apathetic, indifferent God. Israel’s God is full of passion, he is angry, and loves, and shares the fate of his people. What Israel experiences, its God experiences too. The God of Jesus Christ is full of passion love. The story of Christ’s passion is also the story of passion of the Father of Jesus Christ. The fellowship, the community, of the soul with God is a <italic>unio sympathetica</italic>, a fellowship of those united in suffering. God dwells in heaven, and with those who are of a broken heart (Ps 34:18; Isa 57:15). God is the God of the gods and brings about justice for widows and orphans. God is exalted and looks upon the lowest of the low. God carries men and women with their pains and their sins. “God is the fellow-sufferer who understands,” wrote the mathematician Alfred North Whitehead, in his learned book <italic>Process and Reality</italic>, when his son died at the age of 21.</p></list-item>
</list>
<disp-quote>
<p>And when human hearts are breaking</p>
<p>Under sorrow’s iron rod,</p>
<p>then there is the self-same aching</p>
<p>deep within the heart of God.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>
<list id="list4-0040573611434585" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Luther talked about the “merry exchange” between the sin of the soul and the righteousness of Christ. But Christ’s passion is in the first place a consoling solidarity with the victims of sin. The Gospels tell the story of the passion as his path into the fate of the victims. He is taken prisoner. He is tortured. He is abandoned by his closest friends. The priests of his people turn away from him. The Romans put him to a cruel death through crucifixion as a rebel against the Roman Empire and an enemy of the human race. And Christ goes from Gethsemane to Golgotha into the dark night of God-forsakenness. The one, who came to seek the lost, becomes one of the lost himself, to find them.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>And God goes where Christ goes. God himself was in Christ. Along the path of his passion, Jesus brings God to the victims, who are as humiliated, tormented, and forsaken as he himself. And the victims of injustice and violence can recognize in Christ their divine brother in their distress. The assailed, dying Christ becomes the comfort for assailed and dying men and women. Through his surrendering of himself to his God-forsaken death, Christ brings God to the God-forsaken people.</p>
<p>To speak in more general terms, Christ’s cross on Golgotha stands between the unnumbered crosses which line the bloody path of the violent in humanity’s inhumane history, from Nero down to Hitler’s death camps, down to the annihilated in the Gulag Archipelago and “the disappeared” in the Latin American dictatorships. Christ’s cross is a sign that God participates in the pains of the forsaken victims, and is beside us in our forsakenness. “Only the suffering God can help,” wrote Dietrich Bonhoeffer from his death cell.</p>
<p>It is the identification of Christ with the victims of sin which makes the tremendous drama of the image of the great Judgment in Matt 25 comprehensible: the victims, the “hungry, thirsty, strangers, naked, sick and imprisoned,” are his sisters and brothers: “What you did to them, you did to me,” for “I was hungry … thirsty … in prison.” He identifies himself so closely with the victims that he will judge according to what has been done to them. He judges the perpetrators in the face of their victims, who are beside him.</p>
<p>That is the consoling solidarity christology which has long been overlooked in our traditions. It is the other side of the reconciliation christology. If we wanted to adopt Luther’s language, we might say that through faith the injured, humiliated, forsaken soul is united with the injured, humiliated, and forsaken Christ, and Christ takes the tormented soul in his arms and takes its pain on himself in order to lead it into his resurrection freedom and to make it blessed in the fullness of life.
<list id="list5-0040573611434585" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What are the practical consequences? For the perpetrators of sin, we have the sacrament of penance and the forgiveness of sins, the confession of sin, contrition, and satisfaction. For the victims of the sins of injustice and violence we have nothing comparable. I should like to make a suggestion, drawn from my own experience.
<list id="list6-0040573611434585" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Only the truth can make victims free. The victims of injustice and violence must emerge not just from the suffering that has been inflicted on them, but from their humiliation as well. In the case of the victims of sexual abuse, shame over the violation they have suffered is added. That often seals their lips life-long. They first of all need recognition of their personal dignity, and recognition of the injustice under which they suffer. They need a protective space of love in order to become aware of what really has been done to them. Self-hate and self-pity are no help. It is only regained self-respect which lets the victims rise above what they have suffered and liberates their personality. The perpetrator’s admission of guilt can help. But the victims must not wait for this, because they must become free from fixation on the perpetrators, and must take their lives into their own hands. They must not go on being “victims” forever.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>After they have been raised from the depths of humiliation into the wide space of the affirmation of life, the next step will lead to a surmounting of the evil which has thrust itself into life contrary to their own will. Everyone who suffers injustice has dreams of revenge and retaliation: perpetrators must suffer the same pain as their victims. Then we are quit. But we also know that retaliation of evil with evil only increases the evil, suffered, “which must unceasingly bring forth evil,” as Goethe said. “Do not be overcome by evil,” counsels Paul (Rom 12:24). So do not requite evil with evil. Anyone who kills the person who has murdered is also someone who commits murder. I believe democratic institutions must not lie, must not steal, and must not kill. Overcome evil with good, Paul goes on. It is not a matter of the perpetrators, but of the evil to which they were enslaved, and that evil can only be combated with good. If we do that, we don’t only help the person enslaved by evil to free themselves from that evil, but we do something good for ourselves as well. We liberate our souls from shame and disgrace, hate and revenge, and all the evil dreams that torment us. The forgiveness of guilt is the sovereign royal right of the victims. It raises them above the perpetrators and makes them free lords over all things and subject to none!</p></list-item>

<p>Finally, I should like to put forward a daring thesis about being a Christian. For in his treatise Luther only dealt with freedom in faith, and the readiness to serve in love. And where is the hope? So I would say, a Christian is an heir of God’s future, in which there are no longer masters and servants. A Christian does not merely experience faith as the righteousness of God, and a Christian does not only in personal love stand up for the rights of his neighbor, he also hopes that the sun of God’s righteousness and justice will rise above the bloody history of human beings and of this sorely tried earth. So with Charles Wesley he sings,
<disp-quote>
<p>Sun of Righteousness, Arise!</p>
<p>Triumph O’er the shades of night.</p>
<p>Dayspring from on high be near,</p>
<p>dayspring in my heart appear.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Wherever we bring a little freedom to the oppressed and a little bread to the hungry and a little comfort to the sad, we are children of his kingdom “on earth as it is in heaven.” Wherever we heal the wounds which we have inflicted on the earth in centuries of ruthless exploitation, we anticipate the earth “on which righteousness dwells” (2 Pet 3:13).</p>
<p>For this category of hope for God’s future and for the liberation of the victims of injustice and violence we have to thank not Martin Luther, but Martin Luther King Jr. He always began his last speeches like a prophet or like Moses himself (Deut 34): “I have been on the top of the mountain; I have seen the promised land.” Like Moses, he was not able to experience much of “the promised land” of righteousness and justice in his country. We too, still in the shadows of night, see only the first rays of the morning sun. But his “I have a dream” of 1963 in Washington is unforgotten. It is the dream of equality and the “beloved community.” “I have a dream, that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low … and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together” (Isa 40:4–5).</p>
<p>The “together” is important, separated we shall never see the glory of the Lord. This promise gives us hope in disappointments and lets us rise up again, when we were cast down. Why? So as then, after all, to end with the first Martin Luther. Why? “Das Reich muss uns doch bleiben.” “The kingdom is ours forever!”</p>
