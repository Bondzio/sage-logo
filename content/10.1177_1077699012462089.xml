<p>The first and only issue of the first English-language newspaper in America, Boston’s <italic>Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick</italic>, included several telling articles about American Indians. Some Indians were friendly (they were “Christianized”); others were threatening (they were “miserable savages”). In one form or another, these contrasting categories have been ingrained in popular culture from the colonial era to the present, resulting in a misleading and harmful set of ideas and images about American Indians that this text sets out to describe, deconstruct, and correct.</p>
<p>Meta G. Carstarphen of the University of Oklahoma and John P. Sanchez of the University of Pennsylvania have put together a comprehensive overview of how American Indians have been portrayed in the mass media. The book is organized into four parts: Historical Analyses, Contemporary Viewpoints, Mediated Images and Social Expectations, and Interior Views and Authentic Voices. Each section includes articles by scholars, journalists, and activists, many of whom write—refreshingly—from American Indian perspectives. They offer research and commentaries on topics ranging from labels (Are they “tribes?” “nations?” “Indians?” “Native Americans?”) to legal issues, such as tribal sovereignty and the continuing reliance on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century stereotypes in news, advertising, and the movies.</p>
<p>The purpose of the collection, co-editor Carstarphen writes, is “to chart some of the seminal issues concerning American Indians and the media, from past portrayals to contemporary icons, in a manner that explicates the new and the nuanced.” In this, the book is largely successful, though the quality and significance of the articles varies and the collection would benefit from a more powerful and coherent theoretical foundation. That said, the best of these essays tackle important questions about race and representation in American culture and describe ongoing efforts to carve out a place for Native American voices in contemporary media. Even in the twentieth-first century, as contributor Victoria E. Sanchez notes, American Indian “voices and self-representations are overshadowed by the pervasive and monolithic images perpetuated and reinforced by the institutions of the American mass media.”</p>
<p>One of the most interesting chapters is Lynn Klyde-Silverstein’s analysis of the 2002 controversy surrounding the “Fighting Whites,” the deliberately provocative name of an intramural basketball team at the University of Northern Colorado. The team, which offered a clean-cut, smiling white man as its mascot, generated huge media coverage and allowed American Indians to raise pointed questions about Indian mascots. Nevertheless, Klyde-Silverstein found that American Indians did not have the power to frame the issue themselves and could not stop some readers and reporters from trivializing the topic. “Through trivialization,” she concludes, “[Colorado] newspapers created a picture of American Indians as unimportant to mainstream American life.”</p>
<p>Other notable chapters include Selene G. Phillips’s examination of news and advertising images of Indians in <italic>Life</italic> magazine from 1937 to 1949. Despite some positive and well-intentioned representations, Phillips discovered many advertising images that featured whites “playing Indian,” a role that mocked “actual modes of American Indian dress, behavior, or culture.” For example, ads for Clicquot Club Soda featured a smiling Inuit boy known as Klee-ko, presented as a sign of wholesomeness. “When quality decides the call,” the copy read, “this Eskimo is paged.”</p>
<p>In the Contemporary Viewpoints section, Stacey J.T. Hust and Debra Merskin recount the history of “The ‘S’-Word,” a reference to “squaw,” said to be an Algonquian word for vagina and variously used as a synonym for woman, prostitute, harlot, and other demeaning terms. The battles surrounding the word’s origin, meanings, and uses in geography and public discourse have been bitterly contested, Hust and Merskin found, and removing the word as a place-name has been impeded by media coverage that—once again—“prioritized non-Indian opinions and arguments.”</p>
<p>Concerning Hollywood, contributor Jennifer Meness highlights the 1998 Indian-produced film <italic>Smoke Signals</italic> for its pathbreaking perspectives, what she calls “equipment for living.” By skillfully using Native humor and reservation in-jokes, writer Sherman Alexie and director Chris Eyre were able to speak to Native viewers in terms they understood while also appealing to non-Native viewers. In a similar vein, law professor André Douglas Pond Cummings assesses the shifting Indian stereotypes in law and in Hollywood, where Eyre, Alexie, and other American Indian filmmakers have challenged clichés with new kinds of Indian stories and opened the door for young Native filmmakers, writers, and actors.</p>
<p>In the Interior Views and Authentic Voices section, journalist Mark Trahant tells the story of the American Indian Press Association (AIPA), a 1970s effort to generate Indian news from Indian perspectives. Although the AIPA lasted only a few years, it was one of the forerunners of the Native American Journalists Association (NAJA), an organization that has fostered a generation of young Native American journalists since its founding in the 1980s.</p>
<p>With its variety of topics and perspectives, this collection will be a thought-provoking addition to classes that deal with American Indians and popular culture. Beyond the classroom, the book should be required reading for non-Native journalists who cover American Indians and their communities. Some readers are likely to find the book too politically correct, overly concerned with “trivial” matters such as labels and mascots and psychological issues such as self-esteem. The editors and authors would respond, I suspect, by reminding critics of the long and shameful legacy of anti-Indian prejudice in American history and culture. Against that backdrop, this collection is a welcome response.</p>
