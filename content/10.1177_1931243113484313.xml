<abstract>
<p>In journalism, writing concisely is fundamental. Multimedia journalism demands even more writing precision. . . . In this quasi-experimental study (<italic>n</italic> = 113), we tested the effects of the paramedic method (PM) of writing instruction on multimedia writing students completing a broadcast-style news writing assignment. We hypothesized a reduction in word count and an increase in writing quality. Word counts decreased significantly. While the quality of writing did not significantly improve with the PM samples, the overall decrease in words did not lower the quality of writing. The results indicate an overall improvement in writing efficiency with little or no effect on the quality of the writing. This study unveils a unique approach to clarifying writing that can be implemented in the multimedia classroom and by professional journalists. The study shows significant results for lowering word count and an important aspect of multimedia writing.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multimedia<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1931243113484313">1</xref></sup> journalism students write in many genres including social media, online, print, and broadcast. Their first exposure to multimedia writing styles may not happen until their sophomore or even junior years. At this point, students have focused their writing on research papers, essays, and other lengthier writing genres, often adding words to pad the length of a piece or using nonconversational syntax and phrasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1931243113484313">Olson, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The multimedia classroom, unlike the traditional English composition classroom, is designed to teach students to write in nontraditional genres, reducing the number of words used, but maintaining the information needed for the reader. Common efforts to impress professors in traditional academic subjects are the opposite of what is appropriate for multimedia writing, but there are relatively few prescribed teaching methods for correcting these problems. Multimedia students may be writing for mobile applications of only 256 characters or Tweets of only 140 characters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1931243113484313">Fisher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1931243113484313">Gigel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1931243113484313">Tweeternet, 2012</xref>). The typical online writing piece is reduced to 400–500 words and a broadcast reader may contain less than 80 words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1931243113484313">Fisher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1931243113484313">Gigel, 2003</xref>). This experimental study analyzed two newswriting samples from 100 communication students. Each student wrote two writing samples based on the same fact set. The samples were television readers based on a straightforward set of facts. After completing the first writing sample, the treatment group then received instruction using the “paramedic method,” a writing technique developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1931243113484313">Lanham (1979</xref>) to reduce the number of words in a sentence by eliminating prepositional phrases and using the active voice. Comparing the original sample with the paramedic writing sample, the study found an average of 11% reduction in the number of words in the paramedic writing sample after one 20-min instruction session.</p>
<p>To date, the scholarship about specific methods that can be used by <italic>multimedia</italic> students (students who are expected to write in several genres including social media, broadcast, and online) to improve their writing is limited. This study offers an overview of the effectiveness of the paramedic method (PM) within a new context, the multimedia classroom.</p>
<sec id="section2-1931243113484313">
<title>The Paramedic Method</title>
<p>Richard Lanham, a University of California, Los Angeles English professor and author of 11 books on rhetoric and writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1931243113484313">Lanham, 2011</xref>), developed the PM in his book <italic>Revising Prose</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1931243113484313">Lanham, 1979</xref>) to help writers clarify their writing. The method employs eight basic steps to improve writing by decreasing word count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1931243113484313">Sheehan-Johnson, 2012</xref>). Lanham named it the “paramedic method” because it acts as an emergency resuscitator to sentences full of what Lanham calls “lard factor” (1987, p. 2).</p>
<p>Lanham developed the PM with business prose in mind. He described the most accepted writing style in day-to-day business as the “official style” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1931243113484313">Lanham, 1987</xref>), fraught with weak verbs, a dependence on nouns, and with too many prepositions. Lanham’s description of the foibles of business prose may also adeptly describe the majority of college student writing. According to scholarship by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1931243113484313">Williams (1982</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1931243113484313">Stone (1989</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1931243113484313">Auman (1995</xref>), professors and peers perceived journalism students to be similarly deficient in their writing, lacking both basic and mechanical writing skills.</p>
<p>Lanham developed the PM to address mechanical and stylistic issues in writing. The eight steps are as follows:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Circle the prepositions.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Circle the “is” forms.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Ask “who is kicking who” (who is performing the action).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Put this kicking action into a simple (not compound verb).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Start fast—no mindless introductions.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Write out each sentence on a blank piece of paper and mark off its rhythm units with a “/.”</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Read the passage aloud with emphasis and feeling.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Mark off sentence lengths in the passage with “/” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1931243113484313">Lanham, 1987</xref>, p. 7).</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The PM relies on active writing and the elimination of wordiness, making it a useful tool not only for journalism education but also for professional journalists. Although Lanham’s original target audience was business people, he emphasizes that his method provides a step-by-step approach to writing improvement that can be applied to all writing genres. The PM’s primary goal is to reduce unnecessary words by transforming passive writing into active writing. This step-by-step method may elevate students’ writing awareness by forcing them to critically look at each sentence after writing it. This awareness of each word, and each sentence, helps students identify words that are critical versus words that can be considered “LF or lard fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1931243113484313">Lanham, 1987</xref>).”</p>

<title>Writing Concisely</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>To get the right word in the right place is a rare achievement. To condense the diffused light of a page of thought into the luminous flash of a single sentence, is worthy to rank as a prize composition just by itself … Anybody can have ideas—the difficulty is to express them without squandering a quire of paper on an idea that ought to be reduced to one glittering paragraph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1931243113484313"><italic>White house symposium on the life and works of Mark Twain</italic>, 2008</xref>). <italic>Mark Twain, February 10, 1868</italic></p></disp-quote>
Good journalism begins with good English. Technology helps us identify passive writing (if you tell it to), but it is up to the writer to make the necessary changes. Nevertheless, technology has also changed the way we write (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1931243113484313">Thurman &amp; Lupton, 2008</xref>). As audiences turn to cell phones, tablets, and computer screens for their information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1931243113484313">Purcell, Rainie, Rosenstiel, &amp; Mitchell, 2011</xref>), journalists must adapt traditional journalism practices to short-form writing compatible with multimedia devices. Multimedia students, as well, are now presented with the challenge of transitioning from the silos of traditional journalistic writing to multimedia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1931243113484313">Daniels, 2006</xref>). Writing concisely is more critical than ever for multimedia students who will soon join the workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1931243113484313">Fisher, 2003</xref>). British editors of dailies adopting multimedia platforms confirmed that the core skills in the convergence newsroom include, first and foremost, the ability to write clearly and concisely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1931243113484313">Thurman &amp; Lupton, 2008</xref>). As journalism evolves, the multimedia pieces that are produced remain an extension of the written word (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1931243113484313">Jacobson, 2012</xref>). While news articles are incorporating more and more hypertext, social media, and even interactive games, the song remains the same—writing is at the heart of the integrity of these pieces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1931243113484313">Jacobson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1931243113484313">Thurman &amp; Lupton, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Multimedia students’ writing abilities must exceed the skills of their predecessors. No longer do students have the luxury of 15 in. of column for a piece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1931243113484313">Fisher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1931243113484313">Gigel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1931243113484313">Thurman &amp; Lupton, 2008</xref>). Writing for the web or mobile platforms, they must now write the same piece with considerably fewer words in order to fully inform the reader before the “jump” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1931243113484313">Thurman &amp; Lupton, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1931243113484313">2</xref></sup> Because they read more slowly, web readers require 50% less text in order to fully absorb what is being read (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1931243113484313">Gigel, 2003</xref>). Cell phones allow for only 256 characters, a considerably greater challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1931243113484313">Fisher, 2003</xref>) and a Tweet consists of a mere 140 characters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1931243113484313">Tweeternet, 2012</xref>). Writing concisely as a journalist has never been more critical.</p>
<p>Concise writing sells articles, garners promotions, and showers accolades. Pulitzer prize-winning author E. B. White brought concise writing to the discussion table with his renowned book, <italic>The Elements of Style </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1931243113484313">Strunk &amp; White, 2000</xref>). The book, which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009, was based on a privately published text used by Will Strunk in his Cornell English courses. White resurrected the “little book” and prepared it for publication years after Strunk’s death. He explained Strunk’s premise for the book in the introduction, “It was Will Strunk’s <italic>parvum opus</italic>, his attempt to cut the vast tangle of English rhetoric down to size and write its rules and principles on the head of a pin” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1931243113484313">Strunk &amp; White, 2000</xref>, p. 8).</p>
<p>Professional writers rely on the ability to write concisely to sustain them. Some have been wildly successful. J. K Rowlings, author of the Harry Potter series, mastered the active voice. She, like Richard Lanham, relies on the subject–verb–object sentence structure, complete with fiery verbs.
<disp-quote>
<p>A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1931243113484313">Rowling, 1999</xref>, p. 17)</p>
</disp-quote>
Journalism is, of course, based on fact, not fiction. The art of storytelling, however, is the <italic>way</italic> in which it is written. Gay Talese considered the founder of “new journalism” says that getting the facts right is important, but that telling a story is equally important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1931243113484313">Hackett, 2011</xref>). Journalists use these stories to sell newspapers, websites, and broadcast advertising. Up-and-coming student journalists, like journalists in newsrooms globally, must now come to grips with the concept of a converged journalism environment as an “urgent necessity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1931243113484313">Huang et al., 2006</xref>, p. 222), an atmosphere where storytelling may embody audio files, slides, and video. The field is so hot right now that scholars are quickly churning out books for the multimedia classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1931243113484313">Daniels, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1931243113484313">Moretti, 2010</xref>) with the intention of improving these future journalists’ abilities to conquer the changing media landscape … </p>
<p>The foundation of any journalistic piece, whether traditional or multimedia, remains good writing. Good writing is the kind of writing people can easily read and understand. Teaching multimedia students <italic>how</italic> to write well is the test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1931243113484313">
<title>Writing Instruction Challenges</title>
<p>Journalism instructors in the multimedia classroom may be required to instruct students not only in technology and visual elements but also in writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1931243113484313">Auman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1931243113484313">Huang et al., 2006</xref>). Teaching courses that focus on writing alone challenge even the best professors and for a good reason. According to the National Assessment of Academic Progress’s 2008 report, only 29% of students nationwide were writing at a “proficient” level in the eighth grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1931243113484313">U.S. Department of Education, 2008</xref>). Of the students tested, 57% wrote at a “basic” level, 13% of students wrote at the “below basic” level, and only 2% of students wrote at an “advanced” level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1931243113484313">U.S. Department of Education, 2008</xref>). What is more startling than the writing scores is the increase in students attending college. In 2009, U.S. Department of Education reported to the U.S. Census bureau that of the 2,937,000 students who graduated from high school, 70% enrolled in college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1931243113484313">U.S. Census Bureau, 2012</xref>). If the U.S. Department of Education’s writing ability statistics are generalizable to the following year, college writing classes in 2009 consisted mainly of students who wrote only at a “basic” and not at a proficient level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1931243113484313">U.S. Department of Education, 2008</xref>). The Chronicle for Higher Education’s 2006 writing study revealed that 44% of faculty members surveyed stated that students were not well prepared for college writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1931243113484313">Lingwall, 2010</xref>). To teach a particular writing style in the midst of considerable skill deficits presents an even greater challenge. Faculty members in the survey indicated that they were spending a large percentage of their time dealing with student writing deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1931243113484313">Lingwall, 2010</xref>). These writing deficiencies included grammar, spelling, punctuation, and style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1931243113484313">Lingwall, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Scholars arguing against mechanical approaches to writing instruction suggest that less emphasis should be placed on mechanics that position the teacher as “editor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1931243113484313">Hammond, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1931243113484313">Lingwall, 2010</xref>). Scholars who resist the “editor and reporter” model of instruction emphasize opening up a dialogue with students, removing the teacher as expert and sentence mechanic, and encouraging other aspects of journalism like “news worthiness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1931243113484313">Lingwall, 2010</xref>). Lyle Olsen, among other scholars, emphasizes the need for diversity in writing instruction, allowing faculty to explore various teaching methods in the writing classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1931243113484313">Olson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1931243113484313">Perelman, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1931243113484313">Weathers, 1976</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1931243113484313">Olson (1992</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1931243113484313">Weathers (1976</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1931243113484313">Perelman (1986</xref>) posit that diversity of instruction may improve writing students’ motivation to learn and increase positive outcomes in the writing classroom.</p>
<p>Based on a review of literature on writing, and writing challenges, as well as a literature review of the PM, we formed two broad research questions, which we then operationalized and formed testable hypotheses:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Research Question 1</italic>: Will students be able to decrease the number of words in their stories by applying the PM?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Research Question 2</italic>: Will the quality of the stories be affected after applying the PM?</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Since Research Question 1 amounts to an exercise in counting words, we formed the following hypothesis:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Students will use fewer words to complete a news writing assignment after learning the PM than before.</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Our second research question, leading to Hypothesis 2, required the operationalization of “quality” of writing:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: News stories written using the PM will rate significantly higher in terms of overall quality, as measured by an accepted scale, than stories written by the same participants before receiving instruction in the PM.</p>
</list-item>

<title>Method</title>
<p>In determining Hypothesis 1, the first five steps of the PM were presented in an instructional setting. Due to time limitations, the last three steps were mentioned as additional teaching points at the end of the sessions. One hundred students participated in approximately six 50-min class periods. The students ranged from freshmen to seniors with the majority appearing as members of the junior class. Participants in the study had not been previously introduced to the PM.</p>
<p>The students were given the following fact set as a base for writing a broadcast news story. We chose the broadcast news reader as it fell somewhere in between the challenges of writing a very precise social media piece and the longer form online piece. We did not ask the students to write a print version of the story using the PM as print style can be considerably longer with more flexibility for excessive word usage. Students were instructed to write a reader for use in a newscast that would air at 5 p.m. that evening. A reader is a shorter story in which anchors read the copy without video. The typical reader runs approximately 15–20 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1931243113484313">Tuggle, Carr, &amp; Huffman, 2007</xref>). In broadcast journalism, producers and reporters are often presented with limited facts, similar to our fact set, when writing the initial news story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1931243113484313">Shoemaker &amp; Reese, 1996</xref>). The limited amount of facts and short story form allowed the exercise to be completed in a typical 50-min class period.</p>
<p>Fact Set:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>WHO: Amtrak train called the Colonial.</p>

</list-item>
</list>At the beginning of each session, the instructor presented the above fact set on a PowerPoint slide and asked the students to write the reader for the 5 p.m. newscast. The instructor advised the students that this exercise was a workshop and would not affect their grades in the course and the writing samples would remain anonymous. Fifteen minutes were allotted to the students for writing the story. Students wrote the story based on the facts and then used Microsoft Word’s word count to record the number of words beneath their stories. They saved the paragraph and were then given a 20-min presentation explaining the first five steps of the PM. Students first underlined all prepositional phrases in their stories. Due to time limitation, students were allowed to look up lists of prepositions to refresh their memories. In the second step, students highlighted all forms of “to be” verbs. During the presentation, the instructor provided students with a list of the “to be” verbs; am, are, is, was, were, be, become, and became (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1931243113484313">DeRosa, 2012</xref>). Students then identified the subject and object in the sentence, or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1931243113484313">Lanham (1987</xref>, p. 1) refers to it, “who’s kicking who” for Step 3. Step 4 recommends replacing any compound verbs with simple verbs when possible. Step 5 took the students back to the beginning of the sentences in the initial paragraph where they eliminated “wordy” start-ups to complete the exercise. The students then observed the notations in the initial paragraph and rewrote the story beneath the initial paragraph relying on the notes made with the PM. They counted the words in the second version and recorded them beneath it. The papers were then returned to the instructor for analysis.</p>
<p>A separate media writing class served as the control group. They were given the same set of facts distributed to the treatment group and asked to write a broadcast reader. We then administered a traditional broadcast writing lecture to the control group, emphasizing the need for short declarative sentences, simple, conversational language, the avoidance of complex sentence structures, and so on. After the traditional broadcast writing lecture, members of the control group were asked to rewrite their stories.</p>

<title>Method: Hypothesis 2</title>
<p>To analyze the quality of the writing, we used an established scale for evaluating writing quality originally developed by Anderson and adapted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1931243113484313">Sager (1972</xref>). To maintain “blindness” and prevent bias in the coding process, we trained two graduate assistants as coders without telling them anything about the dependent variables or the exact methodology of the study. For instance, coders did not know that their stacks of writing samples actually included two samples per participant. We shuffled the writing samples and numbered them in a way that would not reveal to the coders the identity of participants or whether a given sample was a pretest or posttest. In coder training, we merely told our assistants they were evaluating writing samples. We made it clear to the coders that our purpose was to maintain blindness and that our withholding of further information about the study was for purposes of maximizing the quality of the research—not to deceive them.</p>
<p>The Sager scale consists of 5 items, which we modified only slightly so the wording referred specifically to news rather than other forms of writing for which the scale had been employed previously. Coders were asked to rate samples from 1 to 4, with 4 <italic>being good</italic> and 1 <italic>being bad</italic>, evaluating each writing sample on
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>continuity and logically clear arrangement of relevant information,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>no irrelevant details,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>organization of facts suitable to express story,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>main idea fully expressed,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>all minor details support the major idea.</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In coder training, we used three examples from the stacks that would be evaluated, first coding them ourselves as our assistants did the same, then comparing and discussing our evaluations with those of the coders. During these discussions, we explained to our assistants what we considered the relevant and irrelevant facts of the story and reviewed what we considered clear arrangement of facts for broadcast news. Our coders were master’s degree students in the field of communication, but not mass media students. We continued coder training until our coders expressed confidence that they understood which samples qualified as good or bad, according to our expertise in broadcast news writing. We specified a technique for our coders to use with their stacks of writing samples: We asked that each coder create a “good” stack and a “bad” stack, based on a first impression, but constantly reevaluate, moving samples to opposite stacks as appropriate. Only after establishing with confidence which samples were good or bad were they to begin entering their ratings into a spreadsheet we provided with the scale items and sample numbers. We encouraged them to make sure the samples they considered “good” generally received ratings primarily in the 3–4 range, and “bad” received ratings of 1–2 for the most part. In the event that a sample originally considered “good” received lower ratings, we asked that the coders reassess the sample by comparing it again with other samples in the good and/or bad stacks. All of these techniques were intended to maximize reliability.</p>
<p>The study relies on a purposive sample of communication students in a Southeastern university communication school. Purposive sampling is the selection of a sample on the basis of our knowledge of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1931243113484313">Babbie, 1989</xref>). In this case, purposive sampling is appropriate as the study tests the effectiveness of a writing method as a tool for communication students, and the sample consists entirely of communication students.</p>

<p>The mean word count for the pretest samples was 58.26 and the posttest (PM) word count was 52.22. A paired-samples <italic>t</italic>-test revealed this to be a statistically significant difference (<italic>p</italic> = .000). There was no such difference between pretest and posttest in the control group (pretest mean: 62.235; posttest mean: 61.411; <italic>p</italic> = .679). Thus, Hypothesis 1 is confirmed.

<title>Analysis of Hypothesis 2</title>
<p>After transferring data from Excel spreadsheets used by the coders into Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, we cleaned the data. We had 100 participants in the treatment group, each providing a pretest and a posttest writing sample, for a total of 200 treatment group writing samples (<italic>n</italic> = 200). Due to scheduling constraints, our control group was much smaller, with a total of 17 participants, each providing a pretest and a posttest sample for a total of 34 (<italic>n</italic> = 34). Therefore, our total number of participants was 117, and our total number of writing samples evaluated with 234.</p>
<p>We computed separate scale reliabilities for each coder, to verify the accuracy of coders’ data entry and to evaluate in part the reliability of each coder’s assessments of the writing samples. Cronbach’s α for Coder 1 was .810 (5 items) and for Coder 2 was .812 (5 items), both easily within a good range for analysis. We also used 30 overlapping writing samples for the purpose of calculating intercoder reliability, but this did not yield strong results (percentage agreement κ = .525). Because of the subjective nature of writing evaluation, as compared with the more objective nature of traditional content analysis (for which intercoder reliability is typically computed), we would argue a lower threshold of acceptable intercoder reliability is worthy of consideration—especially given the exploratory nature of this study and the fact that it is the first step in a process of testing teaching techniques specific to broadcast news writing.</p>
<p>We began our statistical analysis with a simple comparison of the pretest and posttest samples from the treatment group. With all treatment group participants included, a paired-samples <italic>t</italic>-test revealed no significant difference (<italic>n</italic> = 100; pretest mean 2.25; posttest mean 2.27; <italic>p</italic> = .733). This was not surprising, however, given that some participants’ pretest scores were above 3 (on a scale of 4), meaning they had little if any room for improvement. Eliminating those with pretest scores over 3 yielded a difference which, although small, was significant at the .05 level (<italic>n</italic> = 85; pretest mean 2.11; posttest mean 2.2294; <italic>p</italic> = .039).</p>

<p>In light of the above data analysis, it would be accurate to report that Hypothesis 2 was marginally confirmed. There were statistically significant improvements, but not overwhelming differences, and certain flaws in the data and testing procedures call for further study.</p>

<sec id="section15-1931243113484313">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In short, these results show very small differences, and the control group size was not large enough to provide a clear refutation of possible testing bias. These results show only a weak improvement during the short (roughly 30 min) period in which we conducted our educational experiment. But this is, of course, an unrealistic time frame in which to convert novice media writers into experts. However, one can glean a much more significant piece of information from this study’s results. Hypothesis 1, that the PM would reduce the word count of student news writing, was easily confirmed. Hypothesis 2, that it would also improve the quality of the writing, yielded a weak result, but <italic>not</italic> a negative result. We do not claim that our study definitely proves the PM group’s writing was better, but it does prove conclusively that the treatment group’s writing was not worse—at least according to the parameters of the scale we used. The PM reduced word count without reducing quality, which translates into a net gain in efficiency, particularly in the multimedia and journalism classroom.</p>
<sec id="section16-1931243113484313">
<title>Limitations and Further Research</title>
<p>Students were introduced to this method in a very short period of time, 20 min. These students had not been previously exposed to the method nor had they been afforded any type of review in terms of parts of a sentence. The results do not meet the level of Lanham’s expectation of an average reduction of 26% in word count because of these factors. Lanham, however, points out that implementing the PM on a regular basis increases the results until it becomes natural to analyze one’s writing using the method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1931243113484313">Lanham, 1987</xref>). Writing as a skill is honed with years of practice. As students come into the journalism classroom, they may already have a significant amount of writing skill, or they may not. Knowledge of the PM is not a stand-alone cure-all. It does not help students correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation issues nor does it help journalism students decide what is pertinent to a journalism piece and what is not. However, it does offer a concrete method for analyzing writing in order to make it more concise. Clearly, more research is needed about effective teaching methods in the multimedia classroom. This study adds to a body of research that has a great deal of potential for both multimedia students and multimedia journalists in practice.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section17-1931243113484313">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study explored using the PM to teach multimedia writing students to write more concisely. The results positively confirm both research questions and Hypothesis 1. In confirmation of Hypothesis 1, the writing samples using PM showed an approximate 11% reduction in words after only one use. In Hypothesis 2, we posited that the PM samples would also show improved writing quality over the original samples. In students whose overall scores were below 3, there was significant improvement in the PM samples over the original samples. In students who scored above 3, the significance was marginal. The aforementioned is to be expected as students who already write well have less room for improvement. Both Hypotheses 1 and 2 confirm that the PM has solid potential as a tool in the multimedia writing classroom, both to reduce the number of words and to maintain the overall quality of writing. The reduction in word count, although not a perceived goal in general college composition <italic>is </italic>a perceived goal in the multimedia classroom. Journalists constantly work toward judiciousness in word usage as a means of fitting more facts and details into a story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1931243113484313">Shoemaker &amp; Reese, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>While the PM is not a recipe for instant remedial help, it may help students’ writing in several ways. First, PM usage increases awareness of what one has written. Simply being aware of what one has written by reviewing it word for word can improve writing. Second, students learn to identify the parts of a sentence when implementing the method. One cannot use PM without first learning how to identify subjects, simple verbs, compound verbs, and prepositions. Third, PM provides instant results. Most importantly, multimedia students can use PM to more closely conform their writing to broadcast and online styles. Anecdotal comments from students confirm that the method can help students with their writing. On several occasions, we received positive feedback from students about how much they learned using the method and how their awareness of their own writing increased.</p>
<p>The implementation of writing improvement methods is not, however, limited to the classroom. The well-known Poynter Institute offers a constant flow of classes geared toward the professional journalist now faced with the onslaught of new technology. The PM is an easily applied method that can quickly be learned by multimedia journalists who are already on the job and hoping to improve conciseness in their writing. While the PM is not a new method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1931243113484313">Lanham, 1979</xref>), it becomes new when applied to the journalism field, and in particular the multimedia classroom.</p>
