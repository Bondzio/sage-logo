<abstract>
<p>Colorectal cancer, the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, could largely be prevented if more people had polyps removed via colonoscopies. Embarrassment is one important barrier to colonoscopy, but little is known about embarrassment in this context, and there were no reliable and valid measures of this construct. The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable and valid instrument to measure colonoscopy-related embarrassment. Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change and Health Belief Model provided the theoretical basis for this study. Participants were health maintenance organization members aged 50 to 65 years (<italic>N</italic> = 234). Using a cross-sectional, descriptive research design, data were collected using a mailed survey. Internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .96) and construct validity of the 13-item instrument were demonstrated. This unidimensional scale shows promise as a valid and reliable instrument to measure colonoscopy-related embarrassment and to inform development of interventions to reduce embarrassment, leading to higher colonoscopy completion rates and lower mortality.</p>

<body>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of death related to cancer in the United States and is projected to kill 51,370 people in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945911410328">American Cancer Society [ACS], 2010</xref>). In addition, an estimated 102,900 cases of colon cancer and 39,700 cases of rectal cancer will be diagnosed in 2010. Colon cancer mortality can be reduced by removal of adenomatous polyps, the precursors to cancerous lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945911410328">Stewart, Wike, Kato, Lewis, &amp; Michaud, 2006</xref>). Removal of adenomatous polyps and early detection of CRC contribute to the 90% 5-year survival rate observed when the lesion is localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945911410328">Ries et al., 2008</xref>). Compared with other CRC screening methods, colonoscopy has the highest sensitivity, and the recommended 10-year frequency is the longest interval between screenings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945911410328">ACS, 2010</xref>). In addition, the rectum and entire colon are examined and suspicious tissue can be removed in one procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911410328">ACS, 2008</xref>). Colonoscopy is the most commonly recommended screening test and the only appropriate test for individuals at increased risk for CRC, for those who have positive stool blood tests, and for people having symptoms associated with CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945911410328">Levin et. al., 2008</xref>). However, only 57% of people aged 50 years or older report ever having had a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945911410328">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006</xref>), even though current screening guidelines recommend that average risk individuals begin CRC screening at age 50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945911410328">Levin et al., 2008</xref>) because 91% of new CRC diagnoses and 94% of deaths from CRC occur in individuals older than 50 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911410328">ACS, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Embarrassment is an Important Barrier to Colonoscopy</title>
<p>Studies have shown that higher perceived barriers are associated with lower completion rates of endoscopic CRC screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945911410328">Brenes &amp; Paskett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911410328">Janz, Wren, Schottenfield, &amp; Guire, 2003</xref>). One important barrier, embarrassment, was negatively associated with participation in such screening, with up to 74% of participants identifying colonoscopy-related embarrassment as a major reason for not doing this test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945911410328">Codori, Peterson, Miglioretti, &amp; Boyd, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945911410328">Gipsh, Sullivan, &amp; Dietz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945911410328">Green &amp; Kelly, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945911410328">Harewood, Wiersema, &amp; Melton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911410328">Janz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945911410328">R.

<p>In one study, embarrassment was the only barrier that differentiated first-degree relatives of CRC cancer patients who had endoscopic CRC screening from those who had not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945911410328">Codori et al., 2001</xref>). Participants who had not had a screening sigmoidoscopy reported more embarrassment than those who had this endoscopic test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945911410328">R. B. Kelly &amp; Shank, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945911410328">Lewis &amp; Jensen, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945911410328">Rawl et al. (2004)</xref> found differences in several barriers, including embarrassment, among 257 first-degree relatives of CRC survivors who were at different stages of adoption for colonoscopy. Specifically, greater proportions of precontemplators and contemplators agreed that colonoscopy was embarrassing compared with those in the action stage (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .006).</p>
<p>Embarrassment, cited by 35% of people aged 50 to 79 years, was the second most common reason people gave for not having a colonoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911410328">Janz et al., 2003</xref>). Likewise, embarrassment was second only to discomfort as a barrier to screening colonoscopy among adults aged 47-83 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945911410328">Gipsh et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945911410328">Harewood et al. (2002)</xref> studied 258 gastroenterology patients being seen for reasons other than lower gastrointestinal concerns and found that almost one third cited embarrassment as their main reason for not having a colonoscopy.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911410328">Modigliani (1968)</xref> was the first to examine, in depth, the concept of embarrassment, which he called embarrassability or “general susceptibility to embarrassment” in potentially embarrassing situations (p. 316). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945911410328">Miller (1996)</xref> later described several different categories of embarrassment, including awkward interactions, failure of privacy regulation (private thoughts, actions, or anatomy made public), undue sensitivity (overreacting to ordinary situations that typically produce only mild awkwardness), loss of control over body (inability to restrain a bodily function), and departure from personal goals (behavior or appearance that is incongruous with one’s own standards or expectations).</p>
<p>Psychological studies also have shown that most individuals try to avoid embarrassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945911410328">Brown &amp; Garland, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945911410328">Foss &amp; Crenshaw, 1978</xref>). Although psychology research was helpful in understanding the concept and attributes of embarrassment in general, most research on embarrassment was conducted with undergraduate students. More research is needed to examine embarrassment in the context of health care, especially among older adults who are being encouraged to have invasive medical procedures such as colonoscopy.</p>
<p>Although no specific measures of colonoscopy-related embarrassment were identified, two instruments were found that measure embarrassability. One instrument, the Embarrassability Scale, measures embarrassability in the context of specific social situations such as a man inadvertently walking into the women’s bathroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911410328">Modigliani, 1968</xref>). The second instrument, the Susceptibility to Embarrassment Scale, measures embarrassability using personality trait–based statements such as “I feel unsure of myself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945911410328">K. M. Kelly &amp; Jones, 1997</xref>, p. 322). Limitations of these scales are (a) both were developed using undergraduate students as participants and (b) neither assessed embarrassability in the context of a medical procedure (K. M. Kelly &amp; Jones; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945911410328">Maltby &amp; Day, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945911410328">Miller, 1995</xref>). Therefore, this study was undertaken to develop and test an instrument that measured the construct of colonoscopy-related embarrassment using an age-appropriate sample for whom this test is commonly recommended.</p>
<p>A valid and reliable instrument to assess colonoscopy-related embarrassment would enable identification of persons who are likely to experience embarrassment, specific sources of embarrassment, and factors that contribute to embarrassment. This knowledge would support development of interventions to alleviate or reduce embarrassment thus improving CRC screening rates. Increasing colonoscopy screening has great potential to effectively reduce CRC morbidity and mortality rates.</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>In this article, we will describe the process of instrument development and report the results of a study conducted to test the psychometric properties of the Colonoscopy Embarrassment Scale (CES). In the study, four hypotheses were tested</p>
<list id="list1-0193945911410328" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic> (<italic>H1</italic>): The CES will demonstrate adequate internal consistency with a Cronbach’s alpha of at least .70.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic> (<italic>H2</italic>): The CES will show evidence of construct validity as a unidimensional scale through principal component analysis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic> (<italic>H3</italic>): Participants who had a colonoscopy within the past 10 years will have lower CES scores than those who never had a colonoscopy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic> (<italic>H4</italic>): Participants who are in more advanced stages of adoption for colonoscopy will have lower CES scores than those in less advanced stages.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This study was guided by two conceptual models. The Health Belief Model (HBM) is commonly used to guide research about factors that influence people to prevent, screen for, or control an illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945911410328">Rosenstock, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193945911410328">Rosenstock, Stretcher, &amp; Becker, 1988</xref>). The model postulates that, even with a cue to action such as a physician recommendation for a cancer screening test, an individual must perceive personal risk for a disease that is serious for behavior change to occur. In addition, the individual must possess confidence in his or her ability to take action, and the benefits of action must outweigh the barriers. Perceived barriers have been shown to be the HBM construct that is most predictive of participation in various preventive health behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945911410328">Pender, Murdaugh, &amp; Parsons, 2006</xref>). This study investigated the psychometric properties of a new instrument to measure one specific barrier, colonoscopy-related embarrassment.</p>
<p>The Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change posits four stages of change and a maintenance phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945911410328">Prochaska &amp; Velicer, 1997</xref>). In the context of colonoscopy, an individual in the first stage (precontemplation) has no intent to have a colonoscopy but over time may progress to more advanced stages, such as thinking about getting one in the next 6 months (contemplation), having taken some steps to complete a colonoscopy such as scheduling an appointment (preparation), and finally, completing the test (action).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-0193945911410328">
<title>Development and Pretesting of Items</title>
<p>Individual items for the CES were initially developed from an extensive review of the literature followed by interviews with five people who had never had a colonoscopy. Content validity was examined by three content experts, and items were tested through cognitive interviewing techniques. Two national experts on CRC screening and one expert on the concept of embarrassment evaluated each item for wording, clarity, and representativeness. Representativeness, the degree to which the item was believed to represent colonoscopy-related embarrassment, was rated using a 4-point scale: (a) not representative, (b) needing major revisions to be representative, (c) needing minor revisions to be representative, and (d) representative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945911410328">Grant &amp; Davis, 1997</xref>). Items that were unanimously rated as not representative were deleted, and some items were modified. For example, “I would be embarrassed to have a colonoscopy if I knew the doctor or nurse doing the test” was changed because experts thought it important to clarify that a nurse would not be doing the test. In addition, one item, “I would be embarrassed to have a colonoscopy because I might smell,” was added based on expert recommendation.</p>
<p>Final decisions about item retention, deletion, modification, or addition were made by two researchers who independently reviewed the content experts’ ratings. Next, the researchers compared decisions, which agreed 90% of the time. For any equivocal item, discussion ensued until consensus was reached. As a result of the content expert evaluations, the number of items was reduced from 36 to 26.</p>
<p>In addition, the content validity index (CVI), a mathematical calculation of content validity, was determined based on the ratings of the items by the content experts. The CVI is computed based on the proportion of items that were rated either 3 or 4 by the experts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945911410328">Davis (1992)</xref> established that a CVI of at least .80 was evidence of adequate content validity. The CVI for the 26 items in this instrument was .93.</p>
<p>A pilot study, using cognitive interviewing techniques, was conducted with 10 men and women aged 50 to 54 years, to further examine validity of the instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945911410328">Carbone, Campbell, &amp; Morreale, 2002</xref>). Cognitive interviewing techniques included thinking aloud, concurrent and retrospective probing questions, and paraphrasing. The questions were read to participants and, with their permission, interviews were audiotape recorded. Audiotapes were transcribed, and transcriptions were read once for an overview and a second time to focus on details. Statements were highlighted and notes were made in the margins. The transcripts were read a third time to ensure that all pertinent comments had been analyzed. Two researchers independently read the transcripts and compared findings. Overall, participants expressed clear understanding of the items. However, four participants confused “same sex” and “opposite sex” on the item concerning the gender of the physician. Therefore, separate male and female versions of this item were developed to ensure clarity.</p>
<p>In response to the item, “I would be embarrassed to have a colonoscopy if my bowel was not clean,” one participant asked if she should assume that the item meant not clean “following the bowel prep.” Therefore, the item was changed to read “I would be embarrassed to have a colonoscopy if my bowel was not clean after the bowel prep.” One item that perplexed two participants was, “I would be embarrassed to have a colonoscopy if the doctor or nurse joked with me about the test.” On further explanation, participants expressed item comprehension but were unable to offer suggestions to improve clarity. However, all participants thought this item should be retained.</p>
<p>When items were similar, one of the items was deleted. For example “I did not know the doctor doing the test” and “I knew the doctor doing the test” were both aimed at determining whether familiarity with the physician was related to embarrassment. Both items were understood by participants, but “I would be embarrassed to have a colonoscopy if I did not know the doctor doing the test” was retained because participants relayed that not knowing the physician would elicit more embarrassment.</p>
<p>The final version of the CES was a 15-item instrument designed to measure colonoscopy-related embarrassment. The instrument uses a 4-point response scale: (1) <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, (2) <italic>disagree</italic>, (3) <italic>agree</italic>, and (4) <italic>strongly agree</italic>. The responses are summed, and higher scores on the scale indicate higher levels of embarrassment.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0193945911410328">
<title>Psychometric Testing</title>
<p>Further evaluation of the newly developed CES instrument, using an adequate sample size, was needed to test hypotheses related to internal consistency reliability and construct validity. To test these hypotheses, a cross-sectional, descriptive research design was implemented after Institutional Review Board approvals were obtained.</p>
<sec id="section6-0193945911410328">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Participants, aged 50 to 64 years, were recruited from members of one Midwestern health maintenance organization (HMO) that did not require “out-of-pocket” payment for a screening colonoscopy. Power analysis indicated that 194 participants were needed to detect a .20 correlation between colonoscopy-related embarrassment scores and completion of colonoscopy. Therefore, 580 potentially eligible participants were purposefully selected by an HMO staff member to ensure that half had completed a screening colonoscopy within the past 10 years and half had never had a colonoscopy. In addition, participants were matched by age and gender. Exclusion criteria included (a) a personal history of CRC, inflammatory bowel disease, or total colectomy; (b) having had a colonoscopy for a reason other than screening; (c) ever having had a sigmoidoscopy or barium enema; or (d) having completed a fecal occult blood test using a take-home kit within the last 12 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0193945911410328">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were collected using a mailed, self-administered survey. The HMO staff assigned a unique study identification code to each mailed survey, which kept the identities of the participants unknown to the researchers. The self-administered survey, a certificate of appreciation for participating, and a 2-dollar incentive were mailed to 580 potential participants—290 who had a colonoscopy in the past 10 years and 290 who had not. A reminder/thank you postcard was mailed 1 week after the survey, and a replacement survey was mailed 2 weeks later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945911410328">Dillman, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the 580 surveys originally mailed, there were 185 nonresponders; 3 actively refused participation, and 182 simply did not return the survey. Of the 396 (68%) respondents who returned completed surveys, 159 (27%) did not meet inclusion criteria. Of the 237 respondents who were eligible, 3 surveys were incomplete, resulting in 234 usable surveys. The final response rate was 55.6% (234/421).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0193945911410328">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>In addition to the 15-item CES, the survey collected demographic information, including participant age, marital status, educational level, income, and gender. Data were gathered using an open response for the date of birth and categorical response items for marital status, level of education, and income. A dichotomous response option was used for gender. Stages of colonoscopy adoption were measured by asking participants whether they had had a colonoscopy within the past 10 years, planned to have a colonoscopy in the next 6 months, and had an appointment scheduled for a colonoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945911410328">Rawl et al., 2006</xref>). Precontemplators had not had a colonoscopy in the past 10 years and were not planning to have one in the next 6 months. Contemplators were planning to have a colonoscopy in the next 6 months, and planners had an appointment scheduled for a colonoscopy in the next 6 months. Actors completed a colonoscopy within the last 10 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0193945911410328">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Data were entered into SPSS 13.0 and cleaned by conducting frequencies to identify outliers or inappropriate entries. Data were evaluated for normal distributions and no outliers were identified. Neither the CES nor any individual items on the CES had more that 5% missing data. Data were analyzed using independent samples <italic>t</italic> tests, ANOVA, chi-square, principal component analyses, and Cronbach’s alpha. All analyses were conducted using <italic>p</italic> = .05 as the significance level.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Participants (<italic>N</italic> = 234) who had a colonoscopy and those who had never had a colonoscopy were evenly distributed by gender (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945911410328">Table 1</xref>). Ages ranged from 50 to 65 years (<italic>M</italic> = 56.6, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.2), and 95.3% of participants were non-Hispanic Whites. Participants were well educated, with 73.7% having at least some college education, and 71.9% had annual household incomes of at least US$50,000. Three quarters of the participants were married or living with a partner. Chi-square analyses showed there was no difference in the demographic characteristics of the group that had a colonoscopy and the group that did not (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945911410328">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>To make a final determination about the relevance of these two items, analyses were conducted to determine whether they were significantly related to completion of a colonoscopy in the past 10 years. All responses to items were dichotomized into disagree (strongly disagree or disagree) and agree (strongly agree or agree). Chi-square analyses showed that these two items, “if the doctor joked with me” (<italic>p</italic> = .49) and “if I had to be awake during the test” (<italic>p</italic> = .07), were not significantly related to completion of a colonoscopy. These results provided additional support for the decision to delete these two items, resulting in the final 13-item CES (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0193945911410328">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Content validity of the CES-13 was supported through item evaluation by a panel of content experts, an adequate CVI, and results of the cognitive interviews conducted in the pilot study. The CES-13 demonstrated high internal consistency reliability, with a Cronbach’s alpha suggestive of item redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945911410328">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994</xref>). Redundancy is often relieved by deleting items from the scale to alleviate potential respondent burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911410328">DeVellis, 2003</xref>). However, the results of this analysis did not warrant the removal of additional items at this time. Further testing of the CES-13 with more diverse samples is needed for additional evaluation of individual items in the scale.</p>
<p>After item reduction, principal component analysis demonstrated that the CES was unidimensional. Deleting two items that that did not load onto the first component and were not significantly related to the completion of colonoscopy, resulted in a 13-item CES that loaded well onto one component and accounted for a substantial amount of variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911410328">DeVellis, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Construct validity was demonstrated in two ways. First, participants who had lower CES-13 scores were more likely to have had a colonoscopy in the last 10 years than participants with higher scores, suggesting that embarrassment was a barrier to completion of colonoscopy. Second, this study found that individuals in the earlier stages of colonoscopy adoption had higher colonoscopy-related embarrassment scores than individuals in action. These findings are consistent with other studies that examined stage of adoption for CRC screening and mammography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945911410328">Champion &amp; Skinner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945911410328">Rawl et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945911410328">Brenes and Paskett (2000)</xref> found that with a digital rectal exam, stage of adoption was not related to embarrassment.</p>
<p>Embarrassment has been consistently documented as a barrier to completion of colonoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945911410328">Codori et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945911410328">Gipsh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945911410328">Harewood et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911410328">Janz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945911410328">R. B. Kelly &amp; Shank, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945911410328">Lewis &amp; Jensen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945911410328">Nelson &amp; Schwartz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945911410328">Rawl et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945911410328">Stockwell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193945911410328">Wardle et al., 2003</xref>). Prior to development of the CES-13, investigators were unable to comprehensively evaluate the sources of embarrassment in this context. The current study provides initial evidence of internal consistency reliability, construct validity, and unidimensionality of the CES-13. Having a valid and reliable measure of colonoscopy-related embarrassment is important for identifying patients who are more likely to be embarrassed by the procedure because embarrassment can lead to test delay or not completing this life-saving test.</p>
<p>Investigators typically use a single item to assess perceptions of colonoscopy-related embarrassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945911410328">Codori et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945911410328">Green &amp; Kelly, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945911410328">Harewood et al., 2002</xref>). The CES-13 is more informative than a single item that does not provide any information about the sources of embarrassment. For example, a single item would not inform the clinician that an endoscopist of the opposite gender was the source of colonoscopy-related embarrassment.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the specific factors that contribute to colonoscopy-related embarrassment also has implications for clinical practice. For example, providers should be aware that gender of the endoscopist is a barrier to colonoscopy for some patients. Therefore, endoscopists of both genders should be available and patients’ preferences should be solicited when making appointments. Because modesty is a concern for many, endoscopy teams must take great care to maintain patients’ privacy and reassure the patients that privacy will be maintained. For patients who express discomfort talking about problems with their buttocks or bowel movements, discussions should be held in private locations and patients should be reassured that the discussions are confidential. As some patients may be embarrassed to have observers (students) in the room, all patients should be asked permission for observers to be present and reassured that declining to give permission is perfectly acceptable. Patients embarrassed by gas expulsion during the test should be assured that it is a normal part of the procedure for every patient. Hospitals and centers where colonoscopies are performed should consider designing recovery areas to maximize privacy. Education and counseling interventions that are tailored to each patient’s needs have potential to alleviate embarrassment and increase the likelihood of test completion.</p>
<p>The CES-13 is relatively short and easy to administer, enabling its use in today’s busy health care settings. The items on the CES-13 will be important in future research and clinical practice to assist in identifying interventions to reduce or eliminate embarrassment and improve colonoscopy completion rates.</p>
<p>There are several limitations of this study that should be noted. First, generalizability may be limited because the sample consisted of well-educated White individuals who were members of an HMO and had insurance coverage. Another limitation of the study is that, for the participants who had not had a colonoscopy, items on the CES were hypothetical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945911410328">Dillman, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Although oversampling was used to recruit equal numbers of participants who had had a colonoscopy in the last 10 years and those who had not, fewer surveys were returned from individuals who had never had a colonoscopy. The lower response rate from individuals who had never had a colonoscopy may have resulted in some nonresponse bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945911410328">Polit &amp; Beck, 2004</xref>). Therefore, this study may underestimate the prevalence of colonoscopy-related embarrassment in the population.</p>
<p>In addition, a new instrument was used in this study. Although the instrument performed well with this sample, it is not known how well it would perform with other populations.</p>
<p>The CES-13 was found to be a valid and reliable instrument to measure colonoscopy-related embarrassment. Further studies using more ethnically and socioeconomically diverse samples are needed. Health literacy may be an important variable to examine in future studies because it may contribute to lack of knowledge about colonoscopy and embarrassment. In addition, studies to examine redundancy and possible reduction of items to make the CES-13 even more useful in clinical settings should be conducted.</p>
<p>A colonoscopy is not the only test option for CRC screening, and not all individuals will be willing to undergo this screening test. In addition, it has recently been suggested that CRC screening methods should be tailored according to individual risk factors such as race and gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945911410328">Penn, Garrow, &amp; Romagnulo, 2010</xref>). However, for individuals for whom screening colonoscopy is recommended for either screening, diagnostic, or surveillance purposes, the CES-13 can be used to identify individuals with colonoscopy-related embarrassment, a barrier linked to not having a colonoscopy. In addition, the CES-13 can be used to identify specific factors that contribute to colonoscopy-related embarrassment. Interventions are needed to alleviate or reduce colonoscopy-related embarrassment to increase completion of this life-saving test, and the CES-13 can be used to inform the development of such interventions.</p>
