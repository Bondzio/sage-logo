<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>A 35-year-old man had his left thumb crushed between two wheelbarrows at work. Physical examination showed a dorsal skin abrasion and a painful deformity at the proximal phalanx level. Radiography showed a short oblique fracture of the proximal shaft of the proximal phalanx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412446405">Figure 1</xref>). Closed reduction and fixation using two crossed Kirschner wires failed owing to a persistent gap at the fracture site on fluoroscopy. In addition, the dorsal skin of the thumb showed an unusual depression while performing axial traction for fracture reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412446405">Figure 2</xref>). This indicated the loss of the cantilever effect of the extensor pollicis longus (EPL) tendon and raised the suspicion of an associated tendon rupture. Therefore, we decided to proceed to surgical exploration. The EPL tendon was found to be ruptured near its insertion, and its proximal end was found to be entrapped at the fracture site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412446405">Figure 3</xref>, left). After releasing the proximal stump of the EPL tendon, the fracture was reduced and fixed using two crossed Kirschner wires. The tendon was repaired without difficulty with the interphalangeal joint fixed in extension using temporary Kirschner wires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412446405">Figure 3</xref>, right).</p>

<p>This case shows that the loss of the cantilever effect of the tendon on the skin should arise suspicion of a tendon rupture. Occult tendon injuries have been reported after finger fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412446405">Dubert, 1995</xref>), and may be difficult to diagnose as the deformity may be interpreted as being caused by the fracture itself. In our case, however, the EPL tendon was ruptured at a level distal to the fracture site, which might indicate that the tendon had not been injured by the sharp edges of fracture fragments, but by traction or other mechanism.</p>
<p>An EPL tendon rupture can occur in acute trauma or in delayed fashion. When the loss of thumb extension occurs after an acute insult, the clinical diagnosis of the EPL tendon injury is relatively straightforward. However, the diagnosis will be difficult when it is complicated by fractures, as in our case. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in such a scenario because it can show the tendinous gap in closed mallet thumb injuries and identify cases that will not response to conservative treatment and thus warrant surgical intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412446405">Tabbal et al., 2009</xref>). Despite ultrasound having the benefits of low cost and a dynamic survey, it may be too painful for acute injured patients and is more suitable for a delayed tendon rupture to localize the rupture and measure the tendinous gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412446405">Santiago et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
