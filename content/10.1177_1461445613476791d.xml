<p>For over a decade now, work has been accumulating within Conversation Analysis for Second Language Acquisition (CA-for-SLA), or simply CA-SLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445613476791">Kasper and Wagner, 2011</xref>). This volume is a useful, if uneven, addition to this body of work. In addition to the informative introductory chapter by Hall and Pekarek Doehler, the book is organized into two parts, Part 1 on the nature of interactional competence in a second language (L2) and Part 2 on its development.</p>
<p>Of particular interest in Part 1 are chapters by Piirainen-Marsh, Sahlström and Theodórsdóttir. Piirainen-Marsh demonstrates how two Finnish adolescents playing a video role-playing game make use of locally available resources, including resources provided by the game, to accomplish such things as the completion of a game character’s talk in L2 English. The chapter by Sahlström shows how L2 learning can be investigated as a participants’ concern and as something that they do through their talk. The data in this chapter involve two seven-year-olds attending a Swedish-medium pre-primary school in Finland, one of whom is competent to some degree in English, Finnish, Swahili and Swedish. The analysis demonstrates how they do, over a five-day period, teaching and learning of counting to 10 in English. In doing learning, the participants orient to such things as the longitudinal nature of the learning task and knowledge asymmetries. When learning an L2 in a community in which the language is used, the learner can be expected simultaneously to use the L2 to conduct the business of living in the community and to learn it through this use. The chapter by Theodórsdóttir shows how this is accomplished by an L2 learner of Icelandic as she purchases bread at a bakery. The analysis demonstrates how the learner and the baker balance sometimes competing orientations to language learning and accomplishing the business transaction.</p>
<p>Part 2 contains three chapters which investigate development of interactional competence through the use of longitudinal data and one which uses cross-sectional data. Of particular interest are chapters by Nguyen, and Pekarek Doehler and Pochon-Berger. Nguyen’s chapter, which investigates the development of interactional competence of a pharmacist intern as he interacts with customers, may at first seem out-of-place in a volume about L2 interactional competence, as the intern is a first language speaker of English, the language he uses with the customers. It is not out-of-place, though, as he is learning to use English in, for him, a new kind of role and legally mandated activity, that of a pharmacist explaining and giving advice about a prescribed medication. The analysis of the longitudinal dataset illustrates how ability to recipiently-design advice in this activity develops over time. When I began reading the chapter by Pekarek Doehler and Pochon-Berger, which uses cross-sectional data, I found myself feeling skeptical of trying to use such data to investigate the development of interactional competence. This comes from a more general skepticism about cross-sectional methodology in SLA. However, in reading the chapter, I found my skepticism receding, as it is a well-designed study which illustrates how resources for doing disagreement in L2 French by secondary students (L1 Swiss German) expand over time. More specifically, resources for doing disagreement used by lower-intermediate learners are not abandoned by more advanced learners, while new resources, in particular the use of token agreements, are added.</p>
<p>As often happens with edited volumes, the quality of the different chapters varies. This may simply reflect my own bias, but those chapters that I found the most problematic were the ones that were influenced by some version of sociocultural theory. Hellermann, who probably more than anyone else has contributed to the small but growing body of longitudinal CA-SLA, has also tended to frame this work within situated learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445613476791">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>). This has involved the conceptualization of learning as movement from more peripheral to fuller participation in interaction, a conceptualization that I have criticized elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445613476791">Hauser, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, in Hellermann’s chapter, for the first time that I have seen in his longitudinal work, he does not treat learning this way. This makes me wonder whether he has reconsidered the usefulness of situated learning theory. Unfortunately, his chapter on the development of resources for other initiation of repair is weakened by imprecise use of terminology (e.g. ‘repair initiations on peer action projection’, p. 162, when what is being referred to seems to be action rather than the action projection) and a tendency to conflate disagreement and initiation of repair. Van Compernolle also looks at repair initiation, or rather what is claimed to be a lack of repair initiation, with data drawn from oral tests for university L2 French students. He argues that when they do not understand a question, rather than initiate repair, the students try to answer the question anyway, resulting in an answer incongruent with the question. On this basis, he presents a case for concept-based instruction, derived from Vygotskian sociocultural theory, related to such things as how to initiate repair. However, a close look at the transcripts reveals that the students do initiate repair, something which even the author recognizes at one point.</p>
<p>Though the quality of chapters is uneven, this volume contains several that are valuable. Researchers and others interested in L2 interactional competence and how it develops in and through interaction are likely to find it useful.</p>
