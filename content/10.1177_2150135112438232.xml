(b) Borderline biventricular physiology (n = 4), in which the patients had TGA, ventricular septal defect (VSD), and hypoplastic right ventricle (RV). (c) Biventricular physiology (n = 3), in which the patients had TGA and multiple VSDs. <bold>Results:</bold> In all, 12 (80%) patients survived.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Arterial switch operation (ASO) is the definitive procedure of choice in biventricular hearts with transposition of the great arteries (TGA). It has also been described as a palliative procedure for single ventricle, TGA, and subaortic stenosis (SAS). It has not, so far, been described in the setting of biventricular or potentially biventricular hearts with TGA. Our group has used this approach to defer the intracardiac part of the repair in situations involving complex intracardiac manipulation (multiple ventricular septal defects [VSD] and concomitant complex endocardial cushion defects) in hearts with balanced ventricles and also to postpone (and also influence) the decision between the univentricular or biventricular repairs in TGA associated with borderline ventricular imbalance. Fifteen patients have undergone palliative ASO for the above indications at our institute from January 2007 till June 2011, and this article presents  our experience during this period.</p>

<title>Univentricular Hearts (Group I)</title>
<p>This group comprised eight patients. The diagnoses included double inlet left ventricle (DILV), TGA with restrictive bulboventricular foramen (BVF), and hypoplastic arch (n = 4); tricuspid atresia (TA), TGA, and restrictive BVF (n = 3); and L-malposed great arteries, left atrioventricular (AV) valve atresia, and restrictive BVF (n = 1). If there is flow acceleration across the BVF or if its size is smaller than the aortic orifice, it is referred to as restrictive. All patients underwent an ASO. The additional procedures that were performed included arch repair (n = 5), pulmonary artery (PA) banding (n = 7), and atrial septectomy (n = 2). The rest of the patients underwent a palliative arterial switch in the first stage, keeping the option of a delayed univentricular or biventricular repair (group II) and a biventricular repair (group III) in the second stage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2150135112438232">
<title>Borderline Biventricular Hearts (Group II)</title>
<p>This group comprised four patients (30, 45, 90, and 548 days of age, respectively), and the patients in this group had TGA, VSD with hypoplastic right ventricle (RV), and tricuspid valve. All patients underwent ASO without ventricular septation. The inter-atrial communication was closed at least partially to maintain RV preload facilitating its growth. The inter-atrial communication was guarded by a purse-string suture and the ends of the purse-string suture were brought out of the right atrium (RA). On coming off cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the purse-string was tightened to close the atrial septal defect (ASD) by monitoring the pressure of RA and left atrial (LA) . Whenever the RA pressure was 4 mm Hg or more than the LA pressure, we released the purse-string around the ASD and left it partially open. In fact, the interatrial communication was completely closed only in one of the four patients in group II; while in the other three, it was closed partially. One patient also underwent a concomitant repair of leaking common AV valve. The pulmonary blood flow was regulated by means of PA band.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2150135112438232">
<title>Multiple VSD (Group III)</title>
<p>This group included three patients (26, 30, and 90 days of age, respectively) with TGA and multiple VSDs. The multiple VSDs were deemed inaccessible through the tricuspid valve or through either of the great arteries, on preoperative echocardiography, and therefore, no attempts were made to close them intraoperatively. Arterial switch was performed and the pulmonary blood flow was regulated by means of PA band.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-2150135112438232">
<title>Surgical Techniques</title>
<p>All the patients were operated by a single surgeon (R.S.). Standard techniques of hypothermic CPB with aortic and bicaval cannulation were used. Isolated innominate artery perfusion was utilized for aortic arch reconstruction. The myocardial protection was achieved by multidose antegrade cold blood cardioplegia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-2150135112438232">
<title>Arterial Switch Operation</title>
<p>Aorta was transected 10 mm above the coronary ostium. The coronary buttons were harvested and the proximal coronaries were mobilized. Pulmonary artery was transected just below the bifurcation. LeCompte maneuver was performed. The coronary buttons were implanted on the neoaortic root either in a button-hole or as a trap door. The neoaortic continuity was restored. The defects in the neopulmonary artery were patched with pantaloon-shaped autologous untreated pericardium.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2150135112438232">
<title>Aortic Arch Repair</title>
<p>Five patients in group I and one in group II had hypoplastic transverse arch with coarctation. The coarctation segment was excised and the proximal and distal normal segments were directly connected in the dorsal aspect. The transected distal end of the ascending aorta was then opened into the ventral aspect of the arch going across the partial circumferential anastomosis into the descending aorta. The posteriorly placed, enlarged main pulmonary artery (MPA; neoaorta) was directly implanted into widely opened arch and distal end of the transected aorta. This also took care of the size discrepancy between the large proximal PA stump and the small distal ascending aorta. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135112438232">Figures 1</xref>

<title>Pulmonary Band</title>
<p>The PA was banded with a 2-mm-wide strip of e-PTFE patch fixed proximally on the neopulmonary artery. Trusler formula was used as the guideline and the band was loosened or tightened as required. The aim was to achieve a mean PA pressure of near Fontan levels (approximately 15-20 mm Hg) for patients in groups I and II and 30% to 50% of the systemic arterial pressure in group III. Systemic arterial saturation of more than 85%, appearance of the RV, and no acute increase in the central venous pressure were taken as additional parameters of a satisfactory band.</p>

<title>Comments</title>
<p>In patients with single ventricle subtypes, where the systemic outlet is from an outlet chamber, and especially associated with coarctation of the aorta, it is well known that subaortic obstruction (real or potential) has high chances of progressing after restriction of flow to pulmonary circulation by means of PA banding. This is secondary to the increased flow through the systemic outlet and also to ventricular hypertrophy which induces BVF narrowing. It is universally agreed that SAS is an incremental risk factor for poor outcome after total caovopulmonary anastomosis.<sup>

</sup> Approaches to preempt future or progressive SAS have been classically the Norwood procedure or a Damus-Kaye-Stansel (DKS) procedure, whereby the pulmonary outlet works in additive fashion to the preexisting systemic outlet.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135112438232">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135112438232">4</xref>
</sup> The principle disadvantage with this approach is the method of constructing PA inflow. A systemic to pulmonary arterial shunt results in systemic steal and the deleterious effects of a low diastolic pressure on coronary perfusion. The other option (Sano shunt) involves an obligatory ventriculotomy, which may not be benign in a single ventricle situation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135112438232">5</xref>
</sup> The third option of enlarging the BVF with banding of the pulmonary outlet is fraught with increased probability of interruption of AV conduction and recurrence of SAS and systemic ventricular dysfunction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135112438232">6</xref>

</p>
<p>The palliative arterial switch has been described as a first stage palliation for univentricular hearts with two outlets and subaortic obstruction. Palliative arterial switch utilizes the naturally present semilunar valve in the outlet and thereby avoids the disadvantages associated with the Norwood repair and its modifications. Palliative switch for TGA, SAS, and single ventricle was first described by Trusler and Freedom<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135112438232">7</xref>
</sup> and popularized by others.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135112438232">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135112438232">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Five (62.5%) of our patients with SAS  had associated aortic arch hypoplasia or coarctation. This association has been previously documented.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135112438232">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135112438232">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135112438232">11</xref>
</sup> Transposition of the great arteries with associated aortic arch obstruction is a situation ideally anatomically suited for both problems to be managed by means of an arterial switch. This is because the posterior large PA is adjacent to the aortic arch in <sc>d</sc>-TGA. The transected PA fits into the incision on the ventral aortic arch, and in this way a single anastomosis addresses the arch issue, while at the same time addressing the issue of ascending aorta to PA size discrepancy (Figures 1–3). The incidence of recoarctation is a known problem with DKS and Norwood procedures.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135112438232">8</xref>
</sup> Lack of laminar flow and use of nonnative tissue have been implicated as causes of recurrence. Palliative arterial switch provides laminar flow and it should reduce the incidence of recoarctation. Use of autologous tissue in this method is another advantage over other options. Familiarity with the ASO for conventional indications gives us the ability to utilize both natural outlets to our advantage. Although none of our patients have reached the stage of total cavopulmonary anastomosis, there have been reports in the literature, which suggest that these have been suitable for Fontan candidates.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135112438232">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A matter of concern is the accelerated restriction of BVF and reduction in the pulmonary blood flow that may occur. In fact, two of our patients had to undergo superior cavopulmonary shunt within two months of palliative arterial switch in view of excessive cyanosis.</p>
<p>The palliative ASO has not been described for indications other than staging for future univentricular repair. We have been using the palliative arterial switch with adjunctive pulmonary artery banding (PAB) as a temporizing measure in TGA with multiple VSDs, where the VSDs are judged to be inaccessible through the tricuspid valve or through either of the great arteries. The treatment of choice for TGA and multiple VSD is ASO and closure of all VSDs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135112438232">13</xref>
</sup> Generally, it is possible to close all the VSDs through the atrium or the great arteries. Despite advances in preoperative diagnosis and management and improved surgical techniques and postoperative care, treatment of patients with multiple VSDs who require ASO may carry significant morbidity.<sup>

</sup> Closure of Swiss cheese or apically located VSDs may be associated with a greater incidence of residual VSDs. Often a ventriculotomy is required. In a small heart, temporizing by means of a PA band therefore may still have a role. This option simplifies the operative management and the palliative ASO converts the TGA physiology to one of normally related great arteries. There is no risk of injury to the conduction tissue, tricuspid valve injury, residual VSD, ventricular dysfunction, and so on. The total CPB and aortic cross-clamp time is greatly reduced and the postoperative course is relatively smooth. However, it is only a palliation and will require a second operation for VSD closure and PA debanding. This is likely to be less of a problem in a bigger child. Some of the VSDs may close spontaneously. Simple pulmonary banding has also been described to defer definitive repair in TGA and multiple VSDs. However, with this approach, the cyanosis is likely to be aggravated and consequently the PA banding inadequate. It may also produce dilatation and distortion of the PA resulting in pulmonary valve incompetence which will become the systemic valve following ASO.</p>
<p>Tricuspid valve hypoplasia and/or RV hypoplasia is a known association of TGA. <italic>Z</italic> score less than 3 for the tricuspid valve was taken as the criteria for right ventricular hypoplasia. In such a situation, it is unclear whether the final repair is going to be a biventricular or a univentricular one. A simple PAB in TGA has an inherent problem of aggravating desaturation and therefore often results in inadequate banding. The palliative ASO serves the purpose of correcting the mixing problem of TGA, thereby allowing an adequate PAB. For the borderline RV, closure of an ASD that causes the entire systemic venous return to the right heart is likely to potentiate the growth of right-side chambers. We sought to close the ASD/patent foramen ovale (PFO) at least partially under RA and LA pressure monitoring. If the RV is truly hypoplastic, it may not support the entire cardiac output. Therefore, we routinely leave a small interatrial communication guarded by a purse-string suture brought out of the RA. On coming off CPB, the purse-string is tightened to close the ASD, with LA and LA pressure monitoring. When the RA pressure was 4 mm Hg or more in excess of the LA pressure, this is used as an indication to leave a small interatrial communication.</p>

<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>The small number of patients in groups II and III with only one patient in each group proceeding to the next stage does not yet allow definite conclusions as to the superiority of the palliative ASO over conventional approaches. Long-term results with a larger number of patients reaching the end of the treatment pathway are awaited.</p>
