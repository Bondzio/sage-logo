<p>Clinical research professionals are faced with decreased funding and increased workloads; innovative methods of professional development programs are necessary to accommodate these factors. This study evaluated the feasibility, perceived satisfaction, and value of using webinars to educate clinical research professionals on reporting adverse events commonly experienced in pediatric oncology clinical trials. The setting incorporated synchronous web-based educational technology. Constructivist learning provides the theoretical framework for this study. Participants evaluated the professional development program at 2 time points: (a) at the conclusion and (b) 4 to 6 weeks afterward, using survey method. Synchronous webinars were both economical and effective in educating clinical research professionals across institutional sites. Participants reported exceptionally high levels of satisfaction with the accessibility, scope, quality, and interactivity of the professional development program. The vast majority of participants reported that the education would assist with reporting adverse events in pediatric oncology clinical trials and this perception persisted into clinical practice. Although the results of this study were intended to guide future educational efforts of the Children’s Oncology Group, they may also apply to other cooperative groups.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Clinical Trials Cooperative Group Program, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, supports cancer research for more than 14,000 investigators at more than 3,100 institutional sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043454212457465">National Cancer Institute, 2009</xref>). These researchers comprise various cooperative groups. They investigate new diagnostic and/or therapeutic modalities through clinical trials to improve detection, survival, and quality of life for patients with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043454212457465">National Cancer Institute, 2009</xref>). Cooperative groups are faced with a flat budget. Per case reimbursement is minimal, accounting for only one third the average cost of each patient enrolled in a clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043454212457465">Emanuel, Schnipper, Kamin, Levinson, &amp; Lichter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043454212457465">Schmidt, 2007</xref>). Decreased funds result in minimal staffing and increased workloads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043454212457465">Gwede, Johnson, Roberts, &amp; Cantor, 2005</xref>), which can affect retention of staff. In addition, clinical research professionals have diverse roles and educational backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043454212457465">Devine, Nagel, Benson, &amp; Krailo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043454212457465">Gwede et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043454212457465">Price, Barrett, &amp; Roark, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043454212457465">Rico-Villademoros et al., 2004</xref>), which further affects educational efforts within cooperative groups. This study evaluated the feasibility, perceived satisfaction, and value of using an interactive webinar to educate clinical research professionals on reporting adverse events commonly experienced in pediatric oncology clinical trials.</p>
<p>This study focused on the Children’s Oncology Group (COG), a cooperative group with clinical trials at more than 200 institutions worldwide. COG’s mission is to cure and prevent childhood and adolescent cancer through scientific discovery and compassionate care. Some of the tasks required at institutional sites, including the collection of data and reporting of adverse events, are often delegated to clinical research professionals. An adverse event is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043454212457465">Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 2011</xref>, p. 5). Accurate and timely reporting of data is essential to the scientific integrity of clinical trials and vital in assuring the safety of human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043454212457465">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2009</xref>). Adverse event reporting is the most consistently requested topic on continuing education evaluations at annual COG meetings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043454212457465">Borgerson, 2010</xref>). Innovative methods are needed to deliver this education collaboratively across sites.</p>
<p>Previous education sessions on adverse event reporting were challenging; they were provided annually at COG meetings, attendees had a wide variety of academic and professional experience, time was limited, and the large group format further challenged the effectiveness of the intervention. Clinical research professionals desire educational opportunities on a more frequent basis with individualized attention. Web-based education is a cost-effective and easily accessible method of providing such opportunities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1043454212457465">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Current literature indicates the need for increased interactivity in web-based education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454212457465">Little, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043454212457465">Yordanova, 2007</xref>), and webinars are likely to bridge this gap. Webinars have the ability to provide synchronous learning environments that are comparable to face-to face instruction without the inconvenience and cost of international travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043454212457465">Senecal &amp; Gazda, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043454212457465">Wang &amp; Hsu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043454212457465">Wyatt, 2007</xref>). Although webinars have been positively received in a number of online learning environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043454212457465">Little, Passmore, &amp; Schullo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043454212457465">McBrien &amp; Jones, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043454212457465">Wyatt, 2007</xref>), there is limited evidence of perceived satisfaction and value of receiving professional development through these methods.</p>
<p>This study used WebEx© by Cisco, a program that includes a polling feature to actively engage participants. The web-based polling feature is comparable to audience response systems used in classroom education. Such audience response systems support adult learning by anonymously identifying concepts that need further explanation, increasing comprehension and retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043454212457465">Berry, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043454212457465">Moredich &amp; Moore, 2007</xref>). The success of web-based education is dependent on several factors: accessibility, group discussions, interaction, and timely feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454212457465">Little, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043454212457465">Salazar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043454212457465">Yordanova, 2007</xref>). Synchronous webinars are a promising method to meet these criteria.</p>
<p>The education developed for this webinar incorporated the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Terms in the CTCAE represent specific adverse events, and each term also includes consistent grading criteria to label the severity of the event. This aids medical documentation and scientific analysis. National Cancer Institute Guidelines (2011) warn that the “CTCAE is NOT a tool to assist with data extraction from source documents without the direct participation and supervision of clinical investigators” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043454212457465">Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 2011</xref>, p. 10). The CTCAE was recently updated and cooperative groups sponsored by the National Cancer Institute require conversion from CTCAE v3.0 to CTCAE v4.0 by October 1, 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043454212457465">Finnigan, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1043454212457465">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Constructivist learning provides the theoretical framework for this study. Clinical research professionals are adult learners who have varying degrees of life experiences and educational backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043454212457465">Devine et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043454212457465">Jones, Harrison, Carter, &amp; Jester, 2008</xref>). Constructivism builds on previous learning to expand knowledge and increase understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043454212457465">Legg, Adelman, &amp; Levitt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043454212457465">Peter, 2000</xref>). Educational methods that incorporate a constructivist approach to learning will stimulate analysis of complex situations common in health care and improve critical thinking skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043454212457465">Billings &amp; Halstead, 2009</xref>). Constructivism is well embedded in the literature as the theoretical framework for interactive teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043454212457465">Bacon &amp; Bloom, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043454212457465">Chikotas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043454212457465">Gijbels, Segers, &amp; Struyf, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043454212457465">Hyde &amp; Fife, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043454212457465">Powell &amp; Kalina, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043454212457465">Ridley, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Participants were English-speaking adult clinical research professionals at member institutions of the COG. A professional development webinar was offered to all 848 clinical research professionals. Recruitment methods included advertisements in the COG <italic>Clinical Research Associate Bulletin</italic> and invitations sent through the COG e-mail distribution list. The setting incorporated synchronous web-based educational technology. The cost of the webinar was funded by COG, who subscribes to Cisco WebEx teleconference meetings. Services were provided over a proprietary network ensuring security, performance, and reliability.</p>
<p>Participants contacted the principal investigator and received an e-mail with instructions to join the prescheduled WebEx session from a computer with Internet access and audio via conference call function. Eight case scenarios were used during the webinar to assist with adverse event reporting. The education introduced the key differences between the CTCAE v3.0 and CTCAE v4.0, using a constructivist online learning environment. Webinars were moderated by the principle investigator. Participants practiced reporting adverse events commonly experienced in pediatric oncology clinical trials, using the polling feature. Participants were not graded on the polled questions pertaining to the case scenarios. Results were displayed in a collated fashion. Rationale was discussed and questions answered. The webinar was offered a minimum of twice monthly from December 2010 through March 2011; additional sessions were added based on demand. Each webinar was 1 hour in duration.</p>
<p>The feasibility of using synchronous webinars to provide education across institutional sites was measured based on cost, attendance, and accessibility. The perceived satisfaction and value of the education was measured using a 5-point Likert-type scale. Participants evaluated the webinar at 2 time points: (a) at the conclusion and (b) 4 to 6 weeks afterward. Evaluations were completed and saved through the polling feature in the WebEx program, which were linked to participants’ names. Data were de-identified and labeled with a unique identifier, which was used on the second study endpoint. Participants were contacted by e-mail 4 to 6 weeks later to measure the perceived impact on clinical practice using survey method. Data collection concluded at this time point to assess the need for further education prior to the CTCAE v4.0 conversion deadline. The evaluation and survey instruments were pretested by peer review prior to implementation to increase face and content validity. This study is descriptive in nature. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS Version 15.0 and qualitative data were examined using content analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1043454212457465">
<title>Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>Participation in the webinar, evaluation, and survey were voluntary. Lack of participation did not affect current or future relationships with COG. Participants were informed through advertisements, e-mail invitations, and webinars. This study was reviewed by 2 independent institutional review boards. There was minimal risk to those who participated. Possible risks included discomfort with answering questions during the education, evaluation, and/or survey. There was no cost associated with this study for participants; a toll-free phone number was provided by COG. Participants received 1.0 continuing education credit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1043454212457465">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>A total of 12 synchronous webinars were completed for this study. In all, 243 people agreed to participate, 70% attended the scheduled webinar. Attrition was because of illness, meetings, decreased staffing, and/or patient priorities. The study sample consisted of 163 clinical research professionals from 81 different institutional sites. Participants resided in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, or Brazil. Three participants were excluded from the analysis because of attending more than one webinar (<italic>n</italic> = 160).</p>
<p>Characteristics of the sample are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043454212457465">Table 1</xref>. Participants were largely female (94.6%). The educational background of participants varied; high school diploma (8.3%), associate degree (11.8%), bachelor (61.8%), master (15.3%) or doctorate (2.8%) prepared. The majority were certified in clinical research (56.3%). Among those, one quarter of the participants were licensed registered nurses. Experience with COG clinical trials ranged from less than 1 year to greater than 10 years of professional experience. However, more than half of participants (55.1%) reported less than 4 years of clinical research practice. The majority worked full-time (77.2%) with COG clinical trials and annual therapeutic enrollments ranged from less than 9 to greater than 40, representing diversity in the size of pediatric oncology programs.</p>

<p>Results of the survey data collected 4 to 6 weeks after webinar completion are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043454212457465">Table 3</xref>. Eighty-three surveys were returned resulting in a 51% response rate. The majority (91.6%) of respondents had recommended the webinar to colleagues. One third of the respondents did not report adverse events in the study timeframe and therefore could not assess impact into practice. Two thirds of the respondents reported adverse events since participating in the webinar (n = 55) and nearly all (94.6%) indicated that the webinar assisted them in reporting those adverse events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1043454212457465">Figure 2</xref>). Eighty-one percent used the CTCAE v3.0 and 75% used the CTCAE 4.0. Some respondents (42.6%) specified that the knowledge gained in the webinar decreased the amount of time it took them to report adverse events; others (n = 21, 37.5%) revealed challenges with the reporting. The challenges encountered were expressed through one open-ended survey question. Three themes emerged from the data: challenges with (a) locating adverse event terms, (b) protocol reporting requirements, and (c) specific adverse events. More than half of the responses followed one theme: difficulty locating adverse event terms. This is best portrayed by the following response: “The switch from v3 to v4 is challenging, especially finding new descriptions of adverse events and new categories. V4 booklet is very complex compared to v3.” Many respondents also provided additional insight into the transition to CTCAE v4.0, recognizing that over time they would become more familiar with the new version.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study included a convenience sample from one cooperative group and outcome variables were based on self-report data. Generalization may be limited because of the inability to confirm a representative sample. Providing continuing education credit could have introduced bias, perhaps accounting for the high number of certified clinical research professionals reported. Lastly, 4 to 6 weeks may not have been a long enough time frame to determine impact into clinical practice, such that the results from the second study endpoint could possibly be over and/or under reported.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<sec id="section9-1043454212457465">
<title>Accessibility</title>
<p>Webinars were a highly successful method of delivery for professional development across institutional sites. Technical problems, including connectivity and/or audiovisual difficulties, are reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043454212457465">Chen, Ko, Kinshuk, &amp; Lin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043454212457465">McBrien &amp; Jones, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043454212457465">Wang &amp; Hsu, 2008</xref>) but were minimal in the current study. Only a limited number of participants (3.2%) were unsatisfied with accessibility and identified institutional permissions and/or blocks as the primary problem. These findings are consistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043454212457465">Wyatt (2007)</xref>. Security settings of the end user can prohibit the installation of files that are needed to participate in a webinar. This factor could be eliminated with prearranged testing of the program download and/or website prior to the scheduled webinar.</p>
<p>Similar to on-site education, environmental influences can prohibit the ability to provide and/or attend synchronous webinars. One webinar was added to accommodate Australia and New Zealand time zones, one was rescheduled due to a blizzard, and attendance at another was affected by an earthquake. Although synchronous webinars were perceived as accessible by participants, on average, 30% of people who signed up did not attend. Asynchronous options would be beneficial in these instances and could be provided easily.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1043454212457465">
<title>Professional Development</title>
<p>Historically, adverse event reporting has been the most consistently requested topic on COG continuing education evaluations, despite annual education on the topic. Adverse event reporting remains a hot topic. Sixty-five people requested inclusion in the webinar within 2 hours of the e-mail invitation being distributed. Professional development programs specific to clinical research are limited to regional conferences, many of which require travel and a considerable fee. With decreased funding, increased workloads, and high staff turnover, additional efforts are required at the institutional level to ensure that clinical research professionals are adequately educated to perform delegated tasks. The cost associated with the webinar used in this study was $3.26 per participant, significantly less than onsite education. Webinars are both an economical and practical way to share knowledge across institutional sites.</p>
<p>Webinars averaged 16 participants per session, a manageable size to accommodate learner needs. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction regarding the interactivity of the professional development program. The polling feature, discussions surrounding the case studies, and immediate feedback, contributed to this success. With constructivism, the learner is actively engaged in the learning experience to build knowledge from previous experiences and bring forth meaning in the current situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043454212457465">Yilmaz, 2008</xref>). The learner is responsible for expansion of knowledge, which helps build confidence and strengthen communication skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043454212457465">Powell &amp; Kalina, 2009</xref>); webinars allowed for this. One respondent replied, “After the webinar I feel as if I am reporting thoroughly and correctly.”</p>
<p>Frequently asked questions were communicated back to the COG Statistics and Data Center. This facilitated the development of guidance, released group-wide. The challenges participants expressed through the second study endpoint will be incorporated into future professional development programs.</p>
<p>Dialogue surrounding the case studies varied between webinars. However, participants contributed less to the discussions than anticipated, despite the use of detailed probes and positive reinforcement. Interestingly, participants rated the time for discussion the lowest. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043454212457465">Wang and Hsu (2008)</xref>, minimal interaction was noted between participants during webinars when high cognitive loads were present. Fewer case studies will be included in future webinars to account for these factors. Future research should examine the perceived satisfaction and value of synchronous versus asynchronous webinars in professional development programs.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Synchronous webinars are a feasible method to educate across institutional sites. Participants reported exceptionally high levels of satisfaction with the accessibility, scope, quality, and interactivity of the webinar. The vast majority of participants reported that the education would assist them in reporting adverse events in pediatric oncology clinical trials and this perception persisted into clinical practice. Although the results of this study were intended to guide future educational efforts of the COG, they may also apply to other cooperative groups.</p>
