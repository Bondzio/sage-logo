<p>Beginning in the 1970s, the Red Brigades (<italic>Brigate Rosse</italic>, hereafter BR) engaged in a sustained campaign of terror in Italy, most notoriously in 1978, kidnapping and later assassinating a former Italian prime minister, Aldo Moro. How did the BR form? Who joined it, from whence did they spring, and what were their ideology and practice? How did they justify killing and how did they undertake it?</p>
<p>To address these questions, in <italic>Anatomy of the Red Brigades</italic>, Alessandro Orsini draws on a variety of documents concerning the BR: participants’ testimony at trials; documents in which they claimed responsibility for killings, kneecappings, and other acts of violence; group resolutions and leaflets; and private letters to family members. These sources shine an uneven light on various aspects of the BR. Necessarily, they reveal more about social origins, <italic>Weltanschuuang</italic>, formal organization, and aspects of daily life than about social processes of decision-making and action. Nevertheless, the analysis triangulates a variety of sources which, taken together, provide a striking composite portrait of an underground revolutionary group that undertook a sustained program of violence to try to achieve its goals.</p>
<p><italic>Anatomy of the Red Brigades</italic> traces the group’s origins to its sectarian split with the Italian Communist Party, which preached revolution but held back from revolutionary action, counseling the young to “wait” (p. 146). Orsini argues, convincingly in my view, that despite these secular communist origins, the BR engaged in a “sacrificial gesture” (p. 32): for the BR, Orsini writes, “politics has a ‘total’ meaning with all the aspects of a mystico-religious experience” (p. 36). Following a religious line of sociological analysis, Orsini differentiates the BR as an “active sect,” in contrast to “passive sects” that position themselves escaping the Apocalypse and establishing collective existence “beyond” the established social order. These distinctions align with my own typification of utopian movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113477381">Hall 2009</xref>). Specifically, Orsini’s passive groups are either post-apocalyptic “other-worldly sects” or “ecstatic associations” oriented to mystical enlightenment, or some hybrid of the two.</p>
<p>The “active sect” approximates the “apocalyptic warring sect,” and indeed just as in the warring sect more generally, in the BR the established social order is regarded as fundamentally illegitimate and evil—an eschatology of the End Times yields a strategy of uncompromised and eternal struggle. As Orsini puts it, “the enemy is a monster” (p. 3). In the BR and in general, the warring sectarian elect claim both to understand contemporary historical circumstances and (to quote Lenin) to know “what is to be done” in response. True believers band together in a warring quest to lead a revolutionary process that will fully engage and then move beyond Armageddon, to a post-apocalyptic utopia.</p>
<p>Whatever their social origins, participants in the BR as in the warring sect more generally, renounced any previous class privilege, abandoned their previous social identities, joined the ranks of the <italic>declassés</italic>, and underwent <italic>metanoia</italic>: a dramatic resocialization and rebirth into the identity of a revolutionary warrior, whose new persona is often signified by the adoption of a new name. Just as the old self has died and been replaced, so too the new self will die, but only in service to the cause or as a citizen in the New Era.</p>
<p>There can be neither compromise with evil nor gradualism, only an immediate, highly disciplined, and totalizing quest for revolutionary transformation that reshapes the individual, gives transcendent meaning to struggle, structures the features of underground revolutionary organization, and supposedly legitimizes violence toward those who defend or abet (or fail to oppose sufficiently) the established social order. Here, Orsini emphasizes the importance of purity as a motif based on a “binary code” (p. 17) that leaves no intermediate space between good and evil, innocent and guilty, friend and enemy.</p>
<p>Orsini rightly notes the comparisons that others, beginning with Engels, have made between secular revolutionary warring sects and earlier messianic warring religious sectarians. He engages in an extended and revealing set of comparisons to previous apocalyptic episodes, ranging from Thomas Müntzer’s quasi-mystical deflection of the sixteenth-century Peasants’ War into the abyss of martyrdom, to the Puritan Revolution in England, Jacobinist developments in the French Revolution, Russian anarchism, and Russian and Chinese Marxist-inspired revolutionary movements, down to the Cambodian Revolution (he could easily draw al-Qaeda into this comparative web).</p>
<p>To understand the book’s overarching argument, it may be useful to understand against whom the author is writing. Orsini explicitly contests explanations of terrorism that fail to give due consideration to ideology. In particular, he seeks to counter arguments of communist intellectuals who try to label the BR as little more than “imbeciles” (p. 122).</p>
<p>Many sociologists today, especially those who have studied cultural aspects of political violence and social movements, might regard Orsini’s argument as overly bound up with now dated Marxian debates. However, they would miss the distinctive contribution of <italic>Anatomy of the Red Brigades</italic>. Orsini acknowledges the importance of material circumstances that create conditions conducive to revolutionary mobilization, but his general proposition is that a culture of the sacred animates groups like the BR, and his comparative considerations identify a rich set of commonalities across a wide range of cases, for over half a millennium. Thus Orsini is led to assert, “a professional revolutionary is a particular anthropological type who possesses identical features in all places and times” (p. 255). The focus on commonalities necessarily results in less attention to differences, and more could be said about exactly why revolutionary warring sects gravitate toward the apocalyptic search for purity that Orsini describes and how they operate. As a basis for such inquiries, <italic>Anatomy of the Red Brigades</italic> offers a compelling and descriptively thick portrait of religious terrorism as a type of organized social action.</p>
