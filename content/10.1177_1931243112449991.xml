<abstract>
<p>In an increasingly fragmented media landscape where “narrowcasting” is more often the norm, it is important to teach today's students how to best understand and serve niche audiences. This case study of a Spanish language radio newscast examines student-reported learning and content outcomes, to demonstrate the value of this type of experiential learning about niche audiences. Among the findings, students reported a heightened sense of awareness of topics that are relevant and suitable for their niche audience, and commented on the experiences or tools that best helped them to understand their audience and how to best serve these listeners.</p>

<body>
<p>In an increasingly fragmented media landscape where “narrowcasting” is becoming a more dominant programming strategy, it is critical to train students to serve niche audiences with targeted content. While radio (formats) and cable television have been practicing this strategy for some time, the technological expansion to additional media platforms such as the World Wide Web, video on demand, mobile, and tablet content make the distribution and delivery of niche content more prevalent than ever. So, while mass audience strategies may not be gone, they have certainly ceded ground in recent years. As such, mass communication and journalism students must be prepared to understand niche audiences, and how to develop and supply content to serve these audiences’ needs and wants.</p>
<p>One narrowcasting trend that has only continued to grow in recent years is Spanish language programming. With Hispanics now comprising 16% of the U.S. population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1931243112449991">Humes, Jones, &amp; Ramirez, 2011</xref>), such growth has spawned demand in the marketplace and opportunities for suppliers of Spanish language content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1931243112449991">Coffey, 2009</xref>). In fact, Spanish language newscasts in some local markets regularly beat English language newscasts in the ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1931243112449991">“Univision beats all,” 2011</xref>), and prime time entertainment programming on Univision and Telemundo competes on equal footing with the likes of English broadcast television networks CBS, NBC, ABC, and FOX. Introducing students to programming trends that are reflective of America’s changing demographics can better prepare them for the society in which they live, and opportunities to practice content creation to serve niche audiences will equip them to be better content developers and providers, regardless of the media sector they enter. Practically speaking, the media environment our students are entering is almost always a converged one, serving radio, television, print, and/or online audiences. And increasingly, it will have a Spanish language component.</p>
<p>A case study of a Spanish language radio program at the University of Florida, <italic>Noticias WUFT</italic>, illustrates how audience targeting and niche programming can be taught using an experiential learning activity common to many journalism and mass communication programs: the student-produced newscast. A Spanish language newscast presents a challenging but necessary shift in thinking for students who may not be conditioned to consider a particular demographic group and what is most needed and desired by that group in terms of content. In the following pages, a review of relevant literature on niche audiences and student instructional tools will be provided, followed by a discussion of the newscast’s niche-focused content and student insights into their learning experiences.</p>
<sec id="section1-1931243112449991">
<title>Targeting Niche Audiences</title>
<p>Niche audiences are essentially market segments targeted by particular media products. As noted by marketing scholar Philip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1931243112449991">Kotler (1980)</xref>, a market segment is “the largest possible homogenous group of buyers that it pays to go after with a specially designed marketing program” (pp. 308–309), and a useful market segment is one that is measurable, substantial, accessible, differentiable, and “actionable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1931243112449991">Kotler, 2000</xref>, p. 274). Examples of niche audiences—market segments—can include gender and age groups such as women, teenagers, and baby boomers; race and ethnicity segments such as African Americans and Hispanics; interest and hobby groups such as country music fans, nature lovers, or sports enthusiasts, or any other segment, no matter how narrow, that meets Kotler’s criteria.</p>
<p>While the concept of narrowcasting may seem new, many would argue that the concept is an ancient one. Public speaking instructors tell their students to “know your audience.” Writers of all kinds, if they are good ones, never put pen to paper—or fingers to keyboard—without first thinking about their target audience. It is a basic and best practice. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1931243112449991">Tichenor (2006)</xref> notes, “Teaching students to think in terms of specific audiences makes their writing much more relevant and useful” (p. 455). But for broadcasting students who may normally be instructed to target their content to general news audiences within their community, they most likely have a broader, mainstream population in mind when crafting their stories and not a particular ethnic group. And most likely, they are thinking about an English-speaking audience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1931243112449991">
<title>Tools for Teaching Audience Understanding to Students</title>
<p>Few, if any, published studies have documented the techniques used to teach broadcasting students, or journalism students in general, how to serve niche audiences. However, there are some teacher scholars who have developed creative tools. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1931243112449991">Tichenor (2006)</xref> used niche magazines to teach audience understanding to students in technical writing classes. In his exercises, students learned to identify not just the demographic and psychographic traits of the niche audience readership but also the level of expertise required to read the magazine and to identify the level of vocabulary and type of language best suited for each magazine’s readership. Other observations, such as layout and advertisement types, are also utilized to help students identify the audience. These same skills are then used to adapt content, vocabulary, and writing style for technical writing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1931243112449991">Treise and Wagner (1999)</xref> developed a focus group exercise to train advertising students to identify the needs and wants of an ethnic audience, and then to successfully implement gathered knowledge to develop an effective campaign targeting that particular audience. Another advertising study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1931243112449991">Greene, 2009</xref>) outlined some useful segmentation tests that could be taught to marketing and advertising students; however students were neither interviewed, nor measured, as part of the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1931243112449991">
<title>Experiential Learning</title>
<p>Experiential learning, which approaches instruction from a practical, hands-on perspective, is often used in collegiate journalism courses or when producing extracurricular student broadcasts or publications. With experiential learning, the instructor is more of an organizer and facilitator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1931243112449991">Boud, 1993</xref>), coaching and mentoring students as they navigate real-world experiences as young journalists. As stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1931243112449991">George-Palilonis (2010)</xref>, “while the primary goal of didactic learning is the successful transmission of ‘knowledge’ from professor to student, that of experiential learning is the student's successful completion of a final product or his journey through a practical real-world exercise(s)” (p. 416). George-Palilonis used an experiential approach with research-informed design to teach visual communications students to learn from and better respond to the needs and wants of media users via their feedback.</p>
<p>Within the experiential learning realm, the study that comes closest to this essay’s exemplar in helping students better understand their audience is Hatcher’s (2009) Urban News Project. During the course of the project, students were sent into their community and out of their comfort zones in order to view, up close and personally, how people in their community lived. While the goal was primarily community engagement and community-focused journalism, both this project and the current Spanish language radio program share the goal of shaping, or reshaping, student perceptions about the people they serve as journalists. In summarizing the results of the project, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1931243112449991">Hatcher (2009)</xref> wrote, “what if the objectives are to challenge participants to look beyond their own stereotypes, become more involved in their community, and observe and write thoughtfully about the world around them? If the goal, in other words, is to create more engaged citizens, then not only is this approach promising, but also it becomes a technique that has value beyond the journalism classroom” (p. 315). One might even argue that community-based journalism, in many cases, means serving a particular niche audience—in the case of the present essay, Spanish-dominant residents of North Central Florida.</p></sec>

<title>Noticias WUFT</title>
<p>
<italic>Noticias WUFT </italic>is a 30-min weekly news and public affairs program that airs on WUFT-FM 89.1, a 100,000-watt NPR–affiliated station licensed to the University of Florida. Including repeater station WJUF-FM 90.1, the signals cover 19 counties throughout North Central Florida, nearly coast to coast. No other source of Spanish language, over-the-air local or regional news existed in North Central Florida prior to the program’s launch, so it was critical to and in the public interest to provide such a service for the growing Spanish-speaking community. In February 2010, <italic>Noticias WUFT </italic>went on the air, a program entirely produced by bilingual student journalists with oversight by a faculty advisor and a native (Spanish)-speaking copy editor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1931243112449991">1</xref>
</sup> The program’s target audience is Spanish-dependent adult listeners, mainly new arrivals to the United States and/or the state of Florida. The news and information needed by such an audience differs from that of a mainstream audience and, of course, so does the language of delivery. Approximately 10–15 student journalists are involved with <italic>Noticias WUFT</italic> on a weekly basis, and all are necessarily bilingual in English and Spanish. Most, but not all, are Hispanic and are a mixture of domestic and international students. The time commitment from each student ranges from 2 to 20 hr weekly, depending on the student’s role and responsibility within the broadcast. Anchors/producers typically volunteer about 20 hr weekly, while writers might commit just 2–3 hr per week. Production began in the WUFT-FM newsroom and recording booths, and the program has since expanded into its own newsroom. The program is prerecorded with final editing and show approval the day prior to air. Once listened to by the supervisor and any final edits are made, the newscast is approved and uploaded into the radio station’s automation system.</p>
<p>The content in the first half of the program consists of local, state, national, and international news, as well as a sports segment, weather, and a community calendar, which provides information on various events around the listening area. Some events are family entertainment-oriented (e.g., festivals and concerts), while others are more educational (e.g., English or citizenship classes) or health-oriented (e.g., free vaccinations and health screenings). The second half of the program is a long-form interview on a singular topic of interest to the Hispanic community. For instance, a particular social, health, cultural, or political issue is discussed in depth, or a prominent person in the Latino community is featured. This segment’s goal is more educational in nature, aimed at enhancing the quality of life for the program’s listeners and providing tools, information, or otherwise helping them acclimate to a new culture and home.</p>
<p>Opportunities to instruct students about targeting a niche audience—in this case, the Spanish-dependent Hispanic audience of North Central Florida—have come at various points during the newscast’s evolution. At group meetings at the beginning of each semester, student volunteers are told who the target audience is, including their traits as Spanish-dependent speakers and newer arrivals to the United States, and that they are adult listeners and not the student population of the university, a perspective that student reporters naturally embrace. Other opportunities to remind and instruct students about the niche audience and the issues that are likely important to it occur at the weekly editorial meetings, where story selection is debated and the rundown set. When students suggest story ideas, they are encouraged to ask themselves whether this is important and relevant, not to themselves as students, but to the target audience. Moreover, students are informed at various times which counties within the station’s metropolitan statistical area have the highest percentage of Hispanic listeners, so that students can try to serve these counties in particular with local news. Finally, during some publicity visits in the community (e.g., Hispanic cultural festivals, health fairs, church socials following Spanish language masses), students have had the opportunity to speak and interact with their target audience directly.</p>

<title>Content and Learning Outcomes</title>
<p>For purposes of illustrating learning outcomes and student understanding of audience targeting and niche programming in this case study, a brief content analysis was conducted of the newscast’s story topics. Additionally, student journalists were interviewed to ascertain to what extent, if any, the Spanish language newscast has aided them in learning how to serve and prepare news content for niche audiences.</p>

<title>Interview Findings</title>
<p>Students’ interview responses were analyzed and themes were identified within these responses. The most prevalent themes were grouped by category and are presented below.</p>
<p>
<italic>Development of an audience “filter.” </italic>Student journalists responded that their involvement with the Spanish language newscast, <italic>Noticias WUFT</italic>, helped them to develop a news judgment and discernment that enabled them to identify which stories and topics were relevant to their target audience, what might be referred to as the development of an audience “filter.” David<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1931243112449991">2</xref>
</sup> explained, “I think it has changed the way I always approach a developing story. The same question always pops into my mind, how does this affect the Hispanic community in Central Florida?” Similarly, Marta reported:<disp-quote>
<p>Being the co-anchor and the producer made me aware of my audience when reading or listening to any news, always asking, how is this report going to affect our Hispanic audience? I had to design the show with content that would be important to their lives. For example, I would interview a nurse from a free clinic in Marion County to talk about the services provided and targeted to a Hispanic community…. <italic>Noticias </italic>made me think about my audience at all times, and structure the show with them in mind.</p>
</disp-quote>
<italic>Emphasizing and providing specialized content</italic>. From this audience filter, students explained how they were then able to better select relevant stories and place an emphasis on specialized, customized content. Mateo explained:<disp-quote>
<p>My involvement in <italic>Noticias </italic>helped me understand the needs and wants of niche audiences. When I started working with<italic> Noticias </italic>as a sports anchor, I didn’t really realize this, and at first I reported on tennis matches, golf, hockey, and other sports that our target audience is not very much immersed in. But I soon realized the importance of reporting more on football, soccer, béisbol [sic], and news more related to Latin America.</p>
</disp-quote>Sometimes, students realized the perspective or angle they needed to share with their target audience was not necessarily one that would be shared by a mainstream audience. As Jessica observed:<disp-quote>
<p>As a proud Hispanic in a city where Latinos aren’t the majority, I’ve realized that not everyone wants to cover stories pertaining to immigration reform, the DREAM Act, discrimination, etc. Most of these topics bring no interest to the student-journalist peers around me, because it does not affect them directly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<italic>Personal interaction with the target audience.</italic> One of the ways that several students reported as having assisted them in understanding the content wants and needs of their target audience was the personal, one-on-one interaction they had with their target audience in the community. On various occasions, the students publicized the newscast at churches with Spanish language services, Latino festivals, or other cultural events around the listening area which provided opportunities for valuable interaction and feedback. Teresa explained:<disp-quote>
<p>Thanks to the exposure to the community through <italic>Noticias</italic>, I knew for example that most Hispanics in our area were peasants who expended hours in the field working, so stories related to pesticide side effects and agriculture in general were always welcome. This type of story, for example, would not be that relevant for a Hispanic radio program in a city like Miami, [sic] reason why knowing the audience was crucial.</p>
</disp-quote>Marta also shared that “one of the best experiences…was going out there to churches and group-gathering events to speak to our audience. Asking them what they would like to hear helped a lot and it was also a rewarding experience, since I felt like my work was being appreciated.” Finally, simply being a journalist associated with the newscast, with its many opportunities for interaction, aided students. Added Teresa:<disp-quote>
<p>The longer I was working with the community, for example doing interviews with local Hispanic organizations, Hispanic professors and the Hispanic community in general, the more I understood the audience. So, basically Noticias was the “vehicle” for me to actually meet the community I needed to inform, and once I knew them, then it was easier to inform them accurately and with relevant and useful news.</p>
</disp-quote>
<italic>Tools and mechanisms to further understand the target audience.</italic> Beyond audience interaction opportunities, students mentioned other tools or mechanisms that aided them in better understanding their niche audience. One of these included briefings and information from the student leader of the program’s publicity/marketing team. Said Mateo, “Patricia, our marketing expert, gave me a very detailed explanation of who our audience is and what they are looking for. Talking to her was really helpful on understanding this.” In addition, students were briefed occasionally in meetings on the population of Latinos in the surrounding counties and the most common countries of origin using U.S. Census Bureau data. “The nationalities and traditions of Hispanics in North Central Florida are really diverse, so it was really important to look for news relevant to different countries in Latin America, and also to look for issues affecting the different groups within the Hispanic community,” Teresa pointed out. Finally, the weekly editorial meetings for the newscast proved beneficial for one student in terms of story selection and better understanding the target audience. According to Jennifer, “What helped me definitely was our editorial meetings, where we really narrowed down what we would be covering that week, and the reasons why that particular story was newsworthy for our audience.”</p>
<p>
<italic>Side benefits</italic>. Through their experiences with producing the Spanish language newscast, it seems that students have received some additional but unanticipated benefits. As one student commented, “<italic>Noticias </italic>has opened new horizons and desire in me to worry more about the Hispanic community and figure out ways in which we can help them be better informed.” And another student mentioned, “My involvement with <italic>Noticias </italic>has made me get closer to the roots of my ancestors and question where I come from more. I am currently eager to explore the background and heritage of Hispanics in our community and the world.”</p>

<sec id="section8-1931243112449991">
<title>Reflections on Program Content</title>
<p>In reviewing the topics covered within the Public Affairs segment of the newscast, the assortment of themes is different than what might be expected in a mainstream (general audience) newscast. The considerable coverage of immigration, as well as special attention to migrant worker issues, language, and citizenship, demonstrates that this content is geared toward recent arrivals to the United States. More specifically, the featured interviews with prominent Hispanics suggest who the target audience is. And, while international affairs were heavily covered as noted above, nearly all segments had to do with Latin America, where most listeners had family or served as their countries of origin. In this sense, then, the international affairs content may have provided a type of cultural maintenance for listeners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1931243112449991">Ríos &amp; Gaines, 1998</xref>) and enabled them to keep informed, in detail, on events “back home.”</p>
<p>While health coverage is important to all, topics featured in the<italic> Noticias WUFT </italic>newscast specifically covered topics such as free access to health care for children of migrant workers, Spanish speaking public clinics, or care for expectant mothers (who may not have a primary care physician or be insured), and so on. Topics that are important to all populations often receive a special angle or focus for the North Central Florida Latino population. Moreover, certain topics are covered that probably would not be covered at all, if the program was geared to a mainstream population (e.g., how to become a U.S. citizen).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1931243112449991">
<title>Insights From Student Journalist Responses</title>
<p>In evaluating the student journalist responses, it seems that they indeed benefitted from their involvement with the show, in terms of better understanding the needs and wants of the Spanish-speaking Latino audience. The development of an audience “filter” is central to understanding and serving any audience, not just niche audiences. However, by serving a narrow, specific audience (such as Spanish speakers of North Central Florida), it seems this skill may become more sharply honed, out of necessity. (Experimental studies would be needed to accurately test this premise.) Students mentioned various topics that they know would not be relevant to the general population, but because of the background or physical needs of their audience, they quickly understood which stories belonged in the newscast and which ones did not. Perhaps the narrower the focus, the more acute the students’ attention is to the story selection, relevance, story significance, and likely impact.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1931243112449991">
<title>Tools and Mechanisms to Aid Niche Audience Understanding</title>
<p>Tools and experiences mentioned by students as having aided them in better understanding the Latino audience of North Central Florida—personal interaction with the community, audience and market research and population data, and editorial meetings—can be considered central to better understanding any audience. The personal interaction benefit from interacting with the audience or consumer was effective in both the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1931243112449991">Treise and Wagner (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1931243112449991">Hatcher (2009)</xref> studies and seems to be the case for this group of student journalists as well. In addition, an understanding of the target audience’s demographic and psychographic traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1931243112449991">Tichenor, 2006</xref>) was generated both from this interaction and from population and audience data. Student appreciation for these tools and mechanisms should be considered a success, as these same tools can help them to better understand and serve any audience, regardless of type or location. It seems they understand the value of these practices and information sources about their audience, and the value of utilizing them, to better serve their audience. Teaching students about niche audiences may, in fact, be one of the best vehicles for helping students to understand any future audiences they may serve. As Jessica summarized, “It all depends on the audience and how much it pertains to them. Good local news is about the majority of your audience and what interests THEM. <italic>Noticias </italic>taught me to always think of my audience beforehand, no matter who you’re reporting for.”</p>
