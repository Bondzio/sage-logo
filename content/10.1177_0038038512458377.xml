<p>Over the past decade Zygmunt Bauman has explored various aspects of what he calls ‘liquid’ modernity: a condition characterized by, among other things, the fragility and transience of social bonds; the passing down of responsibilities from the state to the individual; the transformation of citizens into consumers; and the emergence of new forms of disengaged, extraterritorial power. Given that Bauman has addressed these aspects of liquid modernity many times before, the basic argument of <italic>Culture in a Liquid Modern World</italic> will be familiar to many readers. Chapter 1 returns to Bourdieu’s work, which is said to capture ‘culture at its homeostatic stage: culture at the service of the status quo … just before the inevitable and fast approaching loss of its position’ (p. 11). This ‘loss of position’, Bauman argues, is one consequence of liquid modernization, through the course of which everything ‘solid’ is dissolved and ‘unlike yesterday’ is not replaced by other solid forms. Bauman’s response to Bourdieu is that ‘culture today consists of offers, not prohibitions: propositions, not norms’ (p. 13). He adds: ‘it serves not so much the stratifications and divisions of society, as the turnover-oriented consumer market’ (p. 13). This position is not exactly new and is accompanied by a number of declarations that are all too familiar: in liquid modernity, ‘networks replace structures’ (p. 14); culture is no longer about enlightenment but the seduction of its ‘clients’ (p. 16); and in a world of high consumerism the ‘function of culture is not to satisfy existing needs, but to create new ones’ (p. 17).</p>
<p>The following chapters are more engaging. Chapter 2 addresses the question of fashion. Bauman argues that ‘In every period of history, in every territory of human habitation and in every culture, fashion has taken on the role of chief operator in the refashioning of constant change into a norm of the human way of life’ (pp. 22–3). What happens in liquid modernity is that culture becomes ‘subjugated’ to this logic of fashion. Bauman warns: ‘If you don’t want to drown, you must keep on surfing: that is to say, keep changing, as often as you can, your wardrobe, furniture, wallpaper, appearance and habits, in short – yourself’ (p. 24). This portrait of a world that is fast moving and transient frames the following chapter on global migration, where Bauman terms liquid modernity the ‘age of diasporas’, and argues that the problem with human rights is that they are based on the right to difference, and because of this do not ‘lay down the foundations for mutual solidarity’ (p. 37). This lack of solidarity is likely to result in fighting between ‘equally weak opponents’ – a situation that, for Bauman, only benefits the few, for ‘When the poor lock horns with the poor, the rich have every reason to rub their hands with glee’ (p. 42).Chapter 4 revisits many of these themes by drawing into question notions of multiculturalism and of community. Bauman argues, in line with many of his previous writings, that community should not be seen as a solution to our problems, for it is underpinned by a ‘ghetto-minded’ model of social exclusion that threatens to bring a ‘deepening of separation, isolation and alienation’ (p. 68). Multiculturalism is also said not to help matters, for ‘Instead of concentrating on the causes and roots of the uncertainty afflicting people today’ it ‘draws attention and energy away from them’ (p. 69).</p>
<p>Chapter 5 shifts attention to the question of culture in a ‘uniting Europe’. Bauman’s position is that globalization would attack the basis of national sovereignty ‘even more eagerly’ if it ‘were not for the bedrock of solidarity of the European Union’ (p. 71). This pro-Europe stance is underpinned by the following judgement:
<disp-quote>
<p>… all we Europeans … are perfectly suited to become friends in the sense given to friendship by the ancient Greeks, the forefathers of Europe: not by sacrificing what is dear to our hearts, but by offering it to neighbours near and far, just as they offer us, as generously, what is dear to their hearts. (p. 85)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Surprisingly, there is no mention of the ongoing crisis of the Eurozone or any reflection on the geographical specificity of ‘liquid modern’ culture. Instead, Bauman presents an idealized version of the political life of ancient Greece as the value-standard for acting in the present, but without questioning either the de facto workings of Greek democracy or the problems to be faced in re-enacting this model today.</p>
<p>The final chapter of the book addresses culture in terms of its position ‘between state and market’. One might expect this chapter to address in detail the neoliberalization of contemporary cultural forms, but it touches only briefly on the ways in which ‘cultural activity’ is subjected to the ‘standards and criteria of consumer markets’ (p. 110). Bauman does suggest two ‘functions’ of the state that should not be neglected: first, ‘the function of defending markets from themselves’, and second, ‘the function of repairing the social and cultural damage which litters the trail of market expansion …’ (p. 115). It might be argued that, in the face of the current crises of market capitalism, this is where a book on contemporary culture should begin rather than end. For what now is the ‘function’ of the state, in connection to culture, under conditions of advanced neoliberalism? How and why should it defend markets from themselves? And how, exactly, might the state act to identify and ‘repair’ the ‘cultural damage’ of market capitalism, if it itself is subject to processes of marketization? Given the current uncertainty over the basis and fate of European integration, these are topical questions that demand further reflection, perhaps not just by Bauman but by the discipline more generally.</p>
