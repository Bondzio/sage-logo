<abstract>
<p>Error-correction strategies are essential considerations for behavior analysts implementing discrete trial training with children with autism. The research literature, however, is still lacking in the number of studies that compare and evaluate error-correction procedures. The purpose of this study was to compare two error-correction strategies: Independent Probe and Delay across learners with autism in an intensive intervention program. Two studies were conducted. The first study compared the two procedures across receptive tasks for 3 individuals, and differential effects were seen across learners. The second study compared the two procedures across tact trials with two of the same learners and found that individual differences were noted, but in addition, the more effective error-correction strategy was consistent across the two verbal operants (i.e., receptive in Study 1, tacts in Study 2). These combined studies suggest the effectiveness of error-correction strategies may be individualized to the learner but may generalize across operants.</p>

<p>Discrete trial training (DTT) is a multicomponent intervention for teaching individuals with autism. Various aspects of the discrete trial (e.g., the antecedent, the consequence) may be manipulated with differential results for the learner. Antecedent strategies such as prompting have been investigated extensively in the literature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445511427973">Green, 2001</xref>) and have demonstrated the effectiveness of an errorless teaching approach. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445511427973">Green (2001)</xref> stated that “few, if any, truly ‘errorless’ training procedures exist” (p. 78), suggesting that reliance on this strategy alone may be insufficient. An analysis of the effects of consequences following errors must be considered to define best practices in DTT.</p>
<p>In the last 15 years, a variety of error-correction strategies have been investigated in the literature. It has been demonstrated that error-correction procedures are a necessary component of DTT for many learners. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145445511427973">Worsdell et al. (2005)</xref> demonstrated in one study that five of six participants demonstrated “little or no improvement” in a no error-correction condition. When error-correction conditions were introduced, all participants demonstrated improvement. Overall, they stated that “every error correction condition produced improvement in sight-word performance over a baseline condition consisting of positive reinforcement” (p. 525). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445511427973">Smith, Mruzek, Wheat, &amp; Hughes (2006)</xref> in their study on DTT to discriminate the matching of written words found that two of their participants performed better with an error-correction procedure than without.</p>
<p>A number of published clinical practice guides such as the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) Manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445511427973">Frost &amp; Bondy, 1994</xref>) and the ME book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445511427973">Lovaas et al., 1981</xref>) contain prescribed error-correction practices. However, implementing the same error-correction procedures for all learners may not be effective. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445511427973">Smith et al. (2006)</xref> demonstrated differential learning rates across different error-correction procedures (i.e., error statements, modeling, and no feedback). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445511427973">Rodgers and Iwata (1991)</xref> demonstrated that five of six adults with developmental disabilities showed differential responding across a feedback, a practice, and an avoidance-based procedure. This suggests that error-correction procedures may need to be individualized for some learners. However the rationale for selecting particular error-correction practices lacks a conceptual analysis.</p>
<p>One possibly detrimental consequence of implementing an error-correction procedure is that a behavior chain may form in that an incorrect response may result in a prompt from an instructor and followed by reinforcement. One suggestion might be to insert a delay or a brief time-out from instruction as a consequence following an incorrect response and prior to the implementation of an error-correction procedure. This type of procedure has been described within the ME Book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445511427973">Lovaas et al., 1981</xref>). Other guidelines, as in the PECS Manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445511427973">Frost &amp; Bondy, 1994</xref>), suggest use of an additional high-probability response during the delay that follows an error and then implementation of the error-correction trial. Clinical practice manuals may dictate practices within early intervention programs, yet the procedures are not necessarily supported by empirical data. For example, error-correction procedures described within the PECS manual and ME book have not been studied comparatively to other correction procedures or each other. Therefore, the purpose of Study 1 was to (a) compare the effectiveness of the components of these two error-correction strategies across learners with autism in a receptive language task and (b) further investigate whether error-correction practices are differentially effective across learners.</p>
<sec id="section1-0145445511427973">
<title>Study 1</title>
<p>This study specifically compared effectiveness of a “Delay” error-correction (as derived from Lovaas et al., 1991) to an “independent probe” (IP) error-correction procedure (as derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445511427973">Frost &amp; Bondy, 1994</xref>) for three children with autism in an early intervention discrete trial program. The specific procedures in this study were adapted and implemented according to the current practice at this particular clinical site, as detailed below.</p>
<sec id="section2-0145445511427973">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0145445511427973">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Four children with autism were recruited for this study and three children completed the study. One participant was removed from the study due to lack of acquisition of targets, which prevented the analysis of the error-correction procedure itself. That is, acquisition of targets would have to be seen in at least one of the error-correction procedures. This participant, although removed from this study, continued to receive intensive behavioral intervention (IBI), and other components of the discrete trial were examined to maximize learning.</p>
<p>All three children had an independent diagnosis of autism and were enrolled in an IBI program, in which they received 17.5 hr per week of service.</p>
<p>In order for a child to receive intervention services within this center, he or she must have met the “eligibility requirements” for the program. “Eligibility requirements” include having received a diagnosis of autism, independent from the clinical program, and clinical evaluation on additional psychometric tests (described below). A clinical team then makes a decision as to whether a child is “eligible” for service.</p>
<p>The children in this study were selected based on their lack of interfering behaviors and their acquisition of all the prerequisite skills necessary for receptive language instruction (e.g., match to sample skills, imitation, etc.). All children were enrolled in a special education school placement. Only those children whose families gave full consent to research participated in this study.</p>
<p>Paula, 7 years old, had been receiving IBI for less than 1 year prior to the study. She was deemed “eligible for service” using multiple assessment tools, including the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Fourth Edition (WISC-IV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445511427973">Wechsler, 2003</xref>), the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales–Second Edition (VABS-II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445511427973">Sparrow, Balla, &amp; Cicchetti, 1984</xref>), the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445511427973">Schopler, Reichler, &amp; Renner, 1988</xref>), and the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed.; <italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445511427973">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) all of which yielded an autism diagnosis.</p>
<p>Xavier, 6 years 10 months old, had been receiving IBI services for 2 years prior to the study. He was assessed for service eligibility at the age of 4 years 6 months. According to the VABS-II, CARS, and the <italic>DSM-IV</italic>, he met the criterion for the diagnostic label of pervasive developmental disorder–not otherwise specified (PDD NOS).</p>
<p>Lisa, 8 years 1 month old, did not have previous experience in an IBI program, prior to the study. The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445511427973">Lord, Rutter, DiLavore, &amp; Risi, 1999</xref>) and the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> rendered an autism diagnosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0145445511427973">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>All children received their training in a center. For the purposes of this study, all children were removed from their classroom-based IBI program, into a separate room. Within this 10 × 10 room was a standard-sized table with two chairs. The participants sat at a 45-degree angle from the instructors, and an additional person was present and videotaping the sessions. There was no interaction between the participant and the video camera technician. Given that sessions within the IBI program were videotaped on a regular basis, it is unlikely that the presence of a camera and video technician altered the participants’ responding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0145445511427973">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Stimuli were selected based on participant interest, wherever possible. For each target, five exemplars were created of equal size (i.e. 3.5 × 5 inches) and presented in a three-stimulus array format as per receptive discrimination trials. Paula’s receptive targets included “beauty products” (e.g., shower cap, flat iron, etc.), given her preference for interacting with such items. Xavier’s targets were “vehicles” (e.g., streetcar, snowmobile, etc.) because of an interest in wheels and motors. Lisa’s targets were receptive letters, given that this was an upcoming target in her school-based program. A total of 15 stimuli (i.e., three target items with five exemplars each) were presented in each condition. Each teaching trial involved a receptive target (S+) and two distractors (S−). There were no additional stimuli accessed to function as distractors. Each stimulus functioned as either an S+ or an S− depending on the trial.</p>
<p>All target items were trained simultaneously, and each stimulus was presented only one time per condition. Both conditions were presented at least once, and no more than 2 times per session. An average of 30 min separated the treatment conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0145445511427973">
<title>Preference assessments</title>
<p>Preference assessments were conducted for all participants to ensure that motivation was high across all conditions and to prevent lack of responding due to lack of reinforcement. Two of the three participants (Xavier and Paula) were able to verbally respond to the question “What do you want to work for?” or would verbally express preferences prior to being asked. Lisa’s preferences were indicated either by responding to the question “What do you want to work for?” or an array was presented from which she selected a desired item. Preferred items were delivered immediately following an independent correct response. Social praise was delivered to Xavier and Paula following a prompted response after an error. For Lisa, smaller portions of her edible reinforcers were delivered following prompted trials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0145445511427973">
<title>Research design</title>
<p>A within-session alternating treatments design was conducted. Stimulus sets were counterbalanced between conditions to ensure that the participant had equal exposure to both conditions and both types of stimuli. Each condition was delivered at least once per session but no more than 2 times per session. For example with Xavier, vehicles (e.g., helicopter, snowmobile, streetcar) were assigned to the first condition, “Delay,” followed by flags (e.g., Greece, Japan, Portugal) in the IP condition, then vehicles in the IP condition (e.g., tractor, motorcycle, ambulance) and flags in the Delay condition (e.g., Italy, Poland, Jamaica), and so on. Replication of the most effective procedure with a new set of targets was implemented in the final phase. Data were collected on the cumulative trials to criterion. Both cumulative trials to mastery of “concepts” and “exemplars” were analyzed as described in the Results section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0145445511427973">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>The two conditions that were alternated were the “Delay” condition and the “IP” condition. All trials involved least-to-most prompting, in that all participants were given 5 s to respond following the instruction and without assistance. The Delay condition consisted of a 5-s delay (intertrial interval) following the error, with no feedback given, followed by a readministration of the Discriminative stimulus (Sd) and a prompt to respond correctly. Then a new trial with a new stimulus followed. The IP condition consisted of a 3-s delay (intertrial interval) following the error, with no feedback given, then a readministration of the Sd with a prompt to respond correctly. The child was then asked to respond to a “distractor trial” (i.e., a request to respond to a previously learned response). Distractor trials were selected according to the instructor’s knowledge of previously learned responses. Following the distractor trial, the original Sd was administered again to test for a learned response. The delay for the IP trial was shorter in this condition to balance the time taken to deliver the distractor and probe trials. The aim was for both procedures to be similar in terms of duration of the correction trials. The intertrial interval between discrete trials varied depending on reinforcer consumption (e.g., time taken to consume a marshmallow) but on average did not exceed 30 s.</p>
<p>Treatment integrity was measured across all instructors, as described in the following sections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0145445511427973">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>All stimuli were presented to the participants in a three-card array discrimination format. The goal was for the participant to identify, through multiple exemplar training, receptive flashcards. As multiple exemplar training involves acquisition of targets as measured by correct responding across different stimulus exemplars of that target, mastery of the “target” in clinical practice is often defined as responding correctly to a percentage of these exemplars across presentations. Therefore, data of the individual stimulus exemplars are collapsed at the group (of exemplars) level or the “stimulus set” level. When using multiple exemplar training in practice, but measuring the effectiveness of the teaching method, the acquisition of each stimulus exemplar as well as mastery across exemplars (i.e., stimulus generalization) is necessary. This ensures that the error-correction procedure itself is what is being examined and not the salience or the ambiguity of one individual exemplar. In this study, a stimulus set was defined as five exemplars of the chosen target and is herein described as a “concept.” An “exemplar” was defined as one exemplar within the stimulus set (e.g., streetcar is the “concept”; each of the five different pictures of a streetcar is the “exemplar”). Mastery of a “concept” was met when the learner responded correctly to 5/5 targets on three consecutive sessions. Mastery of an exemplar (in a post hoc analysis) was met when the learner responded correctly to the exemplar three consecutive times. Concepts were taught in groups of three (i.e., five exemplars each). No new targets were introduced into the existing 15-stimulus set. Following mastery of the first set of 15 stimuli, another set of targets was introduced.</p>
<p>A correct receptive response was defined as “pointing to or touching the correct flashcard following the Sd.” Dependent variables included (a) sessions to criterion for “concepts,” (b) cumulative trials to criterion for “exemplars,” and (c) procedural efficiency.</p>
<p>The “efficiency” of error-correction procedures was defined as the mean length of time taken to deliver the error-correction trial. This measure was taken by viewing videotape samples of 10 trials via videotape and calculating the mean number of seconds per error condition trial.</p>

<sec id="section10-0145445511427973">
<title>Procedure</title>
<sec id="section11-0145445511427973">
<title>Baseline</title>
<p>Instructors delivered the Sd “Point to/Touch/Show me” or “Give me” (target). Each stimulus was presented 3 times. If the participant identified a particular exemplar correctly 2 out of 3 times that exemplar was removed as a target for the study. If the participant correctly identified 6 of 15 presentations of the exemplars that defined the concept (e.g., nail polish) that concept was removed as a target for the study. Reinforcers were delivered for on-task behaviors, not for correct responses to the receptive task.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0145445511427973">
<title>Training</title>
<p>Two instructors were trained to implement the procedures as designed. The instructors had a minimum of a college diploma in a related field and had been employed within the clinical program for more than 3 years. Both instructors were selected based on their effective technical application of DTT. To facilitate rapid alternation within the design, instructors were informed of the purpose of the study, as they were individually implementing both conditions with their respective participant. However, both instructors had a history of delivering both types of error-correction procedures in the clinical setting.</p>
<p>Behavioral Skills Training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445511427973">Sarakoff &amp; Sturmey, 2004</xref>) was used to train the instructors. Specifically the trainees received verbal and written instructions, viewed videotape models, role-played conditions, and were scored on a performance checklist by the second author. Once procedural competence was demonstrated during role-play, the instructors implemented the treatment with the participants. Given that treatment integrity was evaluated via videotape, feedback was delivered intermittently to maintain staff performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0145445511427973">
<title>Interobserver agreement</title>
<p>Interobserver agreement was calculated using point-by-point agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445511427973">Kazdin, 1982</xref>). These data were collected by two of the authors viewing 30% of the trials via videotape for each of the conditions. The evaluated sessions were randomly selected within each of the five phases. The number of sessions evaluated in each phase depended on the total number of sessions that were required for mastery. For example, if a participant mastered the targets in 9 sessions of a phase, 3 sessions were randomly selected for interobserver agreement. If a participant mastered the targets in 12 sessions of a phase, 4 sessions were randomly selected for interobserver agreement. The authors viewed the selected sessions and recorded data based on the participants’ responses. The author’s data were then compared against the instructor’s data. If the author and the instructor scored the same data on a particular trial, it was scored with a (+) and if different data were recorded, the trial was scored with a (−). Agreement for each phase was calculated using the formula Agreements / Agreements + Disagreements × 100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445511427973">Kazdin, 1982</xref>). Overall agreement for the study was calculated by adding the percentage of agreement for each phase divided by 5 (phases) × 100.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0145445511427973">
<title>Treatment integrity</title>
<p>Measurement of treatment integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445511427973">Progar, Perrin, DiNovi, &amp; Bruce, 2001</xref>) was conducted via videotape. One of the authors viewed the same trials that were selected for evaluation of interobserver agreement. Following each trial, the author scored a (+) if the instructor implemented each of the treatment components as intended and a (−) if she did not. Treatment integrity for each phase was calculated using the formula Agreements / Agreements + Disagreements × 100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445511427973">Kazdin, 1982</xref>). Overall integrity for the study was calculated by adding the percentage of agreement for each phase / 5 (phases) × 100.</p>

<title>Exemplar acquisition</title>
<p>A post hoc analysis of the exemplar data where individual exemplars were measured to the same mastery criterion of three consecutive correct responses revealed the following: Paula and Lisa still demonstrated greater acquisition in the Delay (78 sessions, 340 trials) over the IP condition (124 sessions, 503 trials), respectively (as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0145445511427973">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0145445511427973">3</xref>, respectively).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Two of the three participants (Paula and Lisa) demonstrated quicker acquisition in the Delay condition; however, one participant (Xavier) demonstrated better acquisition in the IP condition, although this was not demonstrated until the post hoc exemplar analysis. Given the varied results, few conclusions can be drawn about which procedure is more effective; however, results further substantiate the hypothesis that error-correction procedures may be best selected for the individual learner, based on individualized results.</p>
<p>The post hoc analysis of the exemplar data suggest that determining best practices in DTT should be done at the exemplar rather than the “concept” (i.e., stimulus set) level. Collecting data at the exemplar data level allows for analysis of discrimination difficulties due to the stimulus itself. That is, determining that a child has learned to identify five different examples of a target (e.g., car) after eight presentations may not be the most precise examination of effectiveness. If four of the examples were learned after four presentations and the fifth example required eight presentations that data would indicate to the clinician that the problem is with the particular stimulus, and the conclusion might be that the learner is not attending to the relevant features of that stimulus. In turn, the clinician may decide to either remove that stimulus or make the relevant features more salient on subsequent trials. However, if data were only taken at the “concept” level, incorrect conclusions about the child’s learning may be made. Therefore, collapsed data or “concept” level data only may lead to erroneous conclusions that an error-correction procedure is ineffective. Analysis of exemplar data would ensure that decisions are based on procedural effectiveness rather than the particular properties of a particular stimulus. Given that these procedures were limited to receptive tasks only, investigating these same procedures across a different verbal operant was the purpose of the next study.</p>

<title>Study 2</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to compare effectiveness of two error-correction strategies (Delay and IP) on tact training with two children with autism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445511427973">Rodgers and Iwata (1991)</xref> suggested that “(it should be) determine (d) whether certain error-correction procedures are more effective for some tasks than for others” (p. 781). This study investigated the generalizability of procedures across tasks, examining whether the more effective error-correction strategy (from Study 1) corresponded with the more effective strategy in tact training. Specifically, this study was investigating whether the effectiveness of error-correction strategies was task specific for individual children.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section24-0145445511427973">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in this study were two of the same children from the first study, Xavier and Paula, and this study was conducted immediately following Study 1.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0145445511427973">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>As in Study 1, stimuli were selected based on participant interest, and preference assessments were conducted prior to teaching. For each target, five exemplars were created of equal size and presented by the instructor holding up the card and asking “What is it?” as per tact-training trials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0145445511427973">
<title>Research design</title>
<p>An alternating treatments design was implemented. The Delay and IP procedures were alternated in random order. The stimulus categories were counterbalanced across all conditions, and replication of the most effective procedure was implemented in the final phase. For example, stimulus Set A (“tools”) in the Delay condition, then Set B (“vehicles”) in the IP condition, then Set C (“vehicles”) in the Delay condition, then Set D (“tools”) in the IP condition, and finally Set E, the most effective condition.</p>

<title>Procedure and Data Collection</title>
<sec id="section28-0145445511427973">
<title>Baseline</title>
<p>Instructors delivered the Sd “What is it?” Each stimulus was presented 3 times. If the participant identified a particular exemplar correctly 2 out of 3 times that exemplar was removed as a target for the study. If the participant correctly identified 6 of 15 presentations of the exemplars that defined the concept that concept was removed as a target for the study. Reinforcers were delivered for on-task behaviors only.</p>

<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>Dependent variables that were measured were the same as in Study 1, except that the tact response was operationally defined as “verbally stating the name of an item depicted in a flashcard when that flashcard is held up and the child is asked ‘What is it?’” As in Study 1, the following data were collected: (a) sessions to criterion for “concepts,” (b) cumulative trials to criterion for “exemplars,” and (c) procedural efficiency. Mastery of “concepts” and mastery of “exemplars” were measured across conditions. A “concept” was defined as a stimulus set or five exemplars of the chosen target. An “exemplar” was defined as one exemplar within the stimulus set. Mastery of a “concept” was achieved when the learner responded correctly to 5/5 targets on three consecutive sessions. Mastery of an exemplar was achieved when then learner responded correctly to the exemplar three consecutive times.</p>
<p>The “efficiency” of error-correction procedures was defined as the mean length of time taken to deliver the error -correction trial. These data were collected by viewing sampling of 10 trials via videotape and calculating the mean number of seconds per error condition trial.</p>

<title>Exemplar acquisition</title>
<p>The exemplar data indicate that Xavier also acquired individual tacts faster in the IP condition, as the cumulative trials to mastery were 120 in IP versus 151 in Delay. For Paula, the exemplar data yielded a contradictory result. Paula acquired individual exemplars cumulatively in 141 trials in Delay and 126 trials in IP. This result suggests that other mechanisms may have been responsible for either a more favorable IP result or a less favorable Delay result in the concept analysis. Possible explanations for this are elaborated in the Discussion section.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Xavier and Paula demonstrated individualized effectiveness with respect to a particular error-correction procedure, as can be seen in their exemplar results. Xavier demonstrated quicker acquisition in the IP condition, and Paula demonstrated quicker acquisition in the Delay condition. These results are consistent from Study 1, suggesting that error-correction procedures may be determined and then applied across learning tasks.</p>
<p>The exemplar data (as opposed to the “concept” data) are more representative of the learning attributed to the particular error-correction condition for at least two reasons. First, collapsing the data in the concept condition prevents analysis of slow or error-filled responding due to individual stimulus properties. For example, in a stimulus set of five pictures of a building, it may be that one picture of the building is preventing the learner from reaching mastery criterion. He or she may not be attending to the relevant features of the stimulus, therefore making repeated errors on that stimulus alone, preventing mastery of the concept. Another reason why exemplar data are preferred is that acquisition of a set of targets may be due to stimulus generalization, particularly in receptive language targets, where comparators are always present. The results of this study demonstrate that data analysis may be limited during multiple exemplar instruction, unless data are collected on the individual exemplars. This method of analysis will allow the practitioner to make a more thorough and timely analysis of problems that arise in discrete trial instruction.</p>
<p>Procedural efficiency noted within these studies is an important consideration in clinical practice of DTT. In both studies, the IP condition took approximately twice the length of time to implement than the Delay condition. A cost benefit analysis for the individual learner would need to be considered when selecting error-correction procedures. For example, although the Delay condition for Xavier during tact training took 31 more trials to meet mastery criterion over the IP condition, the difference is only 310 more seconds (approximately 5 min) of teaching time. Analysis of the teaching duration for Xavier reveals that the IP trials may have taken approximately 34 min of instruction, whereas the Delay condition may have only taken 25 min. Although the IP procedure took more time to implement, Xavier mastered the targets within fewer trials. Efficiency is an important issue in early intervention, as children have minimal time to achieve maximal gains. Future research needs to consider how to make procedural decisions to maximize efficiency whether it be defined in terms of time or number of trials.</p>
<p>The following limitations of these studies can be noted. The number of participants was only two in the second study, preventing maximum external validity. However, the results do suggest that individualization of error-correction practices may be warranted, replicating the findings of other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445511427973">Smith et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145445511427973">Worsdell et al., 2005</xref>). The benefit of the limited participants was the ability to extend the analysis across operants, providing some preliminary data to suggest that error-correction practices may be generalizable across tasks. Another limitation of the study was the multicomponent IP correction procedure. As the IP procedure included a shortened delay and a distractor trial, the specific feature of the condition responsible for improved results is difficult to determine.</p>
<p>Finally, analysis of the behavioral mechanisms involved in these conditions is not fully understood. Although it would seem that the IP trial functioned to maximize stimulus control due to the additional practice opportunity, the inclusion of the delay makes it difficult to prevent the conclusion that punishment + stimulus control would be responsible for the benefit in the IP condition. However, given that both conditions contained a delay component, if improved performance was seen, as with Xavier, then it might be suggested that it was the additional practice, or increased stimulus control, that contributed to this result.</p>
<p>Error-correction methods in DTT require further investigation. Based on these results, future studies should include exemplar data in applied studies within discrete trial training, punishment versus stimulus control relationships should be compared directly, and efficiency data should be examined in all early intervention studies. In addition, replication of the finding that error-correction procedures generalize across operants for individual learners is needed.</p>
