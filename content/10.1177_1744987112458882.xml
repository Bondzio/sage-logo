<p>The authors of this paper have provided a very timely, insightful and interesting approach to exploring the online access pattern to a specific genetic educational resource. The methods applied by the authors could easily be repeated with any online resource. This paper has exposed the valuable data that could be readily available to many readers.</p>
<p>This paper has highlighted to any individuals who regularly receive their own set of Google Analytics™ that they too have access to a rich data set. Exploration of their own Google Analytics™ could enhance their knowledge of visitor access to the information they provide on their own website. Before reviewing this paper the author of this review had never ventured beyond the dashboard summary page.</p>
<p>With advances in information technology, changes to local face to face education and financial constraints, many higher education institutes and National Health Service (NHS) education departments are embracing online learning to provide a more flexible learning environment. So, it is important for online resource developers to understand the flow of visitors and users of their materials in order to provide timely, accessible and usable educational resources. One finding from the exploration of this data demonstrated that there was global access of the resource. Understanding this type of information could lead to further international collaboration.</p>
<p>The ‘Telling Stories’ resource incorporates stories of several common and rarer genetic conditions. A user can choose a story from several aspects depending on their personal requirements. Each story has an audio file and/or a video: in addition, each story has a transcript which is printable, and educational activities are provided for each story. The resources are freely downloadable. Having access to this educational resource is very valuable for any health professional educator. In recent years, greater understanding of genetics and genomics has shown that they play a crucial role in many common conditions. These conditions are seen in everyday nursing practice and having knowledge of genetic principles and genetic conditions is no longer confined to specialist medicine. It is important that every effort is made to ensure that general nurses, specialist nurses, student nurses and all healthcare professionals are aware of such a resource.</p>
<p>A strength of this paper is in the quality and depth of exploration of the Google Analytics™ data. However, the limitations of the information that can be extrapolated from these data, make it difficult for the authors to strongly link to nurse education. However, although this paper is published within a nursing journal, genetic conditions can be complex and long term so that they require multi-professional collaboration. The ‘Telling Stories’ resource would be valuable to all health professionals and those in training to become health professionals. The findings shown in this paper will inform the resource developers as to where and how to enhance their website to strengthen their access to the wider health professional team.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors of this paper has indicated some limitations of the data available in Google Analytics™. This knowledge of the limitations, and the findings from exploring the available data, could then provide the basis to develop a data collection tool. The tool could be used to undertake a study using a robust research methodology to understand more deeply the areas of interest found in this exploration of data.</p>
