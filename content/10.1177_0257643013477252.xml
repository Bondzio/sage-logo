<p>The forests of the Sundarbans, located in the southernmost parts of West Bengal in India and south-western Bangladesh, remain synonymous with the Royal Bengal Tiger and, to some extent, the mangrove forests unique to South Asia. The principal strands in the story of the region centre around the contest between the tiger and the forest dweller—in other words, the conflict between and co-existence of man and nature. This struggle took the form of reclamation and of putting the forests to the plough. Down the ages there have been several efforts to reclaim forests and set up human habitation in this region. Before the advent of British rule in India most were individual efforts. Those made during British rule were largely successful in bringing in people of various origins into the region. Despite the slow pace of development compared to the rest of Bengal, the face of the Sundarbans then changed forever. Changes in settlement patterns and the stratification of society led to changes in human relations. The region suffered denudation and deforestation. In fact, ultimately as social stratification increased and exploitation intensified, tensions exploded in the form of the Tebhaga movement (1946).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>To naturalists, the Sundarbans—an intricate littoral web of islands and waterways bordering on the Bay of Bengal—is fascinating in its mysterious variety and offers a rich field of interest and enquiry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0257643013477252">1</xref></sup> The forests of the Sundarbans, located in the southernmost parts of West Bengal (in India) and south-western Bangladesh, remain synonymous with the Royal Bengal Tiger and to some extent, the distinctive and dense mangrove cover characteristic of the region. The Sundarbans figures in Bengal folklore as an unknown dark corner, attracting the more adventurous in search of livelihood. For the historical researcher, the problems and imperatives that this region poses stem largely from two sets of issues. First, our understanding of its agrarian structure, land tenure patterns and its economy at large, needs to go beyond the concerns and compulsions of colonial settlements and other reports. Second, the popular culture of the area, as also the nuances of its social formation/s, remain as yet imperfectly and inadequately analyzed.</p>
<p>The Sundarbans stretches from the Hooghly on the west to the Meghna, the estuary of the Ganga and Brahmaputra (Jamuna), on the east, and is spread across the southern portions of the districts of South 24 Parganas in West Bengal (India) and Khulna and Bakarganj in Bangladesh. The principal strands in the broad story of the region centre around the contest between the tiger and the forest dweller and forest-clearer; in other words, the conflict between, as also the co-existence of, man and nature. One of the forms that this struggle took was that of reclamation, of putting the forests to the plough, as it were.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0257643013477252">2</xref></sup> The geographical and ecological evidence would indicate that most of the area had, since time immemorial, been covered by dense and impenetrable forest, although pockets of habitation and patches of cultivation did spring up from time to time. The struggle between man and nature was a continuing one in the region. The Sundarbans with its unique physical features posed formidable, if not insurmountable, challenges to continued human habitation and settlement. Although instances of attempts at reclaiming forest can be found throughout its history, before the advent of the British such efforts were largely individual, isolated and sporadic in nature, and did not leave any lasting impression on the physical and geographical configurations of the region. Recent archaeological findings prove beyond doubt that ports and settlements had emerged and disappeared recurrently in deltaic Bengal in the last two thousand years. Clearings would spring up from time to time, only to be overtaken by some natural or political calamity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0257643013477252">3</xref></sup> The historical experience of the region was also distinctive. The year 1757 marked the beginning of political subjugation of Bengal by the British who were given the region of the 24 Parganas in perpetuity. By gaining the Diwani in 1765 the English East India Company acquired rights of revenue collection and thus came to control the economy of the province.</p>
<p>The close link between revenue collecting structures and land tenure in the pre-colonial agrarian order brought the British face to face with the question of existing land tenure arrangements during their efforts to set up effective land revenue systems in India.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0257643013477252">4</xref></sup> With their keen eye for profits, the English realized that the Sundarbans could not be ignored even if large parts of it were densely forested and far too marshy and saline for cultivation The British then began the process of pushing the forest back through clearance and settlement operations. Frontier expansion into the delta’s wetlands accelerated in the second half of the eighteenth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0257643013477252">5</xref></sup> The Permanent Settlement came into practice in Bengal in 1793 following many debates and experiments. This Settlement, originally derived from French physiocratic notions, introduced the rule of property for Bengal which led to the creation of landed estates. The Permanent Settlement succeeded in creating property rights and tax policy.</p>
<p>However the Sundarbans did not fall into the purview of the Permanent Settlement. The estates that had been recognized by the system bordered on the deltaic forests but the system could not be extended to the interiors. The Sundarbans, which was acquired in 1757 with the 24 Parganas, drew the attention of the English and reclamation was carried out further. The British began the process of pushing the forest back through clearance and settlement operations. The receding of the jungle followed the logic of revenue maximization under the cover of the rhetoric of improvement. The rationale behind it was that a land ‘covered with impenetrable forest, a hideous den of beasts and reptiles’, could only be improved by deforestation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0257643013477252">6</xref></sup> The question of reclaiming the Sundarban jungles was taken up by the then Collector General Claude Russel and by Tilmann Henckell, Magistrate of Jessore, in 1783. Their work in the Sundarbans forms part of a larger story of early British administration in India; the antecedents of which, in terms of ideology and practice, have been analyzed by historians like Eric Stokes and Ranajit Guha. It is strange that Russel and Henckel have so far escaped the scrutiny of scholars who have worked on the ideological apparatus associated with the Company Raj. While Russel and Henckel were considered pioneers in devising land settlements that engaged directly with land cultivators, they also articulated an extremely paternalist position in order to benefit their own administration. In a sense they straddled the two philosophies of the Bengal, Madras and Bombay systems. The understanding of agrarian and tenurial systems has been guided by two separate ideological biases: one that considered the primacy of rural intermediaries; while the other was based on the rights of peasant proprietors. The debate between revenue officials came to be known in terms of preferences between the Cornwallis or Monronian positions. It is also necessary to go beyond the rubric of the debates and try to understand the ground realities of each situation. In this contest, locality becomes central to the writing and understanding of revenue history.</p>
<p>The land reclamation experiment in the western district in the post famine years of late eighteenth century did not bear much resemblance with land reclamation in southern Bengal. In the Sundarbans the prevailing conditions of wilderness and frontier chiefly influenced colonial ideas on rural settlements. Initially the government found it difficult to identify the social categories which actually formed the intermediary landholding class in the frontier. This obviously led to a construction of dominant and privileged in rural society. The construction of new social classes that led to deep chasms between rich and poor finally found expression in the radical peasant movements of Tebhaga.</p>
<p>The present article is an attempt to analyze the history and complexities of land tenure systems in the Sunderbans, while examining the land reclamation policies and the systematic colonial penetration into rural India. Changes in settlement patterns led inevitably to the stratification of rural society and the gradual sub-infeudation of land ownership to the formation of the sharecropper class. Ultimately the region witnessed severe socio-economic conflict and peasant upheavals.</p>

<title>The Early Years of Reclamation</title>
<p>The reclamation of the Sundarban jungles acquired in 1757,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0257643013477252">7</xref></sup> began under the stewardship of the Collector, General Claude Russell in 1770 and was followed by Tilman Henckell, Magistrate of Jessore in 1783. The Sundarbans as a tract was ever-moving southward and had in its northern limits lands whose assessment required special knowledge and effort to ascertain the revenue potential of the areas. The zamindars of the north of the Sundarbans always claimed the forests as their land. Both Tilman and Russell came in conflict with the zamindars, who were eager to add to their estates all such waste lands as they could, to bring under cultivation. The Sundarbans as such did not form a separate district, with revenue, magisterial and civil jurisdiction of its own. The Collectors of the 24 Parganas, Jessore and Bakarganj exercised concurrent jurisdiction with the local Commissioner in the revenue matters of the Sundarbans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0257643013477252">8</xref></sup> The revenue of all Sundarban estates was paid into the collectorates mentioned above. The magisterial and civil jurisdictions of these districts included the Sundarbans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0257643013477252">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the initial period, leases were granted by the Collector General, Claude Russell, to individuals during 1770–73 on certain conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0257643013477252">10</xref></sup> Lands were generally to be held rent free for a period of seven years,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0257643013477252">11</xref></sup> after which they were subject to a yearly progressive assessment up to the full rate of 12, 8, or 6 annas per bigha.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0257643013477252">12</xref></sup> A fresh assessment would be conducted at the end of the rent-free term. Fresh measurements would take place once in every ten years and necessary adjustments in the rent would be made. The lands which came under this system of grants were known as <italic>patitabadi taluk</italic>s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0257643013477252">13</xref></sup> The measurements made in 1775–76 and 1779–80 were, however, not authentic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0257643013477252">14</xref></sup> The first proper measurement in the 24 Parganas took place in 1783. It was on the basis of this measurement that the decennial settlement of the district was introduced in 1790.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0257643013477252">15</xref></sup> The reclamation initiated by Claude Russell was carried out by Tilman Henckell whose name is associated with the development of this region. Legend has it that he was worshipped as a god by the dwellers of the Sundarbans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0257643013477252">16</xref></sup> Tilman Henckell was the first magistrate and judge of Khulna, Faridpur and Jessore, with powers to supervise the work of cultivation in the Sundarbans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0257643013477252">17</xref></sup> ‘His acquaintance’, writes James Westland, a late nineteenth century British I.C.S., ‘with every subject in his district was intimate’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0257643013477252">18</xref></sup> He wanted to adopt measures which would be beneficial for the ryots.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0257643013477252">19</xref></sup> ‘He was never unmindful of his employer’s mercantile interests, but he always set this before him as his duty to guard the then almost helpless natives from the oppressions to which they were subjected by the commercial officers of the company as well as by their own zamindars’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0257643013477252">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>While dealing with reclamation, Henckell had mainly two objectives in mind—to gain revenue from lands then utterly unproductive,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0257643013477252">21</xref></sup> and to create a reserve of rice as protection against famine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0257643013477252">22</xref></sup> To achieve his objectives Henckell submitted in December 1783 certain proposals to Governor General Warren Hastings, for granting leases of the forest lands. His plan was to lease out plots of land to ryots and create a large number of occupants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0257643013477252">23</xref></sup> A ryot would clear his own ‘little spot’, and hold it directly under the government, free from the interference of the zamindar or anyone invested with revenue collection. Cultivation would drive out the dacoits infesting this area and bring peace and security to the land. He felt that the scheme was feasible because the soil was fertile and the proximity to the markets of Calcutta was a great advantage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0257643013477252">24</xref></sup> He anticipated difficulties but thought that perseverance would help to overcome them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0257643013477252">25</xref></sup> He was also confident about the considerable increase in revenue from this hitherto uncultivated wasteland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0257643013477252">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Governor General approved the plan in February 1784, and Henckell revised the terms and fixed them by April 1784.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0257643013477252">27</xref></sup> ‘Population soon multiplied in the area’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0257643013477252">28</xref></sup> The natural products of the soil—timber, firewood, wax and shell lime—furnished the ryot with means of support during the period of clearing the ground.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0257643013477252">29</xref></sup> From April to October 1785, Henckell gave away 144 grants between the rivers Raimangal and Haringhata which was his area of jurisdiction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0257643013477252">30</xref></sup> The grants, with boundaries specified, were to be held free of revenue for the first three years, and at a rental of 2 <italic>anna</italic>s per <italic>bigha</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0257643013477252">31</xref></sup> in the fourth year on whatever land was then brought into cultivation; 4 <italic>anna</italic>s in the fifth year, 6 <italic>anna</italic>s in the sixth year and 8 <italic>anna</italic>s, the full rate, from the seventh year onwards. Provision was made for the assessment at these rates and a deduction of one-sixth was allowed for expenses on the land under cultivation.</p>
<p>An estimation was made that 600,000 <italic>bighas</italic> would be reclaimed from which the Government would derive a revenue of 7.5 lakh in seven years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0257643013477252">32</xref></sup> In March 1790, a statement was issued which expressed the progress of the scheme.

<p>The names of the grants were given in the same letter and almost all had names derived from those of the grantees—‘Kalidaspur’, ‘Muhammadabad’ and ‘Bhairabnagar’ and so forth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0257643013477252">33</xref></sup> One of the most important elements of Henckell’s scheme was the establishment of a convict colony, wherein convicts were given small grants of land. However, the most heinous offenders were exempt from the scheme and were shipped off to sea.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0257643013477252">34</xref></sup> Henckell went as far as to apply for drafts in the surrounding districts under his jurisdiction in the event that long term prisoners might come to settle in the area and work. Nothing further appeared to have been done and this part of the scheme proved to be a failure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0257643013477252">35</xref></sup></p>

<title>Challenges and Pressures</title>
<p>Henckell took active measures to ensure the success of the land reclamation scheme. In 1785–86, three government outposts were established in central positions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0257643013477252">36</xref></sup> and a <italic>gomasta</italic> was appointed with the charge of each, for the purpose of defining the boundaries of the Sundarbans and encouraging reclamation. The outposts were Henckellganj (named after Henckell and subsequently corrupted to Hingalganj), on the west bank of the Jabuna at its junction with the Kalindi which lay to the west of his jurisdiction; Chandkhali, on the river Kabadak in the middle; and Kachua, at the junction of the Baleswar and Bhairab rivers, in the east. The surrounding lands were cultivated and they were known as ‘khas abad’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0257643013477252">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1784, Henckell tried to demarcate the boundary between the zamindari lands and the Sundarban forest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0257643013477252">38</xref></sup> Henckell called upon the zamindars to put forward their objections if they had any, but the latter were silent in the nine months following the notice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0257643013477252">39</xref></sup> However, after the grantees got their leases and commenced reclamation, the zamindars claimed these lands lay in their estates. In 1786, he Committee of Revenue directed Henckell to inquire into these claims. Henckell’s inquiry was hindered by lack of knowledge of the boundaries and the previous inattention shown by the zamindars to the <italic>parwana</italic>s issued.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0257643013477252">40</xref></sup> Meanwhile, the zamindars were clandestinely extending their cultivation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0257643013477252">41</xref></sup> while Henckell was endeavouring to define their boundaries. He deputed <italic>vakil</italic>s<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0257643013477252">42</xref></sup> and others,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0257643013477252">43</xref></sup> to ascertain and fix the northern limits of the Sundarbans, and at his request the Committee of Revenue published fresh notices, allowing a fresh period of nearly two months in which the zamindars were ordered to present their claims on the lands.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0257643013477252">44</xref></sup> On 19 July 1786, Henckell drew up a list of the Parganas that bordered the Sundarbans. The party deputed to fix the boundary demarcated it by means of bamboos planted at short distances all along the banks of rivers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0257643013477252">45</xref></sup> The line was called Henckell’s Bansgari.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0257643013477252">46</xref></sup> The demarcation introduced a certain degree of certainty<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0257643013477252">47</xref></sup> and by July 1787, Henckell granted fresh leases for 13,000 bighas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0257643013477252">48</xref></sup> In April 1788, the government inquired how far the plan had been carried out and Henckell submitted his report in May 1788. Applications had been made for large quantities of land, but leases could not be granted as the boundary problem was still present.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0257643013477252">49</xref></sup> As a result of the confusion related to the boundary demarcation and the zamindars’ opposition, and also in some cases the neglect to ascertain the situation of grants before their bestowal, the members who had received <italic>patta</italic>s<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0257643013477252">50</xref></sup> in 1785 returned them and relinquished the scheme. Thus despite Henckells best efforts the problem persisted.</p>
<p>Henckell had estimated that the aggregate revenue of 34,000 <italic>bigha</italic>s leased would amount to ₹272,500 and expenses would be at ₹94,776; therefore the net gain to the government would be ₹177,724.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0257643013477252">51</xref></sup> But in reality, the expenses far exceeded the receipts. Though the objectives of the scheme had not been accomplished, Henckell felt that the union of the Raimangal Salt Agency in 1786 to his district had proved beneficial to the scheme.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0257643013477252">52</xref></sup> A last notice was issued by the Board of Revenue in July 1788, ordering the zamindars to define their boundaries within three months.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0257643013477252">53</xref></sup> The first collections were made in 1788–89 and the grantees, though in numerous instances out of possession, paid the revenue in the hope of regaining their lands. But when the quarrels with the zamindars persisted, and collections became impractical except in the few cases where there were no disputes,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0257643013477252">54</xref></sup> a large number of grants disappeared, until only about 25 remained in 1790.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0257643013477252">55</xref></sup> The plan, too, was modified. Instead of ryots holding lands directly under the government, as Henckell had suggested, the lessees acquired the name and status of talukdars, and their grants were called taluks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0257643013477252">56</xref></sup> The weaker lessees were eliminated, and only the influential people survived.</p>
<p>Henckell left Jessore in September 1789 and was succeeded by Rocke, who experienced much difficulty in completing the scheme. After reviewing it in March 1790, Rocke claimed that not only did the original scheme have defects but the lack of data to determine the territorial boundary of the Sundarbans had also led to its failure. The disputes between the zamindars and the Sundarbans talukdars could have been resolved if the former had clearly defined their own boundaries; however, by making ambiguous claims that all the land that stretched to the sea was theirs, they made any resolution impossible. This confused state of affairs ruined the whole scheme. The difficulties of the scheme (litigation and so on) and the discouraging pecuniary results (the expense having largely exceeded the receipts)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0257643013477252">57</xref></sup> induced the government, on the recommendation of the Board, to abandon it in August 1790.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0257643013477252">58</xref></sup> Thus the scheme failed. From 1792 onward, the sixteen taluks that remained came to be referred to as Henckell’s taluk.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0257643013477252">59</xref></sup> In connection with this scheme, Henckell set up a court at Chandkhali which he called ‘Cutcherry of Reference’, under one of his assistants, Foster. The court was established for trials of claims made by the zamindars and Foster was directed to collect government dues on wax and honey taken from the Sundarbans, as well as to take cognizance of civil and criminal matters arising within a radius of thirty miles from Chandkhali. He soon came into conflict with zamindars, who had set up toll stations upon the rivers to collect money from trading boats.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0257643013477252">60</xref></sup> There were eighteen of these stations within a circuit of fourteen miles from Chandkhali.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0257643013477252">61</xref></sup></p>

<title>A Benevolent Paternalist in the Frontier</title>
<p>Was Henckell caught in the cusp of a transition that saw the Company turn ‘sahib’ from ‘nawab’? Questions such as these seem inevitable when we analyze Henckell’s tenure and his attempts to deal with the problem of revenue collection in what was essentially a frontier society, but one that had already developed a measure of stratification. The complexity of the situation meant that Henckell had to balance paternalist authoritarian strategy with a more formal structure of revenue and judicial management. In retrospect, one may conclude that Henckell’s administrative tenure (1783–89) in the region had to accommodate various factors at work—problem of the dacoits and the hostility of the neighbouring zamindars. Various kinds of actions and interactions took place among them. The boundary dispute between the neighbouring zamindars and the grantees in this region was not easy to solve. The boundary line was in a state of flux as it was subject to periodic re-definition under the supervision of the various Collector Generals in this area. Henckell wanted to draw the attention of the Board regarding this problem but did not find adequate help forthcoming—the reason being attributed to the heavy expenses the project would entail. Henckell thus failed in his efforts. However, Henckell succeeded in making an important and positive impression in the minds of the local people—the ryots who had received lands on lease from the British Government and who were convinced that the Englishmen had their welfare in mind. Thus not for nothing did the people of this part of the Sundarbans consider Henckell to be their saviour and named the place Hingulgunge after him. Actually the significance of Henckell’s settlement lies in the fact that he was the pioneer in colonizing a part of the Sundarbans and set a precedent for later colonial rulers to follow. The task of reclaiming the jungle continued after Henckell and within the twentieth century there was a lot of visible transformation in the region.</p>

<title>Reclamation after Tilman Henckell</title>
<p>Henckell’s policy met with stiff resistance from the local zamindars who saw in it an attempt to encroach on their rights. They claimed that the cleared lands and indeed all the forest (the Sundarbans) belonged to them. This resulted in a permanent state of tension that persisted even in the next phase of reclamation when boundary disputes continued to remain the most important issue in agrarian relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0257643013477252">62</xref></sup> Henckell’s administration initially gave the peasant rent-free ownership of land. This brought in peasant settlers—mostly migrants from other Bengal districts—who cleared the land, constructed embankments and then planted rice in the alluvial soil.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0257643013477252">63</xref></sup> Initially, the population of the Sundarbans consisted entirely of marginalized people. ‘Nearly all the inhabitants’ of the Sundarbans were ‘either Hindus or Muslims’, according to Hunter. ‘There were, of course, a few Magh Buddhists and native Christians who also came up with missionary penetration of Portuguese and later of British power. The rest belonged to the Hindu and Muslim communities, mostly of low status’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0257643013477252">64</xref></sup> The Hindus were mainly of the following Sudra castes: Napit, Kaibarta, Kapali, Pod, Chandal, Jalia, Bagdi, Tior, Dhoba, Jogi, Suri and Kaora. Of these twelve castes, the Pods and the Chandals were the ‘most numerous’. Next came the Bagdis whom Hunter described as ‘rather numerous’. Thereafter came the Kapalis who were neither ‘numerous nor few’. The others were either ‘few or very few’ in number. All of these castes pursued a mix of occupations, such as ‘cultivation, wood-cutting and fishing’ as means of subsistence.</p>
<p>The largest group among the Muslims of the Sundarbans, according to Hunter, was the Shaikhs (cultivators and wood-cutters). The Sayyids and Pathans were higher in status than the Shaikhs. They were cultivators and were said to be ‘very few in number’. Besides these, Hunter noted, the Mirshikaris (hunters and fisherman), the Sapurias (snake-catchers and snake-charmers) and the Bediyas, all outcastes or gypsy tribes, had ‘professed Muhammadanism’. The native Christians, as recorded by Hunter, were all cultivators. All these people depended on the forest for their livelihood though they had to perpetually struggle against the hazards of nature. With the progress of reclamation more people came to settle in this area among whom were the Oriyas from Orissa and Bunas from Chota Nagpur.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0257643013477252">65</xref></sup> The Oriyas originally came as salt manufacturers and the Bunas were brought for the purpose of clearing jungles. ‘They brought their wives and families with them’ and settled down permanently as cultivators on their own account.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0257643013477252">66</xref></sup> People came from Hijli and other parts of the Midnapore district to the Sundarbans as permanent settlers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0257643013477252">67</xref></sup> The Santhal, Mundas, Oraons and Mahatos were the other settlers who came and settled in this region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0257643013477252">68</xref></sup> Oppression of the landlords and moneylenders prompted the tribals (Oraons, Mundas, Bhumijes and so on) to seek new fortunes in the Sundarbans where the terms of settlement were easy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0257643013477252">69</xref></sup> Settlers grew some vegetables for personal use and planted coconut, dates, mango and jackfruit on the embankments which protected the homestead from saline waters. The principal crop grown was the Aman paddy, sown in May or June and harvested in December or January.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0257643013477252">70</xref></sup> Sections of the forest which were not reclaimed provided the settlers with wood and grass for building their houses and also as fuel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0257643013477252">71</xref></sup> Thus it was seen that land reclamation was carried out substantially in this area and the East India Company tried hard to solve the problems relating to revenue and land ownership in Bengal. They introduced the Permanent Settlement in 1793 but this Settlement was not put into practice in the Sundarbans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0257643013477252">72</xref></sup> The Board of Revenue believed that even though large tracts in the Sunderbans had been reclaimed, the reclaimers were depriving the Government of their due revenue.

<title>The Colonial Rules for Reclamation, 1800 to 1870</title>
<p>Redefining the boundaries was carried out in a more determined manner when Lieutenant W.E. Morrison started surveying this area during 1811–14 with the help of special officers. In 1814, the Board of Revenue affirmed that the whole of the Sundarbans Tract (except areas covered by Henckell’s taluks and similar taluks in 24 Parganas called Patitabadi Mahals) was excluded from the zamindaris and acquired by the state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0257643013477252">74</xref></sup> It was considered important for the state to assert its claim to such surreptitiously reclaimed land.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0257643013477252">75</xref></sup> The enquiry conducted by Smelt (who was appointed the Assistant to the Collector of Jessore) in 1815 was an important operation to assess the excess land and unauthorized cultivation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0257643013477252">76</xref></sup> Operations began in the south, where claims were likely to be less complicated and gradually moved northwards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0257643013477252">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>Under Regulation IX of 1816, the Bengal government appointed a Special Commissioner of the Sundarbans whose primary task was to administer the process of land reclamation. The first Commissioner, D. Scott was charged with surveying reclaimed lands, assessing and collecting revenues and receiving adjudicating claims to land made by local zamindars.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0257643013477252">78</xref></sup> The government’s right to collect revenue from newly settled land or to claim the forest as public land continued to be challenged. In 1817, came Regulation 23 which firmly asserted the ‘inherent title’ of the government to a share of the produce of all land in the Sundarbans on the grounds that such land was termed ‘wasteland’ in 1793 and hence did not come under the purview of the Permanent Settlement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0257643013477252">79</xref></sup> Controversies however, did not end. Over the next few years the Commissioner of Sundarbans surveyed all cultivated land, particularly within the jurisdiction of 24 Parganas, which had encroached upon the forest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0257643013477252">80</xref></sup> The purpose was not to appropriate the land but to collect revenue. Later in 1822–23 all forestlands were divided into blocks and numbered with the aid of Morrison’s map. Morrison was the surveyor in this region and carried out his work from 1811 to 1814. This was the beginning of the Sundarban Lots.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0257643013477252">81</xref></sup> Ownership claims still continued to be made on the basis of ‘ancient rights’ and it was only in 1828 that the government proclaimed the Sundarbans to be the property of the state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0257643013477252">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>The enactment of Regulation III of 1828 was followed by the definition of the Sundarbans boundary which was carried out by William Dampier and Alexander Hodges.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0257643013477252">83</xref></sup> The regulation and the demarcation of the Dampier–Hodges line represented the end of the first phase in Sundarban’s settlement history. All lands brought under cultivation between the Permanent Settlement and 1828 were naturally shown outside the Dampier–Hodges (D–H) line of forest. Subsequently these areas formed an integral part of the Sundarbans administration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0257643013477252">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, colonial policies in regard to the Sundarbans’ reclamation process moved through several phases. The Bengal government consistently became more aggressive and interventionist. In the course of this period official policy gradually turned away from bestowing huge land grants on speculative entrepreneurs, and favoured smaller grants to less wealthy applicants who would actually manage or even cultivate the lands themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0257643013477252">85</xref></sup> These changes partly reflected wider currents in official policy and ideology and partly the increasing costs and difficulties of reclaiming remote Sundarbans tracts. In 1829, the Bengal government set out terms for grants to be opened in the newly demarcated Sundarban forest. Land grants, free of any revenue demands for twenty years, were made available to individuals who had the means to carry out reclamation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0257643013477252">86</xref></sup> One-fourth of the land granted had to be cleared and put under cultivation within five years. At the end of the twenty year period, three-quarters of the land became liable for land revenue at moderate fixed rates. In 1844, an interim report showed slow progress: 95 persons had taken up 138 surveyed tracts totalling 491,000 bighas in 24 Parganas and Bakarganj districts. Most of these speculators hired woodcutters and labourers from Hazaribagh or Magh immigrants from the eastern coasts to develop their land plots.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0257643013477252">87</xref></sup> After five years, only one-tenth (49,000 bigha) of the granted land had been placed under active cultivation (usually wet rice) by the new tenants. The results did not improve and eight years later, in 1852, only a few additional allotments had been taken up in the Sundarbans forests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0257643013477252">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the whole, the pace of reclamation work varied according to individual character and circumstances. The government tended to view favourably those grantees who had really exerted themselves to fulfil the condition of their grants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0257643013477252">89</xref></sup> In 1853, the government announced revised rules for land grants in the Sundarbans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0257643013477252">90</xref></sup> These rules continued to favour prosperous Bengali and British land developers. The areas surveyed and made available for reclamation were generally large and the grantees continued to meet all expenses of clearing and constructing embankments on their tracts. The most important revision lay in reduced land revenue rates which made the venture more attractive. For the next two decades, clearance and settlement proceeded steadily, though not as quickly as the state would have liked.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0257643013477252">91</xref></sup></p>
<p>Next came the Wasteland Rules of 1863 that provided for disposal of wastelands—either by selling them outright, exempt from land revenue, or by allowing landowners to redeem their existing land revenue against a single, one-time payment. This policy aimed to settle Europeans in India.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0257643013477252">92</xref></sup> The granting out of land was suspended as the price was very high, with only capitalists reaping the advantage. Applicants for land, therefore, did not prefer the grant rules of 1863 as it was not possible to pay such a high amount at one go. The people wished to go back to the 1853 rules as the land revenue rates were lower.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0257643013477252">93</xref></sup> Until 1870, the rules of 1853 and 1863 had resulted in little additional reclamation. The area leased till 1870, was 946 square miles, with an ultimate revenue of ₹177,458. In the report of the Commissioner (1873) the total area of the Sundarbans was divided into four categories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0257643013477252">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The first century of British colonial rule in lower Bengal had but a minimal impact on the delta. Only 14 per cent of the total area was cleared and cultivated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0257643013477252">94</xref></sup> By 1870, there was stagnation in land reclamation. Government attention was diverted towards the preservation of forests. Forestry was emphasized, leading to management and conservation of wood resources. The Sundarbans was a very important source for timber and fuel wood for the people of south Bengal. The stagnation in land reclamation rules intensified in 1874, after a policy decoration by Sir Richard Temple, the then Lieutenant Governor of Bengal. Shortly after assuming office, Temple visited the Sundarbans on tour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0257643013477252">95</xref></sup> He was struck by the value of the forest products of the wetlands. The Sundari trees were used for carpentry and timber work and the shrubs for fuel. The Sundari forests supplied wood for boat-building to the 24 Parganas, Jessore, Bakarganj, Noakhali and other districts and also furnished wood for purposes of domestic architecture. Temple decided that the tract should be preserved for the supply of wood, timber and fuel for southern Bengal. ‘Reclamation,’ he wrote, ‘is not wanted there. In some places the substitution of rice-fields for jungle may be desirable. But in this particular case the ground already bears produce which is more valuable to Bengal than rice.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0257643013477252">96</xref></sup> He merely supported reclamation to the extent required to make the forest tract accessible for human use. Richard Temple’s policy resulted in the creation of the reserved and protected forest in Jessore and the 24 Parganas, and not unnaturally, the Board of Revenue suspended its endeavours to formulate suitable reclamation rules. The classification of Reserved or Protected forests was an intervention designed to protect the Sundarban forests against the market forces and reclamation pressure. The Sundarban forests became and remained a production unit run as a state monopoly in lower Bengal.</p>

<sec id="section7-0257643013477252">
<title>Regulations from 1878 to 1915</title>
<p>By 1878, however, the forest reserve limits had been fixed. Since a considerable portion of wastelands had been excluded and was still available for reclamation, the Board again engaged itself with the task of formulating reclamation rules. A set of rules was submitted by the Commissioner of the Sundarbans, on 22 September 1877.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0257643013477252">97</xref></sup> The Government of Bengal insisted on a reference to the Conservator of Forest, in order to prevent sporadic reclamation. In 1879, the revised rules were accepted by the government and new wasteland rules for the Sundarbans were promulgated (published in the Calcutta Gazette on 12 November 1879).</p>
<p>Blocks of 200 acres or more were leased for forty years to large capitalists who were prepared to spend time and money in developing them. Plots not exceeding 200 acres were leased to small capitalists for clearance by cultivators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0257643013477252">98</xref></sup> The government reserved for itself all rights to mineral resources. In the case of having more than one applicant for the same land, the sale would be decided by auction amongst the applicants. These regulations opened up the Sundarbans to direct land claims by wealthier peasant farmers. Larger speculators and smaller landlords were offered long-term forty year leases and rights to leased lands were inheritable and transferable, provided land taxes were paid. Between 1870 and 1904 the officially recognized area of the Sundarbans diminished by 13.3 per cent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0257643013477252">99</xref></sup> The reduction of land reflected the level of cultivation and settlement as new lands were leased. However many grantees, beset by financial problems, also chose to abandon their lands. Every year revenue officials had to initiate legal action to rescind grants whose holders had failed to clear and cultivate successfully as per the required proportions. Cyclones and storms discouraged many peasant farmers and grant holders. However, despite setbacks, the agricultural economy of lower Bengal displayed remarkable strength and resilience in this period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0257643013477252">100</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bakarganj district rather than 24 Parganas or Khulna was the area most favoured by settlers. After 1879, a stream of settlers poured into the fertile lands of Bakarganj. Here the conditions for rice cultivation were generally more favourable than in either of the neighbouring districts. Land was higher and better drained. Embankments were required to prevent salt water from flowing into the new fields but they needed only to be of modest height. The waters in Bakarganj streams tended to be less saline, with direct access to the main river. As a result, the district was over 90 per cent occupied and reclaimed by over 90 per cent in 1904. In parts of the eastern Sundarbans, clearings and cultivation extended almost to the sea face.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0257643013477252">101</xref></sup></p>
<p>Keen to utilize the district’s lands to the fullest extent possible, the British government in Bengal adopted a radically new approach to reclamation. In 1903 the Board of Revenue appointed a Committee which decided to abolish the lease system to capitalist farmers and instead deal directly with the ryots. Experimental <italic>ryotwari</italic> settlements, ranging from ten to seventy five bighas were let out to actual cultivators,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0257643013477252">102</xref></sup> along with a financial commitment from the government to assist with the construction of tanks and embankments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0257643013477252">103</xref></sup> In return the ryots would pay revenue directly to the government. The government also chose to offer reclamation loans and to invest in the construction of irrigation tanks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0257643013477252">104</xref></sup> For this new experiment, the Bengal government aimed at the last remaining tracts of undisturbed forest in the lower delta of Bakarganj and 24 Parganas. It was proposed that Fraserganj (24 Parganas) should form the first centre for <italic>ryotwari</italic> colonization. It was estimated that the total cost of reclamation, including embankments, clearance of jungle, construction and maintenance of drinking water tanks and advances to cultivators, would not exceed ₹23,000 per square mile or approximately ₹22 per bigha. However, to those experienced in Sundarban reclamation, Fraserganj seemed a difficult area to experiment with since the reclamation of the whole area at the time involved an enormous outlay of capital.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0257643013477252">105</xref></sup></p>
<p>The work of reclamation commenced in the year 1904–05 under the Sundar, who was Deputy Collector and Settlement Officer in the Sundarbans from 1905. Twenty five colonists had settled on the cleared portion of the island by the end of the first year’s work. Applications for settlement in this area poured in. Huge expenditure was incurred for this scheme.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0257643013477252">106</xref></sup> The abnormal expenditure and the failure to show any adequate returns for the enormous outlay soon disheartened the government. In September 1909, the Government of Bengal finally decided to abandon the scheme, mainly for financial reasons, and proposed that Fraserganj should be leased out under the rules of 1879 subject to certain alterations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0257643013477252">107</xref></sup> Later, the lease of the Fraserganj government estate was given to Maharaj Manindra Chandra Nandi of Cossimbazar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0257643013477252">108</xref></sup> This change in the Fraserganj policy was severely criticized. According to many, the Fraserganj scheme despite its extravagance, would have been profitable for the government in the long run. It is worth mentioning that in 1904 the Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Revenue and Agriculture, wrote ‘In this connection I am to forward the papers which explain the system under which state land has been so successfully colonized in the Punjab, and to ask that the rules and conditions embodied in them may be taken into consideration in framing the new lease rule for the Sundarbans.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0257643013477252">109</xref></sup> During the second half of the nineteenth century, Punjab experienced significant economic growth under British rule. The ensuing agricultural settlement transformed the previously barren lands of Punjab into one of the most important regions of commercial agriculture in South Asia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0257643013477252">110</xref></sup> The British regarded the agricultural prosperity that they had brought to the Punjab as one of the crowning achievements of their participation in Indian history. They therefore wanted to adopt similar rules in the Sundarbans for the development of the region. The construction of an extensive network of canals in Punjab was the story behind the success, whereas natural hazards, salinity and flood hindered the progress in the Sundarbans. However, this did not stop the process of reclamation which was carried out extensively where large forest tracts were converted to rice fields.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0257643013477252">
<title>Progress and Change</title>
<p>As a result of these policies of reclamation the area was divided in the north-south, north-east and south-east into <italic>abad</italic> and <italic>patitabad.</italic> Certain tracts were notified as forests within the reclaimed areas. Reclamation and settlement spread into the marshes and jungles of the Sundarbans and was especially fast in the Bakarganj area. A specially appointed colonization officer, armed with wide powers and resources, favoured settlement of the Maghs who were engaged in salt smuggling in this area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0257643013477252">111</xref></sup> Some of the most remote portions of the Sundarban jungles were transformed into fertile rice fields. Schools, dispensaries, post offices, markets and co-operative credit societies came up. The erstwhile ‘turbulent’ Maghs became worthy peasant farmers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0257643013477252">112</xref></sup></p>
<p>Government officials hailed this new policy a success. Bakarganj was almost entirely reclaimed and cultivated as early as 1910. In 24 Parganas and Khulna, new policies prevented wholesale leasing of the remaining wetland forests. The year 1915 was the turning point in the 24 Parganas. The change in policy was initially due to administrative changes of 1912, which enabled the revenue authorities to apply the experience gained in Bakarganj to the western districts. In 1915, C.J. Stevenson-Moore, after an extensive tour through the Sundarbans, wrote a note on the development of the area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0257643013477252">113</xref></sup> Describing the success achieved in the colonization of the Bakarganj Sundarbans he proceeded to show that the failure of the Fraserganj experiment should not justify abandoning the <italic>ryotwari</italic> system in Khulna and the 24 Parganas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-0257643013477252">114</xref></sup> He objected to a revival of the system of lease to lotdars and instead propounded a scheme for <italic>ryotwari</italic> colonization. In forwarding the draft rules to the government, it was proposed that while <italic>ryotwari</italic> settlements should be the ordinary method of reclamation, the Board of Revenue should be also authorized to make settlements with capitalists in some particular cases. The Government of India accepted this proposal and the new rules were published. These rules were enforced soon afterwards and ryotwari settlements became the norm for reclamation in the whole of the Sundarbans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0257643013477252">115</xref></sup></p>
<p>A seventy year history of land use for the three districts in which the Sundarbans are situated (24 Parganas, including the city of Calcutta, in West Bengal, India and Bakarganj and Khulna in Bangladesh) reveals massive transformation of the land. Between 1880 and 1950, cultivated land in these districts expanded by 45 per cent. Natural processes added to the alluvial wetland formations along the water channels and at the sea face of the Bay of Bengal. During this period, the human population of these districts increased from 5.6 million to 12.9 million persons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-0257643013477252">116</xref></sup> Large-scale land clearance occurred between 1940 and 1950, resulting in the increase of cropland by 23 per cent. This reflects a response to two large-scale traumatic events—the Bengal famine in 1943 and the massive movement of refugees in both directions across the newly created India–Pakistan border following the 1947 Partition.</p>

<title>Changing Landscapes and Formation of Undertenures</title>
<p>Visible changes were seen in the landscape of the Sundarbans. After reclamation the Sundarbans displayed a landscape of embanked paddy fields and farmsteads. There appeared fertile homestead clusters and their gardens of areca palm mingled with coconut and tamarind. The most enthusiastic proponents of expansion into the Sundarbans were the district officers charged with collecting revenue from agricultural production and with peacekeeping duties. One model was that of the improving, energetic landlord who would invest both energy and capital into reclaiming the wastelands of the Sundarbans. W.W. Hunter offered an account of the growth of a river port called Morrelganj on the Panguchi River in Jessore (later Khulna) district. Two Englishmen, Morrel and Lightfoot, purchased an estate from the Government of Bengal in 1849 and proceeded to clear and settle the ‘dense Sundarban Forest’ along fourteen miles of riverfront.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn117-0257643013477252">117</xref></sup> The partners employed ten thousand labourers brought from nearby Bakarganj and the costs averaged ₹20 per hectare of cleared land.</p>
<p>After the initial phase, many of the original workers settled on assigned plots in the estate lands and took up rice cultivation under fixed rents. The Morrelganj tenants produced 1,128 metric tons of rice and 261 tons of betel nuts for shipping out in the half dozen river boats leased by the partners each year. In recognition of its commercial importance, the Government of Bengal classified Morrelganj as a river port in 1869, set out buoys and markers and assigned a customs officer to collect excise duties on the exported commodities. Morrelganj may have been one ideal model, but it was not typical. Bengali investors in land were more than willing to apply for and purchase leases for land to be reclaimed from the wastelands of the Sundarbans. However, they were less inclined to take up the direct management of large estates. Landlords might organize and fund the clearing of a portion of their leases, but rarely the entire tract. Usually they sold the rights to sub-lessees who were either interested in organizing and financing tracts of lands or who would sublet their leases in turn to smaller operators. There is a clear description of the organizational structure of this tenurial system by Ram Sankar Sen, Deputy Collector of Jessore, in 1873:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn118-0257643013477252">118</xref></sup>
<disp-quote>
<p>As soon as a Sundarban grant is settled with an applicant called <italic>abad talukdar</italic>, the land is apportioned by him among subordinate tenants called <italic>haoladars</italic>, who undertake the clearance. To keep the damages caused by wild animals limited to the furthest edge of the farm the <italic>haoladar</italic> needs to create buffer farms and that need leads him to sublet portions of his holding to other tenants called <italic>nim haoladars</italic>. The <italic>nim haoladar</italic> undertakes the same process of clearing. During the years of reclamation three men are there in the field to organize the whole operation. They are the <italic>talukdars</italic> who financed, the <italic>haoladar</italic> who directly engaged himself in clearing and the <italic>nim haoladar</italic> who cultivated land.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>J.C. Jack outlined the normal hierarchy from estate holder down to 160 petty tenure holders who in turn collected rents from 360 cultivating peasants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn119-0257643013477252">119</xref></sup>
<disp-quote>
<p>Typical Descent from the Estate Holder to Petty Tenure Holders</p>
<p>Zamindar with an estate of 2000 acres and paying a revenue of Rs 200</p>
<p>4 Talukdars each with a subordinate <italic>taluk</italic> of 500 acres and paying a rent of Rs 100 to the zamindar</p>
<p>20 Osat Talukdars each with a tenure of 100 acres and each paying a rent of Rs 50 to one of the 4 <italic>talukdars</italic></p>
<p>80 Haoladars each with a tenure of 25 acres and paying a rent of Rs 25 to one of the 20 <italic>talukdars</italic></p>
<p>160 Nim Haoladars each with a tenure of 12.5 acres and paying a rent of Rs 20 to one of the 80 <italic>haoladars</italic> and he has sublet in turn to two cultivators in an ordinary raiyati lease stipulating a payment of Rs 15 rent apiece.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All contemporary observers agree that even in this extreme case, the Bengal tenurial system did not inhibit, but rather encouraged reclamation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn120-0257643013477252">120</xref></sup> From one perspective it permitted investment in land by smaller investors. They stood to gain modestly and steadily from their investments without running any overwhelming risk. They were not required to spend energy or possess managerial skill to make a profit. The system was virtually self-sustaining. It enabled the cultivators to clear forests, build embankments and plant paddy with the realization that they would eventually possess ownership rights even if they were at the bottom of the chain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn121-0257643013477252">121</xref></sup> When opportunities for land reclamation diminished in various parts of Bakarganj, the pattern of chained tenures did not end. Rather they became a form of liquid investment that could be freely bought and sold.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn122-0257643013477252">122</xref></sup> One aspect of the system was that most of the land holding remained concentrated in the hands of absentee land holders who stayed in Calcutta but never directly got involved in reclamation and development of the region. <italic>Abad</italic> operations (cultivating the jungle lands) were often led by zamindars themselves in <italic>benami</italic> (not in their own names). The practice of <italic>benami</italic> engagement for a <italic>patitabad</italic> grant flourished in the first half of the nineteenth century. Thus in 1918, the collector of Bakarganj reported that in his district ‘all native staff working at the revenue and judicial offices posess land grants benami’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn123-0257643013477252">123</xref></sup></p>
<p>A study of the occupational background of successful applicants for land from 1861–71 in Bakarganj district shows that, out of 1141 <italic>patitabad</italic> grants made during the period, 792 were held by legal practitioners and the rest were distributed among landholders, tenure holders, merchants and traders, <italic>zamindari amla</italic> and so on. From the 1880s the government distributed grants to the educated Muslims and Hindu <italic>bhadralok</italic> (gentlemen). The <italic>bhadralok</italic> allottees in this region did not move to the location in person but instead created under-ryoti tenures to cultivate those lands.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn124-0257643013477252">124</xref></sup> It would be important to identify those tenure holders and other participants who actually applied to undertake <italic>abad</italic> activities in person. The talukdars and their local holders were on the look out for agriculturists. Land hungry cultivators came in contact with the <italic>abad haoladar</italic>s and at first held lands from them on easy terms. The success of one group of colonizing peasants persuaded their counterparts from other villages to migrate and settle on the cleared estates. Upper caste members came last of all. L.R. Fawcus in his settlement report of Khulna is of the opinion that the untouchables (Pods and Namasudras) had ‘cleared the way converting the jungle into paddy land’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn125-0257643013477252">125</xref></sup></p>
<p>The population of Bengal and in particular deltaic Bengal rose at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Two factors, the rise in prices and population growth, contributed to an acceleration of the reclamation movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn126-0257643013477252">126</xref></sup> Similar economic stimuli had launched a large-scale reclamation movement in Britain during the period of the Napoleonic Wars. But what is remarkable is that while reclamation in Britain was accomplished by capitalist farmers, in Bengal it was achieved by a long chain of sub-infeudatory interests. Reclamation through hierarchic tenurial interests was encouraged by the Mughal Government and this tradition continued into the British period. It could not be otherwise, because agriculture in Bengal, unlike that of Britain, was still conducted not primarily for the market but for subsistence, and it was carried out not through paid labour, but through unpaid family labour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn127-0257643013477252">127</xref></sup> The landless daily labourers who were brought into this region with the temptation that they would own their own land very soon became <italic>bhag chasi</italic>s or sharecroppers. During the nineteenth century, as sub-infeudation expanded, the numbers of share-croppers on the <italic>khas</italic> lands of tenure-holders increased.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn128-0257643013477252">128</xref></sup> In 24 Parganas the men of substance who had leased government Lots in the Sundarbans for reclamation were somewhat similar to the big jotedars (rich tenants) of the north. Lots were large land holdings, held at easy rents that were subject to forfeiture unless all clearance conditions were fulfilled. Often speculators and land-jobbers obtained such leases and sublet them on cash payments with the result that the work of reclamation was actually carried out by small peasant cultivators paying rack-rents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn129-0257643013477252">129</xref></sup> The process of dispossession of what was initially a relatively free peasantry and their conversion into near-serfs paid with a share of the crop began in these areas and gathered pace during the first half of the twentieth century. The cultivators in the Sundarbans were generally an oppressed lot. What worsened things for them was that the leases or tenure holders stayed away from the estates which were run by unscrupulous and ruthless agents (<italic>naib</italic>s) who subjected cultivators to oppressive demands. Besides rent, these hapless people were made to pay a number of illegal taxes. From the late eighteenth century to the twentieth century the condition of the peasantry was dismal and their rights non-existent. This simmering discontent finally resulted in the Tebhaga movement before Indian independence.</p>

<title>The Uprising at Kakdwip</title>
<p>The Kakdwip Movement, a part of the All Bengal Tebhaga Movement,supported by the Bengal Provincial Kisan Sabha, saw the peasants of Kakdwip rise in revolt against their traditional oppressors in a bid to establish their rights. The main objective of the movement was to establish the Tebhaga principle, that is, two-thirds share of the produce for the sharecropping cultivators instead of the customary half,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn130-0257643013477252">130</xref></sup> thereby shifting the profits in favour of the cultivator vis-à-vis the landholder. The growth of sharecropping in the 1930s was deeply moulded by the colonial context. The history of tenancy legislation and agrarian relations during this period of British rule reveals the erosion of sharecroppers’ rights, the use of share contracts to evade legal constraints and the increasing power of the landlords. Prior to the 1930s sharecropping was a significant form of tenancy that was characterized by insecurity and oppression, with secondary structures of exploitation that maximized subordination, and maintained sharecroppers in a state of dependency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn131-0257643013477252">131</xref></sup> During the 1930s however, the world economic depression and the Bengal Famine of 1943 were important factors to further increase the numbers of sharecroppers. At the same time, there was an increase in the number and types of people entering the world of sharecroppers. While traditional zamindars, <italic>bhadralok</italic> and large tenure holders had always had some land sharecropped to gain an income in kind, other categories of wealthy people, mainly consisting of money lenders and traders, were becoming increasingly interested in becoming landlords. In addition the jotedar class emerged from the more affluent ryots who turned to sharecropping on purchased land.</p>
<p>Cultivators were economically and socially exploited and discriminated against. They were not allowed to enter or pass by the landlord’s house or cutchery (office) wearing shoes, carrying an umbrella or riding a horse. Once inside the compound, the sharecropper had to sit on the ground or on a seat lower than that of the landlord. The social and economic authority of the landlords was enforced through physical coercion. Tortures ranged from beating with shoes to murder. Cultivators suffered from physical, social as well as economic abuse at the hands of their landlords.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn132-0257643013477252">132</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Movement</title>
<p>The first winds of change could be felt in the mid-1930s when the political parties started taking interest in the conditions of the Sundarbans peasants. Members of the Communist Party of India (CPI) joined other Left groups and individuals in forming the All India Kisan Sabha in April 1936, and set up the Bengal Provincial Kisan Sabha (BPKS) in March 1937.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn133-0257643013477252">133</xref></sup> Since peasant organizations were now reasonably well established in a few villages, the Bengal Provisional Kisan Sabha gave its ‘Tebhaga Call’ in September, 1946. Since <italic>tebhaga</italic> was in the interest of sharecropping cultivators, the peasants of Budakhali of whom about 89 per cent were sharecroppers, were the first to respond. The ‘Tebhaga Chai’ slogan became so popular that the movement spread in all parts of the area. In Kakdwip, the movement became active in the following areas: Munsif’s lot, Fatikpur, Bamannagar, Bisalakhmipur, Dwariknagar, Berar lot, Sibrampur, Radhanagar, Durganagar, Chandanpiri, Layalganj, Haripur, Rajnagar, Debnibas and from Lakshmipur to Fraserganj. The cultivators were organized, almost spontaneously, under the leadership of the Kisan Samiti.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn134-0257643013477252">134</xref></sup></p>
<p>Inspired by the Kakdwip movement, the peasants of Mathurapur and Sagar Island adopted the Tebhaga struggle. Along with the <italic>tebhaga</italic>, other slogans raised were <italic>Zamindari Khatam Karo</italic> (abolish zamindari), <italic>Nij Khamare Dhan Tolo</italic> (store paddy in your own yards), <italic>Samasta Julum Bandho Karo</italic> (stop all oppression), <italic>Bhag Jamir Rasid Chaii</italic> (give receipt of the record of rights on returned land), and so on. It was the fight against <italic>zulum</italic> (oppression) more than the demand for the <italic>tebhaga</italic> that dominated the initial phase of the movement in Kakdwip.</p>
<p>The peasants refused to perform <italic>begar</italic> (work without money) of any sort and their defiance of the landlords’ unbridled authority gave an emancipatory context to the movement. This liberating nature of the agitation and the general awakening, particularly the discontinuation of <italic>begar</italic> and the exemplary acts of retaliation, such as, forcing the landlord’s men to apologize publicly for specific acts of oppression or beating an oppressive jotedar with shoes, inspired a large number of agricultural labourers in Kakdwip to join the uprising.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn135-0257643013477252">135</xref></sup></p>
<p>In other parts of Bengal too, the movement was seen as a protest against oppressive landlords and this common cause united the landless labourers with the sharecroppers. Revolutionary <italic>tebhaga</italic> songs were composed and sung to spread the message. Everywhere in Kakdwip, Kisan Samitis emerged, each with a working committee of around seven members and each decision was taken with the full consent of the villagers. At first the Kisan Samitis were dependent on the Communist Party for funds, but later they sought to become self-reliant, collecting funds locally in the form of a couple of seers of paddy per bigha and an annual subscription of one <italic>anna</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn136-0257643013477252">136</xref></sup></p>
<p>Generally leadership and decision-making lay with the Communist party cadre. However the Communists had to take stock of local wishes and sentiments. In 1947 when the sharecroppers did not want to follow the advice from Party leaders that they keep their grain with the jotedars, the Communist party members had to climb down from their position. Two distinct factions emerged within the Tebhaga movement: the top leaders who upheld peasant causes and the local leadership who were generally direct victims of oppression. At the initial stage of organization the leaders of the first group were less effective and had made little direct contribution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn137-0257643013477252">137</xref></sup> It was the local leadership that was most effective in the formative stage. Another fact regarding leadership was that it was the poorer sections of the peasantry which constituted the leading cadres of the movement. The relations between the two sections of leadership were, however, always cordial.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn138-0257643013477252">138</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sharecroppers assembled in their hundreds in the harvesting fields of those landowners who were unwilling to concede to their demands. The peasants armed themselves with traditional weapons, namely, <italic>lathi</italic>, <italic>vali</italic> and arrows, while women depended on <italic>jhanta</italic> (brooms), <italic>bonti</italic> (sharp cutters), sand and chilli powder. In the harvesting session of 1946–47, peasants seized the paddy and stacked it either in their own <italic>khamar</italic> or the panchayat <italic>khamar</italic>. The unity, militancy and organizational strength of the sharecroppers forced the landlords to concede to the peasants’ demands. In those districts even where the <italic>tebhaga elaka</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn139-0257643013477252">139</xref></sup> had been achieved, sharecroppers continued their struggle against landlords and the authorities. In the 24 Parganas, sharecroppers took their two-thirds share of the crops. In Diamond Harbour, smaller landlords conceded to the <italic>tebhaga</italic> demand although others did not. Officials attempted to reconcile the parties but they failed to reach a compromise. Incidents continued as sharecroppers took their share from the <italic>khamar</italic>. At Bemajur (or Demuja) in Sandeshkhali, peasants were detained in a landlord’s cutchery for implementing <italic>tebhaga</italic>. The police were summoned to make arrests and when a crowd attempted to rescue these people, it led to firing in which seven peasants were killed and others wounded. Subsequently, more armed forces were called in and mass arrests were made.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn140-0257643013477252">140</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Government had conceded the <italic>tebhaga</italic> demand and the Bengal Bargadars Temporary Bill was notified in Calcutta Gazette on 22 January 1947.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn141-0257643013477252">141</xref></sup> However this Bill remained on paper only. The agents paid by the landlords were successful in preventing the sharecroppers from harvesting the fields. False cases were instituted with the help of the police force and goons. More cases, both civil and criminal, were instituted against militant cadres and peasant leaders.</p>
<p>The Revolt continued into Independence and many leaders like Jatin Maiti were arrested. But the peasants could not be subdued. Defying the prohibitory order they assembled in the fields with their traditional weapons for harvesting. Some were deputed to keep watch on the police and they blew into conch shells to alert the peasants when police were approaching. The peasants however were unable to protect their harvest due to the combined attack launched by the landlords, <italic>lathial</italic>s and the armed police. The Government of West Bengal declared the whole area under the jurisdiction of Kakdwip and Sagar Police Station as ‘disturbed’. Repression was let loose; crops of the sharecroppers were destroyed and the movement ended in January 1948.</p>
<p>A remarkable feature of the movement was the large-scale participation of women. Their courage and sacrifice are worth mentioning. It was found that out of seventy families of Budakhali, women of twenty five families provided leadership and formed their <italic>nari bahini</italic> or women’s brigade. This awakening of rural women at Kakdwip would give a new dimension to future struggles in the state. Apparently, Tebhaga failed. But did it really? The immediate demand went unrealized but what perhaps was more important was the eager response of a people to wrest their due. This definitely contributed towards the agrarian land-reform laws of subsequent years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn142-0257643013477252">142</xref></sup></p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>Land reclamation in the Sunderbans was thus a complex process involving constant changes in British policy. The clearing of the Sundarban forests with its intertwining trees and an impenetrable undergrowth of brushwood was always considered to be an arduous job, not only because of the number of labourers required but also due to the danger from wild beasts. Another obstacle was the surprisingly quick growth of the reeds (<italic>nal</italic>) which would spring back as soon as the land was rested. The soil had to be cultivated for at least ten to twelve years in succession before the danger finally disappeared. The danger from cyclones was also one of the major problems faced by the early colonizers as was the salinity of the soil. Despite all these difficulties land reclamation was carried out vigorously in the area. The area changed completely as settled cultivation took over forest areas.</p>
<p>The story of the Sundarbans reclamation resulted in sub-infeudation of land and the creation of new agrarian classes, largely the sharecroppers or <italic>bhag chasis</italic>. These peasants, subjected to exploitation by land owners and money lenders, finally rose in revolt. The story of the Sunderbans jungle after reclamation was no longer the battle between the man and the tiger but a bloody contest between man and man in a rapidly shrinking jungle.</p>
<p>This article states that the agrarian structure in the Sunderbans resembled other parts of south Bengal. Agricultural production was predominantly in the hands of small peasant holders, some with recorded occupation rights and others without title. However their relationship with the propertied rural groups remained mired in an unequal, exploitative system. In the course of time as agricultural production became commercialized, there was a gradual emergence of rich peasant households and jotedars who proceeded to dominate the agricultural and credit markets.</p>
<p>By the early decades of the twentieth century agrarian relations in the Sunderbans were seriously fractured. This allowed a new platform for radical and left groups to raise issues of <italic>ryotwari</italic>s and wage labour and eventually the bargadari question.</p>
<p>By 1947, a region consisting primarily of untapped virgin forest had been transformed into the rice bowl of Bengal, based on extremely unequal social relations between peasants, landlords and moneylenders. The Tebhaga was a direct response to peasant discontent. Radical parties attempted to restore a balance in favour of the under-privileged groups of sharecroppers and landless peasants. It also motivated local peasants to undertake resistance and wrest the leadership of the Movement in their own hands. The myths of the Sunderbans etched in people’s imaginations, represented by the tiger and the forest deity Banbibi were imperceptibly replaced by poverty, litigation and extreme exploitation by landlords and resulting peasant struggles that dominated the agrarian landscape.</p>

The earlier grantees had the option to give up their old leases and take fresh leases under the new rules.

Many of the investors were upper caste men who were prevented by caste rules from cultivating. They found direct management difficult, hence the chain of undertenures. Jack also suggests that most of the landlords in the district came from Bikrampur town, near Dacca and followed the same practices.</p></fn>

One of the examples: A big contingent of policeman had just arrested some male peasant cadres and wanted to leave by truck. Suddenly, women of the village sounded the warning system. The air vibrated with the noise and echoes of conchshells, horns, gongs and other instruments. At this, a hundred women—Hindus, Muslims and tribals alike came out from their huts. With their brooms and knives they ran towards the truck and tried to free the arrested men. An unequal fight ensued, in which the policemen could ultimately outwit the women, only after they had fired their rifles. But at no moment did the women who were all from poor families lose courage. ‘When the firing took place the women became more daring!’ Mass encirclements of police personnel, in response to alarm signals given by women, were a regular feature of Tebhaga in its militant phase. This is cited by Peter Custers, <italic>Women in the Tebhaga Uprising</italic> (Calcutta: Naya Prakash, 1987), 111–12. This example was based on the tales told by inhabitants of a village in the 24 Parganas, and the quotation is from a Muslim woman who herself participated in this fight.
