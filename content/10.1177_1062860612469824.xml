<abstract>
<p>Accurate patient identification is a National Patient Safety Goal. Misidentification of surgical specimens is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and costs of care. The authors developed 12 practical, process-based, standardized measures of surgical specimen identification defects during the preanalytic phase of pathology testing (from the operating room to the surgical pathology laboratory) that could be used to quantify the occurrence of these defects. The measures (6 container and 6 requisition identification defects) were developed by a panel of physicians, pathologists, nurses, and quality experts. A total of 69 hospitals prospectively collected data over 3 months. Overall, there were identification defects in 2.9% of cases (1780/60 501; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.0%-4.4%), 1.2% of containers (1018/81 656; 95% CI = 0.8%-2.0%), and 2.3% of requisitions (1417/61 245; 95% CI = 1.2%-4.6%). Future research is needed to evaluate if hospitals are able to use these measures to assess interventions meant to reduce the frequency of specimen identification defects and improve patient safety.</p>

<body>
<p>Misidentification of surgical specimens is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and costs of care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612469824">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612469824"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612469824">3</xref></sup> Surgical specimen identification defects are errors that occur with regard to the identification of the patient associated with a surgical specimen or the characteristics of the specimen itself. Correction of such identification defects consumes valuable resources; each may take an average of 3.5 hours to correct.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612469824">2</xref></sup> These defects are common, occurring in an estimated 6% of operative cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612469824">4</xref></sup> Moreover, these defects may lead to incorrect therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612469824">5</xref></sup> and are estimated to cause up to 160 000 adverse events annually in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612469824">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>To address the surgical specimen identification problem, The Joint Commission has made accurate identification of laboratory specimens a National Patient Safety Goal, requiring at least 2 patient identifiers on specimen labels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612469824">6</xref></sup> The College of American Pathologists also requires 2 or more patient identifiers on specimen labels plus other labeling requirements as part of their Laboratory Accreditation Program for anatomical pathology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612469824">7</xref></sup> They also have measured specimen identification defects through their Q-Probes program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612469824">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612469824">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612469824">8</xref></sup> and have tried to reduce these errors through their Q-Tracks program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612469824">9</xref></sup> These accreditation processes help ensure that safe protocols are in place in surgical pathology laboratories of accredited hospitals.</p>
<p>Surgical pathology errors have traditionally been categorized into 3 phases of the testing process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612469824">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612469824">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612469824">11</xref></sup>: a preanalytic phase (from the operating room to the pathology laboratory), an analytic phase (from specimen receipt in the pathology laboratory to analytic test results), and a postanalytic phase (involving the reporting of the pathology test results). Although there are national standards pertaining to this process (eg, as part of the accreditation and inspection practices of the College of American Pathologists), they pertain almost exclusively to the analytic phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612469824">7</xref></sup> There is still no standardized surveillance or valid measures to assess adherence to these regulatory standards in the preanalytic phase and to allow frontline providers from both surgery and pathology to jointly evaluate and improve their performance with regard to preanalytic surgical specimen identification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612469824">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612469824">12</xref></sup> Preanalytic surgical specimen identification defects also have been the least well studied and represent a potential source of significant patient harm, despite the fact that these defects are preventable and unambiguous.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612469824">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The goal of this research was to develop a measurement tool of practical, process-based, standardized measures with explicit definitions to give frontline providers a shared framework that they could use to evaluate the quality of surgical specimen identification in the transition from the operating room to the surgical pathology laboratory. In this article, the authors describe the development of these quality measures and pilot test them in evaluating surgical specimen identification defects in a large cohort of Midwestern hospitals.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1062860612469824">
<title>Developing the Set of Quality Measures</title>
<p>The model previously published by Rubin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612469824">13</xref></sup> was used to help design this project. The steps of this model include defining the audience and use for measurement, choosing the clinical area to evaluate, organizing an assessment team, selecting the processes or aspects of care to measure, writing the measure specifications, performing preliminary tests, and establishing scoring and analytic specifications.</p>
<p>An interdisciplinary panel convened and used the model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612469824">13</xref></sup> to develop a specific set of surgical specimen quality measures that frontline providers could use to evaluate and improve their performance in surgical specimen identification. The panel included physicians, nurses, students, and administrators with expertise in surgical care, quality improvement, and/or pathology. Panel members represented the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, the Henry Ford Health System, and the Michigan Health and Hospital Association (MHA) Keystone Center for Patient Safety and Quality.</p>
<p>In selecting a process of care, the authors first considered the 3 stages in which surgical specimen defects are typically stratified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612469824">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612469824">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612469824">11</xref></sup>: stage 1, the preanalytic phase (from the operating room to the pathology laboratory); stage 2, the analytic phase (from specimen receipt in the pathology laboratory to analytic test results); and stage 3, the postanalytic phase (the reporting of pathology test results). The preanalytic phase was chosen because specimen identification defects in this stage are completely preventable and unambiguous, yet their prevention requires the coordination of frontline staff from both pathology and surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612469824">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The process of writing measure specifications began in the fall of 2008. A literature review was conducted to identify previously published measures of surgical specimen defects. The authors’ work built mainly on the validated error taxonomy developed by Zarbo et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612469824">11</xref></sup> work previously done at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612469824">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612469824">14</xref></sup> and the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612469824">10</xref></sup> and on the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses’ <italic>Perioperative Standards and Recommended Practices</italic> for “specimens in the perioperative environment.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612469824">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The panel of experts used an iterative process to achieve group consensus on a preliminary set of surgical specimen identification quality measures. Conference calls were conducted every 2 to 4 weeks to evaluate progress and discuss barriers. With each iteration, each panelist considered the validity and feasibility of data collection based on their clinical experience and perceptions. The goal of the interdisciplinary panel was to develop explicit specifications for each of the candidate measures in order to standardize data collection and reduce the potential for bias. The specifications described who should collect the data, what to measure, how to measure it, and when to measure it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1062860612469824">
<title>Pilot Testing of Surgical Specimen Quality Measures</title>
<p>In the fall of 2009, the preliminary set of candidate measures, measure specifications, and a preliminary data collection tool were ready for pilot testing. All hospitals in the MHA were invited by the MHA Keystone Center to voluntarily participate in what was called the “Keystone Surgical Specimen Project.” The preliminary materials were distributed to all participating hospitals to determine their face validity. The measures and data collection tool were revised based on feedback from each hospital. In the end, the panel agreed on 12 candidate measures: 6 container identification defects and 6 requisition identification defects. They also developed 3 composite measures to calculate defect rates: (1) case defect rate: number of operative cases productive of a tissue specimen submitted to surgical pathology with 1 or more defects divided by the total number of those operative cases; (2) container defect rate: number of specimen containers with 1 or more defects divided by the total number of containers accessioned; and (3) requisition defect rate: number of specimen requisitions with 1 or more defects divided by the total number of requisitions accessioned (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1062860612469824">Table 1</xref>). Initially, an “other” category also was included for both container and requisition defects to allow teams to record additional defects that they identified.</p>

<p>A final Microsoft Excel–based “Specimen Error Toolkit” was assembled with the measure definitions, the daily data collection forms known as “Surgical Specimen Defect Log Sheets” for printing (available from the authors on request), a data collection workbook for monthly tabulation, and the instructions for data collection. This toolkit was distributed to all participating institutions. A multidisciplinary improvement team also was assembled at each participating hospital. This team consisted of a project coordinator, frontline medical and nursing staff from the surgical operating room, and surgical pathology laboratory staff. One team member at each site was trained via a webinar on how to educate his or her team to correctly use the measure definitions to identify defects and to collect data using the toolkit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1062860612469824">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were collected prospectively on each candidate measure from January to March 2010 to evaluate baseline performance. Teams used the paper-based standardized log sheets to record at the case level the frequency of container or requisition surgical specimen defects. The defects were classified according to the 12 candidate measures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1062860612469824">Table 1</xref>). At the end of each month, teams used the Excel-based data collection workbook to total the number of defects recorded from each case and submitted the monthly report forms to the MHA Keystone Center via e-mail.</p>
<p>At the end of 3 months, the panel of experts reviewed the data collected and identified that defects entered in the “other” category varied across sites and within sites over time. Some teams were erroneously recording container or requisition defects that belonged in 1 of the 6 specific defect categories into the “other” category. As a result, it was not possible to accurately interpret the frequency of “other” defects, and as such, the “other” category was removed from the toolkit. Only container and requisition defects are reported for the 12 candidate measures. For inclusivity, however, all defects were included in the calculation of composite defect rate measures.</p>

<sec id="section5-1062860612469824">
<title>Hospital Characteristics</title>
<p>Hospital characteristics (critical access, bed size, number of operating rooms, and total surgical operations per year) were obtained from the 2009 American Hospital Association annual survey data. All hospitals were in Michigan except for 1 in Iowa. Urban hospital status was defined using the core-based statistical area (CBSA) type of “Division” or “Metro” (defined as a population of at least 50 000). All other hospitals were defined as rural. The CBSAs are defined yearly by the Office of Management and Budget (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/fedreg/metroareas122700.pdf">http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/fedreg/metroareas122700.pdf</ext-link>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1062860612469824">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The defect-related data were aggregated to report rates for the overall cohort (definition of calculations in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1062860612469824">Table 1</xref>). Medians with ranges and means with standard deviations were used to summarize the data. A quasi-likelihood model using the Poisson distribution, with scaling using the Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> statistic to accommodate for overdispersion, was used to generate confidence intervals (CIs) for the defect rates. All analyses were conducted using Stata version 10.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX). This research was approved by The Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board.</p>

<p>It was found that 87% of hospitals reported data over all 3 months, and reporting compliance for each of the 3 months was greater than 90%; 63 hospitals reported container and requisition defects in month one, 66 in month two, and 68 in month three. A total of 196 data-months were reported for both containers and requisitions and 197 data-months for case defects (1 hospital reported only requisition defects in month 2 and only container defects in month 3). In 28 of 196 (14.3%) data-months, hospitals reported “other” container defects, whereas in 38 of 196 (19.4%) data-months, hospitals reported “other” requisition defects.</p>
<p>The median number of surgical pathology cases accessioned per hospital over the 3-month period was 523 (range = 15-4370). The median number of containers accessioned per hospital over the 3-month period was 654 (range = 15-6600). The median number of requisitions accessioned per hospital over the 3-month period was 457 (range = 15-6600).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, the authors developed a set of practical, process-based, standardized measures with explicit definitions to evaluate the quality of surgical specimen identification in the transition from the operating room to the surgical pathology laboratory. They pilot tested the definitions and measures in a cohort of 69 diverse hospitals in Michigan (1 in Iowa) and found an average case identification defect rate of nearly 3%. They also found an overall container identification defect rate of about 1% and a requisition identification defect rate of more than 2%.</p>
<p>The rates of surgical specimen misidentifications reported here are unique, in that they derive strictly from operating rooms and are solely from specimen requisitions and specimen containers in the preanalytic phase of surgical tissue specimen processing. Therefore, there are no direct comparisons with pathology misidentification rates reported previously in the literature. However, a few similar studies have been conducted by various methodologies to estimate broader types of specimen misidentification, including identification defects in clinical pathology (eg, blood, urine, and body fluid specimens) in addition to those in surgical pathology. It should be noted that the number of clinical pathology specimens most often far exceeds the number of surgical pathology specimens in any individual laboratory.</p>
<p>For example, Valenstein et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612469824">1</xref></sup> examined identification defects for released test results at 120 institutions throughout all 3 phases of specimen processing (preanalytic, analytic, and postanalytic). The defects reported were predominantly from clinical pathology tests (general chemistry, hematology, microbiology, and transfusion medicine) and therefore were expressed in rates per 1 million billable tests. The numbers of tests corresponding to specific laboratory domains or to surgical (anatomic) pathology were not stated. The use of a denominator of billable tests contrasts with most other studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612469824">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612469824">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612469824">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612469824">10</xref></sup> including ours, that assess defects using total number of operative cases productive of tissue specimens submitted to surgical pathology as the denominator. Nonetheless, Valenstein et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612469824">1</xref></sup> calculated an overall laboratory misidentification rate for released results of 55 defects per million billable tests. They found that “primary specimen label errors” were the most common, accounting for 55.5% of defects. However, additional information about the type of labeling deficiency was not reported. Therefore, it is not known if these defects resulted from mislabeling of patient name or ID and/or specimen type, source, or laterality.</p>
<p>Nakhleh and Zarbo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612469824">4</xref></sup> collected data from more than 1 million surgical pathology cases from 417 institutions worldwide and found that defects in specimen identification and accessioning occurred in 6.0% of cases. By their methodology, only 9.6% of those defects were “specimen identification deficiencies.” Although not presented formally in that publication, one can calculate that these surgical specimen identification deficiencies occurred in 0.58% of that large number of surgical pathology cases. However, another 77% of those defects were classified as “deficiencies related to incorrect or missing information,” some of which, by the authors’ methodology and that of others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612469824">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612469824">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612469824">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612469824">14</xref></sup> also would be considered surgical specimen identification defects. These included defects in tissue source/type or date of procedure. In general, this lack of standardized definitions, measures, and methodology has made it difficult to accurately estimate and compare the incidence of these defects at different institutions and to identify the types of defects that are most prevalent.</p>
<p>D’Angelo and Zarbo,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612469824">2</xref></sup> by prospective study, documented a misidentification rate of 1.67% of all surgical pathology cases occurring throughout all 3 test phases (preanalytic, analytic, and postanalytic) of the complete surgical pathology process. Uniquely, this study measured the hours of labor required to correct each defect and found that the average was 3.5 hours per defect. In another study of theirs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612469824">16</xref></sup> tracking in-process defects, again throughout all 3 test phases, defects resulted in rework of some kind in nearly 1 in 3 surgical pathology cases. Clearly, surgical specimen identification defects, especially misidentifications that may require molecular DNA profiling to correct, are extremely costly in terms of manpower and unnecessary health care expense.</p>
<p>Within the preanalytic phase specifically, there have been fewer studies. One single-center, prospective analysis of preanalytic surgical specimen defects by Makary et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612469824">10</xref></sup> found that defects occurred in 4.3 of 1000 or 0.43% of cases. However, this study only looked at container defects. In comparison, the current study’s container defect rate, from 69 centers, was 1.2% (95% CI = 0.8%-2.0%) of containers. Francis et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612469824">17</xref></sup> meanwhile, prospectively analyzed endoscopy specimen labeling defects specifically before and after the implementation of a radiofrequency identification system. Their 3-month baseline defect rate was 9.3% for containers only.</p>
<p>The current study’s estimate of preanalytic surgical specimen identification defects, based on examination of container and requisition defects, is 29 defects per 1000 cases or 2.9%. The authors believe that their findings are strengthened by the use of standardized measures with explicit definitions that were thoroughly vetted by physicians, frontline providers, and quality experts to identify defects in a large diverse cohort of hospitals. In this cohort, specimen source/type defects were the most common container defects, followed by laterality defects. This finding contrasts with that of Makary et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612469824">10</xref></sup> where missing container label (19.8%) was the most common type of preanalytic container identification defect. This suggests empirically that the most prominent type of defect may be dependent on processes unique to individual hospitals and that additional research to attempt to reduce these defects, such as that of Francis et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612469824">17</xref></sup> should be hospital centered.</p>
<p>The authors’ findings have important implications for surgical care. In the short 3-month period of this study, defects were identified involving 1780 patients across 69 hospitals. The consequences of these defects may represent a significant patient safety risk. An estimated 17% of identification defects result in incorrect therapy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612469824">5</xref></sup> and nearly 6% cause adverse events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612469824">1</xref></sup> Hospitals cannot afford to maintain these levels of patient safety risk, particularly when it is feasible to measure the incidence of these defects, they are unambiguous, and they are preventable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612469824">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>To the authors’ knowledge this is only the third large multi-institutional study of specimen identification defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612469824">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612469824">4</xref></sup> and the first study to collect data strictly from operating rooms from a large cohort of hospitals in a given state. The authors convened an expert panel, used a group consensus process to establish a standardized set of measures and definitions, and then pilot tested them to estimate defect rates by surgical specimen case, container, and requisition and to identify 12 specific container and requisition identification defects. This work offers a feasible strategy that health systems can use to quantify surgical specimen identification defects in the perioperative setting and sets the stage for additional statewide efforts to reduce the occurrence of these defects.</p>
<p>Successful efforts to improve surgical specimen identification defects likely will require a multifaceted approach that includes both technical and adaptive change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612469824">18</xref></sup> Technical change involves solutions to problems for which we know the answers (eg, handwashing to prevent infection) and often focuses on the systems of care rather than individual performance. For example, technical changes such as standardization of the defect identification process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612469824">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612469824">17</xref></sup> and use of color-coded sticker notification and computerized software programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612469824">16</xref></sup> or of radio frequency identification technology together with a paperless requisition process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612469824">17</xref></sup> have been associated with reductions in specimen identification defects.</p>
<p>Adaptive change is often more challenging than technical change and requires changing people’s values, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612469824">18</xref></sup> Many improvement projects focus the majority of their time on the technical work, yet projects fail most often because of adaptive challenges, such as clinicians who do not support the project.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612469824">18</xref></sup> Multifaceted approaches that address both technical and adaptive change have been associated with large-scale significant and sustained reductions in health care–associated infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1062860612469824">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1062860612469824">20</xref></sup> It remains unclear if a similar approach could be applied successfully to achieve reductions in the frequency of specimen identification defects as well.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to this study. First, the content or construct validity of the measures was not rigorously evaluated. Additional research is needed before these measures can be broadly implemented. Nevertheless, teams routinely used the measures and submitted data, suggesting that these measures are feasible and have face validity among providers. Second, all data were submitted voluntarily without independent validation. Voluntary reporting may introduce bias and underestimate the magnitude of defects, particularly if hospitals with high error rates elected not to submit data. Third, the measures focus on 1 type of preanalytic surgical pathology defect—specimen identification. There are other areas of preanalytic defects, such as poor or improper sample collection and preservation, specimens “lost” in transit, and analytic and postanalytic defects that were not addressed here.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612469824">11</xref></sup> Fourth, the initial inclusion of an “other” category prevented the authors from classifying all reported defects according to their 12 specific container or requisition defect candidate measures. Finally, with the exception of 1 hospital in Iowa, all the data come from hospitals in 1 state. Nonetheless, the authors believe that these results are generalizable, given the number and diversity of the hospitals in the cohort.</p>
<p>In conclusion, surgical specimen identification defects are common, yet preventable, and pose significant risks to patients. The authors developed a set of standardized measures for the preanalytic phase and used them to detect specimen container and requisition defects and quantify performance across a large and diverse cohort of hospitals. Future research is needed to evaluate whether hospitals can use these measures to assess interventions meant to reduce the frequency of surgical specimen identification defects and improve patient safety.</p>
