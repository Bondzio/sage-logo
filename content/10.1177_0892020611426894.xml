<abstract>
<p>Many models of timetabling exist in secondary schools in Western educational jurisdictions. This study examines whether or not teachers teaching a full course load without preparation time during a semester are willing to volunteer to participate in extracurricular activities. This research was conducted in a rural school district in British Columbia, Canada. Teacher workload, preparation time and willingness to volunteer for extracurricular activities were addressed. Over 70 per cent of respondents to the survey indicated that they found their workload unmanageable during the semester in which they had no preparation time while over 90 per cent of respondents indicated they wanted to have preparation time distributed evenly over the full school year. A significant majority of teachers do not supervise extracurricular activities when they have no preparation time. A comprehensive literature review examining advantages and disadvantages of the semester timetable and an extensive bibliography are included.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Teachers in Canada and many other westernised countries face increasing demands on their time. As their work intensifies, expectations from parents, the school-based administration and society for improved student achievement is also increasing. While many teachers in British Columbia enjoy coaching and supporting student involvement in extracurricular activities, by contract teachers in British Columbia public schools are not required to supervise or participate in such activities.</p>
<p>Extracurricular activities are actively supported by Boards of Education in British Columbia with policy and resource allocation suggesting an expectation that extracurricular activities are part of school life in British Columbia. Many school jurisdictions provide funding for transportation and liability insurance, fund school-based ‘extracurricular activity’ coordinators or reimburse out-of-pocket expenses teachers incur while supervising extracurricular activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0892020611426894">BCSTA, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2001 Naylor and Field examined the workload of secondary English teachers in the province of British Columbia. Among other findings, these researchers discovered that approximately 40 per cent of English teachers who taught in a semester system withdrew from participating in extracurricular activities during the semester in which they had no preparation time. This piqued our interest– is it only English teachers who withdraw from participating in extracurricular activities when they do not have a preparation block? Would more teachers be willing to participate in extracurricular activities if a school timetable ensured they had a preparation block every day or every other day?</p>
<p>This article reports on research into how preparation time impacts secondary school teachers’ willingness to sponsor extracurricular activities. The central research question was ‘Does the semester timetable structure affect teacher participation in school-based volunteerism?’ The research was conducted June 2009 in a rural British Columbia school district, North Okanagan-Shuswap.</p>
<p>The first section briefly overviews literature related to timetabling and extracurricular activities. Permissions and descriptions of the school district, schools, teachers and school district timetable structure follow. Data-collection instruments and methodology precede a description and analysis of the findings. Tables are included in the findings section. Conclusions and recommendations complete the paper.</p>

<title>Literature</title>
<p>In this section, linear and semester timetable models and preparation time are described and explained with the focus on the semester or block timetable model. Most scholarly literature in the field of school timetables compares the semester timetable system with the linear model.</p>
<p>Numerous timetable models exist for ten-month, semester and year-round schooling. In British Columbia (BC) three timetable models are dominant in secondary schools: the linear or traditional, the semester or block and the Copernican models (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0892020611426894">Figure 1</xref>). Linear timetables usually operate over the ten-month school year and consist of eight classes with five or six 45–55 minute classes or ‘blocks’ per day. With a linear timetable teachers are allocated one of the eight blocks, 12.5 per cent of annual instructional time for preparation or ‘prep time’ for the duration of the year. Semester timetables usually have four 70–90 minute classes per day for a five-month period – September through January and a second five-month cycle February through June. Teachers typically receive a preparation block in one of the two semesters. In the Copernican system two 2.5-hour classes are offered during a 2.5-month cycle. Teachers usually receive one 2.5-hour preparation time in one of the four cycles comprising the year. Regardless of the timetable model, by contractual agreement, full-time equivalent teachers in middle and secondary schools in the province of BC receive 12 per cent of allocated instructional time as preparation time.</p>

<title>Semester timetable</title>
<p>In a comprehensive review of the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0892020611426894">Rettig &amp; Canady (2001)</xref> conclude there is no clear evidence to suggest that a semester timetable will improve or negatively impact student achievement. However, when compared to students on a linear system, students graduated earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0892020611426894">Gullett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0892020611426894">Murrin 2000</xref>), were better prepared for post-secondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0892020611426894">Murrin, 2000</xref>) and attended more post-secondary colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0892020611426894">Eineder &amp; Bishop, 1997</xref>). Student achievement was negatively impacted for students on the semester system who were absent for any length of time because of the compressed nature of a semester timetable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0892020611426894">Hurley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0892020611426894">Kienholz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0892020611426894">Stauton &amp; Adams, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0892020611426894">Wilson &amp; Stokes, 2000</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0892020611426894">
<title>Extra-curricular activities</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0892020611426894">Fredricks &amp; Eccles (2006)</xref> report that students who participate in sports or social or academic clubs were more successful academically, had fewer emotional issues and used less drugs and alcohol than those students not participating in extra activities. Internationally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0892020611426894">Moriana et al. (2006)</xref> found that Spanish students who participated in sporting or academic extracurricular activities performed better academically than those who didn’t participate in such activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0892020611426894">Shulruf et al. (2008)</xref> reported on significantly improved literacy scores for New Zealand students involved in school athletics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0892020611426894">Hoffman (2006)</xref> found that athletic girls from low socio-economic status homes and boys from high socio-economic status homes consume less alcohol than those who aren’t involved in school athletics.</p>
<p>There is no evidence to suggest timetabling structures negatively impact learning or achievement among students though many studies highlight the physical, emotional, social, academic and self-identity benefits of extra-curricular activities. We could find no studies that specifically examine whether or not timetable structure impacted teacher volunteerism or impacted teacher attitudes towards their workload. There is a noticeable lack of research specifically investigating teacher preparation time. This study attempts to attend to that gap and address questions related to teacher preparation time and teacher willingness to volunteer for extracurricular activities.</p>

<title>Permissions</title>
<p>The University of British Columbia Research Ethics Board vetted the study and the North Okanagan-Shuswap Teachers’ Association and the British Columbia Teachers’ Federation authorised participation by their members. The North Okanagan-Shuswap School District No. 83 Board of Education authorised the research and granted researcher access to district schools and teachers.</p>

<title>Demographics</title>
<sec id="section7-0892020611426894">
<title>District</title>
<p>School District No. 83 (SD83), North Okanagan-Shuswap, is one of 60 British Columbia school districts. The 7,200 students in SD83 attend one of the 18 elementary, six alternate/storefront, three middle (grades 6–8) or four secondary (grades 8–12) schools. The geographic area covers 8,500 square kilometres, includes 18 cities, towns and villages and four Aboriginal reservations. The region is resource dependent and is a very popular tourism and recreation area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0892020611426894">
<title>Schools</title>
<p>The research was conducted in four secondary schools in four communities that employ the semester timetable system. The four secondary schools, two housing grades 8–12 students and two housing grades 9–12, range in student population from 230 to over 1,500. Between 20 and 83 full- and part-time teachers are employed at each site. Extracurricular activities offered in the four schools and supervised by teachers include the traditional sports of volleyball, basketball and cross-country/track and field as well as clubs such as Ultimate Frisbee, Anime, Dungeons and Dragons, Drag Racing and Environmental.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0892020611426894">
<title>Teachers</title>
<p>Surveys were distributed to all 163 teachers in the four schools. The two largest schools in the two largest communities in the district had an average completion rate of 55 per cent (64/118 teachers) while the two smallest schools in the smallest communities had a poorer return rate of 36 per cent (16/45 teachers).</p>
<p>Of the responding teachers 57 per cent had 16 or more years of teaching experience; 30 per cent of the responding teachers reported between 6 and 15 years of experience. Only 12.5 per cent of the teachers reported five or less years of experience. These percentages mirror provincial teaching experience averages. In 2006 district reorganisation resulted in reassignment of many teachers and, combined with declining enrolment, resulted in only 55 per cent of teachers in SD83 reporting that they had been teaching in the same school for more than five years.</p>
<p>Of respondents 47.5 per cent were female, 52.5 percent were men. It is not known if these numbers reflect the secondary school teacher gender composition in the district. Eighty-six per cent of respondents worked full time. Part-time teachers are those teachers who teach from one of eight blocks to six of eight blocks. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0892020611426894">Table 1</xref> shows the teaching areas of the survey respondents.</p>

<title>Timetable</title>
<p>The four secondary schools in SD83 share a common semester timetable with an identical block rotation and class schedule – it is often referred to as a ‘four-by-four’ timetable (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0892020611426894">Table 2</xref>). There is a four-block rotation Monday through Thursday and a rotational block order on Fridays.</p>

<p>This common district timetable model ensures the four secondary schools consistently offer the same timetable, class schedule and hours of operation enabling students to attend programmes and classes in different schools. For example, eight students enrolled in Physics 12 in one school may be bused to join ten students enrolled in Physics 12 in another school in the district.</p>
<p>Benefits of the four-by-four semester model are many: students can retake failed courses in the second semester; students and teachers have fewer class preparations; and with fewer students, a more meaningful student–teacher relationship may develop. One drawback is that a student may enroll in Math 11 in the first semester of their grade 11 year and not take Math 12 until the second semester of their grade 12 year – a break of 12 months.</p>
<p>By contract, teachers in SD83 are allotted 12.5 per cent preparation time per year. This means that most teachers working in a semester system will teach seven of eight blocks over a year or four of four blocks one semester and three of four blocks the other semester.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0892020611426894">
<title>Method</title>
<p>A questionnaire consisting of five sections was distributed to all secondary teachers in School District No. 83. The sections consisted of teacher demographics, sections for part-time and full-time teachers, the attitudes of teachers towards extracurricular activities and timetables, and a section for written responses. A five-point Likert scale was used for all but the demographic and written components of the questionnaire.</p>
<p>Written responses were designed to provide opportunities for respondents to expand on their responses. The data from the open-ended questions was coded and categorised into themes including teacher workload and personal commitments, administrative and district support, provincial government support and philosophical issues. Workload data is not included in this article.</p>
<p>The questionnaire was completed early June 2009 with a 49 per cent completion rate (80/163). Codes were assigned to help ensure confidentiality. Fields were created and data was entered into an Excel spreadsheet and uploaded into SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) for analysis. A percentage breakdown of each of the segments within each demographic and question emerged resulting in patterns that helped explain the data.</p>
<p>When analysing the data we were perplexed with the number of ‘not applicable’ (NA) and ‘neither agree or disagree’ (NAD) responses. When we disaggregated the NA and NAD responses, we discovered that counsellors, teacher librarians and other non-enrolling teachers constituted a significant majority of these responses. These teachers generally do not schedule preparation time due to the serendipitous nature of their teaching assignments and relatively unscheduled workload.</p>
<p>Questions on the survey were designed to determine how School District No. 83’s timetable structure affects teachers’ choice of work status, how the timetable affects teachers’ capacity to do their jobs and how the timetable affects teacher’s participation in extracurricular activities. The researchers were interested in whether or not teachers would be willing to participate in extracurricular activities if the timetable structure allowed for a yearlong preparation block.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0892020611426894">
<title>Part-time teachers</title>
<p>Eleven of the 80 teachers who participated in this study identified themselves as part-time teachers. Nine of these teachers were female. Seven of the 11 part-time teachers were willing to work full-time if their preparation time was evenly distributed or balanced throughout the year. Four of the eleven teachers who work part time indicated that they do so because of how preparation time is allocated in the secondary school semester system. These four teachers stated that they would prefer to work full-time but choose not to because of the unbalanced preparation blocks during a school year.</p>
<p>We recognise that with the low response rate the degree of certainty and generalisability is low. However, there are no studies that specifically investigate the effect of timetables on teacher volunteerism. A low number of part-time teacher responses does not negate the information in this study but rather significant policy questions worthy of further investigation are raised.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0892020611426894">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Forty-one per cent of the full-time teachers surveyed who responded to the statement ‘I have difficulty managing my teacher workload for the entire school year or two semesters’ disagreed or strongly disagreed with this statement, suggesting they could manage their workload through an entire year. Conversely, 40 per cent of full-time teachers who responded to this statement agreed or strongly agreed with, it suggesting that they have difficulty managing their workload (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0892020611426894">Table 3</xref>). Four out of ten North Okanagan-Shuswap secondary teachers admit that they have difficulty managing their teaching workload on the semester system.</p>

<p>There were numerous comments included in the written section of the questionnaire that specifically addressed the unbalanced preparation schedule. A female math/science teacher addressed the issue of teaching four of four blocks and coaching during a semester. She coached and taught full time at a personal cost yet recognised a solution to the problem:<disp-quote>
<p>I did coach basketball for 10 years and I know it is beyond ridiculous to teach 4/4 and then coach three nights a week &amp; travel on weekends. I usually got very ill every season from being burned out. A year-long preparation block would have helped me stay afloat.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A female Applied Skills/Technology teacher with over 15 years’ teaching experience recognised the difficulty of teaching four out of four classes in one semester. She bluntly stated:<disp-quote>
<p>[We need] even preparation time all year. Four on four is ‘insane’! [Having] one preparation block every day for only one semester is too much!</p>

<title>Alternative programmes</title>
<p>The Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) programme is offered in one of the four high schools in SD83. AVID is offered on a linear schedule – that is, the course is offered every second day throughout the school year. The six teachers who instruct in this programme or teach a course backed with an AVID course receive a preparation block every second day. These six teachers and one other who teaches a leadership course over two semesters all agreed with the statement ‘I like the way my preparation time is currently distributed’.</p>
<p>Every teacher who agreed or strongly agreed with the statement ‘I like the way my preparation time is currently distributed’ also agreed or strongly agreed with the statement ‘I would like my preparation time evenly distributed during the school year’. Teachers satisfied with the traditional semester preparation time schedule wanted evenly distributed preparation time throughout the school year.</p>
<p>Secondary teachers in SD83 are not willing to teach outside their subject specialty even if it means a balanced preparation time during both semesters. Over 70 per cent of teachers would be willing to teach a course in their subject specialty if it meant a balanced preparation time (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0892020611426894">Table 6</xref>). However, only 41 per cent of those teachers would be willing to teach a course outside their subject area. Interestingly teachers who participated in the study are not willing to teach outside their subject specialty regardless of whether or not it meant preparation time during the whole school year.</p>

<title>Extracurricular activities</title>
<p>School District No. 83’s secondary teachers understand the value of and overwhelmingly support volunteer activities in schools. Over 91 per cent of the 80 respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement ‘Extra-curricular activities are important to offer at a school (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0892020611426894">Table 7</xref>).

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Students who participate in extracurricular activities perform better academically than those students who don’t participate in such activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0892020611426894">Fredricks &amp; Eccles, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0892020611426894">Moriana et al., 2006</xref>), attain improved literacy scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0892020611426894">Shulruf et al., 2008</xref>), are less likely to consume alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0892020611426894">Fredricks &amp; Eccles, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0892020611426894">Hoffman, 2006</xref>) and have fewer emotional problems and use less drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0892020611426894">Fredricks &amp; Eccles, 2006</xref>) than students not participating in extracurricular activities. These are compelling reasons for schools to offer extracurricular opportunities for students to engage in. Educational administrators must consider ameliorating factors that may impede or negatively impact teacher participation and supervision of extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>Over 90 per cent of teachers in School District No. 83 believe extracurricular activities are an important characteristic of school life and almost three out of every five of these teachers volunteer to lead or coordinate extracurricular activities. However, only one out of every five teachers is willing to volunteer for extracurricular activities in a semester when they are teaching four-out-of-four blocks. Eighty per cent of the teachers who participated in this research are sending a strong message to policy-makers and administrators – they want a balanced teaching schedule that provides them with preparation time during both teaching semesters.</p>
<p>Timetable models that blend the semester and linear systems together already exist. Administrators in School District No. 83 allow teachers in the AVID programme to offer a class every second day over two semesters. AVID teachers receive a preparation block every second school day. School administrators could schedule core (English, Math, Social Studies, Science) or other courses every second day for both semesters thus providing an opportunity for teachers to back the core course with a preparation block. Given that most teachers are unwilling to volunteer to supervise extracurricular activities during the semester they teach four-of-four blocks school administrators ought to consider implementing a blended linear/semester timetable.</p>
<p>Teachers whose teaching assignments include preparation time during both semesters of the year are satisfied with their assignments. Scheduling a preparation block every second day of the school year for secondary English teachers may also address workload manageability issues. Forty per cent of English teachers in British Columbia withdraw from sponsoring extracurricular activities during the semester they have no preparation time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0892020611426894">Naylor &amp; Field, 2001</xref>). We found that teachers who teach the ‘core subjects’ of English, Social Studies, Math and Science on a semester system were less likely to volunteer to sponsor extracurricular activities, especially when they did not have a preparation block during a semester. As one Science and Math teacher with between 11 and 15 years’ experience who participated in the study commented:<disp-quote>
<p>If I had a prep both semesters, I would coach one season and run a school club in the other. By the time my no-prep semester is done, I am so burnt out it takes me two months to recover.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A few respondents suggested that the school district pay for teachers on call (substitute teachers) to cover coaches’ classes and a few respondents suggested extra pay for coaching or sponsoring extracurricular activities. Neither of these options is viable given shrinking budgets and increased demands on resource allocation in the education sector even though our work suggests that significantly more teachers will consider volunteering when they have balanced preparation time. A balanced, blended linear/semester timetable has no financial costs associated with it yet makes preparation time every second day of the year an option for teachers.</p>
<p>Results from this study suggest many teachers would be willing to participate in extracurricular activities if preparation time was evenly distributed during the school year. District and school-based administrations have the authority to implement a balanced linear/semester timetable and provide an opportunity for teachers to have preparation time throughout the school year. Given the results of this research, we believe it is incumbent for school and district administrations to put into practice a timetable that provides preparation time for secondary teachers throughout the school year.</p>
