               <title>Background</title>
               <p>Bronchiectasis in tuberculosis (TB) is usually considered chronic traction bronchiectasis associated with healed scars. However, bronchiectasis can occasionally be seen in active TB.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Purpose</title>
               <p>To evaluate prevalence, appearance, and changes of bronchiectasis associated with active TB on computed tomography (CT).</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Material and Methods</title>
               <p>A total of 391 patients with active TB who had undergone CT scans at the time of diagnosis were included in the study. Active TB was diagnosed when the sputum or the sample obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage tested positive using an acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear test, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, or an AFB culture. The CT scans were reviewed focusing on bronchiectasis within consolidations or nodules. Cases with bronchiectasis beyond the consolidation or nodules were excluded from the study to exclude pre-existing traction bronchiectasis. The prevalence and appearance (cylindrical, varicose, cystic, and presence of focal erosion) of bronchiectasis and its time-dependent changes were analyzed. In addition, the presence of the feeding bronchus sign was checked. Here, the feeding bronchus sign was defined as a CT finding where the cavity communicates with the dilated airway.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Results</title>
               <p>In 100 (25%) of the 391 patients, bronchiectasis was present within consolidations or nodules on CT. The shape of the bronchiectasis was cylindrical in all patients and focal erosions were revealed in 75 patients (75%). Nine patients had both cylindrical and varicose forms of the bronchiectasis. The feeding bronchus sign was observed in 42 patients (42%). Follow-up CT was performed on 19 of 100 patients. The bronchiectasis had progressed in 11 patients (58%), improved in four patients (21%), remained unchanged in one patient (5%), and could not be determined in the remaining three patients (16%). In nine patients, CT images prior to diagnosis were available, and in all these cases, bronchiectasis was newly developed.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Conclusion</title>
               <p>Bronchiectasis can be seen within active inflammation in one-fourth of active TB on CT. In association with active inflammation, bronchiectasis is mostly cylindrical with focal erosions, occasionally accompanied by the feeding bronchus sign.</p>

         <p>Bronchiectasis is defined as an irreversible bronchial dilatation, although bronchial dilatation does not always indicate bronchiectasis. However, most bronchiectasis are irreversible, and reversible bronchiectasis cannot be distinguished from irreversible ones with one single CT study. The cases showing bronchial dilatation on the CT images are defined as bronchiectasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C2">2</xref>). It frequently occurs in association with healed pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). After the healing of active TB, in the vicinity of scar tissues or bronchial obstruction, traction bronchiectasis can develop, and thus bronchiectasis is considered to be an irreversible manifestation of healed TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C6">6</xref>).</p>
         <p>Should all bronchial dilatation present within active TB lesions be considered as traction bronchiectasis? In active TB, bronchial wall destruction may occur resulting in bronchial dilatation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C7">7</xref>). Bronchial dilatation can be seen together with active TB, and without any connection with traction bronchiectasis. In addition, if it is true, bronchiectasis within an active lesion on CT images could help to diagnose active TB, and distinguish TB from, for example, pneumonia. However, studies on bronchiectasis caused by active TB are rare. Therefore, we examined the prevalence and appearance of bronchiectasis in active TB lesions by analyzing CT findings. We also reviewed any other CT scans prior to and after diagnosis for comparison.</p>

            <title>Patients and CT scans</title>
            <p>The study was approved by our institution's Institutional Review Board, which granted a waiver of informed consent. Between May 2008 and June 2010, 391 patients with active TB underwent CT scans at the time of diagnosis in our institute. For most patients, CT was performed because abnormal opacities were detected by plain radiography or pulmonary tuberculosis was suspected clinically. All patients were diagnosed with active TB as pulmonary lesions were confirmed by plain radiography or CT, and the sputum or the sample obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage were found to be positive for acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear test, TB polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, or AFB culture.</p>
            <p>CT scans were obtained with LightSpeed VCT (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with or without intravenous administration of contrast medium (100 cc at 2 ∼ 2.5 cc/s) in 351 and 40 patients, respectively. The decision to perform contrast medium studies was made by the attending clinicians, who suspected a malignancy or TB lymphadenitis from the chest radiographs of their patients. Scanning parameters included a 130 mA tube current, 120 kV tube voltage, 128 × 0.6 mm collimation, and 1.2 pitch. All images were reconstructed into axial images with 5-mm slice thickness at 5-mm intervals and coronal images with 3-mm slice thickness.</p>

         <sec id="s2b">
            <title>Analysis</title>
            <p>All CT scans and medical records were retrospectively reviewed by three chest radiologists with 2, 8, and 12 years of experience, respectively. Interpretation was determined on consensus among at least two of the three reviewers.</p>
            <p>Bronchoarterial ratio higher than 1 was defined as bronchiectasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C8">8</xref>). To rule out pre-existing traction bronchiectasis, only bronchial dilation in consolidation and nodules within active lesions were analyzed, and bronchiectasis beyond the above mentioned lesions was excluded. The changes in lobar and main bronchi were also excluded from this analysis.</p>
            <p>The appearance of bronchiectasis was broadly divided into three groups: cylindrical (type A), varicose (type B), and cystic (type C). Among type A, cases with focal erosion or dilatation were subdivided into type A-e (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475796F1">1</xref>). In addition, cases with the cavity within consolidations or nodules communicating with the dilated airway were defined as the feeding bronchus sign, and its presence was evaluated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475796F2">2</xref>).

         <p>In 100 (25%) out of 391 patients, bronchiectasis was associated with consolidation or nodules, all of whom were type A. In nine patients (9%), type A and type B were observed simultaneously. In addition, 75 patients (75%) showed type A-e morphology. In 42 patients (42%), the feeding bronchus sign was seen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475796F3">3</xref>).

         <p>Among the 100 patients with bronchiectasis, CT was performed on 19 patients during follow-up at our institution, and for all patients, anti-TB chemotherapy was initiated immediately after diagnosis. No patients started anti-TB medication before CT scanning. During the follow-up period, progression of TB lesions was not detected in any patient. In all 19 patients who underwent follow-up CT, the improvement of all the active pulmonary TB lesions was noted. In 11 patients (58%), bronchiectasis had progressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475796F4">4</xref>), in four patients (21%), bronchiectasis had diminished in size and in one patient, bronchiectasis were unchanged. We were unable to evaluate the remaining three patients because of architectural distortion caused by pulmonary atelectasis or fibrosis in the vicinity that developed during the healing process.

         <p>Among all patients with bronchiectasis, nine patients had CT images obtained prior to the diagnosis of TB (range, 18–70 months), and at that time, none of them were diagnosed with active TB. For all patients, bronchial dilatation was newly developed. In one patient, bronchial dilatation newly appeared in the area of the pre-existing traction bronchiectasis as TB reactivated around the old TB scar lesion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475796F5">5</xref>).

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>In active TB, there are two major types of airway involvement that can be visualized with CT. The first type is endobronchial TB, mainly involving the large airways, with luminal narrowing and wall thickening together in the lobar and main bronchi, usually extending into the carina and trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C11">11</xref>). The second type is centrilobular nodules with “tree in bud” appearance caused by bronchogenic spread, with caseous material fillings of the bronchioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C12">12</xref>). In addition to these two types, in medium-sized airways, aneurysmal changes with impacted caseous materials may be present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C7">7</xref>). Other minor findings are bronchial wall thickening. It is well-known that bronchial wall thickening by active inflammation is visualized by CT. However, bronchiectasis has been believed to be the only TB sequela (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C13">13</xref>). Indeed, are all bronchial dilatations in active TB traction bronchiectasis? To our knowledge, the literature pertinent to active TB and bronchiectasis is scanty.</p>
         <p>We found that 25% of active TB patients had bronchiectasis associated with active TB lesions. This prevalence is low compared with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C4">4</xref>). We believe that the low prevalence in our study is due to the restriction of bronchiectasis associated within active lesions, as cases with adjacent architectural distortion observed in traction bronchiectasis were excluded. In all our patients, bronchiectasis was of the cylindrical type, and corkscrew shapes or varicose cases were rare. Many cases (75%) were associated with focal erosive or aneurysmal changes. It is believed that such findings are due to the active inflammation and destruction of bronchial wall by TB. In addition, 42% of the cases displayed the feeding bronchus sign that connected the cavity to the dilated airway. This also suggests the presence of bronchial destruction caused by an active inflammation. This focal aneurysmal or cystic destruction in active TB lesions is different from cystic or varicose bronchiectasis. In these types of bronchiectasis, dilated airways have alternating areas of dilatation and constriction. Thus, multiple cystic dilatations are clustered like grapes in the cystic bronchiectasis or arranged in a row like beaded strings in the varicose bronchiectasis. Cystic bronchiectasis is the most severe and chronic form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C14">14</xref>). We believe that the rarity of the cystic type in our analysis was caused by the chronicity of these types and our exclusion of the pre-existing fibrotic lesions.</p>
         <p>There have been many reports about bronchiectasis and associated non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) infection in contrast to active TB. The feeding bronchus sign is also suggested as a CT finding of NTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C15">15</xref>). According to recent studies, bronchiectasis was not a pre-existing condition but had resulted from NTM. Fujita <italic>et al.</italic> observed extensive granuloma formation along airways accompanied by destruction of the bronchial cartilage and smooth muscle layer, and ulceration of the bronchial mucosa in pathologic specimens of NTM. They concluded that NTM causes bronchiectasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C16">16</xref>). According to our results, these necrotic changes in the airways can be caused by any Mycobacterium species rather than NTM alone.</p>
         <p>In addition, in all patients who had access to previous CT, bronchiectasis were new lesions. This finding strongly suggests that these lesions are not post-TB sequela. In addition, in most patients who were under TB medication and whose follow-up CT scans were available, bronchiectasis was either progressed or improved during the healing process. Such changes also support that bronchiectasis shown on the CT images taken at the time of diagnosis were reversible.</p>
         <p>Bronchiectasis with focal erosive change caused by inflammation and destruction of the bronchial wall has not been reported until now in other necrotic pneumonia except NTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475796C15">15</xref>). In other words, a cylindrical bronchiectasis with focal erosion, which is detected within consolidation, is thought to be a characteristic of TB comparable with other necrotic pneumonia. Because there has not been a comparative study before, we believe that such studies are needed.</p>
         <p>A major limitation of this study is that to evaluate bronchiectasis, the CT images of 3–5-mm slice in thickness were applied rather than using high resolution CT (HRCT). The use of HRCT may have evaluated the bronchiectasis more accurately. However, we analyzed the routine chest multidetector CT (MDCT) images retrospectively. In this institute, contrast-enhanced MDCT rather than HRCT was performed routinely in evaluating TB. This was to examine for the presence of lymphadenitis or other associated findings, or to rule out diseases other than pulmonary TB, such as lung cancer. In addition, improvement in the resolution of MDCT facilitates the evaluation of bronchial dilatation, and if needed, multiplanar reconstruction with thin slice thickness is feasible. It would be advantageous if our study could be applied to routine MDCT protocols. Another major limitation is that pathologic proof could not be performed. However, all our patients could be diagnosed by sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Surgical resection was unnecessary. In reality, it was impossible to confirm the pulmonary lesions in all TB patients histologically. Another shortcoming is that the number of patients who were available for follow-up and the number of patients whose CT images prior to diagnosis were available was small, thus not being statistically reliable. Finally, we could not completely exclude the possibility that active TB inflammation could be superimposed on the pre-existent traction bronchiectasis, although we tried to exclude traction bronchiectasis by including the bronchiectasis cases within the active inflammation. However, the number of patients would be very small, considering all the bronchiectasis were new lesions in nine patients with the old CT scans.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, active TB could induce changes not only in the pulmonary parenchyma or the large airway but also in the segmental or subsegmental airways. It may present as a cylindrical bronchiectasis with focal erosion within the consolidations or nodules on the CT images, which can be characteristic of active TB differentiated from other infectious pneumonia.</p>
