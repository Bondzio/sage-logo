<title>From the Editor</title>
<p>June 2013 comprises five research articles. The lead article by Alfred A. Marcus and Marc H. Anderson concerns “Commitment to an Emerging Organizational Field: An Enactment Theory.” The authors build an enactment theory to explain the continuing commitment of entrepreneurs to emerging organizational fields, which are widely seen as being in the interest of society but constrained by market conditions and lack of government support. Instances cited are energy efficiency and renewable energy. Entrepreneurs committed by their perceptions and beliefs act to educate stakeholders and thus help develop the organizational field.</p>
<p>The second research article by Michael L. Barnett addresses “One Voice, But Whose Voice? Exploring What Drives Trade Association Activity.” The study measures the activity of 148 major industry trade associations over time in relationship to the performance of the relevant industries and dominant firms. Trade association spending is inversely related to the profitability of the four largest firms in an industry, but not related to overall industry profitability. The author concludes that these findings suggest that large firms exert control over trade association agendas to advance their own interests rather than industry interests.</p>
<p>In “An Exploratory Analysis of Corporate Social Responsibility and Disclosure” Cedric E. Dawkins and John W. Fraas test the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and annual report disclosure. They divide S&amp;P 500 into low CSP and high CSP groups for comparison. The low CSP group shows a positive relationship of disclosure to CSP strengths, to build or repair reputation. The high CSP group shows a positive relationship of disclosure to CSP weaknesses, to protect favorable CSP brand.</p>
<p>In “The Role of Governance in Corporate Social Responsibility: Lessons From Dutch Finance” Frank Jan de Graaf and J. W. Stoelhorst extend the corporate social performance (CSP) model by studying the role of governance structures and governance systems in shaping corporate social responsibility. They provide a comparative case study of responsiveness processes of four Dutch banks with markedly difference governance systems and structures, which both enable and constrain responsibility and responsiveness. The authors propose reorientation of the CSP model to study responsibility through a governance perspective.</p>
<p>The final research article, by Naomi A. Gardberg and William Newburry, addresses “Who Boycotts Whom? Marginalization, Company Knowledge, and Strategic Issues.” Applying marginalization theory, the authors develop a model of boycotts incorporating both individual motives and corporate strategic issues. They analyze more than 25,000 evaluations of 59 companies. Members of marginalized groups, especially upwardly mobile members, are more likely to boycott. This propensity declines with greater knowledge of the company and increases when companies are organized boycott targets. Types of boycotts are associated with strategic issues.</p>
