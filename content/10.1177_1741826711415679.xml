<p><bold>Background:</bold> We aim to investigate the effect of exercise training on endothelial function and exercise capacity in patients with coronary artery disease.</p>
<p><bold>Methods and results:</bold> A randomized, controlled trial was conducted to determine the effects of an 8-week exercise training programme (<italic>n </italic>= 32) vs. controls (<italic>n </italic>= 32) on brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in patients with stable CAD. After 8 weeks, patients received exercise training had significant improvements in FMD (1.84%, <italic>p </italic>= 0.002) and exercise capacity (2.04 metabolic equivalents, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001) compared with controls. The change in FMD correlated inversely with baseline FMD (<italic>r </italic>= −0.41, <italic>p </italic>= 0.001) and positively with the increase in exercise capacity (<italic>r </italic>= 0.35, <italic>p </italic>= 0.005). After adjusting for confounders, every 1 metabolic equivalent increase in exercise capacity was associated with 0.55% increase in FMD. Furthermore, patients received exercise training had significantly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decreased diastolic blood pressure and resting heart rate compared with controls. However, exercise training did not alter high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, oxidative stress measured as superoxide dismutase and 8-isoprostane, and CD34/KDR + endothelial progenitor cell count. Subgroup analysis showed that FMD was significantly improved only in CAD patients with baseline low exercise capacity (&lt;median value of 7.65 metabolic equivalents, <italic>p </italic>= 0.004) but not in those with normal exercise capacity.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Exercise training improved FMD and exercise capacity in stable CAD patients independent of the changes in inflammation, oxidative stress, or endothelial progenitor cells. The beneficial effects of exercise training on FMD and exercise capacity are inter-related, and more pronounced in those with baseline impaired exercise capacity.</p>

<p>Exercise training reduces total and cardiovascular mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711415679">1</xref></sup> however, the mechanisms remain unclear. Although physical activity can effectively modify conventional cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity, lowering blood pressure (BP), lipoprotein levels and diabetes mellitus (DM),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711415679">2</xref></sup> the beneficial effects of exercise on these risk factors cannot fully account for the magnitude of risk protection from cardiovascular events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711415679">3</xref></sup> Endothelial dysfunction precedes the development of atherosclerosis and is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711415679">4</xref></sup> Previous clinical trials have shown that an exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programme improves endothelial function in CAD patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711415679">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711415679">7</xref></sup> However, these studies were limited by a relatively small sample size, an inpatient setting with a highly intensive training protocol,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711415679">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711415679">6</xref></sup> exclusion of female subjects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711415679">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711415679">7</xref></sup> and a lack of randomization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711415679">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, it is also unknown whether the improvement in exercise capacity (EC) through exercise training is related to the change in endothelial function in CAD patients. Apart from modifying conventional cardiovascular risk factors and endothelial function, exercise training may also exert its vasoprotective effect, including reducing systemic inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711415679">8</xref></sup> and oxidative stress,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711415679">9</xref></sup> and increasing the endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) count.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711415679">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711415679">11</xref></sup> In this study, we hypothesized that exercise training improve EC and vascular function in CAD patients. Accordingly, we performed a randomized controlled study to investigate the effects of and underlying mechanisms by which an 8-week exercise training programme exerts on brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and EC in stable CAD patients.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1741826711415679"><title>Study population</title>
<p>Consecutive stable CAD patients having &gt;50% stenosis in at least one of the major coronary arteries as documented by coronary angiogram were recruited. All patients received stable medications for &gt;6 months before enrolment. Patients with recent acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention in the past 3 months, significant valvular heart disease(s) as defined by symptomatic valvular stenosis or valvular regurgitation of more than mild in severity, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;45%, exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, significant renal (serum creatinine levels &gt;2.5 mg/dl) or hepatic dysfunction (liver parenchymal enzyme &gt;3 times normal), and severe orthopaedic conditions that prohibit exercise were excluded from the study. The study fully conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki, and the research protocol was approved by the local institutional review board. A written informed consent was obtained for each subject. This study was registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.hkclinicaltrials.com">www.hkclinicaltrials.com</ext-link> (number HKCTR-554).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711415679"><title>Study design</title>
<p>This was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial and the study design is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711415679">Figure 1</xref>. Initially, 110 patients who were eligible for the study based on review of medical records were interviewed by phone. Among them, 66 verbally consented to participate in the study. During the initial screening assessment, two patients were deemed ineligible due to renal dysfunction (<italic>n </italic>= 1) and unable to perform exercise training due to knee problem (<italic>n </italic>= 1). As a result, a total of 64 patients were randomly assigned to an 8-week course of exercise training group or to a non-exercise control group in 1:1 fashion. Specifically, each patient was allocated into either intervention or control group by a number randomly generated from computer. Block randomizations (<italic>n </italic>= 8) were used throughout the procedure. To minimize bias, only the principal investigator but not the other operators who carried out the measurements was aware of the patients’ intervention groups. All patients underwent vascular ultrasound measurements, treadmill exercise testing, and fasting blood sampling at baseline and at week 8 follow-up. Patients in both the exercise intervention and control groups were required to attend health education and counselling classes focusing on long-term management of CAD and risk factor modification, such as smoking cessation, control of blood glucose and cholesterol and BP, weight reduction, and stress management. During the study period, all the medications in the study population remained unchanged.

</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711415679"><title>Exercise training protocol</title>
<p>Before exercise training, treadmill testing was used to determine the maximal EC, in terms of metabolic equivalents (METs) at peak exercise. Exercise testing was performed in a standard manner using symptom-limited Bruce protocol. Maximal exercise testing was performed such that peak EC can be achieved. The endpoints for termination of exercise testing included: reaching the targeted heart rate (HR), hypotensive response (drop in systolic BP &gt;10 mmHg from baseline BP), hypertensive response (systolic BP &gt;250 mmHg and/or diastolic BP &gt;115 mmHg), moderately severe angina, fatigue, shortness of breath, and ST or QRS changes such as excessive ST depression (&gt;2 mm horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression).</p>
<p>Participants in the intervention arm were required to undergo 8 weeks of supervised, outpatient training sessions three times per week. As previously described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711415679">12</xref></sup> each session would last for an hour with combined endurance and resistance exercise, beginning with warm-up stretching exercise for 5 minutes. This was followed by a training protocol lasting 50 minutes. During this period, endurance exercise including treadmill, ergometry, rowing, steps, arm ergometry, and resistance exercise including dumbbell or weight training were performed. The intensity of resistance exercise was also based on rating of perceived exertion (in addition to % maximal HR) so that the training intensity is similar to that of endurance training. The training intensity was gradually increased in the first 3–4 weeks until 80% of maximal HR was reached. At the end of each session, subjects were instructed to perform muscle stretching for 5 minutes as a cool-down phase. For each session, the type and duration of exercise, rating of perceived exertion, treadmill speed and grade, and cycle workload were recorded. Haemodynamic status, including HR and BP, were documented before and after each type of exercise. Telemetry was used to monitor electrocardiographic changes in all patients. Training compliance was calculated in terms of percentage of exercise sessions (a total of 24) attended.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711415679"><title>Demographic, clinical, and laboratory evaluations</title>
<p>Baseline demographic data and cardiovascular medications were documented in all subjects. Cardiovascular risk factors, including tobacco smoking, DM, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, and family history of cardiovascular diseases diagnosed in first-degree relatives before 55 years of age were assessed. The body height and weight, BP, and body mass index (BMI) of all subjects were measured as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711415679">13</xref></sup> Hypertension was defined as BP ≥140/90 mmHg at two different clinical visits or the use of medications for BP lowering. DM was defined as fasting serum glucose of ≥7.0 mmol/l or on medications. Hypercholesterolaemia was defined as a fasting total serum cholesterol level of ≥4.9 mmol/l or on medications. Smoking status was recorded as either smoker (past or current) or non-smoker.</p>
<p>Fasting blood samples were obtained from all subjects to determine serum creatinine, glucose, and lipid levels, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride, apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and lipoprotein (a)[Lp(a)]. Plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level was measured using a Hitachi 747 analyser (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany), and a particle-enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711415679">14</xref></sup> Oxidative stress was measured as superoxide dismutase (SOD), an important antioxidant enzyme and 8-isoprostane, a marker of lipid peroxidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711415679">15</xref></sup> The lower limits of detection of hsCRP, SOD, and 8-isoprostane were 0.1 mg/l, 0.025 U/ml and 45 pg/ml, respectively, and their intra-assay coefficient of variation were 8% 6.1, and 6.7%, respectively (<italic>n </italic>= 10).</p>
<p>Circulating EPC count was defined by the co-expression of surface markers CD34/KDR, and measured by flow cytometry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711415679">13</xref></sup> Briefly, 100 µl of peripheral blood was incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against human KDR (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated CD34 antibodies (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). FITC-labelled anti-human CD45 antibody was used for differential gating during flow analysis. FITC-labelled IgG1a (Beckman Coulter) and phycoerythrin-labelled IgG2b (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) served as the isotypic control for colour compensation. Analysis was performed with an automated fluorescence-activated cell counter (Elite; Beckman Coulter) in which 1,000,000 events were counted. The percentages of all the measured components defined as the absolute cell counts divided by the lymphocyte counts were calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711415679"><title>Brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation</title>
<p>Vascular ultrasound was performed with a high-resolution ultrasound system (Agilent Sonos 5500; Philips, Andover, MA) with the use of a 7.5-MHz linear array transducer by a single experienced operator without knowledge of the subjects. All subjects were studied in the fasting state, and all vasoactive medications were withheld for 12 hours or more before the study. The brachial artery was imaged above the antecubital fossa in the longitudinal plane, and a stereotactic probe-holding device was utilized to stabilize the probe during the measurement process. The pneumatic tourniquet was placed on the subject’s forearm, so that the ultrasound probe is placed proximal to the pneumatic tourniquet. As previously described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711415679">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711415679">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711415679">16</xref></sup> longitudinal scans of the artery were obtained at rest, and then brachial FMD was induced by inflation of a pneumatic tourniquet placed on the forearm to a pressure of 250 mmHg for 5 minutes. The diameter of the brachial artery was allowed to return to baseline. Finally, the diameter of the brachial artery was obtained 5 minutes after administration of 400 µg sublingual nitroglycerin spray. FMD was calculated as the percentage change in diameter from baseline to the diameter at 60 seconds of reactive hyperaemia. Nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation (NMD) was defined as the percentage change in brachial artery diameter 5 minutes after nitrate administration. All of the scanned images were stored digitally and analysed offline with manual measurement by the same operator, who was blinded to the identity of study subjects. An investigation of 25 patients revealed an intra-observer variability correlation coefficient of 0.90 (<italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741826711415679"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Primary endpoint was the change from baseline in endothelium-dependent FMD. Secondary endpoints were changes in EC, endothelium-independent NMD, HR, systolic and diastolic BP, and serum markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, glycaemic control, lipid profile, and circulating EPC. Based on the data from our cross-sectional study on a similar patient population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711415679">11</xref></sup> we calculated the sample size using a standard deviation of 2.65% for the change of FMD at 8 weeks from baseline. For 1:1 randomization into exercise intervention group and control group, we would need 28 patients in each arm, assuming an 80% power to detect an absolute change of 2% in FMD between the treatment and control group with a 5% maximum false-positive rate. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, at least 64 patients would be required.</p>
<p>Continuous variables were expressed as mean ±standard deviation. Categorical data were presented as frequencies and percentages. Statistical comparisons were performed with Student’s t-test for continuous variables or Pearson’s chi-squared test for categorical variables. Bivariate correlations were studied using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to adjust for the baseline values in comparing the means of outcome variables, i.e. the follow-up measurement was taken as the dependent variable with group allocation (exercise training vs. control) as independent variable correcting for the baseline value. Absolute changes and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of outcome variables were calculated using univariate and multivariate linear regression to determine the effect of increased EC after training. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 15.0. A two-sided <italic>p</italic>-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>A total of 64 patients were randomly allocated into training (<italic>n </italic>= 32) or control group (<italic>n </italic>= 32). Their baseline clinical characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711415679">Table 1</xref>. Overall, their mean age was 67.1 ± 8.4 years and 75% were men. In the study population, 50% were smokers, 70% had hypercholesterolaemia, 67% had hypertension, and 38% had DM. All subjects had stable CAD, and among them 28% had history of myocardial infarction and 91% had received prior revascularization. Their mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 60.1 ± 5.9%, and none of the patients had New York Heart Association Class III or IV symptoms, at baseline. Apart from a lower total cholesterol, LDL-C and ApoB in the intervention arm (<italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05), all other baseline characteristics were not significantly different between the two groups (<italic>p </italic>&gt; 0.05). All patients completed the final follow-up after the 8-week intervention. Subjects who underwent exercise training had satisfactory compliance, with a mean attendance rate of 94% of all sessions.

<p>Our results demonstrated that the 8-week exercise training programme improved endothelial function and EC in patients with stable CAD. The changes in FMD and EC are inter-related, and more pronounced in those with baseline impaired EC. Furthermore, exercise training also increased HDL-C level and reduced resting HR and diastolic BP compared with controls. Nevertheless, there were no significant changes in inflammation, oxidative stress or circulating EPC count after exercise training. These findings suggest that improving endothelial function and altering conventional cardiovascular risk factors such as lipid profile, BP, and HR by exercise intervention might contribute to its cardiovascular protective effect in patients with established CAD.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that exercise training improved endothelial function in CAD patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711415679">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711415679">7</xref></sup> In the present randomized controlled study, we have confirmed that exercise training was associated with 50% relative increase in FMD as compared with controls. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the improvement of endothelial function with exercise training was independent of the change in inflammation, oxidative stress, and circulating EPC. Endothelial function largely depends on nitric oxide (NO), which is produced by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in endothelial cells and functions as a potent vasodilator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711415679">17</xref></sup> Ageing and cardiovascular diseases are associated with endothelial dysfunction through different mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711415679">17</xref></sup> Specifically, reactive oxygen species induced by atherogenic factors exert significant detrimental effect on the vascular endothelium by decreasing NO bioavailability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711415679">18</xref></sup> Physiologically, exercise produces transient hyperaemia to the exercised limbs and to the coronary circulation. As a result of exercise training, the repetitive increases in coronary and peripheral blood flow expose the endothelium to increased shear stress, leading to adaptations that eventually enhance the bioavailability of NO. Recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711415679">6</xref></sup> have shown that improvement in FMD in trained subjects is correlated with increased eNOS protein expression and phosphorylation of eNOS at the Ser1177 residue, resulting in augmented NO synthesis. In view of the evidence that endothelial dysfunction is predictive of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with established CAD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711415679">4</xref></sup> exercise-induced improvement in FMD may eventually lead to a better prognosis in these high-risk patients.</p>
<p>The observation that only endothelium-dependent FMD, but not endothelium-independent NMD, was improved by exercise training is consistent with previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711415679">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711415679">7</xref></sup> The endothelium-independent NMD remained unchanged after exercise training, suggesting that exercise training primarily corrects endothelial dysfunction but not improve vascular smooth muscle cell responsiveness. It has been postulated that short-term exercise training leads to enhanced endothelial vasodilatory function, which serves to buffer shear stress during early exercise periods. However, longer-term training may be required to stimulate changes in the vessel wall, represented by a corresponding increase in endothelium-independent vascular function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711415679">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>EC expressed as the peak MET level or peak oxygen intake is an estimate of cardiorespiratory fitness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711415679">2</xref></sup> and a strong predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711415679">20</xref></sup> Recent epidemiological studies suggested that physical fitness may be as important as regular physical activity in determining cardiovascular outcomes, and every 1 MET increase in fitness conferred a 20% survival benefit in patients referred for exercise testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711415679">21</xref></sup> Our study showed that exercise training resulted in an increase of 2.04 METs in EC (relative increase 25%). The improvement in EC was also associated with an augmented FMD, with 0.55% increment in FMD for every 1 MET increase in EC, after adjustment for confounders. Furthermore, the exercise intervention in CAD patients with a low fitness level at baseline (METs level below median value) had an augmented gain in EC, accompanied by a significant rise in FMD and HDL-C, which were not detected in those with normal physical fitness. These results imply that patients with low baseline cardiorespiratory fitness had more prominent responses to exercise training, which might help to improve their prognosis through increasing EC, alleviating endothelial dysfunction, and modifying cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, those with a relatively well preserved endothelial function may require a higher dose of training in order to attain similar degree of vasoprotective effect.</p>
<p>Previous studies found that the intensity of exercise training or regular physical activity is associated with the improvement in aerobic capacity and the reduction of risk for CAD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711415679">22</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711415679">24</xref></sup> Indeed, dose–response relationships exist between physical activity and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and type 2 DM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711415679">25</xref></sup> In particular, CAD incidence and mortality are associated with physical activity in an inverse, dose–response manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711415679">26</xref></sup> In patients with chronic heart failure, changes in endothelium-dependent vasodilation also correlated with the change in EC after exercise training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711415679">27</xref></sup> This relationship can be explained by the observation that better endothelial function results in a more coordinated vasculature that preferentially supplies blood flow to oxidative muscles during exercise, thus improving aerobic capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711415679">27</xref></sup> Consistent with these observations, our results demonstrated that changes in the EC and endothelial function after training are inter-related.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the vasoprotective effects of exercise training have also been attributed to an improvement in blood lipid profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711415679">28</xref></sup> and reduction in BP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711415679">29</xref></sup> and systemic inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711415679">8</xref></sup> Our results showed that exercise training increased HDL-C, marginally reduced triglyceride levels, and lowered resting HR and diastolic (but not systolic) BP. Extending these findings into clinical context, the 7% improvement in HDL-C demonstrated in our study is comparable to the treatment effect of gemfibrozil, which is associated with a 22% decrease in the 5-year risk of myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711415679">30</xref></sup> On the other hand, hsCRP, markers for oxidative stress, circulating EPC and levels of lipoproteins were not altered by exercise training in this study. In addition, the improvement in FMD did not correlate with changes in BP and lipid profile, suggesting that exercise training improved FMD independent of its anti-hypertensive and lipid-lowering effects. Indeed, this is in agreement with prior studies that the exercise-induced improvement on vascular function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741826711415679">31</xref></sup> is independent of changes in cardiovascular risk factors.</p>
<p>Exercise plays a vital role in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711415679">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741826711415679">32</xref></sup> Our findings suggest that exercise training in CAD patients improves endothelial function, increases HDL cholesterol and lowers diastolic BP, and these changes have been previously reported to favour clinical outcome. In particular, patients with a low baseline fitness level had prominent improvements in EC, FMD, and HDL-C. We also demonstrated that the improvement in EC correlated with the increase in FMD, providing further evidence for the link between exercise training intensity and vascular function.</p>
<sec id="sec13-1741826711415679"><title>Study limitations</title>
<p>There are several limitations in our study. First, imaging of the brachial artery in the measurement of FMD was performed manually instead of using automated methods in this study. Thu use of computerized edge-detection and wall-tracking software implemented in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711415679">19</xref></sup> may minimize investigator bias and a lower coefficient of variation when compared to manual methods. Second, we employed an arbitrary time frame of 60 seconds of reactive hyperaemia for FMD measurement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741826711415679">33</xref></sup> However, recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741826711415679">34</xref></sup> challenged the method of measuring FMD using an arbitrary time frame, since peak dilation often occurs outside the arbitrary time point of 60 seconds. The clinical significance of different methods in measuring FMD is unknown. Third, although we demonstrated an inter-relationship between exercise-induced improvements in EC and endothelial function, the mechanistic insights of such a relationship have yet to be explored and require further clinical studies.</p>
