<p>The distinctiveness of Scotland within the UK is highly significant both in terms of social policy and the delivery of social work services, but this has not always been acknowledged in standard social policy texts. Consequently, Scottish-based students have been under-served by what is available, and, further afield, confusion and misunderstanding abounds about the Scottish context. This has been abundantly clear to me as External Examiner to English-based social work programmes, for example, where students have written about the ‘British Education System’ and ‘British Legal System’. This book therefore is hugely welcome, and the team from Robert Gordon University are to be congratulated on putting together a well-structured, thematically organised and comprehensive volume on social policy from a Scottish perspective.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three parts: Part 1 covers the overall context of social policy, and for me, this was the most disappointing part. The initial chapter seeks to explain what social policy is, and how policy is developed with particular reference to Scotland. The outlines of the Scottish legal structure and the devolved powers of the Scottish Parliament are useful but the statement that ‘there is no right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the UK in Scotland in relation to criminal matters’ (p. 15) is inaccurate; this right (written into the Scotland Act, 1998) currently is subject to fierce political debate. The second, historical chapter helpfully explains some important differences in how the Poor Laws operated in Scotland (in comparison with England) but coverage post-1979 is rather cursory, and underplays, for example, Scottish resistance to Thatcherism and to privatisation in community care.</p>
<p>Themes and issues are covered in Part 2: Poverty and Social Exclusion; Risk, Support and Protection; Changing Patterns of Care; Welfare Rights; and Social Policy Perspectives on Employment. I found the Maas-Lowit chapter on ‘Risk’ (Chapter 6) to be a model of coherence and clarity. He provides a clearly articulated thesis on risk – focusing on both the beneficial and harmful aspects of risk and recognising the increasing preoccupation with risk as ‘unavoidable’ – which is then applied to the Scottish context with relevant examples of policy-making and its influences, specifically the Borders Inquiry (2004) concerning the abuse of a vulnerable woman with learning disabilities and the tragic child protection case of Caleb Ness (2003). The chapter on ‘Changing Patterns of Care’ highlights UK-level developments in community care, but also uniquely Scottish policies such as ‘Free Personal Care’ (2002) which, despite severe cutbacks in public expenditure, remains a flagship policy in post-devolution Scotland. McKay’s chapter on ‘empowerment’ succeeds in providing a readable account of a complex concept, relating this clearly to a Scottish context, emphasising, for example, the Scottish government’s preference for the term ‘social inclusion’ rather than ‘social exclusion’ as used elsewhere in the UK.</p>
<p>The final part covers more specific policy contexts and service user groups. The chapters on ‘Disability’, ‘Substance Use’ and the ‘Criminal Justice System’ stand out because of the balance they achieve between coverage of UK-wide issues and policies, and specific responses to these within Scotland. Despite political attempts to wrest criminal justice from social work, this remains a prominent aspect of social work services within Scotland, as Shirran’s chapter explains. A particularly welcome chapter is that on ‘Asylum and Immigration’ where much of the relevant legislation is reserved (i.e. to Westminster) but where, as Swan argues, a Scottish perspective is necessary, most especially when children, and provisions of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, are involved.</p>
<p>The book’s numerous tables and figures mean that specific, relevant information such as on the chronology of policy formation and legislative enactment is readily accessible (albeit some of this inevitably will go out of date). The inclusion of case studies and exercises renders the material particularly useful to students. A notable omission is recognition of the impact of Scandinavian social welfare ideas on social policy in Scotland, with the Children’s Hearing system being an example of this enduring influence.</p>
<p>This is a book I undoubtedly will recommend to current social work and other caring profession students and hope its readership will extend beyond this nation to develop a better understanding of the diversity of social policy and social work within the UK.</p>
