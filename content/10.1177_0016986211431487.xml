<abstract>
<p>This study examined the average effects of schools’ third through fifth grade gifted programming policy in mathematics and reading on overall school achievement, on gifted students’ achievement and academic attitudes and on nongifted students’ achievement and academic attitudes. Data and results represent a broad, national look at school personnel–reported programming without distinction as to type, length, or degree of programming. No detrimental effects were found at the overall school level or for nongifted students. However, the results also indicated that, on average, the diverse programs reported in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1988-1989 (ECLS-K) database had no effect on gifted students’ achievement or academic attitudes. Considered in light of prior research indicating benefits of specific programs and existing inconsistent policies and programs, this suggests the need for future research to determine effective program characteristics and suggests that policy makers, educators, and parents actively must seek research-based practices to use with gifted children.</p>

<p>The effects of gifted programs have become an area of scrutiny among teachers, parents, administrators, and educational researchers for a number of reasons. First, in light of tight school budgets and funding cuts that occur on a regular basis and especially in the present economic crisis, school administrators must determine how to spend the money they do have available—that is, they must decide which programs are worth the investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0016986211431487">Adams, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0016986211431487">Purcell, 1995</xref>). Although at the heart of this debate are the needs of students, this decision must be considered conceptually within a framework of whether, with limited resources, school administrators are serving the needs of gifted learners while not being detrimental to overall school achievement or to other learners. Additionally, our society is engaged in a philosophical debate about equity versus excellence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0016986211431487">Borland, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0016986211431487">Gallagher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0016986211431487">Robbins, 2007</xref>). On one hand, society wants our students, including our top students, to be competitive in a global economy, to excel, and to become productive adults. On the other hand, critics of gifted education (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0016986211431487">de Vise, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0016986211431487">Grant, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0016986211431487">Sapon-Shevin, 1993</xref>) have expressed some concerns about possible detrimental effects on other students when gifted programming, and thus funding, is provided to gifted students. One argument is that nongifted students may be disadvantaged and their achievement may actually decrease when programming is provided to gifted students but not to other students. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0016986211431487">Worrell and White (2009)</xref> pointed out, some critiques have suggested that “gifted education is responsible for maintaining the achievement gap” (p. 259).</p>
<p>Although educators generally agree that students come to school with varying levels of readiness and ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0016986211431487">Rimm-Kaufman &amp; Pianta, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0016986211431487">Rimm-Kaufman, Pianta, &amp; Cox, 2000</xref>), the field of education does not have a consensus on how to meet the needs of diverse learners, particularly gifted students, as evidenced by the wide range of programming options districts report using (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0016986211431487">Gubbins et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0016986211431487">National Association for Gifted Children [NAGC], 2009</xref>). In contrast to the legal protection provided to special education, the federal government does not mandate programming for gifted students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0016986211431487">Baker &amp; Friedman-Nimz, 2002</xref>). Educators and administrators who must make this policy decision are faced with a critical question: What are the effects of gifted programming on <italic>all</italic> students; that is, how does this policy affect gifted students, nongifted students, and overall school achievement? This study is organized around the overarching question of whether a policy providing gifted programming responds to gifted learners’ academic and emotional needs while either benefitting, or at least not disadvantaging, other students.</p>
<sec id="section1-0016986211431487">
<title>Background of the Study</title>
<p>There are an estimated 3,000,000 academically gifted students in U.S. classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0016986211431487">NAGC, 2009</xref>), but both between and within states, there is a disparity of services for these students. In fact, “with the lack of a federal policy, mandate, or funding as a backdrop, the current condition of gifted education in the states is mixed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0016986211431487">NAGC, 2007</xref>, p. 11). Because decisions are made at state and local levels, students in one school might receive gifted programming while those in a neighboring school might not. In fact, in all but 11 of the states, a student can move from one school to another within the same state and have a change in identification as gifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0016986211431487">NAGC, 2009</xref>). Similarly, only two states require the acceptance of gifted identification from other states when a student moves.</p>
<p>However, the “State of the States in Gifted Education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0016986211431487">NAGC, 2009</xref>) indicated that students who are gifted and talented “require a responsive and challenging educational system to help them achieve their highest potential” (p. 7). Advocates of gifted education promote gifted programming as a means to provide this appropriate education. Some of these advocates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0016986211431487">Delcourt, Cornell, &amp; Goldberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0016986211431487">Rogers, 2007</xref>) have argued that two of the primary goals for providing gifted education are to increase learning and achievement to a level matching students’ potential and to enhance self-concept by allowing students to interact and learn with like-ability peers with similar interests. Although educators and theorists alike hold these beliefs about the benefits of gifted programming, the field lacks empirical evidence to back these claims as established facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0016986211431487">Delcourt et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>One reason the field lacks empirical evidence of the effects of gifted programming on achievement and academic attitudes is that researching these effects has been problematic because we cannot randomly assign gifted students to a gifted program. That is, researchers studying the effects of gifted programming may have difficulty obtaining adequate control groups because of “the ethical problem of withholding service from qualified students” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0016986211431487">Vaughn, Feldhusen, &amp; Asher, 1991</xref>, p. 92). Similarly, we cannot randomly assign nongifted students to a school providing gifted programming or randomly assign schools to adopt a policy providing gifted programming. As a result, researchers must use quasi-experimental techniques to evaluate the efficacy of gifted programs. However, this often results in control groups and treatment groups that differ “in many systematic (nonrandom) ways other than the presence of the treatment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0016986211431487">Shadish, Cook, &amp; Campbell, 2002</xref>, p. 14). Group differences that exist prior to treatment (selection bias) threaten the internal validity of the study and hamper the researcher’s ability to make causal inferences. This is particularly problematic without a consistent means of identifying students as gifted, which often results in students who are gifted in one school not being considered gifted in another and thus, comparison groups not actually being comparable.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, some research has addressed the benefits of gifted programming. However, many of the published articles have focused on the effects of a specific curriculum on students participating without using a comparison group (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0016986211431487">Clark, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0016986211431487">Feng, VanTassel-Baska, Quek, Bai, &amp; O’Neill, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0016986211431487">Gavin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0016986211431487">VanTassel-Baska, Avery, Little, &amp; Hughes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0016986211431487">Wilkins, Wilkins, &amp; Oliver 2006</xref>). Others are either journalistic or philosophical articles, advocating the benefits of gifted programming (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0016986211431487">Gallagher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0016986211431487">Matthews &amp; Foster, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0016986211431487">Reis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0016986211431487">Winebrenner &amp; Devlin, 2001</xref>). Unfortunately, the field has few empirical studies that directly examine the policy implications of providing gifted programming, comparing the achievement and academic attitudes of students in gifted programs with those of similar ability who attend schools that do not provide programming. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0016986211431487">Rogers (2007)</xref> found more empirical research studies than descriptive literature articles for only 5 of the 55 lesson elements or practices she reviewed. Similarly, in a review of articles dating back to 1990 on the cognitive and affective learning outcomes of gifted elementary school students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0016986211431487">Delcourt et al. (2007)</xref> concluded that “research on the effects of gifted programs is still generally sparse, unsystematic, and far from conclusive” (p. 361) and did not find data indicating “comprehensive effects” of gifted programming on achievement or attitudes.</p>
<p>The limited research using a comparison group and some adjustment for selection bias to study the effects of gifted programming on upper elementary students’ reading and mathematics achievement or attitudes has produced mixed results. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0016986211431487">Aldrich and Mills (1989)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0016986211431487">Delcourt et al. (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0016986211431487">Reis et al. (1993)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0016986211431487">Roberts, Ingram, and Harris (1992)</xref> found higher achievement for students in a gifted program compared with other gifted students. In specific content areas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0016986211431487">VanTassel-Baska, Zuo, Avery, and Little (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0016986211431487">Gavin, Casa, Adelson, Carroll, and Sheffield (2009)</xref> found higher literature and mathematics achievement, respectively, when high-end curriculum was used, particularly in self-contained settings. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0016986211431487">Feldhusen, Sayler, Nielsen, and Kolloff (1990)</xref> found improved self-concept for students in a gifted program. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0016986211431487">Carter (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0016986211431487">Lynch and Mills (1990)</xref> found mixed results, depending on whether the outcome was reading or mathematics achievement, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0016986211431487">VanTassel-Baska, Willis, and Meyer (1989)</xref> found mixed results depending on the type of cognitive ability being measured. Although Aldrich and Mills found consistently higher achievement, they did not find higher self-concept for treatment or control students. Additional research studying subject areas such as social studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0016986211431487">VanTassel-Baska, Bass, Ries, Poland, &amp; Avery, 1998</xref>) and science (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0016986211431487">Little, Feng, VanTassel-Baska, Rogers, &amp; Avery, 2007</xref>) have found significant gains for gifted as well as nongifted learners in areas beyond the scope of this study, suggesting the diversity of academic outcomes as well as the focus of gifted programming.</p>
<p>Given that these research studies tended to use small samples, did not focus on gifted programming in general, and found mixed results, further research on the effects of gifted programming is greatly needed. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0016986211431487">Neihart (2007)</xref> noted, there is a need for research comparing gifted students receiving programming with those not receiving programming on “standardized, objective measures.” This would “strengthen the empirical base for specific recommendations” (p. 337).</p>
<p>Not only is there a scarcity of published empirical studies examining the effects of gifted programming on gifted students, there are no studies that take into consideration the effects that providing gifted programming has on overall school achievement and on students not provided services. That is, they fail to answer the question of what effects the program has on students not directly served by the program, which would help us determine if we are serving the needs of gifted students while not being detrimental to other students.</p>

<title>Research Questions (RQs)</title>
<p>This study has five empirical questions focused on examining the effects of gifted education at the elementary school level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0016986211431487">Table 1</xref>). These questions examine the effects on overall school achievement, on the achievement and academic attitudes of gifted students, and on the achievement and academic attitudes of nongifted students.

<title>Sample</title>
<p>This study used data from the restricted-use Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1988-1989 (ECLS-K) data set.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0016986211431487">1</xref></sup> The ECLS-K is a nationally representative sample of kindergartners in 1998-1999 and their teachers and schools. It contains repeated observations of the students and their families, teachers, and schools from fall and spring of their kindergarten year (1998-1999) and the spring of their first-grade (2000), third-grade (2002), and fifth-grade year (2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0016986211431487">Tourangeau, Nord, Lê, Pollack, &amp; Atkins-Burnett, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Teachers reported students’ participation in gifted programming separately for reading and for mathematics, and in fact, reported that 49% of gifted students were in a program only in one domain and not the other. Because of this and the fact that the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) only collected mathematics data on about half of the students, we selected and analyzed the mathematics and reading samples separately. Each sample was selected purposefully from the larger database. First, the analytic samples only included students who were first-time kindergartners and who were in the same school for third and fifth grades. Additionally, each sample only included students in schools with a consistent third through fifth grade gifted programming policy and who consistently were or were not in a gifted program in that subject for third and fifth grade. These constraints allowed for the creation of a propensity score (PS) predicting gifted programming in third grade and the use of school-level variables from third grade without introducing bias in examinations of fifth-grade school effects and student outcomes. The reading sample size for this study was about 5,630 students in 850 different schools. Because of NCES only linking half of the sample to mathematics teachers, the final sample size for mathematics was about 2,740 students in 720 different schools.</p>
<p>The ECLS-K includes a teacher-reported variable on whether a student was in a gifted program in mathematics and in reading. However, the data are somewhat ambiguous as to whether a school had a gifted program in each subject in third and fifth grade. To address this issue, we took several variables into consideration. Specifically, we used administrator-reported variables from multiple waves of data collection about whether the school had a gifted program and the number of full- and part-time gifted teachers as well as teacher-reported variables about the number of identified and participating gifted students in the class to help determine if the school had a gifted program in mathematics and reading (separately). This allowed us to triangulate the data rather than relying on one school personnel–reported variable.</p>
<p>To address missing data in the covariates, we used multiple imputation. Because we did not use the complete data set and used both triangulation and multiple imputation of the data, we compared the students in the analytic sample with the original approximately 7,770 first-time kindergartners, who were in the same school for third and fifth grade. The samples were quite similar in demographic information, including gender, ethnicity, and household income. We also compared the demographics about their schools, which also were quite similar on demographics, including region, sector, mean student socioeconomic status (SES), percentage free lunch, and percentage minority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0016986211431487">2</xref></sup></p>

The propensity of schools to provide gifted programming in each subject was estimated using data only from third grade, as students were permitted to change schools prior to that. To determine which variables were effective pretreatment and during-treatment covariates, we ran correlations of theoretically important student- and school-level variables with outcome (achievement or academic attitudes) and treatment (gifted programming) separately for reading and mathematics.</p>

<title>Outcome variables</title>
<p>The achievement variables were reading and mathematics scale scores calibrated using item response theory. These assessments have established construct validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0016986211431487">Pollack, Najarian, Rock, Atkins-Burnett, &amp; Hausken, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, they were adaptive and carefully designed to minimize the potential for ceiling effects. For instance, a second-stage form with items beyond the target-ability range was used so that they would be difficult enough to measure extreme high ability accurately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0016986211431487">Pollack et al., 2005</xref>). In fact, only 7.4% of students achieved the highest level of proficiency on the reading assessment (evaluating nonfiction), and only 1.7% achieved the highest level of proficiency on the mathematics assessment (area and volume). No students scored a probability of all correct answers.</p>
<p>The reliability of the mathematics scores from kindergarten to fifth grade ranged from .89 to .94, and the reliability of the reading scores for the same period ranged from .91 to .96 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0016986211431487">Tourangeau et al., 2006</xref>). The fifth-grade mathematics mean score for this study’s sample was 114.92 (<italic>SD</italic> = 20.64), and the school mean was 113.48 (<italic>SD</italic> = 17.04). For reading, the sample’s fifth-grade mean score was 141.08 (<italic>SD</italic> = 22.62), and school mean was 139.17 (<italic>SD</italic> = 17.62).</p>
<p>The measures of academic attitudes were surveys on students’ interest and perceived competence in reading and mathematics in third and fifth grade. The ECLS-K data set includes a separate composite scale score (the mean rating for the items on the scale, with a minimum of 1 and maximum of 4) for students’ academic attitudes in each of these subjects. These scales were adapted from Marsh’s Self-Description Questionnaire I. Each scale had eight items that asked students their perceptions of their grades, the difficulty of work, and their interest and enjoyment in the subject. Scores on both scales exhibited high internal consistency reliability (.90 and .92, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0016986211431487">Tourangeau et al., 2006</xref>). The mathematics fifth-grade mean score was 2.90 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.77), and the reading fifth-grade mean score was 3.01 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.72).</p>

<title>Propensity score (PS) variables</title>
<p>Because the ECLS-K data set is so rich, we were able to include variables specific to each domain in the separate PSs. At the individual level, we identified 262 mathematics and 300 reading pretreatment covariates<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0016986211431487">3</xref></sup> that were theoretically important and had a bivariate association either with achievement or academic attitudes using the entire sample or with being in a gifted program using only students in schools with gifted programming. The variables we chose address many of the components of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0016986211431487">Gagné’s (2008)</xref> Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent (DMGT), such as students’ natural abilities and academic competencies (e.g., prior achievement, teacher rating of student ability), intrapersonal catalysts, including traits (e.g., gender, race, whether the student has an individualized education program [IEP]) and goal management (e.g., measures of self-control, cooperation, and attention), and environmental catalysts, including parent participation (e.g., reasons parents contact the school and parent attendance at open house and PTA meetings) and parent demographics (e.g., SES, mother’s education level, type of mother and father, and language spoken). Additionally, these variables take into account some of the disparities seen in gifted identification. For example, the “State of the States in Gifted Education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0016986211431487">NAGC, 2009</xref>) reported greater numbers of White students and, in many states, greater proportion of females in gifted programs, and research has shown minorities and students from homes of lower SES are less likely to be in gifted programs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0016986211431487">Delcourt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0016986211431487">McBee, 2010</xref>). The PS variables were from both kindergarten waves as well as the first- and third-grade waves. To account for local norms, or students’ achievement relative to their peers, particularly for students of lower income, we created an additional covariate for the PS model to reflect the interaction between relative third-grade achievement and SES.</p>
<p>At the school level, we identified 73 mathematics and 82 reading pretreatment covariates<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0016986211431487">3</xref></sup> that were theoretically important and had a bivariate association with the school’s gifted programming policy or mean achievement or attitudes scores. Many of these reflect differences found in gifted programming provisions across the states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0016986211431487">NAGC, 2007</xref>) whereas others reflect classroom practices and school goals that may be aligned with a philosophy that leads to the provision of gifted programming or have been found to be related to achievement. These included information about the school (e.g., region, public or private, percentage receiving free and reduced lunch, total enrollment, and school goals) as well as aggregated information about the students’ third-grade classrooms (e.g., time spent on domain-specific activities and topics, evaluation practices, materials available and used, and grouping practices). We also included variables on state mandates for services, identification, “other,” and funding from the 2006-2007 “State of the States in Gifted Education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0016986211431487">NAGC, 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-0016986211431487">
<title>Covariate composite scores</title>
<p>Additionally, we used variables from fifth grade to create composite scores used as covariates to account for other during-treatment factors that may explain differences in the treatment groups. These variables<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0016986211431487">4</xref></sup> addressed content coverage, such as the average frequency spent on specific National Council of Teachers of Mathematics content and process strands and International Reading Association standards. They also included information about the environment, teacher and classroom characteristics, time spent on the subject in the classroom, child characteristics, and parent involvement. Separately for school- and student-level covariates, we ran principal components analysis with oblimin rotation on the covariates to reduce the information in many variables into a set of weighted linear combinations of those variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0016986211431487">Pett, Lackey, &amp; Sullivan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0016986211431487">Preacher &amp; MacCullum, 2003</xref>). We considered both the scree plot and parallel analysis to decide the number of components and eliminated any variable without a factor loading of at least .30. Finally, we eliminated components with reliability less than .70 and items whose absence resulted in a significant increase in Cronbach’s alpha. This resulted in eight composite covariates for each subject (reading school-level—higher-level reading and writing classroom practices, basic reading and writing classroom practices, grouping practices and use of standards, teacher experience, teacher education; reading student-level—parent involvement, child assessment attitude, Title I participation; mathematics school-level—higher level mathematics classroom practices, basic mathematics classroom practices, evaluation practices, grouping practices, nonnumber strands, teacher experience; mathematics student-level—parent involvement and SES, child assessment attitude). We created factor scores using the least squares solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0016986211431487">Horst, 1965</xref>).</p>

<title>Relative achievement during-treatment covariate</title>
<p>Prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0016986211431487">Marsh, 1984</xref>) has indicated that a student who has high achievement in one subject but does not have as high achievement in another subject may have lower attitudes in the other subject because of making internal comparisons of his or her abilities. Therefore, for the analyses with attitudes as the outcome variable, we also included a student-level covariate comparing students’ achievement in the other domain compared with the domain of interest. Because the mathematics and reading scores are not on the same scale, we created z scores before calculating the difference. The purpose of this covariate was to account for students’ relative abilities in the two domains.</p>

<sec id="section10-0016986211431487">
<title>Data Analytic Techniques</title>
<p>Because students were clustered within schools, the assumption of independent units did not hold true. Therefore, we employed hierarchical linear modeling (HLM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0016986211431487">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>) using HLM 6. The decision to provide programming was made at the school level, and individual participation in the program was decided at the student level; therefore, we explicitly modeled the effects at both the individual and school level, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0016986211431487">Hong (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0016986211431487">Hong and Raudenbush (2005)</xref>. Furthermore, to adjust for selection bias because students were not assigned randomly to gifted programming and schools were not randomly assigned to a gifted programming policy, the analyses combined HLM with PS stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0016986211431487">Rosenbaum &amp; Rubin, 1983</xref>). Although causal inference is challenging, the comprehensiveness of the ECLS-K data and the PS-based adjustment method allows for “relatively more comprehensive control of the pretreatment differences than previously possible” (Hong &amp; Raudenbush, p. 220; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0016986211431487">Schneider, Carnoy, Kilpatrick, Schmidt, &amp; Shavelson, 2007</xref>). The research design of this study is modeled on the methodology used by Hong and Raudenbush to examine the effects of kindergarten retention.</p>
<p>For RQ 1, the average effect of providing gifted programming on overall school achievement, we estimated the average causal effect of a binary variable indicating whether a school provided a gifted program. Because schools were not assigned randomly to a gifted programming policy, we used PS stratification to balance the schools on school-level characteristics that can be regarded as pretreatment covariates. At Level 2, we included dummy codes for the strata, and we accounted for school level during-treatment covariates using the composite variables. If a composite variable was not a statistically significant predictor at the liberal .10 level, we removed it from the model.</p>
<p>RQ 2 and RQ 3 examined the average effects of gifted programming on gifted students’ mathematics and reading achievement and attitudes. Because it is impossible to observe which students attending schools that did not provide programs would participate if a program were provided (those comparable to the students provided programs), we first predicted the probability of participating in a gifted program using data from those who attended schools that provided one. This enabled us to identify how high the probability of being in the gifted program was for students actually in programs. Then, we applied the same prediction equation to those students attending schools that did not provide gifted programs, identifying students with similarly high predicted probabilities of being in the gifted program. Using a liberal definition of giftedness, as advocated by some prominent gifted education researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0016986211431487">Borland, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0016986211431487">Reis, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0016986211431487">Renzulli, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0016986211431487">Renzulli &amp; Reis, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0016986211431487">2009</xref>), we examined the top 20% of students in schools with gifted programming and then identified the minimum logit (an indicator of students’ conditional probability to be in a gifted program, given their pretreatment covariates) for a student in that strata to be classified as gifted. We defined gifted students as those students who consistently had a logit of at least that magnitude in all imputed data sets. This resulted in a subset of 9% of students being identified as gifted in reading and 7% of students being identified as gifted in mathematics. Finally, we estimated the average causal effect of gifted programs in mathematics and reading on those in the program by comparing the high-probability students in the schools that provided a program with the high-probability students in the schools that did not provide a program. We estimated this treatment effect by including a binary indicator of school programming policy at Level 2, because the decision to provide gifted programming is made at the school level. In these analyses, we balanced all the pretreatment covariates by including dummy codes, indicating the school PS strata at Level 2 and dummy codes indicating the student PS strata at Level 1. We also accounted for school- and student-level during-treatment covariates using the statistically significant composite scores (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) at Levels 1 and 2.</p>
<p>For RQ 4 and RQ 5, which addressed the effects of gifted programming on students who would not be identified for it even if their school adopted a policy to provide it (nongifted students), the same problem exists—it is impossible to observe which students attending schools that did not provide programs would not participate if a program were provided. We used similar methodology as that for RQ 2 and RQ 3, except we identified students who consistently had a logit below the minimum logit identified for gifted students (see above) as the nongifted comparison group. In a manner similar to what we did for the research questions concerning gifted students, we estimated the average causal effect of gifted programs in mathematics and reading on those who would not be in the program by comparing those low-probability students in the schools that provided a program with the low-probability students in the schools that did not provide a program after using PS stratification to balance student- and school-level pretreatment covariates and including during-treatment composite covariates.</p>

<title>RQ 1: Average Effects on Overall Achievement</title>
<p>The goal of the first set of analyses was to examine the average effect of providing gifted programming on overall school mathematics and reading achievement. Doing this required balancing the schools with a policy providing gifted programming (about 480 in reading and 410 in mathematics) and the schools not providing gifted programming (about 370 in reading and 310 in mathematics), on all known pretreatment covariates. For each subject, after creating the PSs, we divided the sample into five strata based on the logit of the school-level PS. To check whether the five strata had balanced distribution of the pretreatment covariates, we regressed the logit and each pretreatment covariate on a binary indicator of providing a gifted program, four dummy codes for the strata, and four treatment-by-policy interactions. For both subjects, the strata achieved distribution balance in all pretreatment covariates.</p>
<p>The PS strata were included in the full two-level HLM models (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0016986211431487">Table 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0016986211431487">5</xref></sup> The final model for overall school mathematics achievement included four of the composite variables (basic mathematics classroom practices, grouping practices, nonnumber strands, and teacher experience). After adjusting for those covariates as well as for selection bias using PS strata, the differential effect between schools with a gifted program and those without was 1.17 (<italic>SE</italic> = 1.57). This was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = .46) and had an extremely small effect size of 0.06 (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>). Thus, we concluded that the average effect of providing a gifted mathematics program on overall mathematics achievement was essentially zero.</p>

<p>We also included treatment × strata interactions at each level, but none of those parameters were statistically significant. This indicated that the effect of treatment did not vary by school propensity to have a gifted program or by student propensity to be gifted. Therefore, we removed the interaction terms from the models so that they would be more parsimonious.</p>

<p>The final model for overall school reading achievement included four of the composite variables (higher level reading and writing classroom practices, grouping practices and use of standards, teacher experience, and teacher education). After adjusting for those covariates and for selection bias using PS strata, the differential effect between schools with and without a gifted program was 0.32 (<italic>SE</italic> = 1.41). This was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = .82) and had an extremely small effect size of 0.01. Thus, we concluded that, on average, providing a gifted reading program had no effect on overall reading achievement.</p>

<sec id="section13-0016986211431487">
<title>Average Effects on Gifted and Nongifted Students</title>
<p>The goal of RQs 2 to 5 was to examine the average effect of providing gifted programming on gifted and nongifted students’ achievement and academic attitudes. Schools with a reading gifted program had about 240 gifted and 2,300 nongifted students, and schools with a mathematics gifted program had about 110 gifted and 1,050 nongifted students. Having estimated the PS model from the observed data for students in schools with a gifted program, we used the same model to predict the PS for students in a school without one, identifying students with similar high and low probabilities to be gifted. For schools without a gifted program in reading, this resulted in about 270 gifted and 1,870 nongifted students. For schools without a gifted program in mathematics, this resulted in about 80 gifted and 900 nongifted students.</p>
<sec id="section14-0016986211431487">
<title>RQ 2 and RQ 3: Average effects on gifted students</title>
<p>Having identified gifted students in schools with and without a gifted program, we then examined the average effect of providing gifted programming on gifted students’ achievement and academic attitudes. To do this, we first divided the sample of gifted students in each subject into five strata based on the logit of their student-level PS. The strata achieved distribution balance in all mathematics and nearly 98% of reading pretreatment covariates. The Type 1 error related to sampling fluctuation could explain the within-stratum difference in about 2% of the pretreatment covariates, assuming α = .05.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0016986211431487">
<title>RQ 2: Achievement</title>
<p>Next, we estimated the effects of being in a gifted program on gifted students’ mathematics and reading achievement. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0016986211431487">Table 2</xref> includes the full HLM model. The final model for mathematics achievement of gifted students included one school-level composite variable (higher level mathematics classroom practices) and both student-level composite variables. After adjusting for those and for selection bias for students to be gifted (using student-level PS strata) and for schools to provide gifted programming (using school-level PS strata), the differential effect between gifted students in a school with a gifted program and those in a school without a gifted program was 0.004 (<italic>SE</italic> = 2.16). This was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = .999) and had an extremely small effect size of 0.0004. Thus, we concluded that the average effect of providing a gifted mathematics program to gifted students was null in terms of mathematics.</p>
<p>The final model for reading achievement of gifted students included three school-level composite variables (grouping practices and use of standards, teacher experience, and teacher education) and one student-level composite variable (child assessment attitude). After adjusting for those as well as for selection bias using student- and school-level PS strata, the differential effect between gifted students in a school with a gifted program and gifted students not in a school with a gifted program was 0.72 (<italic>SE</italic> = 1.39), which was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = .60) and had a very small effect size of 0.07. Thus, we concluded that providing a gifted reading program, on average, had no effect on reading achievement of students gifted in reading.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0016986211431487">
<title>RQ 3: Attitudes</title>
<p>Next, we estimated the effects of being in a gifted program on gifted students’ mathematics and reading attitudes. As noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0016986211431487">Table 2</xref>, the full two-level HLM was similar to that for RQ 2 with an additional parameter indicating the relative achievement in the other subject. The final model for gifted students’ mathematics attitudes included two of the school-level composite variables (basic mathematics classroom practices and teacher experience) and neither student-level composite variable. After adjusting for those covariates, relative reading achievement, and selection bias, the differential effect between gifted students in a school with a gifted program and those not in a school with a gifted program was 0.02 (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.15). This was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = .91) and had a very small effect size of 0.03. Thus, we concluded that, on average, there was essentially no effect of providing a gifted mathematics program on students gifted in mathematics in terms of mathematics attitudes.</p>
<p>The final model for gifted students’ reading attitudes included one school-level composite variable (higher-level reading and writing classroom practices) and one student-level composite variable (child assessment attitude). After adjusting for those covariates, relative mathematics achievement, and selection bias using PS strata, the differential effect between gifted students in schools with and without a gifted program was 0.02 (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.07). This was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = .81) and had a very small effect size of 0.04. Thus, we concluded that the average effect of providing a gifted reading program on the gifted students’ reading attitudes was essentially zero.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0016986211431487">
<title>RQ 4 and RQ 5: Average effects on nongifted students</title>
<p>The third set of analyses focused on the effects of gifted programming policy on the mathematics and reading achievement and attitudes of nongifted students. That is, if a school without a gifted program changed its policy to having one, what effect would this have on those students who would not be in the program anyway? Having identified nongifted students in schools with and without a gifted program, we then examined the average effect of providing gifted programming on the nongifted students’ achievement and attitudes in mathematics and in reading.</p>
<p>To do this, we first divided the sample of nongifted students in each subject into five strata based on the logit of their student-level PS. However, for mathematics, quintiles failed to balance the distribution on at least 95% of pretreatment covariates. Therefore, we restratified the nongifted mathematics students into deciles and achieved distribution balance on greater than 99% of all pretreatment covariates. For reading, deciles as well as quintiles failed to balance the distribution on at least 95% of pretreatment covariates, so we restratified the nongifted reading students into 20 strata, achieving distribution balance on greater than 98% of all pretreatment covariates. The Type 1 error related to sampling fluctuation could explain the within-stratum difference in less than 1% of the mathematics and 2% of the reading pretreatment covariates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0016986211431487">
<title>RQ 4: Achievement</title>
<p>The purpose was to estimate the effects of a school’s gifted programming policy on nongifted students’ mathematics and reading achievement. The full two-level HLM model, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0016986211431487">Table 2</xref>, was similar to that for RQ 2. The final model for mathematics achievement of nongifted students included five school-level composite variables (all except higher level mathematics classroom practices) and both student-level composite variables. After adjusting for those and for selection bias for students to be gifted and for a school to provide gifted programming using PS strata, the differential effect between nongifted students in a school with a gifted program and those not in a school with a gifted program was 1.15 (<italic>SE</italic> = 1.17). This was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = .32) and had a very small effect size of 0.06. Thus, we concluded that the average effect of a school’s policy to have a gifted mathematics program on nongifted students’ mathematics achievement was essentially null.</p>
<p>The final model for nongifted students’ reading achievement included two school-level composite variables (grouping practices and use of standards and teacher experience) and two student-level composite variables (child assessment attitude and Title I participation). After adjusting for those as well as for selection bias at the student- and school-level, the differential effect between nongifted students in a school with and without a gifted program was 0.27 (<italic>SE</italic> = 1.14), which was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = .81) and had a very small effect size (0.01). Consequently, for reading achievement, we also concluded that the average effect of a school’s policy to have a gifted reading program on students not gifted in reading was zero.</p>

<title>RQ 5: Attitudes</title>
<p>Finally, we estimated the effects of school gifted programming policy on nongifted students’ mathematics and reading attitudes. As noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0016986211431487">Table 2</xref>, the full two-level HLM model was similar to that for the RQ 3 in that it included an additional parameter indicating the relative achievement in the other subject. The final model for mathematics attitudes of nongifted students included none of the school-level composite variables but both student-level composite variables. After adjusting for those, for relative reading achievement, and for selection bias for students to be gifted, and for a school to provide gifted programming using PS strata, the differential effect between nongifted students in a school with and without a gifted program was 0.02 with a standard error of 0.05. This was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = .64) and had a very small effect size of 0.03. Thus, we concluded that the average effect of a school’s policy to have a gifted mathematics program on those students who were not gifted was essentially null in terms of mathematics attitudes.</p>
<p>The final model for nongifted students’ reading attitudes included two of the school-level composite variables (higher level reading and writing classroom practices and basic reading and writing classroom practices) and one of the student-level composite variables (child assessment attitude). After adjusting for those covariates and relative mathematics achievement, as well as for selection bias at the student- and school-level, the differential effect between nongifted students in a school with and without a gifted program was 0.03 (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.04), which was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = .37) and had a very small effect size (0.04). Consequently, for reading attitudes, we also concluded that the average effect of a school’s policy to have a gifted reading program on students not gifted in reading was zero.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated how a school’s policy of providing gifted programming in mathematics and in reading affected overall school achievement, gifted students’ achievement and academic attitudes, and nongifted students’ achievement and academic attitudes. Thus, it presented an expanded look at the policy implications of gifted programming. Furthermore, this study used a national sample of students and schools, which typically is not the case in gifted education studies. Although the research does have its limitations, the findings merit further discussion, particularly of its implications.</p>
<sec id="section22-0016986211431487">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Most of this study’s limitations relate to the use of a preexisting data set, resulting in analyses being limited by the available variables. In particular, NCES did not collect data regarding the type of gifted programming, the length of time students spent in a gifted program, what they did within the gifted program, or the training and knowledge of the gifted program teachers. Therefore, the study could only examine average effects of gifted programming and could not delve deeper by distinguishing programming variables that are or are not effective. Additionally, given the outcome variables available in the data set, this study was unable to examine gains in such constructs as higher level thinking, which is sometimes the focus of gifted programming, rather than content learning.</p>
<p>Although the ECLS-K began with a representative sample of students and their schools, many students moved and could not be located, thus eliminating them from the data collection by fifth grade. Furthermore, because we were examining the effects of being “assigned” to a gifted program in third grade on fifth-grade achievement, we limited the sample only to students who were in the same school in third and fifth grade. These factors affect the representativeness of the analytic sample for this study.</p>
<p>The composite covariates included in the final model have two limitations. First, they may not entirely capture all content coverage or classroom, school, or student characteristics. Additionally, in some program types, such as self- contained and cluster classrooms, the gifted program could be the mathematics or reading classroom and the mathematics or reading teacher could be the gifted teacher. In this case, the composite covariates could actually be explaining some of the potential treatment effects. So, by accounting for what happened in the classroom during the fifth-grade year, it is possible that the treatment of the gifted program in these classes was also taken into account. For instance, although a self-contained gifted program might provide accelerated and enriched mathematics curriculum, the composite covariates controlled for the curriculum and classroom activities, assuming that what happened in the classroom was outside the scope of the gifted program. Conversely, one should note that those variables also controlled for curriculum and classroom activities in the schools without a gifted program, which included all the private schools. Although private schools typically do not have gifted programs, they often address giftedness in students without a defined program. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0016986211431487">Witham (1997)</xref> found that private schools were more likely to use acceleration, grade skipping, and different texts and materials for gifted students than public schools. That being said, the fourth mathematics classroom component and the third reading classroom component primarily addressed grouping practices. On average, the schools with a gifted program used more groups more frequently and for longer periods of time in both reading and mathematics. In fact, schools with gifted programs tended to have scores above the average on this component (averaging 0.10 in mathematics and 0.17 in reading) whereas schools without gifted programs tended to have scores below the average on this component (averaging −0.13 in mathematics and −0.22 in reading).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0016986211431487">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>The first finding of note was that, on average, gifted programming did not have negative effects on the achievement or academic attitudes of nongifted students. Therefore, providing gifted programming does not appear to have detrimental effects on other students. However, there also were no positive effects of gifted programming for gifted students. Thus, gifted programming, as the United States currently provides it, does not appear to affect gifted students’ achievement. That is, although policy makers and administrators do not have to worry that by providing gifted programming they are harming nongifted students who do not receive the programming and resultant funding, gifted programs, on average, do not increase the mathematics or reading achievement or attitudes of gifted students. Although the results were not statistically significant, they have great practical significance and implications regarding the state of gifted education, for researchers, and for policy makers.</p>
<sec id="section24-0016986211431487">
<title>Implications regarding the state of gifted education</title>
<p>This study was an analysis of gifted programs in general, not specific types of gifted programming. That is, the purpose of the study was to investigate the <italic>average</italic> effects of gifted programming in the United States. Whereas some states have a mandate requiring gifted identification, programming, and funding, other states have minimal or no policies regarding gifted identification and programming and do not provide funding to support such programs. Although the PS strata accounted for state mandates, the fact remains that gifted education is not uniform across the country. Moreover, not only do mandates vary widely across the country, but within states and school districts, program type, frequency, and duration vary, as well as what happens during these programs. The benefit of the ECLS-K data set is that it does ask about gifted programming in specific academic areas, but the nature of what happens in these programs and whether they address specific academic areas are not addressed by the data.</p>
<p>Additionally, the data were reported by teachers and school administrators, and how the gifted program was provided (i.e., self-contained classroom, resource room, within the regular classroom) is unknown. This is especially problematic because regular classrooms and resource rooms, not self-contained programs in specific content areas, are the top delivery methods reported in the upper elementary grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0016986211431487">Gubbins et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0016986211431487">NAGC, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0016986211431487">2009</xref>). If students go to a resource room as their gifted program, they might get the majority of their content-specific curricula and learning in the regular classroom, not through the gifted program. In this case, one might not expect the gifted program to affect academic achievement, particularly broad measures of academic achievement that do not focus on a specific area (such as using a test of only geometry skills to evaluate a geometry unit implemented with gifted students).</p>
<p>As indicated in the review of literature, the wide variety of program types previously studied (such as pullout, special curriculum in self-contained classes, special schools, weekend and summer programs, and school-wide enrichment) have led to mixed research results. In fact, in their comparison of program types, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0016986211431487">Delcourt et al. (2007)</xref> found that pullout programs, special classes, and special schools resulted in consistently higher achievement compared with within-class programs, indicating that different types of programs have differing effects. This is an indication of how diverse gifted programming is. Furthermore, the mixed results are consistent with the lack of effect found in this nationwide, general study of the average effects of gifted programming.</p>
<p>The diverse types of gifted programming also indicate a diverse amount of instructional time students may receive in a program. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0016986211431487">Gallagher (2000)</xref> noted, instructional time in pullout programs could range from a couple of half-days per week to only an hour per week. Perhaps, the lack of treatment effect that this study found for gifted programming resulted from a large number of programs providing what Gallagher called a “nontherapeutic educational dosage” (p. 10), meaning that the amount of time students receive the educational programming is not enough to meet their needs. This might be similar to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0016986211431487">Hong and Hong (2009)</xref> found when studying homogeneous grouping of kindergartners for reading: That grouping like-ability students together is effective only if a substantial amount of time is devoted to actual content instruction. What the current study indicates is a need to define what a “therapeutic educational dosage” would be if we expect gifted programming to improve gifted students’ achievement.</p>
<p>Another consideration is that what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0016986211431487">Kulik (1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0016986211431487">Kulik &amp; Kulik, 1997</xref>) found with ability grouping most likely applies to gifted education as well. That is, having an effect on gifted students depends not only on providing a program for them but also on what students <italic>do</italic> in the program. The field has raised questions about what happens in programs, particularly in the regular classroom and in pullout programs. For example, in regular reading classrooms, most teachers provide minimal differentiation and challenge for students gifted in reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0016986211431487">Reis et al., 2004</xref>). In elementary school pullout programs, the focus is often on mathematics activities meant to be fun rather than those that are challenging and designed to improve mathematics achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0016986211431487">Sheffield, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0016986211431487">Waxman, Robinson, &amp; Mukhopadhyay, 1996</xref>). Unfortunately, upper elementary school teachers make minimal, minor, modifications to the regular curriculum to meet the needs of gifted students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0016986211431487">Archambault et al., 1993</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0016986211431487">Archambault et al. (1993)</xref> found that “the regular classroom services provided to gifted students in schools with formal gifted programs are similar to those provided in schools without formal programs” (p. viii). In terms of curricula, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0016986211431487">Margolin (1996)</xref> reviewed gifted education textbooks and found that only 11% of the pages addressed the content of the lessons. In fact, many lessons in gifted education textbooks tend to be “trivial and irrelevant” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0016986211431487">Gallagher, 2000</xref>, p. 7) rather than being clearly articulated, coherent curricula focused on rigor. On the other hand, the field does have some specific reading and mathematics curricula that have increased students’ achievement, particularly in self-contained settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0016986211431487">French, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0016986211431487">Gavin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0016986211431487">VanTassel-Baska et al., 2002</xref>). Gifted programs with goals of increasing mathematics or reading achievement would benefit from further research on curricula such as these in a variety of settings and the use of research-based curricula as these.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0016986211431487">
<title>Implications for researchers</title>
<p>The limitations of the variables available to study the types, duration, frequency, and content of programming speak to the state of gifted education in the United States. Although many may view <italic>any</italic> type of gifted program as a benefit for gifted students and some may consider the results of this study of gifted programming effects on average to indicate a lack of benefit for <italic>all</italic> gifted programs, the results of prior studies have indicated that some programs have more effects on achievement than others. This suggests that although some gifted education programs in reading and mathematics are increasing student achievement, their effects are dwarfed by the number of programs not having an effect or neutralized by programs with negative effects. Given the research indicating the positive effect of particular gifted education practices, it becomes obvious that we are not employing those programs and practices consistently enough across the country to improve gifted students’ achievement on average.</p>
<p>This should serve as a “call to arms” for researchers to conduct rigorous research on the types of programs and curriculum that improve gifted students’ achievement while controlling for pretreatment differences. This should include scale-up studies of those that have been conducting, including those under the Jacob Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act, which was passed in 1988 and renewed as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 2001. Unfortunately, school personnel stating that they provide gifted programming does not guarantee that gifted students’ academic needs are being met and that the program is effective at increasing their academic achievement. Rather, researchers, policy makers, administrators, educators, and teachers must consider what happens within the gifted program. One must keep in mind that these answers may vary for different students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0016986211431487">
<title>Implications for policy makers</title>
<p>The results of this study go beyond a call for further research—they also suggest implications for policy makers. Despite the average null effects currently experienced by gifted students in the United States, we agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0016986211431487">Gallagher (2000)</xref> that the status quo is not an option and that schools should still be striving to help gifted students achieve their academic potential. The null treatment effects of gifted programming, on average, indicate the need for policy makers who want to improve the academic achievement of gifted students to become aware of the research and to seek out program types and curricula that have evidence to support their effectiveness. Policy makers must become aware that “having a gifted program” is not enough for increasing student achievement. This study clearly indicates that after accounting for pretreatment differences and regular classroom and teacher characteristics, gifted programs, on average, do not increase student achievement. However, studies of specific program types and curricula have indicated that they can increase gifted students’ mathematics and reading achievement. This type of research is becoming increasingly available, particularly with the Jacob Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act and with the 2010 NAGC Pre-K-Grade 12 Gifted Programming Standards (see the research support document for those standards at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nagc.org/uploadedFiles/Information_and_Resources/Gifted_Program_Standards/K-12%20stands%20with%20research%20support.pdf">http://www.nagc.org/uploadedFiles/Information_and_Resources/Gifted_Program_Standards/K-12%20stands%20with%20research%20support.pdf</ext-link>). By seeking out research-based programs and strategies such as those encouraged by the Javits Act and those highlighted by the NAGC standards, policy makers can help ensure that their funding and the students’ and teachers’ time are being used effectively, helping students not maintain their current levels of achievement but improve them. In other words, because school personnel–reported gifted programs have no effect <italic>on average</italic> but individual programs <italic>do</italic> have evidence of effectiveness, policy makers and educators much take into consideration the “fundamental question” that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0016986211431487">Callahan and Moon (2007)</xref> suggested, “Is there credible evidence of the effectiveness of this recommended practice?” (p. 305). Given that gifted programming does have a cost in terms of monetary and human resources, policy makers wishing to provide programs to increase gifted students’ achievement need to be sure they are spending those resources on research-based programs that are more likely to increase achievement.</p>
