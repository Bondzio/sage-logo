<abstract>
<p>We previously hypothesized that the development of traumatic temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis was similar to that of hypertrophic non-union. Besides similarities in etiology, hypertrophic bone stumps, and long-term development, the radiolucent zone, frequently located in the ankylosed bone, is another common feature. In this study, we demonstrated that the radiolucent zone also contained multilineage potential cells (RZs, radiolucent-zone-related cells) as the non-union tissues. RZs were characterized and compared with mandibular bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) by analysis of MSC-related markers, colony-forming-unit assays, multipotential differentiation assays, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assays, and cell transplantation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Both cell types were positive for CD105, CD166, and Stro-1 expression, negative for CD34 and CD45 expression, and exhibited osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation potentials. However, compared with mandibular BMSCs, RZs showed lower colony-forming-unit abilities and proliferation rates. The mineralization and bone-forming ability of RZs was weaker than that of mandibular BMSCs, with Runx2 and ALP mRNA expression and ALP activity significantly lower in RZs. All these results suggest that RZs possess the properties of MSCs but lower proliferation and osteogenic differentiation capacity similar to that of stromal cells in hypertrophic non-union tissues.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Traumatic temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis, a severe joint disability, is characterized by obliteration of joint space and abnormal bone formation in and around the joint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034513483471">Sawhney, 1986</xref>). Previous studies have been limited to clinical or histological studies, or the development of animal models of TMJ ankylosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034513483471">Cheung <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034513483471">Yan <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034513483471">Yan <italic>et al</italic>., 2012b</xref>). However, the pathological mechanism of TMJ bony ankylosis remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Several hypotheses have been proposed in attempts to explain the pathological mechanism of TMJ ankylosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034513483471">Arakeri <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Our group hypothesized that the development of traumatic TMJ ankylosis was the result of mouth-opening interfering with the bone healing of 2 injured articular surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034513483471">Yan <italic>et al</italic>., 2012a</xref>). Considering the etiology, hypertrophic bone mass, and long-term development of TMJ ankylosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034513483471">Aggarwal <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>), we further hypothesized that the development of TMJ ankylosis was similar to that of hypertrophic non-union, which has also been linked to inadequate immobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034513483471">Yan <italic>et al</italic>., 2012a</xref>). Strikingly, a radiolucent zone exists in both TMJ ankylosis and hypertrophic non-union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034513483471">Yan <italic>et al</italic>., 2012a</xref>). Furthermore, histological analysis has revealed that the radiolucent zone in both diseases contains a large quantity of fibers, cartilage, and vessels, and that neoformative endochondral ossification occurs in or at the edge of the radiolucent zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034513483471">Reed <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034513483471">Cheung <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034513483471">Yan <italic>et al</italic>., 2012b</xref>). As above, the radiolucent zones in both diseases have anatomical and histological similarities. However, the cytological similarity has yet to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Hypertrophic non-union is considered to be a biological process whereby lack of mechanical stability interferes with union. As a result, the osseous transformation of non-union tissues fails to occur adequately with the failure of the osseous bridge at the non-union tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034513483471">Iwakura <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). In addition, the osteogenesis of stromal cells derived from the non-union tissues (radiolucent zone) also decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034513483471">Hofmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034513483471">Bajada <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). However, once mechanical stability is attained, the mesenchymal progenitor cells in the radiolucent zone are still believed to contribute to bone formation for healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034513483471">Iwakura <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Thus, the radiolucent zone seems like a potential reservoir of mesenchymal progenitor cells for hypertrophic non-union healing.</p>
<p>However, in traumatic TMJ ankylosis, no previous reports are available on whether the radiolucent zone contains mesenchymal progenitor cells as do the hypertrophic non-union tissues, and, if so, whether the osteogenesis of these cells deserves to be elucidated. In this study, we hypothesized that multipotential cells (herein called ‘radiolucent-zone-related cells’, RZs) existed in the radiolucent zone and further investigated their proliferative and osteogenic capacity.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>In total, eight patients with type II or type III post-traumatic TMJ ankylosis (Sawhney classification) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034513483471">Sawhney, 1986</xref>) were included in this study. Detailed patient information is listed in Appendix Table 1. The control group consisted of eight volunteers (four women and four men; mean age, 31.7 ± 6.4 yrs) who had undergone tooth extraction or orthopedic surgery. None of these individuals had infections or systemic metabolic bone disease. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Peking University Health Science Center (IRB00001052-11002), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p>

<sec id="section9-0022034513483471">
<title>Flow Cytometry Analysis</title>
<p>Cells were harvested at the third passage. After 3 washes with PBS-1% FBS, the cells were incubated in the dark for 45 min at 4°C with anti-human CD34-FITC, CD45-PE (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), CD105-PE, CD166-FITC (Ancell), and Stro-1 antibodies. The anti-mouse IgM-PE secondary antibody (R&amp;D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used to stain Stro-1 antibody. The recommended non-specific mouse PE- and FITC-conjugated IgGs (BD Biosciences) and IgM (R&amp;D Systems Inc.) were used as isotype controls.

<p>To determine whether RZs undergo adipogenesis, we cultured RZs and mandibular BMSCs in adipogenic medium for 21 days and stained them with Oil Red O. Both cell types exhibited intracellular lipid droplet accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034513483471">Fig. 3C</xref>). Correspondingly, mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-2 (PPARγ2) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) increased in the cells under adipogenic conditions for 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034513483471">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Chondrogenic differentiation was induced in RZs and mandibular BMSCs from four patients and four donors. After 28 days, cell pellets from both RZs and mandibular BMSCs had a spherical and glistening appearance; cartilage development in the cell pellets was detected by type II collagen immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034513483471">Fig. 3E</xref>). Toluidine blue staining of both RZs and mandibular BMSCs also confirmed their chondrogenic capability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034513483471">Fig. 3F</xref>).</p>

<title>Comparison of Osteogenesis between RZs and Mandibular BMSCs</title>
<p>We then examined whether the osteogenic potential of the RZs was different from that of BMSCs by evaluating the bone-related mRNA expression under osteogenic induction and <italic>in vivo</italic> bone formation. Expression of Runx2 mRNA by BMSCs was 3-fold (3.00 ± 0.70 v<italic>s</italic>. 1.04 ± 0.13) and 4.2-fold (4.20 ± 1.30 <italic>vs</italic>. 1.00 ± 0.25) higher than that of RZs at days 7 and 14, respectively, while the mRNA expression of ALP of BMSCs was 23-fold (23.76 ± 7.60 <italic>vs.</italic> 1.00 ± 0.8) and 19-fold (19.00 ± 6.30 <italic>vs.</italic> 1.00 ± 0.40) higher than that of RZs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034513483471">Fig. 4A</xref>).

However, no difference in the mRNA expression of the mature osteoblastic gene OCN was detected between the 2 cell types.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that RZs derived from the radiolucent zone of clinically resected ankylosed masses of traumatic TMJ ankylosis possess MSC-like properties. Self-renewal and differentiation potential are 2 important properties of stem cells, in addition to being the key characteristics used to define MSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034513483471">Pittenger <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). RZs derived from the radiolucent zone of resected ankylosed masses of traumatic TMJ ankylosis were successfully expanded and subcultured and shown to form colonies efficiently. RZs had the potential to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes under appropriate inductions. Moreover, their phenotypic characteristics were very similar to those of mandibular BMSCs, although RZs showed lower proliferative and osteogenic capacity. All these results indicated that RZs possess the 2 essential properties characteristic of stem cells. Therefore, we defined them as MSC-like stromal cells. These results also suggest that RZs in the radiolucent zone are capable of differentiation into chondrocytes and osteoblasts under certain pathological conditions, resulting in progressive endochondral ossification. The observation that the radiolucent zone contains MSC-like cells is very similar to that in hypertrophic non-union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034513483471">Iwakura <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Compared with mandibular BMSCs, RZs showed not only lower proliferative and osteogenic capacity <italic>in vitro</italic> but also less bone formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Correspondingly, their Runx2 and ALP expression and activity were lower as well. The above results are consistent with those for hypertrophic bone non-union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034513483471">Hofmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the osteogenesis of RZs could not be improved by a widely used osteogenic-inducing pressure (Appendix Fig. 2). This may explain why RZs retain a decreased rather than increased osteogenic potential under mechanical stimulation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, the large quantity of fibers and cartilage in the radiolucent zone can be inferred to provide indirect evidence of suppressed osteogenesis in RZs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034513483471">Fig. 1</xref>). In addition, in animal models, we obtained the same result, that the bone-related gene expression in the radiolucent zone of TMJ ankylosis was suppressed compared with that of fractured bone (unpublished observations). Therefore, we reasonably deduce that osteogenesis was compromised due to mechanical stimulation in the radiolucent zone, similar to mechanically delayed bone healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034513483471">Schell <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The origin of these RZs is unclear. MSCs have previously been isolated from joint tissues such as synovium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034513483471">Sakaguchi <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), condylar cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034513483471">Bibb <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>), muscle, periosteum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034513483471">Kisiel <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), and mandibular bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034513483471">Akintoye <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). MSCs in TMJ tissues, surrounding tissues, and peripheral blood can be recruited to the injured sites for repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034513483471">Lories and Luyten, 2011</xref>), and then reside in the joint for later tissue regeneration, which may be the major source of RZs. It is less likely that the RZs detected are actually MSCs from the adjacent tissues present, due to contamination during the isolation procedure, since the resected ankylosed mass was thoroughly rinsed with PBS, and only the middle portion of the radiolucent zone was used for cell isolation.</p>
<p>RZs may play a potential role in the development of TMJ ankylosis. As in bone non-union, the radiolucent zone, an indicator of impaired bone healing, contains large quantities of fibers and cartilage. Located between the upper and lower trabecular bones, like TMJ discs, they contribute to the residual mouth-opening of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034513483471">Yan <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). At the early stage of TMJ ankylosis, when jaw mobility is relatively greater, it is easy to understand that RZs with decreased osteogenesis and proliferation are not sufficiently active to form bone bridges, while limitation of jaw motion would hasten the progress of ankylosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034513483471">Miyamoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). As ankylosis progresses, when the radiolucent zone is affected by endochondral bone formation, mouth-opening decreases with the width of radiolucent zone. At this time, with the joint obtaining more stability, RZs might rather contribute to bone formation, worsening ankylosis. Thus, at the later stage, patients commonly show narrower radiolucent zones with obvious bone bridges connecting the upper and lower bone stumps (Appendix Figs. 4, 6), in contrast to the early stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034513483471">Fig. 1</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that the radiolucent zone may be a potential reservoir of mesenchymal progenitors for bone formation.</p>
<p>According to our hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034513483471">Yan <italic>et al</italic>., 2012a</xref>), this study is the first to provide additional cytological evidence, besides their similar etiology, a hypertrophic bone stump, of long-term development history and a radiolucent zone. However, some differences remain. In anatomy, hypertrophic non-union implicates only one bone but rather the joint cartilage or disc, while TMJ ankylosis simultaneously implicates 2 bones and the joint cartilage and disc. Also, ankylosis is affected by biological and mechanical factors. Unfortunately, here we present only the cytological evidence that initially supported our hypothesis; whether RZs did take part in TMJ ankylosis, as we supposed, needs to be further clarified. In addition, whether mechanical factors play a role in the decreased osteogenesis of RZs is another important question. A larger sample size would certainly be beneficial.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the existence of MSC-like RZs that exhibit the properties of lower proliferation and osteogenesis. These results provide innovative cytological evidence supporting the hypothesis that the development of traumatic TMJ ankylosis is similar to the course of hypertrophic bone non-union.</p>
