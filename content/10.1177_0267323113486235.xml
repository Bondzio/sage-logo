<abstract>
<p>In 2009, the outbreak of a new flu virus in Mexico developed into the first pandemic in more than 40 years. For years the world had been warned about such a catastrophic global epidemic, but influenza A/H1N1 (also called swine flu or Mexican flu) turned out to be even milder than the common flu. This study is based on a content analysis of newspaper and television coverage from April to December 2009, and focuses on the volume and the content of the news coverage of the pandemic in the Netherlands. The research shows that media coverage was intensive and alarming, especially during the first and third stages of the epidemic. As it turns out, news sources had about the same share of alarming messages as the media. Therefore, although the media were indeed alarming in their coverage, they were so on the authority of their sources, the experts and the public health officials.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization officially declared that after more than 40 years the world was facing the next pandemic, a worldwide epidemic caused by a new influenza virus, A/H1N1 (also known as swine flu and Mexican flu). The outbreak in Mexico in April triggered massive media attention all over the world and for the rest of the year the new flu would continue to be a front-page topic. For many public health authorities the WHO declaration was an alert for immediate action. In the Netherlands the Minister of Health ordered 34 million vaccines for a double vaccination campaign. Although the first contagion was reported on 30 April and the first death on 2 August, it took until 24 October for the Mexican flu to reach epidemic proportions in the Netherlands. As elsewhere the epidemic was very mild with a lower case fatality than the common flu. By the end of 2009 the epidemic had ended in the Netherlands: 63 people died, of whom only five had not been carrying any other disease than the new flu.</p>
<p>This outcome contrasted sharply with the dramatic pandemic scenarios that prevailed in all kinds of national and international policy documents<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0267323113486235">1</xref></sup> before the start of A/H1N1 flu. For years the world had been warned about the next pandemic that could cause tens of millions of deaths and severe social disruption all over the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323113486235">Bonneux and Van Damme, 2006</xref>). Although outbreaks of avian flu (H5N1) in 1997 (2005/2007) and SARS (2002) had received massive media attention, which seemed to confirm this threat, a pandemic had not materialized then. In the Netherlands the government used a scenario that was based on the idea that a pandemic belonged to the category of ‘most catastrophic risks’, causing social crisis and the deaths of about 80,000 people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0267323113486235">2</xref></sup> This was based on the very high case fatality (68%) of avian flu, but this flu is not transmissible among humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267323113486235">Keil et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As the much feared A/H1N1 pandemic turned out to be quite harmless, the WHO, national health authorities as well as the media were criticized for exaggerating the risk and overreacting to the threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267323113486235">Bonneux and Van Damme, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267323113486235">Keil et al., 2011</xref>). In many countries millions of vaccines became obsolete, causing controversy about this waste of money and alleged conflicts of interests behind public health policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267323113486235">Cohen and Carter, 2010</xref>). In 2010 the Council of Europe published a critical report on the A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009, stating that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Some of the consequences of decisions taken and advice given are particularly troubling, as they led to distortion of priorities of public health services across Europe, waste of large sums of public money and also unjustified scares and fears about health risks faced by the European public at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267323113486235">Flynn, 2010</xref>: 1).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The Council also stressed that: ‘a review is also necessary of the media’s role in fuelling fear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267323113486235">Flynn, 2010</xref>: 13).</p>
<p>This study offers material for such a review of the role of the media in the Netherlands, where the media were criticized for ‘over-hyping’ the pandemic. In this article we present the results of our research project<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0267323113486235">3</xref></sup> with the central research question: how did the media in the Netherlands cover the Mexican flu outbreak in 2009? Before formulating more specific research questions, the role of the media in covering risks and epidemics is explored.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0267323113486235">
<title>Media and epidemics</title>
<sec id="section3-0267323113486235">
<title>News values</title>
<p>A potential pandemic matches perfectly with almost all criteria for news value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267323113486235">Galtung and Ruge, 1970 [1965]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267323113486235">O’Neill and Harcup, 2009</xref>) such as: unexpectedness (sudden outbreak) as well as consonance with expectations (a new pandemic was long predicted), intensity increase (growing number of patients and fatalities), negativity (chance of a catastrophe), relevance (actual risks involved), meaningfulness (fear of epidemic, personal risks), unambiguity (flu is well known), continuity (daily updates) and unpredictability (will it be a severe epidemic?).</p>
<p>This last news value is crucial in reporting on new risks. After the outbreak of a new virus it is very difficult to predict how fast it will spread, how serious the symptoms will be and how many people might die. In general, experts discuss several different options, but the media have a bias in favour of the worst-case scenarios, as these have a higher news value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267323113486235">House of Commons, 2011</xref>: 3). Research on coverage of avian flu in US newspapers showed that worst-case scenarios were present in over 40% of all articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267323113486235">Dudo et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0267323113486235">
<title>Alarming frames</title>
<p>Compared to other risks, an epidemic is a special story, because the fear of a deadly contagion is rooted deeply in Western sociocultural history. An epidemic is not only a public health crisis but also a specific narrative built on iconic images of the medieval plague (Black Death) as well as the Spanish flu following the First World War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323113486235">Alcabes, 2009</xref>). All these images will be reactivated in the media after the announcement of the discovery of a new pandemic virus. These cultural roots can be part of the frames the media use to give meaning to facts and events. In general, frames are used to structure the news story in terms of causes, predictions, solutions and responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0267323113486235">Scheufele, 1999</xref>). Frames also have a tone of voice, supported by the use of fearful or reassuring words and metaphors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267323113486235">Lakoff, 2004</xref>). News coverage on viruses typically uses military metaphors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267323113486235">Chiang and Duann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267323113486235">De la Rosa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267323113486235">Larson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0267323113486235">Williams Camus, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As a consequence, media coverage on epidemics can be quite alarming. Coverage of avian flu and SARS was often sensationalist, focusing on worst-case scenarios and full of emotionally charged language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267323113486235">Berry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267323113486235">Dudo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0267323113486235">Washer, 2004</xref>). Studies on the A/H1N1 pandemic and the media, however, show mixed results. A study of a Brazilian TV news programme shows that it contributed to ‘a scenario of panic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267323113486235">Da Silva Medeiros and Massarani, 2010</xref>). An analysis of British newspapers came to the conclusion that there was little evidence of the media ‘over-hyping’ the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267323113486235">Hilton and Hunt, 2010</xref>). Whereas the overall tone was neutral and not ‘alarmist’, the media did pay a lot of attention to the flu.</p>
<p>This is confirmed by a study of Australian TV news on the epidemic: coverage was in general ‘non-alarmist’, but 63.4% of all television news statements related to the seriousness of A/H1N1, creating the impression of a serious threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267323113486235">Fogarty et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, an analysis of newspaper coverage of swine flu in Australia showed that the ‘deadly swine flu’ narrative prevailed with a combination of alarming and reassuring messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267323113486235">Holland and Blood, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0267323113486235">
<title>Sources and media</title>
<p>During an epidemic, both health authorities and scientific experts play important roles as sources of the news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0267323113486235">Shih et al., 2011</xref>). The experts have access to scientific knowledge while the authorities are in charge of public health policy. As sources they are deemed trustworthy, reliable and responsible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267323113486235">Albæk, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323113486235">Boyce, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267323113486235">Clarke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267323113486235">Conrad, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0267323113486235">Rennen, 2000</xref>). Experts with alarming message are even more attractive for the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267323113486235">Dearing, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0267323113486235">Sandman, 1997</xref>). The virologists, who in a concerted campaign warned about the potential hazards of a new pandemic after a new outbreak of bird flu in 2005, received worldwide media attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0267323113486235">Nerlich and Halliday, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Media often adopt the frames their sources have to offer, but in covering news and dealing with sources journalists also adapt and develop frames. Framing therefore can be defined as the outcome of negotiation processes between the media and their sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0267323113486235">Vasterman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267323113486235">Vliegenthart and Van Zoonen, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0267323113486235">
<title>Media-hype</title>
<p>The daily news generally contains regular flows of current affairs, but every now and then, there are events that trigger huge and fast developing news waves in which all media participate. These so-called media-hypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0267323113486235">Vasterman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0267323113486235">Wien and Elmelund-Praesteker, 2009</xref>) are based on a self-referential and interactive media momentum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267323113486235">Kitzinger and Reilly, 1997</xref>), creating reinforcing feedback loops in the news production. The media system is highly self-referential: media tend to follow other media, thereby nourishing the news wave. This is reinforced by the interaction with responding social actors. Often one specific frame becomes dominant in the coverage, because media tend to look for frame-confirming information and sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267323113486235">Donsbach, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>During a media-hype the new health risk is magnified, creating the perception that this is a very serious risk that needs attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267323113486235">Vasterman et al., 2005</xref>). Media-hypes may also put pressure on the government and public health institutions to take drastic steps in order to handle the alleged threat. If they do so, they will validate the frame of a ‘real’ crisis. This interaction is described as ‘the social amplification of risk’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267323113486235">Kasperson, 1987</xref>), in which this new risk – regardless of the real risks involved – becomes a very important social issue, even a health scare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267323113486235">Hooker, 2010</xref>). If many things are uncertain and undetermined, as is the case after the first outbreak of a new virus, an ideal breeding ground for media-hypes and risk amplification appears.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0267323113486235">
<title>Stages in the epidemic</title>
<p>Developments in media coverage can be linked to the successive stages of the epidemic. Previous research on Ebola, SARS and avian flu defined three stages in the coverage of a new virus, each with a different discourse: ‘sounding the alarm’, ‘mixed messages’ and ‘hot crisis and containment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267323113486235">Holland and Blood, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0267323113486235">Nerlich and Halliday, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0267323113486235">Ungar, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267323113486235">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267323113486235">Wallis and Nerlich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0267323113486235">Washer, 2004</xref>). This model can be used to analyse the A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009: during the first (alarm) stage of the outbreak, fearful claims can be expected to dominate the news with an emphasis on potential mutation of the virus and spreading contagion. The second stage of preparation for the coming crisis may be characterized by a combination of both fearful and reassuring messages. The third stage, when the epidemic is a fact, is expected to be accompanied by a ‘crisis and containment’ discourse stressing that the situation is serious but under control. By analysing these three stages it is possible to reconstruct how media coverage of the pandemic developed. The research questions are formulated in line with these three stages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0267323113486235">
<title>Research questions</title>
<p>It is relevant to examine the characteristics of media coverage, as it influences public perception of risks as well as the response of the public health authorities. The volume of the news flows is important, as is the content of the news. Which frames and which sources are dominant? Are there indeed media-hypes triggered by specific key events during the pandemic?</p>
<p>For this research the following research questions were formulated:</p>
<p><italic>RQ1</italic>: Regarding the volume and the frequency of the news flows: are there intensive news waves (media-hypes), triggered by (which) key events?</p>
<p><italic>RQ2</italic>: What was the main message (frame) in the media about the pandemic during the successive stages?</p>
<p><italic>RQ3</italic>: What was the share of alarming, reassuring or neutral statements in the news during the pandemic?</p>
<p><italic>RQ4</italic>: Who had the largest share in the number of reassuring or alarming messages: the media or the expert sources? And which sources were dominant?</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0267323113486235" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The research is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative content analysis of (a sample of) newspaper articles and television news programmes covering the outbreak in the Netherlands. Included are the main Dutch newspapers (<italic>NRC Handelsblad, de Volkskrant, De Telegraaf, Trouw, Algemeen Dagblad, De Pers, Metro</italic> and <italic>Spits</italic>) and the three most important TV news programmes: one public broadcasting programme (<italic>NOS Journaal</italic>) and two commercial programmes (<italic>RTL Nieuws</italic> and <italic>Hart van Nederland</italic>).</p>
<p>The qualitative analysis is based on a systematic description of the successive events and their ‘construction’ in the news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323113486235">Altheide, 1996</xref>). This analysis focuses on the frames (meanings and the metaphors) used to describe the threat of the pandemic and the response of the health authorities and the public. The quantitative analysis is used is to determine the sources and the tone of the news coverage.</p>
<sec id="section10-0267323113486235">
<title>Time frame</title>
<p>Following previous research into epidemics, we divided the time frame into three stages. The first stage (alarm) covers the first two weeks, from 24 April through 9 May 2009, because these two weeks showed massive news coverage on the outbreak, which quickly declined thereafter. The second (preparatory) stage runs from 10 May until 23 October, when the flu officially became an epidemic in the Netherlands. During this second stage, the pandemic was declared as the flu spread all over the world. The third stage (crisis) begins on 24 October, when the epidemic was officially declared, and lasts until 28 December when the epidemic had ended.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0267323113486235">
<title>Samples</title>
<p>The selection of articles is based on an automatic analysis of all relevant articles in the news media described above. All items/articles included contain keywords related to the Mexican flu.</p>
<p><italic>Sample newspapers</italic>: during stage one (first two weeks) all articles on the Mexican flu were selected for analysis, in total 293 articles. For stages two and three a random sample was used of 58% of all articles on this topic, resulting in 1111 (of 1903) articles. This gave a total of 1404 articles, containing 6790 statements for analysis. Only the headline and the lead of the article were used for analysis. If the article lacked a lead (news analysis or column) the coder would code the first and the concluding paragraph.</p>
<p><italic>Sample TV news</italic>: for stage one (first two weeks), all items on the Mexican flu were selected (total 33). For stages two and three, only those days when all three news media had coverage on the pandemic (69), which resulted in a sample of 102 TV items (out of a total of 294), containing 3932 statements for analysis. All statements were used for coding.</p>
<p>As headlines and leads grasp what the reporter defines as the most newsworthy aspect of the story and the main facts, it is acceptable to analyse these instead of the whole article. Since TV news has a different structure, it was decided to code the whole item to get a good overview of the content of the topic at hand.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0267323113486235">
<title>Coding procedures</title>
<p>In the quantitative content analysis we looked at two special aspects of the news: the sources and the degree to which the news is alarming. As mentioned before the sentence or statement is used as the basic unit for analysis of the newspaper and TV sample.</p>
<p>A source is defined as an actor to whom the information in the statement is attributed by quoting or paraphrasing this actor. The categories of sources were defined in advance at a specific level and aggregated later to six more general categories: government, WHO, RIVM (Dutch Centre for Infectious Disease Control), scientific experts (i.e. virologists), society (citizens, business, etc.) and the health sector (hospitals, physicians, etc.). During the coding the sources were counted on the level of the statements, so if an article contained more than one source, they would all be included. When no source was mentioned, we considered the newspaper or TV reporter to be accountable for the statements and therefore to be considered as the source of the news.</p>
<p>By coding only the headline and the lead of the articles in the newspaper sample chances are that sources mentioned deeper down in the article will be excluded. On the other hand the majority of articles in the sample consist of news reports, built around a few important sources always mentioned in headline and lead. This might be different for some background articles, but these have only a small share in the total coverage. So the loss of information is quite limited.</p>
<p>In order to measure the alarming tone of the news coverage three categories were defined: news can be alarming, neutral or reassuring. In general, a report is alarming when the situation is defined in terms of risk and hazard. For example: ‘WHO raises pandemic alert level; more Mexican flu cases feared.’ As such, warnings for severe outbreaks are alarming as are updates on the number of patients, hospitalizations and fatalities. The same goes for descriptions of the virus as ‘extremely contagious’ or ‘deadly’.</p>
<p>A report is reassuring when risks related to the A/H1N1 flu are put in a broader perspective that downscales the risk (also because of effective preparations by health authorities). For example: ‘A/H1N1 is like a regular flu.’</p>
<p>Statements are neutral when they contain both perspectives, or when the tone is undecided. Coding sentences to be alarming, reassuring or neutral was conducted by a team of coders. When the tone of the sentence was not clear, coders could use the context of the article to decide on the tone of the sentence. Hereby coders indicated the use of synonyms (signal words) related to alarming or reassuring words (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0267323113486235">Appendix</xref> for an overview). The coders analysed 18 identical articles on the tone of the news. The reliability score was satisfactory with an average Cronbach’s α of .84 on the three categories: alarming, reassuring and neutral.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section14-0267323113486235">
<title>RQ1: Key events and news waves</title>
<p>From 24 April to 28 December, the eight selected national dailies published a total of 2270 articles, an average of 1.4 articles per newspaper per day. During the first two weeks, the newspapers printed an average of three articles per day with a total of 293 stories, which is 13% of the total coverage. The three TV news programmes had 294 items on the Mexican flu, of which 47 items were broadcast during the first two weeks (16% of total).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267323113486235">Figure 1</xref> shows the amount of media attention to the pandemic in the newspapers and TV news programmes. The news flows fluctuate; there are clearly several explosions of media attention, the largest one in the first two weeks. Later on, new waves of coverage were triggered by key events like the first casualty in Europe (week 24) and the first death in the Netherlands (week 31). Newspapers and TV news channels followed the same waves of news, except for the first week of August when the newspapers highlighted the first patient dying from the Mexican flu to a larger extent than TV did. By the end of October, a healthy teenager and two toddlers had died from the flu, which was breaking news for the media, especially for the TV programmes. The November vaccination campaigns for groups at risk also attracted a lot of media coverage. After that, attention of the phenomenon decreased.</p>

<p>The news coverage of the pandemic came in six intensive news waves, with the highest levels during the first two weeks (stage one), three somewhat smaller waves during the second stage and another very intensive wave during the third stage. It is remarkable that the first wave was the most extensive, given the fact that the new virus had not yet reached the Netherlands at that point. This is different from the news waves in the UK newspapers, where the first wave was much lower than the one during the second stage when the UK had – contrary to the Netherlands – a fast-growing number of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267323113486235">Hilton and Hunt, 2010</xref>). In October, the UK had a second surge with only a modest increase in media coverage showing the diminishing newsworthiness of the topic. By that time it had become clear in the UK that the Mexican flu was very mild, while the media in the Netherlands were still expecting a severe epidemic, alarmed as they were by the growing number of hospitalizations and the deaths of three healthy children. Compared to the Dutch media, British coverage seemed more in pace with the actual progression of the epidemic.</p>

<title>RQ2: Dominating frames in news coverage</title>
<sec id="section16-0267323113486235">
<title>Alarm stage</title>
<p>During the first two weeks after the outbreak in Mexico, the media emphasized the global threat of a pandemic triggered by a new virus for which people did not have natural immunity. Alarming messages about the expected death toll and the high degree of infections, requiring hospitalization, did prevail in the media. The new virus was described in frightening words and metaphors. There were stories about previous pandemics, like the Spanish flu at the beginning of the 20th century, which caused the deaths of tens of millions of people all over the world. Daily updates about the (international) spread of the virus were an integral part of every news bulletin. Scientific experts (virologists) and health authorities were important sources in the news. Although the pandemic threat dominated the media, there are also some alternative voices, stressing the more harmless nature of the flu.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0267323113486235">
<title>Preparatory stage</title>
<p>The second stage includes a long period (from 10 May until 23 October) as it took the new flu a long time to become an epidemic in the Netherlands. During this stage, the media focused on all the public health preparations and optional crisis scenarios. Government and public health sources made an attempt to communicate reassuring message that everything was under control. At the same time, however, all these preparations (like ordering millions of vaccines) triggered media coverage and confirmed the idea of a serious public health problem. On 11 June, the WHO officially declared A/H1N1 to be a pandemic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0267323113486235">5</xref></sup> Decisive in this was the spread of the virus in a second WHO region, regardless whether the epidemic was mild or severe. This epidemiological definition is quite different from the general perception of a pandemic as a severe public health crisis. The Dutch media hardly paid any attention to these differences in perception and stuck to the idea that a pandemic is severe by definition, despite new data showing the mild character of A/H1N1. Health authorities continued to expect more than a thousand victims in the Netherlands. The first patient’s death in August was front-page news. A few weeks later, however, the Dutch health authority decided to downscale the severity, because the disease turned out to be quite mild. Only groups with a special risk would receive a vaccination. The amount of media attention for the pandemic decreased quickly after these messages. Overall, during this stage the messages were alarming at first but by September the Mexican flu was seen as quite harmless.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0267323113486235">
<title>Crisis stage</title>
<p>This is the stage (from 24 October until 28 December 2009) in which there was officially a flu epidemic in the Netherlands (23 October). It brought A/H1N1 back to the front pages of the media, especially after reports that healthy children had died of the flu. More deaths were reported, while the number of hospitalizations (of whom almost 50% were children) rose quickly. The media paid a lot of attention to the growing anxiety among the public (‘Panic after flu deaths’). At the time of the start of vaccination campaigns for groups at risk, there was also a controversy about the safety of the vaccines, which received a lot of media attention. The public health authorities made an attempt to reassure the public and simultaneously stress the necessity of the vaccine. A report at the beginning of December on the mutation of the virus that made it resistant to antiviral drugs was framed in such a way that this was not alarming. For example <italic>de Volkskrant</italic> wrote on 4 December, ‘According to the RIVM … the mutated virus did not spread. The RIVM emphasizes that the vaccines also protect against this mutated virus.’ In December, the number of patients went down very rapidly and by the end of the month the epidemic was over. Media coverage diminished as well during the last weeks of this third stage.</p>

<p>The expectation on the basis of the available literature on epidemics is that coverage will be very alarming during the first stage, followed by more reassuring messages during the second stage, and then again more alarming during the actual crisis, but within a discourse of control. For the newspapers this cannot be confirmed: the number of alarming statements decreased steadily after the first stage. It starts at 79%, followed by 71% during the second stage and 68% during the epidemic phase (χ<sup>2</sup> (4) = 61.618, <italic>p</italic> = .000, V = .095).

<title>RQ4: The attribution of alarming statements to media and sources</title>
<p>In total, 1278 sources were mentioned in the coverage on the flu pandemic. These sources were aggregated into six categories: government, WHO, RIVM (Dutch Centre for Infectious Disease Control), scientific experts (virologists), society (citizens, business, etc.) and the health sector (hospitals, physicians, etc.). In the view of the research questions (whose messages were alarming or reassuring?) it was decided to specify only the expert sources in different categories. Not surprisingly, 28% of the sources’ belong to the general category of ‘society’ (there are a lot of stories about the impact of the flu). More interesting, however, is the fact that experts and health authorities (including the WHO) claim 40% of all statements (43% in newspapers and 37% on TV) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0267323113486235">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267323113486235">Table 3</xref> shows, the WHO has the highest score of alarming messages (most of the statements in the first stage) on TV as well as in the national dailies (average 93%). This is followed by messages from the RIVM (79%) and society sources (75%). The government has 74% alarming messages. The experts have a score of 69%. Taking the three stages into account it turns out that the experts were very alarming during the first stage (93%) and much less during the second (43%) and more alarming during the third stage (70%). Other sources show a similar development. Although less alarming messages appear during the second stage, this number increases when the epidemic is a fact, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0267323113486235">Figure 5</xref>.

<p>The conclusion is that the media are less alarming along the way, while expert sources and the RIVM show an increase during the epidemic in the autumn. Conclusively, for all sources (except the WHO) and the media the first stage was the most alarming, followed by a decline and another increase albeit lower than the first one). The findings show that, on the whole, the media were not more alarming as a whole than their sources, which is in contrast with the general perception that the media have a tendency to be alarmist.</p>

<title>Influential experts</title>
<p>In the Netherlands two experts played a key role in the whole coverage, the virologist Professor Osterhaus (Institute of Virology of the Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam) and the director of the Dutch Centre for Infectious Disease Control (RIVM), Professor Coutinho. During the first two weeks Osterhaus (an already well-known expert to the Dutch audience), dominated the coverage with a share of 29% of all statements in the newspapers and even 45% of all statements on the three TV news programmes. During the second and the third stage Coutinho became more important on television than Osterhaus, but in the newspapers the latter remained the most quoted expert. Since the RIVM is the official health institution of the Dutch government, the important role of Coutinho is evident. During the first two stages hardly any media attention was directed at other experts expressing a critical view on the pandemic. This then changed in the third stage when a number of different experts were quoted.</p>
<p>Newspapers had a higher share of different expert sources during all three stages than television. The variety of experts during all three stages was higher in the newspapers than on television, where Osterhaus and Coutinho claimed 60% of all statements by experts. Since these two sources were important it is interesting to note that their messages about the Mexican flu were mainly alarming.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the flow, the content and the sources of the news on the A/H1N1 flu in the Dutch media. It offers material for the debate about the role of the media during the pandemic in 2009. In line with previous research, three stages were defined: the alarm stage, the preparatory stage and the crisis stage, each with different frames. As the results show, media coverage during these stages was not regular, but instead came in several intensive news waves, the first one (first two weeks) being the most intense. These media-hypes were triggered by key events like the outbreak of the virus and the death of healthy children during the crisis stage. These surges in media attention were not linked to the actual progression of the epidemic or the actual number of patients – as was indeed the case in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267323113486235">Hilton and Hunt, 2010</xref>). It was only during the epidemic stage that coverage was in line with a growing number of hospitalizations.</p>
<p>Decisive for generating the first news wave during the alarm stage was the framing of the Mexican flu as a potentially catastrophic pandemic. This matches with the conclusions in other studies: uncertainty about the threat leads to speculation about worst-case scenarios. The preparatory stage also showed two news waves, but smaller. The crisis stage had one large news wave almost reaching the same heights as the one in the alarm stage.</p>
<p>The framing of the pandemic changed during the three stages: at first the pandemic was defined as a very high-level risk, then this was brought down to the levels of the common flu, followed again by a renewed concern during the actual epidemic. These findings are largely in line with the three discourses identified in previous studies on epidemics: high alarm after the initial outbreak, mixed messages during the preparatory stage and crisis and containment during the stage of the actual epidemic. Nevertheless, for months the dark shadow of the deadly pandemic discourse dominated all the news about the A/H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Media coverage was mainly alarming during the first and the third stage of the epidemic. The second stage showed decreasing levels of alarming statements with a short period in which the coverage was mainly reassuring. Public health authorities played an important role during this stage by downscaling the threat. The media returned again to intensive and alarming coverage when an increasing number of children were hospitalized and three healthy children (two toddlers and one teenager) suddenly died of the flu. This brought back the initial threat of a serious epidemic, especially on television. TV news turned out to be more alarming than the newspapers during the first and the last stage, while the newspaper showed a declining number of alarming statements from the start in April. Overall the bulk of the media coverage during the whole period was mainly alarming with an average of 72%.</p>
<p>The findings show that the media were generally not more alarming than their sources, which is in contrast with the general perception that the media have a tendency to be more alarmist. The level of alarming statements was higher for the sources during the first stage than for the media and the same is true for the third stage. In between, however, the media were more alarming than the sources. On average, the WHO and the RIVM have the highest scores, while the experts in general issued less alarming statements. Government sources in turn issued the lowest number of alarming statements, probably because these sources were trying to reduce fears among the public.</p>
<p>The expert sources and the public health officials played a dominating role in the coverage, although the variety in sources was limited, comprising only a few well-known experts. This coincides with other studies showing that statements from regulatory agencies drive the media. Other types of sources may become prominent in later stages of issue development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0267323113486235">Shih et al., 2011</xref>). This is what happened in the Netherlands as well: dissident views, although quite marginal during the first stage, became more authoritative later on. Focusing on the two most quoted experts in the media, the conclusion is that their messages were overall very alarming, while other experts were less alarming.</p>
<p>Can the case of the H1N1 pandemic be considered as an example of a risk amplification process? An important point is the fact that there was a lot of uncertainty during the first weeks of the pandemic about its potential risks. Despite that, official sources (WHO) and scientific experts were very alarming in their statements with an emphasis on worst-case scenarios, triggering massive media attention all over the world. Intensive news waves can work as feedback loops reinforcing the original message of a devastating pandemic. In June the WHO declared H1N1 a pandemic, but by that time the severity had ceased to be part of the definition of the pandemic. Nevertheless, national governments decided to activate pandemic contingency plans in which pandemics were perceived as catastrophic. For the media this worked as a confirmation of the alarming messages in the first stage and therefore as an impulse for prolonged coverage. Conversely all this media attention probably increased the pressure on public health authorities to take immediate action and order vaccines. This needs to be explored further in future research. In the Netherlands it took six months before the H1N1 flu was officially an epidemic, in contrast to the UK where the first wave of the Mexican flu already took place in the summer, proving to the health authorities as well as the media that this flu was less severe than expected. Media attention declined sharply and did not rise again during the second epidemic in the autumn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267323113486235">Hilton and Hunt, 2010</xref>). In the Netherlands, to the contrary, the epidemic in October triggered a huge news wave, even though the Mexican flu was not more lethal than the common flu. In that respect the media, inspired by the expert sources, were indeed over-hyping the threat, carried away by emotional stories about healthy children in intensive care, some of them dying from the flu.</p>
