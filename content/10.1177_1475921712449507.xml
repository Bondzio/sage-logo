<abstract>
<p>Orthotropic steel bridges have experienced early fatigue cracks at several welded connections in the steel deck plate. One of the possible strengthening systems to enlarge the fatigue life of the existing decks consists of bonding a second steel plate to the existing deck. This renovation technique was for the first time applied on the orthotropic deck of the movable bridge Scharsterrijn. This article describes the results of the structural monitoring carried out to evaluate the short-term and long-term performance of the strengthening system. Static and dynamic controlled load tests were carried out using a calibrated truck. Strain history measurements were recorded continuously during 1 year from the normal traffic running on the bridge. The short-term measurements show significant decrease of the stress level at the bridge deck after the renovation, especially at the deck plate details. The stresses at the welds between the deck plate and the stiffener web reduce approximately 55% at the deck plate side and 35% at the stiffener web side. Due to this reduction, the fatigue life of these welds is expected to increase 11 times at the deck plate side and 3.6 times at the stiffener side. The long-term measurements do not show significant changes in the stress level at the bridge deck during the year of monitoring. The strengthening system has demonstrated good performance reliability to prolong the life span of the movable orthotropic bridges.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Orthotropic steel bridge deck consists of a deck plate supported in two mutually perpendicular directions by a system of longitudinal stiffeners and cross-beams, which are, in turn, spanned by the main girders, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1475921712449507">Figure 1</xref>. All these elements are connected by welding. In the past decades, severe fatigue cracks have been reported at several welds of orthotropic steel bridge decks all around the world; see examples in Europe,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475921712449507">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475921712449507">2</xref></sup> Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475921712449507">3</xref></sup> and China.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475921712449507">4</xref></sup> The most dangerous cracks are at the weld between the deck plate and the stiffener webs, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1475921712449507">Figure 2</xref>. The cracks are dangerous, first, because they can be a severe threat to the safety conditions of the normal traffic running on the bridge and, second, because they grow through the deck plate in a very early age of the orthotropic bridge deck. Those fatigue cracks are caused by the insufficient stiffness of the existing orthotropic steel decks to face the increase of heavy traffic loads. The structural performance of these existing decks does not meet the requirements of the current heavy traffic.</p>

<p>Research projects have studied different renovation systems to strengthen existing orthotropic steel bridge decks. The main idea is to add a stiff layer on the top of the existing deck to increase its total stiffness. The stresses at the existing welds will decrease, and their fatigue life will be extended. Strengthening systems have been investigated based on a concrete overlay system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475921712449507">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475921712449507"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475921712449507"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475921712449507">8</xref></sup> and on adding a second steel plate either using a sandwich structure or just bonding it to the existing steel deck.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475921712449507">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475921712449507"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475921712449507"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475921712449507">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In March 2009, the strengthening of an orthotropic deck by bonding a second steel plate was for the first time applied at the pilot project of the renovation of the movable bridge Scharsterrijn in the Netherlands. The renovation consisted of repairing the existing fatigue cracks and strengthening the orthotropic deck by bonding a second steel plate to the existing deck plate. Structural monitoring was carried out in order to evaluate the performance of the strengthening system.</p>
<p>Structural monitoring is essential in the assessment of the actual structural condition and performance of a fatigue cracked steel bridge. Through the strain data obtained from bridge monitoring, one can better understand the actual behaviour of the bridge, actual stresses and stress distribution during normal traffic conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475921712449507">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475921712449507">14</xref></sup> The real input, obtained from structural monitoring, has been used for several applications, such as validation of bridge design models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475921712449507">15</xref></sup> or predicting the fatigue life of steel bridges based on their real strain history.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475921712449507">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1475921712449507">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Structural monitoring is also very important to decide whether or not renovations are required<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1475921712449507">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475921712449507">19</xref></sup> and, if so, to evaluate their performance, as it has been done in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475921712449507">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475921712449507">21</xref></sup> Long-term continuous health monitoring gives the possibility to predict when, where and how the failure might occur. Due to the high instrumentation costs, the decision for long-term monitoring is only justified for bridges with significant interest to research the performance of innovative technologies, such as this new type of strengthening system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475921712449507">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present article describes the results obtained from the structural monitoring carried out on the strengthened orthotropic deck of the movable bridge Scharsterrijn. The study includes short-term and long-term monitoring. The short-term monitoring evaluates the performance of the strengthening system immediately after the renovation. The long-term monitoring evaluates the system’s performance for a period of 1 year. The aim is to detect major changes in the structural integrity of the bridge deck due to degradation of the strengthening system. The goal is to evaluate the short-term and long-term performances of the renovation system and to decide about further applications.</p>
<p>The monitoring was carried out by the Stevin Laboratory of the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at the Delft University of Technology by order of Takke LSBV Brugdekken VOF. Takke LSBV Brugdekken VOF was commissioned by the Ministry of Transport and Public Works in the Netherlands to carry out the complete renovation of the orthotropic deck of the movable bridge Scharsterrijn.</p>

<title>Description of Scharsterrijn Bridge and renovation technique</title>
<p>The Scharsterrijn Bridge is located in Friesland, a northern province of the Netherlands. The bridge was built in 1970. After periodical inspections, fatigue cracks were observed around the year 2000. The decision of renovating the movable orthotropic deck of the bridge was taken in 2008, and the renovation took place in 2009.</p>
<p>The bridge is composed of two independent bridges (one per traffic direction) and each one with a fixed and a movable part. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1475921712449507">Figure 3</xref> shows a drawing of the typical cross section of the movable orthotropic steel deck. The main girders of the movable bridge have a total span of 8300 mm. The bridge deck consists of an orthotropic steel plate of 12 mm thickness, stiffened by ‘U-shaped’ longitudinal stiffeners and four transverse cross-beams distanced at 2530 mm.</p>

</fig>
<p>The strengthening system consisted of bonding a second steel plate on the heavy traffic lane of the movable bridge with the north traffic direction (Lemmer to Joure). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1475921712449507">Figure 4</xref> shows a schematic plan view of the movable Scharsterrijn Bridge, including the second steel plate position. The second steel plate is 6 mm thick, 4200 mm wide and 8200 mm long. The bonding layer consists of a low-viscosity epoxy resin (Epikote resin EPR 04908 with hardener Epikure curing agent EPH 04908) with 2 mm nominal thickness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475921712449507">11</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>The renovation procedure consisted of the following chronological steps: (a) remove the existing wearing course, (b) examine the bridge deck for existing cracks, (c) repair cracks if needed, (d) grit blast the steel top surface of the existing deck plate (Blast-cleaning grade Sa 2 1/2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475921712449507">22</xref></sup>) followed by primer application, (e) glue steel spacers of 2 mm thickness to the deck plate, (f) place the new steel plate in the correct position above the steel spacers, (g) prepare the cavity between steel plates to create vacuum, (h) vacuum inject the adhesive into the cavity, (i) cure during 16 h between 40°C and 50°C temperature and (j) place the new wearing surface on top of the new steel plate.</p>

<sec id="section3-1475921712449507">
<title>Monitoring plan</title>
<p>A monitoring plan was carried out on the movable orthotropic bridge deck to evaluate the performance of the strengthened deck. The monitoring plan included short-term and long-term measurements.</p>
<p>The short-term measurements were carried out immediately before and after the renovation. The strain values were recorded from controlled static load tests, and strain history measurements were recorded from the normal traffic running on the bridge. The goal is to evaluate the short-term structural performance of the renovation.</p>
<p>The long-term measurements were carried out during 1 year, starting immediately after the renovation. Controlled dynamic load tests were carried out once every month, and strain history measurements were recorded continuously. The goal is to evaluate the durability of the renovation.</p>
<sec id="section4-1475921712449507">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>The instrumentation consisted of applying strain gauges (SG) to the orthotropic bridge deck. The strain gauges were applied to three transversal cross sections of the movable deck: one at the middle of the deck, referred to as the middle-span cross section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1475921712449507">Figure 4</xref>– cut 1-1′); one at the beginning of the deck, referred to as the Lemmer cross section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1475921712449507">Figure 4</xref>– cut 3-3′) and, finally, one at the end of the deck, referred to as the Joure cross section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1475921712449507">Figure 4</xref>– cut 2-2′). The short-term monitoring was carried out at the middle-span cross section. The long-term monitoring was carried out at all three cross sections.</p>
<p>Two strain gauges were placed unattached to the bridge deck, and they were used as witness strain gauges. Their strain data are used as reference to compare with the strain data from the deck plate. The witness strain gauges record strain variation due to temperature effects caused by thermal cycles. They also record irregular occasional peaks caused by external interference. The strain data from the deck plate are corrected based on these witness measurements (peaks and temperature effects are removed). This procedure has proven to be extremely important for long-term monitoring in order to better understand changes in continuous data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475921712449507">23</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section5-1475921712449507">
<title>Middle-span cross section</title>
<p>Sixteen strain gauges were applied to the middle-span cross section. They were applied close to the right wheel track (traffic direction) and to different deck details in order to determine the stress reduction at different orthotropic deck details. The positions of the 16 strain gauges are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1475921712449507">Figure 5</xref>. The strain gauges close to the welds (2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 12) measured transverse strains 15 mm from the weld toe, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1475921712449507">Figure 6</xref>. The strain gauges 1, 7 and 13 measured transverse strains at middle span between stiffener webs. Strain gauges 43 and 44 are at the same position as 1 and 7, respectively, but measuring longitudinal strains. Strain gauges 4, 10 and 14 measured longitudinal strains at the bottom of the stiffeners.</p>

<title>Joure and Lemmer cross sections</title>
<p>In the long term, the critical points of the strengthening system are at the longitudinal edges of the new steel plate, at the beginning and at the end of the deck. High stress levels at the adhesive layer are expected where the end of the second steel plate meets the cross-beam location (stiffer deck plate). If degradation of the strengthening system due to delamination of the adhesive layer occurs, it will most probably start there. Therefore, for the long-term monitoring, strain gauges were applied at the beginning (Lemmer cross section) and at the end (Joure cross section) of the strengthened deck. They measured only strains at the deck plate because these are expected to be the most sensitive to the strengthening performance. The strain gauges are positioned at the normal traffic wheel track, both left and right, where high strains are expected due to the wheel loads.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1475921712449507">Figure 7(a)</xref> shows the 15 strain gauges that were applied at the Joure cross section. The strain gauges close to the welds (16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25 and 27) measured transverse strains 15 mm from the weld toe, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1475921712449507">Figure 6</xref>. Strain gauges 17, 20, 23 and 26 measured transverse strains at middle span between stiffener webs. Strain gauges 15 and 28 measured transverse strains 50 mm from the end of the new plate. Strain gauge 45 is at the same position as strain gauge 17 but measuring longitudinal strains. All 15 strain gauges are distanced 100 mm from cross-beam 1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1475921712449507">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>The wheel loads can be compared with the set of standard lorries defined at the Fatigue Load Model 4 of Eurocode 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1475921712449507">24</xref></sup> used for the fatigue calculations of bridges. The single-tyre wheel load, 37.75 kN on average, is slightly heavier than the 35 kN standard (70 kN front axle load). The double-tyre wheel load, 37.5 kN on average, is lighter than the minimum standard, 45 kN (90 kN rear axle load). The single tyre and the double tyre have approximately the same load.</p>
<p>The wheel prints are the load area of the wheel (contact area of the wheel with the deck plate). The area of the wheel prints is 864 cm<sup>2</sup> for the single tyre and 972 cm<sup>2</sup> for the double tyre. These wheel prints are in accordance with the classification given by the same Fatigue Load Model 4. The single tyre is comparable with the wheel print type C (270 mm width and 320 mm length) and the double tyre is comparable with the wheel print type B (540 mm width and 320 mm length). The axle spacing and the transverse distance between wheels are in accordance with the values of the same standard load model.</p>

<title>Dynamic loads</title>
<p>Controlled dynamic load tests were carried out once every month over a period of 1 year, starting immediately after the renovation. Dynamic strain values were triggered when the calibrated truck crossed the movable bridge. On each ‘test-day’ of the month, eight tests were performed. Up to September 2009, the tests were carried out at the same transverse position. After analysing the data, this truck position showed to be outside the relevant measuring area of the deck, causing insignificant strain values at the strain gauge positions. Therefore, the results up to September 2009 are not presented. After September 2009, the tests were performed varying the transverse position of the calibrated truck. This procedure allowed covering different deck details and determining the dynamic stress influence lines of the deck plate. The calibrated truck transverse position was recorded using laser equipment positioned at the side of the bridge. The speed of the calibrated truck was, in all cases, approximately 80 km/h. The calibrated truck was a four-axle lorry similar to the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1475921712449507">Figure 9</xref>, with an extra coupled three-axle trailer. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1475921712449507">Table 2</xref> lists the wheel loads. The deviation between wheel loads, in the different dynamic tests, is less than 5%.</p>

<title>Strain history measurements</title>
<p>Strain history measurements were recorded continuously under normal traffic conditions at all strain gauges applied to the bridge deck. The strain values recorded correspond with the successive maximum and minimum values caused by each axle load crossing the bridge. From these measurements, stress spectra for each strain gauge can be derived using cycle counting methods.</p>
<p>Strain history measurements were used on the short-term monitoring for comparison of the stress spectrum before and after the renovation and on the long-term monitoring for detecting changes in the stress spectrum over the period of 1 year.</p>

<title>Results and analysis</title>
<p>The results and analysis of the strain data were gathered in five main groups, each group represents a typical detail of an orthotropic steel bridge deck.</p>
<p>Group I gathers the results from the transverse strains at the deck plate between stiffener webs, for example, at the middle-span cross section, strain gauges 1, 7 and 13 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1475921712449507">Figure 5</xref>). Group II gathers the results from the transverse strains at the deck plate close to the weld, for example, at the middle-span cross section, strain gauges 2, 6, 8 and 12 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1475921712449507">Figure 5</xref>) and at the Joure and Lemmer cross sections, strain gauges 16, 18, 30 and 32 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1475921712449507">Figure 7</xref>). Group III gathers the results from the transverse strains at the stiffener web close to the weld. This group contains only strain gauges from the middle-span cross section as strain gauges 3, 5, 9 and 11 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1475921712449507">Figure 5</xref>). Group VI gathers the results from the longitudinal strains at the bottom of the stiffener. Also, this group contains only strain gauges from the middle-span cross section as strain gauges 4, 10 and 14 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1475921712449507">Figure 5</xref>). Finally, group V gathers the results from the longitudinal strains at the same position as group I, such as, for example, strain gauges 43 and 44 at the middle-span cross section (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1475921712449507">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section12-1475921712449507">
<title>Short-term monitoring</title>
<p>On the short-term monitoring, static influence lines and stress spectra were determined to evaluate the immediate performance of the strengthening system. The measurements were recorded for the strain gauges applied at the middle-span cross section (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1475921712449507">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section13-1475921712449507">
<title>Static influence lines</title>
<p>Strain data from the controlled static load tests were used to determine static influence lines due to wheel loads. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1475921712449507">Figure 10</xref> shows one example of the strain influence lines that can be determined from one strain gauge. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1475921712449507">Figure 10(a)</xref> shows the results of the single-tyre load case (tests 1 and 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1475921712449507">Table 1</xref>), and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1475921712449507">Figure 10(b)</xref> shows the results of the double-tyre load case (tests 3 and 4 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1475921712449507">Table 1</xref>).

<p>The results of the single-tyre load case are less scattered than those of the double-tyre load case. This might be related to the fact that the exact position of the rear axle (double tyre) is more difficult to control than that of the front axle (single tyre). Deviations of few millimetres from the intended tyre positions can lead to significant differences in strain values. This indicates that transverse strains at the deck plate are mainly caused by local loads (wheels) rather than global loads (truck).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1475921712449507">Figure 11</xref> compares, for each group, the strain influence lines due to single tyre and due to double tyre. Each graph shows the results of one representative strain gauge of the group.</p>

<p>There are two main differences between the two load cases: first, the wheel prints, which are bigger on the double tyre than on the single tyre, and second, the load configuration, which is one single load on the single tyre and two loads side by side on the double tyre. The wheel loads between the two load cases are comparable (37 and 38.5 kN).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1475921712449507">Figure 11(a)</xref> shows the results of group I (the deck plate transverse strain at middle span between stiffeners), represented by strain gauge 7 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921712449507">Figure 8</xref>). In the single-tyre load case, the maximum strain is reached when the load is aligned with the strain gauge (<italic>x</italic> = 900 mm). The results from the double-tyre load case show two peaks, the first peak appears (<italic>x</italic> ≈ 500 mm) when the right double tyre is approximately aligned with the strain gauge, and the second one appears (<italic>x</italic> ≈ 1000 mm) when the left double tyre is approximately aligned with the strain gauge. Note that the reference point for the double-tyre load case is the middle of the left tyre. The strains are considerably lower when using the double tyre than when using the single tyre. This has to do with the fact that the individual tyre load is higher on the single tyre than on each of the two double tyres.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1475921712449507">Figure 11(b)</xref> shows the results of group II (the deck plate transverse strain close to the weld), represented by strain gauge 8 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921712449507">Figure 8</xref>). The single-tyre load case presents two peaks of compressive strain, one before and one after the strain gauge (<italic>x</italic> ≈ 800 mm and <italic>x</italic> ≈ 1250 mm). The double-tyre load case presents three peaks: first (<italic>x</italic> ≈ 500 mm), when the right double tyre is before the strain gauge; second (<italic>x</italic> ≈ 800 mm), when the strain gauge is just in between the tyres and finally, a third, when the left tyre is after the strain gauge (<italic>x</italic> ≈ 1250 mm). For <italic>x</italic> ≈ 800 mm, the double tyre leads to higher strains than the single tyre because of its load configuration, with one load on each side of the weld. For <italic>x</italic> ≈ 1250 mm, the single tyre leads to higher strains because, at this location, the left double tyre is the only one affecting the strain, and they have considerably less load than the single tyre.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1475921712449507">Figure 11(c)</xref> shows the results of group III (the stiffener web’s transverse strain close to the weld), represented by strain gauge 9 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921712449507">Figure 8</xref>). Both load cases have a minimum peak and a maximum peak. The minimum strain occurs when the single tyre is at middle span between different stiffeners (the load ‘outside’ the stiffeners), and the maximum strain occurs when the single tyre is at middle span between the same stiffener web (load ‘inside’ the stiffener). For the double-tyre load case, the strain value is minimum when the right double tyre is at the position ‘outside’– middle span between stiffeners. The strain approaches zero when the web is just between the double tyre (no bending of the web), and the strain is maximum when the left double tyre is at the position ‘inside’– middle span between stiffeners. As the load is higher for the individual single tyre than for each of the double tyres, the strains are higher for the single-tyre load case than for the double-tyre load case.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1475921712449507">Figure 11(d)</xref> shows the results of group IV (the lon-gitudinal strains at the bottom of the stiffener), represented by strain gauge 10 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921712449507">Figure 8</xref>). As expected, the longitudinal strains at the bottom of the stiffener are less load case dependent than the previous results. The strain at this location is more dependent on the total load than on the load configuration. Therefore, the single-tyre and double-tyre load cases present similar results.</p>
<p>The strain gauges from group V present results that are very similar to the strain gauges from group I as they are at the same position but measuring in the lon-gitudinal and transverse direction, respectively. The main difference is on the magnitude of the strain values, which is less on the longitudinal direction than on the transverse direction.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1475921712449507">Figure 12</xref> compares the strain gauge stress influence lines before and after the renovation. Each graph shows the results of two representative strain gauges of one group. The results are from the single-tyre load case. For the majority of the strain gauges, this is the most severe load case, and it is also the most reliable test concerning the wheel load position. The latter is especially important when tests before and after the renovation need to be compared. In order to compare strains within the same load level, the strain values measured before the renovation were corrected to a wheel load of 38.5 kN. The stress values were determined by the well-known Hooke’s law using a Young’s modulus for the steel of 210 GPa recommended in Eurocode 3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475921712449507">25</xref></sup> These stress values are an approximation of the actual stresses on the deck, since the Hooke’s law for plates takes also into account the strain in the perpendicular direction, which were not measured.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1475921712449507">Figure 12(a)</xref> shows the results of strain gauges 1 and 7, which represent group I. The pattern of the influence line is the same for the two strain gauges. The maximum strain depends on the strain gauge position (strain gauge 1, maximum at <italic>x</italic> ≈ 300 mm, and strain gauge 7, maximum at <italic>x</italic> ≈ 900 mm). As the geometry of the deck plate is repeated along the transverse direction, the pattern of the influence line is repeated for the same deck details. Strain gauges 43 and 44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1475921712449507">Figure 12(b)</xref>) measured strains at the same location as strain gauges 1 and 7 but in the longitudinal direction. The stress influence lines of 43 and 44 are very similar to the ones from 1 and 7, but with approximately half the stress magnitude.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1475921712449507">Figure 12(c)</xref> shows the results of strain gauges 2 and 12, which represent group II. These strain gauges measured transverse strains on the deck plate close to the weld with the stiffener web. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1475921712449507">Figure 12(d)</xref> shows the results of strain gauges 3 and 5, which measured the transverse strains close to the same weld but on the stiffener web side – group III. It can be observed that close to the weld, the stress values are considerably higher the stiffener web side than the deck plate side – groups III and II, respectively. Due to the stiffener’s geometric symmetry, the stress influence lines of strain gauges 3 and 5 are symmetric (same stiffener, left and right webs). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1475921712449507">Figure 12(e)</xref> shows the results of strain gauges 4 and 10, which measured longitudinal stresses on the bottom of the stiffener (group IV). The two stress influence lines are very similar. The results show that the wheel load is totally carried by one stiffener if the load is positioned just above the stiffener, and when the load is between stiffeners, 50% is carried by one stiffener and 50% by the other stiffener.</p>
<p>Significant stress reduction can be observed for all deck details after the renovation. The reduction is higher at the deck plate details, as groups I and II, than at the stiffener details, as groups III and IV.</p>

<p>Controlled load tests and strain history measurements give approximately the same results in terms of stress reduction factor. The results from the strain history measurements are in general less scattered than those from the controlled load tests.</p>
<p>The highest stress reduction is at the deck plate (groups I, II and V), varying from 45% to 55%. The transverse stress on the stiffener web is reduced by approximately 35% (group III). The lowest reduction is at the longitudinal stresses at the bottom of the stiffener, group IV. This reduction decreases in the direction of the middle span between main girders.</p>
<p>The stress reduction is higher at the deck plate details (groups I and II) than at the stiffener details (groups III and IV). The stress reduction decreases as we get farther away from the strengthening (deck plate level).</p>
<p>The aim of the reinforcement is to prolong the fatigue life of the bridge. This fatigue life is limited by the fatigue cracks that grow through the welds of the deck. As mentioned before, the most threatening cracks are at the welds between deck plate and stiffener web as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1475921712449507">Figure 2</xref>. Therefore, the most important stress reduction factors for the fatigue life of the bridge are from groups II and III, which represent strain gauges measuring strains close to these welds on the deck plate side and on the stiffener side, respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1475921712449507">Figure 6</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1475921712449507">Table 3</xref> shows that the stress ranges close to the weld between deck plate and stiffener web are reduced by about 55% at the deck plate and 35% at the stiffener web.</p>
<p>According to Eurocode 3: Part 1–9: Fatigue,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475921712449507">27</xref></sup> the fatigue strength curve of these welds is defined by the following equation</p>

<title>Long-term monitoring</title>
<p>Long-term monitoring was performed during 1 year starting immediately after the renovation. The goal is to evaluate the performance of the strengthening system during a certain period of time. The measurements were recorded for all strain gauges, applied at the three longitudinal sections of the deck: middle-span cross section, Joure cross section and Lemmer cross section (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1475921712449507">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1475921712449507">7</xref>).</p>
<p>However, a certain percentage of strain gauges failed before the long-term monitoring ended. From the 47 strain gauges applied to the bridge deck, 5 failed after 6 months (10%) and 5 more after 10 months. Hence, in total, 20% of the instrumentation was lost before the end of the monitoring, caused by failure of the strain gauges. Most of the instrumentation manufacturers do not consider the extra risk of harsh environmental conditions and construction process present in the real infrastructure. Even when taking extra precautions and using strain gauges intended for field measurements, failure still occurred in a considerable number of strain gauges.</p>
<p>The results of the strain gauges are gathered in the same five main groups, representing five deck details, as presented for the short-term monitoring.</p>
<sec id="section17-1475921712449507">
<title>Dynamic influence lines</title>
<p>Strain data from the controlled dynamic load tests were used to determine dynamic stress influence lines caused by the passage of the calibrated truck over the movable bridge deck.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1475921712449507">Figure 15</xref> shows the results of group I, which is re-presented by strain gauges 1, 17 and 34. These strain gauges measured the transverse strains on the deck plate between stiffener webs. The three strain gauges are at exactly the same transverse position of the deck but at different cross sections: strain gauge 1 is at the middle of the deck, strain gauge 17 is at the end of the deck and strain gauge 34 is at the beginning of the deck.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1475921712449507">Figure 15(b)</xref> shows two strain signals, triggered by strain gauge 1, when the calibrated truck crossed the movable deck at two different positions. The position is based on the distance measured by the laser, and it is referred to the ‘<italic>x</italic>-axis’ shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921712449507">Figure 8</xref>. The reference of the wheel position is the same as for the static load tests, that is, the centre of the single tyre (front axle) and the centre of the outside/left double tyre (rear axles). From both signals shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1475921712449507">Figure 15(b)</xref>, one can easily identify each axle of the calibrated truck: one front axle and three rear axles from the main truck and three rear axles from the trailer.</p>
<p>From each truck passage, the maximum strain value recorded was used to determine the dynamic stress influence line of each strain gauge. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1475921712449507">Figure 15(a)</xref> for strain gauges 1, 17 and 34. The points on the graph represent the maximum strain absolute values registered at the strain gauges during one dynamic test at the ‘<italic>x</italic>-axis’ calibrated truck position. The mean dynamic stress influence line was determined for each strain gauge (referred to as ‘<italic>m</italic>’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1475921712449507">Figure 15(a)</xref>) using all the results from 1 year.</p>
<p>Looking at the three dynamic influence lines, one can recognize a similar pattern: first peak at approximately <italic>x</italic> ≈ 150 mm and the second peak at approximately <italic>x</italic> ≈ 300 mm. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1475921712449507">Figure 15(a)</xref>, these peaks are identified for strain gauge 1 (SG 1) as ‘x’ and ‘*’, respectively. In order to better understand these maximum values, we need to look at the triggered strains recorded for each truck position in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1475921712449507">Figure 15(b)</xref>. The triggered strains are plotted for the two peak truck positions of strain gauge 1 (highest values). At <italic>x</italic> ≈ 150 mm, the maximum value is caused by the heaviest rear axle, that is, by the double-tyre load case (see ‘x’ on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1475921712449507">Figure 15(b)</xref>). This maximum value occurs when the inside tyre of the truck is approximately aligned with the strain gauge. At <italic>x</italic> ≈ 300 mm, the maximum value is caused by the front axle, that is, by the single-tyre load case (see ‘*’ on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1475921712449507">Figure 15(b)</xref>). This maximum value occurs when the single tyre is aligned with the strain gauge. The single-tyre load case causes higher stresses than the double tyre because the individual tyre load is higher on the single tyre (approximately 38 kN) than on each of the two double tyres (approximately 29 kN = 58/2 kN). These results are in accordance with the static influence lines determined for the same group of strain gauges (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1475921712449507">Figure 11(a)</xref>).</p>
<p>Taking into account the dynamic stress peak of strain gauge 1 caused by single tyre (approximately 38 kN, <italic>x</italic> ≈ 300 mm) and comparing it with the static stress peak caused also by the single tyre at the same strain gauge (38.5 kN, <italic>x</italic> ≈ 300 mm, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1475921712449507">Figure 12(a)</xref>, series ‘SG 1 after renovation’), we can observe that there is no significant difference between static and dynamic stresses (approximately 35–40 MPa). Therefore, we can conclude that the dynamic factors are low at the middle of the deck.</p>
<p>Although one can identify a similar pattern between the three dynamic influence lines, there is a significant difference in the absolute values of the three strain gauges. The strain values of strain gauge 1 are significantly higher than those of strain gauges 17 and 34. The transverse stresses between the stiffener webs are higher at the middle span between cross-beams (strain gauge 1) than close to the cross-beams (strain gauges 17 and 34).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1475921712449507">Figure 16</xref> shows the same type of results for group II, which is represented by strain gauges 2, 18 and 32. These strain gauges measured transverse strains close to the welds in the deck plate side. The three strain gauges are exactly at the same transverse position of the deck but at different cross sections: strain gauge 2 is at the middle of the deck, strain gauge 18 is at the end of the deck and strain gauge 32 is at the beginning of the deck.</p>

Also, in this group, there is a similar pattern between the three dynamic influence lines: first minimum peak between <italic>x</italic> ≈ 350 mm and <italic>x</italic> ≈ 400 mm and second minimum peak at approximately <italic>x</italic> ≈ 600 mm. These peaks are identified for strain gauge 18 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1475921712449507">Figure 16(a)</xref> as ‘x’ and ‘*’, respectively. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1475921712449507">Figure 16(b)</xref>, the triggered strains are plotted for the two peak truck positions, <italic>x</italic> ≈ 360 mm and <italic>x</italic> ≈ 600 mm. At <italic>x</italic> ≈ 360 mm, the minimum value is caused by the rear axles of the trailer, that is, by a double-tyre load case (see ‘x’ on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1475921712449507">Figure 16(b)</xref>). This minimum value occurs when the strain gauge is just in between the two double tyres. At <italic>x</italic> ≈ 600 mm, the minimum value is caused by the front axle, that is, by the single-tyre load case (see ‘*’ on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1475921712449507">Figure 16(b)</xref>). This minimum value occurs when the single tyre is aligned with the stiffener. The double-tyre load case causes higher stress than the single-tyre load case, with approximately 50- and 38-kN loads, respectively. This is in accordance with the static influence lines of the same group of strain gauges (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1475921712449507">Figure 11(b)</xref>).</p>
<p>Taking into account the dynamic stress peak of strain gauge 2 caused by single tyre (approximately 38 kN, <italic>x</italic> ≈ 600 mm) and comparing it with the static stress peak caused also by single tyre (38.5 kN, <italic>x</italic> ≈ 600 mm; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1475921712449507">Figure 12(c)</xref>, series ‘SG 2 after renovation’), we can observe that there is no significant difference between static and dynamic stresses (approximately 10–15 MPa). Therefore, we can conclude once more that at the middle of the deck, the dynamic factors are low.</p>
<p>The difference between the stresses at the three longitudinal sections Joure, Lemmer and middle span is less significant for group II than for group I. However, strain gauges 18 and 32, which are close to cross-beams (Lemmer and Joure), have higher stress values than strain gauge 2, which is at middle span between cross-beams.</p>
<p>Concerning the strengthening performance during the year of monitoring, the results show that there is no significant scatter between all the points of each strain gauge collected over the year of monitoring. This indicates that the stresses at the deck plate remain approximately the same during the monitoring period. This was observed also for the rest of the strain gauges still functioning during the entire monitoring period.</p>

<title>Strain history measurements</title>
<p>The strain history was continuously recorded during the year after the renovation. The aim is to evaluate the performance of the strengthening system during a certain period of time. The measurements started in April 2009 and ended in April 2010. There was an interruption in the recording during the entire month of July 2009 due to power failure of the measuring equipment.</p>
<p>The strain history measurements were used to determine the week stress spectrum of each strain gauge. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1475921712449507">Figures 17</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1475921712449507">18</xref> show typical results of strain gauges from groups I and II, respectively.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1475921712449507">Figure 17(a)</xref> shows 1-week stress spectra of strain gauges 1, 17 and 34 (group I). The results are from the third week of September 2009 because it is the one with the highest stresses observed for these strain gauges during monitoring. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1475921712449507">Figure 17(b)</xref> shows the evolution of the stress range at 100 cycles from April 2009 to April 2010, for the same strain gauges. No significant changes can be observed on the 100 cycles stress range and corresponding stress spectra.</p>
<p>As observed for the dynamic load tests, there is a significant difference between longitudinal sections. The transverse stresses between stiffener webs (group I) are higher at middle span between cross-beams (SG 1) than close to the cross-beams (SG 12 and 34). However, the maximum strains measured during normal traffic are considerably higher than those measured during the controlled dynamic load tests. The maximum dynamic stresses induced by the calibrated truck correspond approximately to the stress ranges at 1000 cycles per week. The maximum stress ranges registered during normal traffic are 1.6, 1.9 and 2.6 times higher than the maximum stresses measured during the dynamic tests, for strain gauges 1, 17 and 34, respectively.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1475921712449507">Figure 18(a)</xref> shows 1-week stress spectra of strain gauges 2, 18 and 32 (group II).

As for group I, no significant changes can be observed on the stress range and corresponding stress spectra.</p>
<p>Comparing the stress ranges of the three strain gauges, the highest was measured by strain gauge 18. This is in accordance with what was observed in the dynamic influence lines, although strain gauge 2 has closer values to strain gauge 18 than those measured from the dynamic tests (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1475921712449507">Figure 16(a)</xref>), and it has higher values than strain gauge 32. This is contrary to what was expected for this detail, which measures transverse stress at the deck plate close to the weld and, therefore, stresses are expected to be higher next to the cross-beams than at middle span between cross-beams.</p>
<p>As for group I, the maximum strains measured for strain gauges 2, 18 and 32 during normal traffic are considerably higher than those measured during the controlled dynamic load tests. The minimum stresses induced by the calibrated truck correspond approximately with the stress ranges at 1000 cycles per week. The maximum stress ranges registered during normal traffic are 2.3, 1.4 and 1.3 times higher than the minimum stresses measured during the dynamic tests, for strain gauges 2, 18 and 32, respectively.</p>
<p>Overall, there are no considerable changes on the stress field of the deck plate during the year of monitoring. This indicates that the strengthening performance did not change during this period.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The orthotropic deck of the movable bridge Scharsterrijn was strengthened by bonding a second steel plate of 6 mm thickness to the existing 12 mm deck. The results presented in this article are part of the short-term and long-term monitoring plan carried out before and after the renovation.</p>
<p>The transverse strains at the deck plate are mainly caused by local loads, such as wheel loads. Overall, the single-tyre load case is worse than the double-tyre load case for the deck plate details studied, except for the transverse strains at the deck plate close to the weld with the stiffener web. There is hardly any difference between comparable static and dynamic stresses at middle-span cross section of the orthotropic deck.</p>
<p>The maximum strains measured under normal traffic conditions are considerably higher than those measured during the controlled dynamic load tests. The calibrated truck used for these tests is lighter than the heaviest traffic crossing the bridge deck. The maximum stresses induced by the calibrated truck correspond approximately with the stress ranges of 1000 cycles per week. The short-term measurements reveal that after applying the reinforcement, the strains next to the weld between deck plate and stiffener web are reduced by about 55% at the deck plate and 35% at the stiffener web. Due to the reinforcement, the fatigue life of these welds is expected to increase 11 times at the deck plate side and 3.6 times at the stiffener side. The reinforcement is more efficient for fatigue cracks initiating at the deck plate than at the stiffener web. The strengthening performance is lower for details away from the deck plate and influenced by the global behaviour of the structure. Overall, the short-term structural behaviour was within the expected performance of the strengthening system.</p>
<p>The long-term measurements do not show significant changes in the stress level of the bridge deck during the monitoring period. This indicates that there was no degradation of the strengthening system during the year after the renovation. Based on this, the strengthening system has demonstrated good performance reliability to prolong the life span of movable orthotropic bridges and therefore can be considered satisfactory.</p>
