<abstract>
<p>In this article we address how relatives of people with frontal-variant frontotemporal dementia (fvFTD) experience the illness and how it impacts their lives. We interviewed 6 participants and carried out interpretative phenomenological analysis. We report on 11 themes that reflect distinctive challenges. Five themes relate to witnessing bizarre and strange changes: changed appetites and drives, loss of planning ability, loss of inhibition leading to social embarrassment, risky behavior, and communication problems. Four relate to managing these changes and two to the impact on the person and his or her relationships. Relatives must live with unusual changes in the person with fvFTD and the stigma this carries in social settings. They learn to act assertively for their relatives and put effort into promoting quality of life, using strategies adapted for fvFTD. Relatives grieve the loss of the person with fvFTD and their mutual relationship, but nonetheless find sources of solace and hope.</p>

<body>
<p>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the fourth most common type of dementia affecting older people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312466294">Sjögren &amp; Anderson, 2006</xref>) and the second most common among those under 65 years of age. Those with frontal-variant FTD (fvFTD) present with changes in personality and behavior; interpersonal difficulties characterized by a lack of empathy or concern for others; disinhibition or other socially inappropriate behaviors; a general lack of insight, and apathy. In addition, some researchers have reported aggressive, socially disruptive, and antisocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312466294">Miller, Darby, Benson, Cummings, &amp; Miller, 1997</xref>), and these behavioral problems have been labeled as sociopathic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312466294">Mendez, Chen, Shapira, &amp; Miller, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the profile of the illness, and judging from our own clinical experience, it seems highly likely that fvFTD poses particular challenges to family members. However, as far as we are aware, there are only two published qualitative studies of the impact of fvFTD on relatives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312466294">Kumamoto et al. (2004)</xref> described the problems of caregivers in two families and reported that the specific behavioral symptoms created major problems and a heavy burden. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312466294">Brenne and Skjerve (2003)</xref> presented a single case study illustrating the burden of caring for a family member with FTD, although this is not available in English. Our aim in this research was therefore to explore experiences of having a relative with fvFTD, with a view to improving awareness of the challenges for relatives and potentially enabling services to better meet the needs of these families.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of qualitative studies, a number of questionnaire-based studies have been published. In these, the type of FTD is not often distinguished, and therefore below we have referred to FTD rather than fvFTD. Findings include that caregivers of people with FTD were more burdened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312466294">de Vugt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312466294">Riedijk et al., 2006</xref>), had higher levels of depression and stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312466294">Mioshi, Bristow, Cook, &amp; Hodges, 2009</xref>), had lower levels of marital satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312466294">Ascher et al., 2010</xref>), and felt less competent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312466294">de Vugt et al., 2006</xref>) than caregivers of people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312466294">Nicolaou, Egan, Gasson, and Kane (2010)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312466294">Mourik et al. (2004)</xref> found the symptom profile to cause particular difficulties.</p>
<p>There are some indications that the relatively unknown nature of FTD and lack of dedicated services leads caregivers to express more dissatisfaction with information, counseling, and advice than AD caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312466294">Nicolaou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312466294">Rosnes, Haugen &amp; Engedal, 2008</xref>). In three studies, researchers found there were impacts on the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312466294">Ascher et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312466294">Riedijk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312466294">Riedijk et al., 2009</xref>). In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312466294">Riedijk et al. (2006)</xref> found that, over a 2-year period, the sense of sharing a viewpoint declined, coping deteriorated, and social support declined, although couples maintained closeness. Thus, overall, we can conclude from quantitative research that FTD has a greater impact on caregivers across a number of dimensions compared with the impact of AD, that families have higher levels of need, and find it hard to access appropriate services and support.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312466294">Nicolaou et al. (2010)</xref> noted that some of the difficulties faced by their FTD sample were because of their life stage. Given that most people with fvFTD present to services between the ages of 45 and 65 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312466294">Snowden, Neary, &amp; Mann, 2002</xref>), research findings on the impact of young-onset dementia (YOD) are of relevance. In a recent review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312466294">van Vliet, de Vugt, Bakker, Koopmans, and Verhey (2010)</xref> identified 15 quantitative and 2 qualitative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312466294">Harris &amp; Keady, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312466294">Keady &amp; Nolan, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312466294">Van Vliet et al. (2010)</xref> concluded that caregivers of those with YOD experienced high levels of stress, burden, and depression, as well as a range of psychosocial difficulties, with finances, employment, relationships, and obtaining a diagnosis for their relative linked, to some extent, to the stage in the life course of the person with FTD.</p>
<p>In contrast to the paucity of qualitative studies with relatives of those with fvFTD or YOD, in recent years there has been an increase in qualitative research with relatives of older people with AD, vascular, and mixed dementia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312466294">Vikstrom, Josephsson, Stigsdotter-Neely, and Nygard (2008)</xref> found that caregivers placed emphasis and effort on the management of day-to-day activity and engagement with their family member. Others found that relatives experienced grief (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312466294">Frank, 2008</xref>), communication difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312466294">Engel, 2007</xref>), and tension between caregiving and the personal intimate relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312466294">Askham, Briggs, Norman, &amp; Redfern, 2007</xref>). However, caregivers also reported gains from caregiving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312466294">Netto, Goh, &amp; Yap, 2009</xref>), used hope to enable coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312466294">Duggleby, Williams, Wright, &amp; Bollinger, 2009</xref>), and developed their own self-care by acknowledging their “self-care worthiness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312466294">Furlong &amp; Wuest, 2008</xref>). These themes from qualitative studies with relatives of people with AD and with mixed samples suggest areas that might be relevant in fvFTD.</p>
<p>A detailed description of the experience of relatives of those with fvFTD is not available. It is suggested that such a picture would be helpful in giving professionals a better understanding of the impact of fvFTD on relatives. Given that, at present, dementia services are largely designed to respond to those with AD, whose dementia typically starts with memory problems, illustrations of fvFTD might prove a catalyst to the development of appropriate services for this distinctive group. In this research, therefore, we aimed to take an in-depth look at the experiences of those with a family member with fvFTD to discover whether there were distinctive features and to explore the way the condition impacted their lives and relationship with the person with fvFTD.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312466294" sec-type="methods">
<title>Study Design and Methodology</title>
<p>We used interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) for this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312466294">Brocki &amp; Wearden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312466294">Smith, Flowers, &amp; Larkin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312466294">Smith, Jarman, &amp; Osborn, 1999</xref>), recording face-to-face interviews between the researcher (second author) and the participants, which we transcribed and analyzed. Underpinning IPA is the perspective that human beings experience the world by making sense of their subjective experiences. The approach is strongly idiographic, emphasizing the value of placing individuals’ experiences in their specific contexts to derive understanding and, in tune with this, small numbers of participants are considered appropriate. To compensate for the small numbers, samples are homogenous in relation to the key focus of the research, in this case the experience of having a relative with a particular, fairly rare form of dementia (fvFTD).</p>
<p>Transcripts were initially analyzed one by one, with themes being drawn out inductively. Aspects of experience and meaning that participants seemed to have in common then allowed the identification of master themes. The derivation of themes is inevitably an interpretive pursuit, and thus we took steps to check for credibility and plausibility (see section on analysis). In line with IPA, we did not aim for data saturation but aimed to provide an inductive yet plausibly interpreted account that would give fresh insights into a neglected aspect of experience.</p>
<sec id="section2-1049732312466294">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We recruited 6 first-degree relatives of those who had received a diagnosis of fvFTD according to the Lund-Manchester criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312466294">Lund and Manchester Groups, 1994</xref>). Participants needed to be involved in care decisions and able to communicate in English. Every participant was the family member who accompanied his or her relative to clinic appointments. All were heavily involved emotionally and in terms of decision making, and were able to give vivid first-hand accounts. They comprised three husbands, a wife, a daughter, and a brother. Five of the people with fvFTD were coresident with the participant and the sixth resided in a care home (the brother was the key relative in this last case, because the person with fvFTD was divorced and had elderly parents who were not in a position to care for him).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732312466294">
<title>Ethical Aspects</title>
<p>A health service ethical review committee gave approval for the study. We gained full written informed consent and participants were aware that quotations from their transcribed interviews, with their contributions anonymized as far as possible, would be disseminated in publications and presentations. We assured participants that the services their relative received would not be affected by their participation. The interviewer was a trainee clinical psychologist who had experience of therapeutic interactions, and he brought this to bear on the research interviews, dealing sensitively with any anxiety or distress, offering to pause or stop the interviews if required, and giving information on local voluntary services, such as carers’ groups, to all who took part.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732312466294">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>We recruited participants through clinical staff at two specialist, working-age-dementia services. These were the only United Kingdom National Health Services for YOD in a wide geographical area, and offered specialist assessment, intervention, and support for people with dementia and their families in cases of onset under age 65. Clinicians in the services (e.g., third author) had expressed an interest in fostering this study because they were keen to know more about the experiences of families of those with fvFTD. Professionals in the services raised the idea of taking part with their clients’ family members, approaching all who met the inclusion criteria until 6 had been recruited. Those who expressed interest were given introductory information. After a minimum of 24 hours, we contacted them by telephone to answer questions, gain consent, and arrange to carry out the interview.</p>
<p>We then met each participant to conduct an in-depth, semistructured interview. One participant chose to have the person diagnosed with fvFTD present. We interviewed all participants in their own home except one, who chose to be interviewed at the care facility in which his relative was resident. We obtained consent and brief demographic data and then addressed how the relative noticed things were amiss; the process of seeking help and obtaining a diagnosis; current living arrangements and day-to-day life; and the effects or consequences of the illness for the person being interviewed, the person with fvFTD, and their mutual relationship. Questions were generally open; for example, “Can you tell me about [the person with fvFTD] and your life now?” “What sorts of things have changed in your relationship and what has remained the same?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732312466294">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The analysis moved from descriptive to interpretative. First, we met to discuss excerpts of the transcripts in depth and detail, allowing us to gain familiarity with attending to the meanings in the script and coding of material. We then read and reread the transcripts and independently recorded initial descriptive observations. We discussed these to debate differences in emphasis and gain a shared understanding. Then we moved into a more interpretative process, identifying and labeling themes for each transcript, turning regularly to the accounts to check that themes were rooted in the data. We conducted this process partly independently and partly jointly through discussion. At the final stage we looked across the themes for the individuals and produced a set of master themes. These were shared with staff who worked with people with FTD and with a mixed audience including relatives of people with fvFTD, to check for plausibility.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312466294">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>We derived 11 salient themes and clustered these into three groups: five concerned reports of the changes in behavior and habits witnessed in the people with fvFTD; four described the ways in which the participants managed these changes, and two were concerned with the impact on the participants’ relationships and lives.</p>
<sec id="section7-1049732312466294">
<title>Themes Related to Witnessing Bizarre and Strange Changes</title>
<p>The five themes in this cluster focus on changes in appetites and drives, lack of forward planning, social embarrassment through disinhibited behavior, risky behavior caused by lack of judgment of danger, and changes in communication.</p>
<sec id="section8-1049732312466294">
<title>Changes in appetites and drives</title>
<p>Four participants described their respective relative seeming to have a compulsion to overeat or walk excessively. One participant, for example, described how an early sign of problems was that his relative suddenly wanted sweet foods: “All he wanted to be eating was Mars bars [candy] for breakfast; you know, chocolate or sweet things.” He “used to walk for miles and come back with big blisters on his feet, huge blisters.” He described how he would “search the cupboards” of his parents’ home looking for food, and would get into trouble in shops by picking up and eating food without paying for it. Another participant left sandwiches for his wife to have for lunch while he was out at work, but described how he would “usually ring up about ten o’clock and she’s ate them.” He also described his wife eating whole cakes if he left any in the house. Five of the participants gave accounts of their relatives’ loss of drive and motivation, with this sometimes leading to problems in personal hygiene. Two of the husbands described how their wives, who used to take pride in their appearance, now “let themselves go.” One commented, “Sometimes I can smell her body odor. It’s that strong, you know. I say, ‘You’ll have to have another shower,’ . . . and she’ll say, ‘There’s nothing wrong with me.’”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732312466294">
<title>Lack of forward planning</title>
<p>All participants described how loss of the ability to plan and keep track of complex tasks caused awkward situations. Four of the people with fvFTD had gotten into increasing difficulties in their work and had to leave. One participant described how her husband had declining ability to plan and follow through on his work. This led to court cases when he was sued for failing to complete jobs properly, to threats, and on one occasion, almost to a fight:
<disp-quote>
<p>This guy come over with a gang of his mates, wanted to punch my husband’s lights out [knock him out]! Apparently it was a job that he’d done and he should have gone back to repair something, and I kept reminding him.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Aside from work situations, the lack of forward planning landed the participants’ relatives in other difficulties. Two filled their cars at gas stations without any means of payment, and had to phone home to ask to be helped out—one repeatedly and in the middle of the night. Neither was able to explain why they had gone ahead to fill the car without having money to pay. Another could no longer plan how to cook:
<disp-quote>
<p>She put the potatoes on the plate, and the veg [vegetables] and everything was as hard as that table. It wasn’t cooked. . . . She said, “Well, they boiled,” and because they boiled well, that was it, you know, she decided to turn them out.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732312466294">
<title>Loss of inhibition leading to socially embarrassing behaviors</title>
<p>Every participant gave accounts of how his or her relative had abandoned the usual social conventions, voicing thoughts that would usually be kept to oneself, invading personal space, or following urges that would normally be suppressed. These behaviors often led to social embarrassment. Two participants described how their relative with fvFTD spoke openly of “hating” certain acquaintances—sentiments they would not have expressed in an unguarded way previously. Two had shoplifted. One participant described his wife being held by security guards:
<disp-quote>
<p>She’d just pick them up because she just couldn’t see any reason why, you know, if something was there to have. I mean, it wasn’t stealing to her, but it is to everyone else. . . . So that became a big problem, yeah. She did get caught in the one store . . . as I’ve walked into the supermarket . . . I saw the wife sitting inside that office. . . . So of course I’ve gone over and he says, “Well, we’ve just caught her stealing.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant described how his wife would invade the personal space of friends and acquaintances, causing some consternation:
<disp-quote>
<p>All of a sudden she grabs hold of them, you know, by the shoulders, in a friendly sort of way, but they’re a bit sort of, “Well, what’s happening here?” sort of thing! . . . She would never do this before you know, but now it could be a complete stranger.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet another spoke of his worry that his brother’s interest in children might be misconstrued: “But he wants to like, tap them on the head or stroke them or whatever, which we’ve got to be very careful of that.” On a lighter note, one spoke of the way his wife followed her inclinations with regard to food, eating a segment of raw lemon; taking a fried egg off the plate, washing it under cold water, putting it back on the plate and eating it; and on another occasion, “She poured the liquid contents out of the beetroot jar all over the eggs and the bacon, and sat there and eaten it as though it was a normal thing to do.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732312466294">
<title>Risky behavior because of a lack of common sense and judgment</title>
<p>In addition to loss of the ability to plan ahead, 5 participants described in-the-moment loss of judgment by their relatives that led to risks of injury. One person put her hand over the spout of the kettle to see if it was boiling, and another burned her hands by taking a dish out of the oven without using an oven glove. In other cases relatives with fvFTD had a lack of road sense. In the early days, one woman told her husband she had raced and overtaken a fire engine, waving to the firemen as she passed. Another had a number of scrapes in his car, knocked and dented his caravan, and later bought a bicycle and was seen by an acquaintance riding dangerously down the middle of a road in traffic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732312466294">
<title>Communication problems</title>
<p>Four participants spoke about their relatives’ declining ability to communicate, through poverty of speech or because of loss of ability to find words and the development of nonsense speech. One described her husband struggling to find the word for deodorant and the tactics she used to work out what he was trying to say:
<disp-quote>
<p>We were going into a supermarket shopping the other week, and just as we were going into the door he’ll think of something, erm, and he’ll say, “Underspray!” Right. “I need underspray.” And then because, well, it’s hurting in here, but we joke. I’ve learned to get a sense of humor which I never had before, and I say, “What [are] you on about, you daft sod [silly person]? Underspray? Is it underspray for the car? Is it underspray for the bed?” Well, you know I was being barmy [silly], you know, and he got it then, you know: under-arm spray.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant described the attention his wife drew to them when out shopping, by her loud and odd chanting:
<disp-quote>
<p>She chants a lot now, she shouts. . . . Funny rhyming chants, you know, but everybody looks at her now, ’cause I guess people recognize her now, you know, and perhaps think, “Oh, she’s here again, this mad woman.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall, from the examples above it can be seen that all participants told stories in which they emphasized that behavior was out of character, provoked strong reactions from others, or was simply hard to understand.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732312466294">
<title>Themes Related to Managing the Behaviors</title>
<p>We grouped four themes into this cluster: taking on tasks and roles; defending, asserting, and explaining; promoting quality of life; and working around lack of awareness.</p>
<sec id="section14-1049732312466294">
<title>Taking on tasks and roles</title>
<p>All participants described taking on additional roles and responsibilities. The brother, for example, was the only family member in a position to help his relative find a place to live after his wife threw him out of their house. He remained the main point of contact for discussions of his brother’s care and filtered this through to his parents: “I come down and have meetings with the staff and I convey the facts that I get, in a watered down form, to my mum and dad. I try to protect them really as much as I can.” However, it was the coresident spouses who took on most, including a wide range of household responsibilities, finances, driving, and domestic tasks. One husband, who could not afford to retire, explained: “I think I’m a dab hand [skilled operator] now. I cook everything, and weekends I try to do as much housework as possible, but it is difficult.” Another spoke about how he showered his wife, dealt with incontinence, prompted her with all her self-care, and then, when asked if he had to do a lot for her, he said, “Well everything, everything. Well, I mean I don’t have to carry her, which is a big asset, isn’t it?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049732312466294">
<title>Defending, asserting, and explaining</title>
<p>All of the participants found that they needed to be assertive to gain access to appropriate services. Their relatives were often offered care in old-age dementia facilities and, without exception, the participants expressed the view that these were not appropriate. One said, “You can’t stick a forty-year-old in a room full of people like that, through no fault of their own, dementia patients, but for a forty-year-old to live in an eighty-year-old’s care home!” Some found being assertive about care needs easier than others. One wife described her struggle: “I should be more forceful. I’ve spoken up once, now they’re still not coming forward. I should keep pestering, you know, but . . . well, that’s not really me.” Later, she described how she did eventually ask for help from social services, and she said, “I thought at least I’ve spoken up now and . . . that took a lot of guts [courage] for me to do that.”</p>
<p>Participants also described how they stepped in to explain their relatives’ socially embarrassing behavior. The participant whose wife was accused of shoplifting, for example, went on to say, “And then I’ve explained to the manager her problem, and he just sort of said, ‘Yeah, okay,’ and he let us go.” One husband described how his wife’s “very loud laughter” used to attract attention in shops, to the point that
<disp-quote>
<p>[w]e used to be followed round by the security guard. I’m sure he used to think, “We’ve got a couple of nutters [mad people] there.” Like, you know, it was the way she used to behave. Until one day I got chatting to the security guard and I explained she has a form of dementia, a rare form of dementia. And I says, “This is not how she used to be, you know.” And now he just comes up to her and just says hello to her, like.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although verbal explanations were often sufficient, in two cases physical defense was necessary. In the case of the builder who was threatened for not having completed a job, his wife had to step physically between the two men: “And I was pulling him off, pulling B off because B wanted to bash him one [hit him]!”</p>

<title>Promoting quality of life</title>
<p>Five of the participants spoke of the efforts they made to keep their relative’s life stimulating and fulfilling. Three tried to provide cognitive stimulation, one being the daughter, who said, “My dad will still ask her opinion and, ‘What do you fancy for dinner today?’ . . . So at least if you still do that, then she’s still trying to think, isn’t she?” Three capitalized on their relatives’ passion for walking by including this in the daily routine. One described it as something enjoyable for his wife that was less risky than being in the shops, and a way of keeping her fit:
<disp-quote>
<p>I take her walks every day . . . two or three miles. . . . So yeah, that’s important, just to keep a little bit fit. And she enjoys that, to be honest, she does enjoy that. Six months ago she would’ve probably been asking me to take her to town, but you can’t. It’s really a waste of time, because she never used to shop. I just thought she wanted me to take her to the shops so she could just steal.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Havens of peace, away from the possibilities of social embarrassment and conflict, seemed particularly important and were mentioned by 4 participants. The brother described the nursing home he had found for his brother as a “place of safety,” away from the possibility of his disinhibited behavior being misconstrued. The husband, who was still at work, encouraged a longstanding friend to visit, providing nonjudgmental acceptance and relaxation for his wife. In the other two cases the havens were literally that, being a boat and a caravan away from the city. One saw their caravan as providing a place where her husband could relax away from the anxieties and risks of interacting with others, and where he would not get into trouble through impulsive behavior:
<disp-quote>
<p>Thank God we’ve got a caravan now. . . . He loves the fishing and the water and peace, you see. . . . But there’s two months of the year where they have to close the site, and then we’re here at the weekends and he’s up and down at the windows. He can’t relax, ’cause we had the shop window put in [broken] about twelve months ago. It was youths, and he ran down to chase them. . . . So it is much better, as I say, when we go and stay in the caravan.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section17-1049732312466294">
<title>Working around a lack of awareness</title>
<p>All participants spoke of the ways they had found to deal with strange behaviors and manage risk despite their relatives’ lack of awareness. They described realizing that rational argument did not have any impact. One participant spoke about how he tried to reason with his brother over his compulsive eating: “‘Why do you need to eat?’ ‘Well, I don’t.’ ‘So why are you eating?’ ‘I don’t know.’ . . . And you couldn’t break that cycle no matter what was explained to him.” In light of this, participants had to find other ways of living with the bizarre behaviors, either coming to accept them (2 participants), using white lies to head them off (3 participants), or defusing muddled behaviors with humor (3 participants). A husband described learning to accept the strange behavior of his formerly appearance-conscious wife:
<disp-quote>
<p>She’ll put two night dresses on to go to bed, and a works overall from when she used to go to work, but you don’t make a big thing out of these issues, you know. I do tell her, but I don’t sort of argue about it; there’s not much point. I’ve learned to sort of cope with these things. Well, she says, “Well, it won’t hurt—it’s up to me what I wear.” So I say, “Okay, fine. If that’s what you want to go to bed in, that’s fine.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant gave an example of white lies, in relation to her fears of her husband taking risks on a new bicycle, which he did not have the judgment to ride: “I can always find ways of wheedling round him [persuading him], you know: ‘Don’t go out on it. You know it’s raining,’ or, ‘John’s gonna pick you up,’ or, ‘Your son’s gonna pick you up.’” The same person spoke of how she had developed a sense of humor to cope, finding that this defused tension and renewed a sense of togetherness with her husband:
<disp-quote>
<p>I can never belittle him and put him down, and I can’t keep telling him, “No, you’ve done that wrong. No, don’t do that.” So somehow or another out the blue it come: that if he was doing something that was wrong or whatever, I would turn it round as a laughing joke, and then we’d both end up laughing about it! And I don’t know how I started doing it or what gave me the insight to be able do it, but that way works best for both of us.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We interpret this cluster of themes as showing how the participants found ways of containing or managing strange behaviors. The examples illustrate how participants adapted life around the symptoms and hazards of fvFTD, simultaneously ensuring safety and tackling ignorance while also promoting well-being.</p>

<title>Themes Related to Impact on the Relationship and the Person With fvFTD</title>
<p>All participants spoke of their sense that the person with fvFTD was no longer the same person, and that they no longer had the relationship they had once had. This was linked to expressions of sorrow and grief by 5 of the participants, as well as fear of what the future might hold. The sixth participant expressed frustration rather than grief. Despite feeling these difficult emotions, all also had resources or strategies they used to keep going and comfort themselves.</p>
<sec id="section19-1049732312466294">
<title>Loss of the person and relationship, and heartbreak</title>
<p>All participants gave strikingly similar descriptions of feeling that their relative was no longer the same person. They were present in body, but their human qualities were no longer the same, and this simultaneously affected the relationship. One participant described a sense of emptiness in his wife: “[She is] nothing like the person I married. . . . She is different, and that’s what hurts, really. I mean, you know, it’s the same person, but all the qualities I saw in her have gone now.” For another, his wife’s apparent loss of affection was intimately connected with his sense of loss of relationship:
<disp-quote>
<p>We was always a very close couple but now we’re like two strangers. . . . She doesn’t have any sort of, how can I put it, affection, anymore. . . . We’ve been married forty-two years now, and we always used to sit there holding hands after forty-two years of marriage, you know. She don’t even do that no more. There’s always that gap between you. You get into bed and there’s a big gap between us, and if you try and get any closer to her then she moves away, you know. It’s very, very strange; there’s no affection no more.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The impact of changes on the sexual relationship were mentioned more openly by another participant:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve got to keep, well, going through the act of making love once a week for him, because I know it will upset him if we hit that on the head [give it up] completely . . . but I can’t wait for it to be over as quickly as possible, because I get no enjoyment out of it at all. And also I’m a carer, a mother, a nurse. I’m treating him like a child three quarters of the time, and then I’ve got to reverse my roles to be wife again, and a lover, and one thing and another.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These descriptions convey hurt and heartache, which was often very strongly expressed, as by one husband who talked about how “not only has this illness destroyed her life, it’s also destroyed mine.” Five of the participants spoke of their sense of a bleak future, and one expressed this very eloquently:
<disp-quote>
<p>There isn’t a future. Definitely isn’t a future. I’ll be completely lost when he’s completely gaga [out of touch with reality] and I can’t look after him anymore. . . . I can’t see life without him, so I can’t see a future. . . . We always used to plan, you know, together, silly little things like buying a touring caravan . . . and I’ve gone on with his bubble and his dream for him, and for something for us to look forward to, but just lately the realism is sinking in.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1049732312466294">
<title>Sources of support, solace, and hope</title>
<p>Despite the sense of loss and anticipatory grief, all participants also mentioned sources of strength. These were disparate and included both external and internal resources. Valued external supports included professionals or services (5 participants), hope from participating in drugs trials (4 participants), and support from family (3 participants) or friends (2 participants). The internal means of managing included keeping up hobbies or interests (2 participants), dwelling in the moment rather than looking forward or backward (2 participants), and adopting a deliberate strategy to blame the illness rather than their relative (2 participants): “You get to the stage where you start thinking that I hate her now, but then stop and think, well, it’s not her I hate, it’s the illness.”</p>
<p>Two participants also took strength from a sense of self-belief: “I’m surprised that I’m not having a breakdown every day. I must be a hell of a lot stronger than I think I am.” However, the most common internal strategy for feeling better was downward comparison, used by 4 participants as a way of reminding themselves that matters could be worse. One encountered a family that had a hereditary component to the fvFTD, and felt fortunate not to have this: “So straight away I mean, my situation is nothing compared to hers.” Another said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m lucky because there are people with partners with the illness far more advanced than what hers is. Who knows, I might have that to come yet, you know, so I suppose in some respects I’m still fortunate. I’m fortunate I’ve still got her, you know.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article we have explored experiences of having a relative with fvFTD, with the aim of discovering whether this particular form of dementia impacts relatives in a distinctive way. In relating our findings to those of others, we draw on the wider body of caregiver research. In our study, although we did not focus on caregiving in particular, all of the participants were first-degree relatives who were providing elements of both practical and emotional care; all but one were coresident, and all but one were primary decision makers. Thus, the study sample overlaps in most respects with conventional caregiver samples.</p>
<p>Perhaps this, in itself, connects with recent critiques of the term <italic>caregiver</italic> voiced by caregivers themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312466294">O’Connor, 2007</xref>) and researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312466294">Molyneaux, Butchard, Simpson, &amp; Murray, 2010</xref>). An increasing number of researchers have recently focused on relationship-centered care (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312466294">Hellstrom, Nolan, &amp; Lundh, 2007</xref>), and perhaps this reflects an acknowledgement of the influence of the context beyond instrumental caregiving which influences care activity and well-being of both parties. We derived 11 main themes from the data, which we clustered into three groups. All contain examples that are distinctly related to the particular diagnosis, but also overlap with themes found in AD and other caregiver research. We review these similarities and differences below, and make links with processes and models suggested by dementia researchers.</p>
<p>The first group of themes, around the bizarre and strange changes that relatives witnessed, was dominated by descriptions of disinhibition and impulsivity, which led to risky situations and caused social embarrassment. It is surprising to find that so few qualitative studies with AD caregivers have been focused explicitly on the nature of AD behaviors, possibly because it is widely accepted that these are primarily related to memory loss and its consequent impact on functioning. Rather, many researchers of AD have focused on how caregivers adjust to their situations, leaving the nature of the challenges as implicit (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312466294">Duggleby et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312466294">Vikstrom et al., 2008</xref>). The changes prominent in the accounts of the participants in our study seem to differ from the descriptions that figure most strongly in accounts from caregivers of those with early AD, vascular, or mixed dementia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312466294">Donaldson, Tarrier, and Burns (1998)</xref>, for example, found that AD caregivers reported repetitive questioning, nighttime waking, and risk as a result of forgetfulness as being most stressful. In the article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312466294">Quinn, Clare, Pearce, and van Dijkhuizen (2008)</xref>, the caregivers reportedly seemed to be most troubled by memory problems; lack of motivation—which they perceived as laziness; and the inability to perform household tasks.</p>
<p>The participants in our study vividly described the ways in which the socially embarrassing and disinhibited behaviors displayed by their relatives provoked strong reactions in others, including shock, anger, withdrawal from contact, and possible labeling of the behavior as madness. This illustrates, in connection with fvFTD, the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects of lay stigma that have been described in relation to AD by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312466294">Werner, Goldstein, and Buchbinder (2010)</xref>. We also saw in the accounts evidence of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312466294">Werner et al. (2010)</xref> called “structural stigma” reflected in professionals’ lack of knowledge about the condition, as evidenced, for example, by suggestions of inappropriate places of care. Given the prominence of disinhibition in fvFTD, it might be that stigma is a strong feature, particularly given the lack of widespread knowledge about this type of dementia.</p>
<p>In the second group of themes, we moved on to describe the way participants spoke of managing the behaviors. This also demonstrated a number of distinctive features, but there was greater overlap with research findings about other dementias. The roles and responsibilities participants had taken on are similar to those necessary when supporting a relative with another type of dementia with regard to the need for supervision, prompting, and decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312466294">Askham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312466294">Pinquart &amp; Sorensen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312466294">Quinn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312466294">Vikstrom et al., 2008</xref>). As in care for people with AD, there was some indication that the 4 coresident spouses in our study had stepped in to provide more of the direct care, whereas the daughter and brother were more involved in care decisions and negotiations.</p>
<p>The apparent lack of insight of those with fvFTD meant that participants had to find roundabout ways of reducing risk because reasoning was not possible. Although this might be necessary in advanced AD, it is unusual early on, at which stage people with AD are usually capable of benefiting from interventions that require a degree of reflection and awareness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312466294">Ciprani, Bianchetti, &amp; Trabucchi, 2006</xref>). To manage the lack of awareness, the participants spoke of learning to accept their relative’s limitations and strange behaviors, demonstrating a process of coming to terms and then “seeing possibilities,” as outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312466294">Duggleby et al. (2010)</xref> in their article on hope in caregivers of people with AD.</p>
<p>Among the strategies used by the participants in our study, humor seemed prominent. This was recently noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312466294">Opitz (2010)</xref>, who found that humor was used by daughters of those with AD to relieve stress and promote positive interaction, in much the same way as the participants in our study. It seems to be a particularly apt strategy with people with fvFTD. We found it defused the embarrassment of mistakes, and perhaps because of the disinhibition of those with fvFTD, it allowed them to join in this release of tension also, providing a rare bonding experience for the dyads. Participants’ efforts to provide stimulation and activity for their relatives have also been noted in AD studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312466294">Vikstrom et al., 2008</xref>), but the accounts here differ, in that the activities were built around the characteristics of fvFTD; for example, building on people’s wishes to keep walking, or finding havens in which the person with fvFTD could relax or be active without the risk of disinhibition causing problems.</p>
<p>The participants in our study spoke of developing assertiveness to stand up for their relatives and explain their behavior, both with services and in public situations. Essentially, the participants were stepping in to deal with stigmatous responses by physically intervening and explaining, using the knowledge and understanding they had gained. Through this process of protecting the dignity, safety, and feelings of their relative while also responding to the unacceptable feelings and behaviors of others, the participants demonstrated their care about, as well as their care for their relative, and upheld their pride in being a loving family member. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312466294">Mac Rae (1998)</xref> described this process as “emotion work,” a process we return to below.</p>
<p>The third set of themes concerned the impact of fvFTD on the participants and their relationship with their respective relative. The sense of losing the person was very powerful in the participants’ accounts, and seemed to have started in the early days of the dementia; for example, when the person was still driving or working, and strange incidents occurred. Loss of person and relationship (dis)continuity have figured strongly in recent writings about those with dementia. Most notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312466294">Hellstrom et al. (2007)</xref> summarized research on marital relationships in dementia and reported on a longitudinal qualitative study, proposing that early in dementia the caregiver attempts to maintain a “nurturative relational context.” Hellstrom et al. described couples going through a journey that moves from the caregiver seeking to sustain couplehood, to maintaining involvement, before finally moving on.</p>
<p>It seems as if this process might be underpinned by the need to regulate emotions provoked by witnessing the changes in one’s relative. The gradual distancing described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312466294">Hellstrom et al. (2007)</xref> seems to parallel the process of detachment described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312466294">Mac Rae (1998)</xref> as a possible consequence of the emotion work of caregiving. In our study, the participants seemed to use their knowledge to enable forbearance and tolerance, and generate empathy with the seemingly odd, irrational behaviors of their relatives; so even though a sense of relationship discontinuity seemed to occur early, the knowledge about fvFTD that was gained and applied in a person-centered fashion enabled the sustenance of a supportive relational context. Thus, relatives fulfilled the “feeling rules” required to avoid the shame or guilt that would have been associated with letting their relative down (Mac Rae).</p>
<p>The felt loss of the person and the relationship were sources of considerable sorrow, and grief was evident in the accounts. This has recently been a focus of studies on people with both AD and vascular dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312466294">Frank, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312466294">Noyes et al. (2010)</xref> proposed a grief/stress model of dementia caregiving, which seems to be eminently illustrated in our sample of participants caring for people with fvFTD. The bleak experiences of some of the participants resonate with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312466294">Duggleby et al.’s (2009)</xref> descriptions of “fading hope” in caregivers of those with AD. This implies that interventions that address ambiguous and anticipatory loss could be usefully combined with those that address stress and burden in this population.</p>
<p>To some extent our findings share common ground with YOD samples, as reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312466294">van Vliet et al. (2010)</xref> and reflected in the two qualitative studies of this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312466294">Harris &amp; Keady, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312466294">Keady &amp; Nolan, 1997</xref>). In particular, employment and relationship difficulties appear to be common to both. Social disinhibition, planning difficulties, changes in appetites and drives and their consequences are, however, more particular to fvFTD. Outcomes of the quantitative research on FTD reviewed in the introduction included that caregivers of people with FTD seem to carry a heavier burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312466294">de Vugt el al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312466294">Riedijk et al., 2006</xref>), with greater consequences in terms of mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312466294">Mioshi et al., 2009</xref>) and marital dissatisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312466294">Ascher et al., 2010</xref>) than caregivers of those with AD, with the nature of the symptoms contributing to this picture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312466294">Nicolaou et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The participants’ accounts filled out the nature of this burden and demonstrated the ways that the symptom profile poses particular challenges. However, the participants also highlighted the efforts they made to retain a nurturing relational context and the personal growth that occurred in response to these challenges. There are some indications from previous FTD studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312466294">Nicolaou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312466294">Rosnes et al., 2008</xref>) and YOD studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312466294">Harris &amp; Keady, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312466294">Keady &amp; Nolan, 1997</xref>) that their relatively unknown nature can lead caregivers to experience dissatisfaction with services to a greater degree than late-onset AD caregivers. The participants also voiced experience of structural stigma, highlighting the need to improve dementia care services to provide support for relatives of fvFTD patients.</p>
<p>This study has a number of limitations. In line with IPA, we interviewed only 6 participants. Although this allows for a nuanced account, it severely restricts the ability to generalize from the results. We hope, however, that the results will alert others working with people with fvFTD to some of the issues that are likely to arise for family members. The sample was sourced by clinicians who might have been overprotective of clients in crisis, possibly leading to a biased sample. We also had a mixed sample, including 4 spouses, 1 daughter, and 1 brother, although all were emotionally and practically involved with their respective relative with fvFTD. This makes it difficult to draw out conclusions about gender or relational influences, although there were some hints that there might be particular issues for spouses. These would be worthy of further exploration in a sample of spouses only. In addition, IPA lends itself to detailed description rather than theory building. In future, more extensive research, perhaps using theoretical sampling, could perhaps make a stronger theoretical contribution.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in this article we have demonstrated the nature of behaviors arising from fvFTD that posed challenges to relatives. Disinhibition caused a sense of loss of the person, and of grief, and the resulting embarrassment carried stigma in social settings and on the structural level. The changes resulting from fvFTD appeared to place heavy demands for emotion work on the participants. However, they used the knowledge of fvFTD they had gained to cope with the behaviors, including through acceptance, humor, and the creation of safe havens. They also learned to combat stigma by becoming assertive and standing up for the needs of their relatives. Our hope is that the material presented will be used to better tailor information for families in which a member has fvFTD, thus combating ignorance, as well as to promote interventions that address grief and enable hope to be sustained.</p>
