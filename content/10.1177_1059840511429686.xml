<p>School nurses play a key role in managing students with food allergies. It is becoming more common to encounter students with severe allergies to multiple foods, putting them at risk for anaphylaxis. It is essential that the school nurse have a clear understanding of food allergies and how to effectively manage students in the school setting. Effective communication between families, health care providers, faculty, staff, and students, is of utmost importance when developing a plan of care to ensure the safety of the student with food allergies. Using an interdisciplinary approach to case management, the school nurse can develop comprehensive individualized health care plans for all students with food allergies.</p>

<title>Case Study</title>
<p>Five-year-old Alison registered for kindergarten the spring before she began school. Her parents expressed their anxiety about sending their daughter to school with her history of severe allergies to multiple foods and had many questions regarding the management of students with food allergies in the school setting. Alison’s food allergies were first presented during infancy. Her mother described an incident where she had given her some uncooked pasta to play with while she prepared dinner. She soon observed that Alison’s forearms were covered with hives from where her skin had come into contact with the dried pasta. Alison’s pediatrician advised that she be evaluated for other food allergies and Radioallergosorbent testing (RAST) confirmed the diagnosis of allergies to wheat, dairy, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, beef, blueberries, cranberries, and shellfish. Simply going to the grocery store presents a challenge for Alison; her mother reported that when they walk down the bread aisle, Alison’s eyes begin to water. Upon entry into kindergarten, Alison was also diagnosed with asthma, putting her at increased risk for anaphylaxis from contact with or ingestion of the identified foods.</p>

<sec id="section2-1059840511429686">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A food allergy is an abnormal immune response to specific antigens and is differentiated from food intolerance by its definition as an Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated response to an allergen, usually a food protein. Immunoglobulins or antibody proteins are present in plasma and subsequently classified according to their specific function with regard to immunity. IgE is one of the five subclasses of immunoglobulins and is responsible for allergic symptoms during a reaction by binding to mast cells in tissues and basophils in the blood. Basophils compromise 1% of circulating white blood cells and are essential to the immune response to inflammation by releasing cell mediators such as histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes into the bloodstream. Mast cells are concentrated in connective tissue beneath the skin and the mucous membranes of the respiratory and digestive tracts and store histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes within densely packed granules within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840511429686">Fox, 2010</xref>). In people with food allergies, specific antigens trigger the rapid release of cell mediators inducing a range of reactions affecting different areas of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511429686">Pilette, 2008</xref>). The RAST test is used to determine the amount of specific IgE antibodies present in the blood of a person with true food allergies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840511429686">National Institute of Health, 2010</xref>). Conditions such as lactose intolerance and celiac disease differ from true food allergies due to the lack of immune system involvement. It is estimated that approximately 5.2% of children in the United States have food allergies and while a cure for food allergies does not exist, reactions can be prevented by strict avoidance of offending foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511429686">Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009</xref>). Although any food can cause an allergic reaction, eight foods are responsible for 90% of allergic reactions: milk, soy, eggs, wheat, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511429686">Branum &amp; Lukacs, 2008</xref>). How long a child may have a food allergy is dependent upon the allergen in question. Children will outgrow milk and wheat allergies in 64% of cases by age 12 while the percentage is lower for egg allergies at 37% by age 10. Individuals with peanut and tree nut allergies have the lowest chance of developing tolerance at 20% and 9%, respectively (Jarvinen, 2005).</p>
<p>The appearance of signs and symptoms related to food-induced anaphylaxis can vary between a few minutes to several hours after exposure to the allergen. Most reactions occur within 1 hr of exposure to the allergen; however, reactions can also occur within 8–72 hrs after initial exposure. The release of histamine from mast cells leads to cardiovascular symptoms such as vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, while bronchoconstriction results from the secretion of leukotrienes and prostaglandin D2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840511429686">Peavy &amp; Metcalfe, 2008</xref>). Skin and respiratory symptoms are observed in about 80% of cases; skin presentations include urticaria, angioedema, pruritis, rash, and flushing; while respiratory symptoms include coughing, difficulty in breathing and wheezing. Gastrointestinal symptoms can present as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea, in addition, cardiovascular signs include tachycardia, arrhythmia, syncope, and chest pain with hemodynamic collapse leading to hypotension and shock occurring in as little as 10 min due to increased vascular permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840511429686">Lieberman et al., 2005</xref>). Neurological symptoms can present as anxiety, headache, seizure, altered levels of consciousness, or a sense that something bad is going to happen. Other clinical presentations include urinary or fecal incontinence and diaphoresis. Symptoms and severity of allergic reactions vary between individuals and can be dependent upon the amount of exposure or ingestion. Additionally, asthmatics are at increased risk for severe food anaphylaxis (Jarvinen, 2005). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511429686">Iribarren, Tolstykh, Miller, and Eisner (2010)</xref> found the risk of anaphylactic shock to be more than five times greater among those with a diagnosis of asthma. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840511429686">Pumphrey (2004)</xref> identified asthma as a major risk factor in food-related anaphylaxis implicating the overuse of rescue inhaler medications as a possible cause of epinephrine resistance. In some children, ingestion of even small amounts of specific foods can cause serious consequences and possibly death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840511429686">Hadley, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1059840511429686">
<title>Management and Guidelines for School Nurse Practice</title>
<p>It is imperative that all children with food allergies have an individualized health plan that includes a written emergency plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511429686">Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, 2010</xref>). This action is endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics which recommends the Food Allergy Action Plan developed by the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1059840511429686">Appendix A</xref>). It is the responsibility of the school nurse to develop such plans as supported by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511429686">National Association of School Nurses (2001)</xref> Emergency Care Plan (ECP) Position Statement released in 2004, addressing children with special health care needs, whereas it is the responsibility of the health care provider to prescribe the specific treatment supported by the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511429686">Powers, Bergren, &amp; Finnegan, 2007</xref>). In Alison’s case, her physician was given a copy of the Food Allergy Action Plan and orders for epinephrine only were obtained as this is the first-line drug of choice in the treatment of anaphylaxis. Antihistamines were not ordered as the physician did not want any delay in appropriately treating anaphylaxis. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511429686">AAAAI, 2002</xref>) Position Statement addressed the use of epinephrine in the treatment of anaphylaxis.<disp-quote>
<p>Epinephrine has long been regarded as the treatment of choice for acute anaphylaxis. This is true despite the recognition of its potential hazards. Alternative treatments—such as antihistamines, sublingual isoproterenol, inhaled epinephrine, and corticosteroids without epinephrine have failed to prevent or relieve severe anaphylactic reactions. It is therefore inappropriate to use them for the first-line treatment or prevention of anaphylaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511429686">AAAAI, 2002</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote>The dosage of epinephrine is based on the child’s weight and typically an autoinjector is prescribed. Children with a weight between 10–25 kg or 22–55 pounds are prescribed 0.15 mg and for those weighing above 25 kg or 55 pounds, the dose is increased to 0.30 mg. Drug therapies such as antihistamines may help alleviate skin symptoms and are usually only given to prevent a later phase reaction, however, research does not support this at present (Jarvinen, 2005).</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of school nurses to be aware of federal laws that apply to K-12 students. The previous restrictive interpretations of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and its civil rights statute, the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) were addressed by the U.S. Congress and “in September, 2008, the President signed the ADA Amendment in direct response to the constrictive judicial interpretations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840511429686">Zirkel, 2009</xref>, p. 259). Section 504 definition of disability addresses three elements: A mental or physical impairment, a substantial limitation of one or more major life activities and activities qualifying as a major life activity. The 2008 expansion of Section 504 now extends the list of major life activities to include various major bodily functions such as “the operation of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine and reproductive functions” (p. 259). Additionally, the ADA Amendment requires “the measurement of substantial limitations for impairment that are episodic, such as anaphylactic shock” (p. 259.) As school nurses have the ability to review medical information and to seek clarification when needed, they should be a part of the 504 team. The school nurse can assist other team members in understanding the medical implications of impairment.</p>
<p>In the case with Alison, she has a physical impairment in that her immune system reacts to specific foods in the form of an allergic reaction. The major life activity impaired is breathing. As previously mentioned, Alison’s eyes begin to tear when walking down the bread aisle in the grocery store. Eating during the school day is a major life activity. Since Alison’s RAST testing indicated very high amounts of IgE antibodies in her blood to multiple foods, her physician strongly recommended Alison not to eat in the cafeteria. The team concluded that the nature and severity of Alison’s food allergies put her at high risk for anaphylaxis and therefore qualified for a service agreement.</p>

<sec id="section4-1059840511429686">
<title>Development of Individual Health Plan (IHP)</title>
<p>A multidisciplinary meeting was held prior to the start of school to ensure that everyone who may have contact with Alison would be knowledgable about her plan of care as well as the ECP. “Effective management of food allergy requires a team approach that includes the child and parents/family in cooperation with the child’s health care provider and school nurse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840511429686">Carlisle et al., 2010</xref>, p. 361). The development of an individualized plan is necessary as every child with a food allergy will react differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840511429686">Weiss, Munoz-Furlong, Furlong, &amp; Arbit, 2004</xref>). Using information provided by Alison’s parents and her physician, an IHP was developed to facilitate appropriate management of food allergies in the school setting (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840511429686">Table 1</xref>
). It is important to note that contact with nonfood items is addressed in the IHP. Anaphylactic reactions can be caused by contact with allergenic components and should be avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840511429686">Behrmann, 2010</xref>). Additionally, Alison’s parents shall be invited to accompany her on school trips, in addition to the assigned chaperone. In the absence of accompanying parents, staff members trained in the use of epinephrine shall be assigned.</p>

<p>The school nurse is responsible for planning and organizing the multidisciplinary meeting to facilitate classroom management, and with input from Alison’s parents, health care provider, school nurse, teachers, and building administrators, the guidelines can be reevaluated prior to the start of every school year. In order to communicate with Alison’s health care provider should the need arise, an authorization for release of confidential information is also obtained from Alison’s parents during this time. After the final health care plan is drafted, it is the responsibility of the school nurse to disseminate the information to all faculty, staff, and any other individuals who may have contact with Alison during the subsequent school year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059840511429686">
<title>Emergency Training for Faculty and Staff</title>
<p>School nurses frequently have case loads in multiple buildings and must rely on licensed practical nurses, unlicensed assistive personnel, and teachers to assist in providing care to students. Despite the need for delegating care, the school nurse should be recognized as the expert in health information, care planning, and the leader in training all staff, licensed and unlicensed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511429686">Cavanaugh &amp; Strickland, 2011</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511429686">Powers, Bergren, and Finnegan (2007)</xref>, school nurses are responsible for training school staff how to recognize and manage a food allergy emergency. Using the information from the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis network, faculty and staff should be given training at the beginning of every school year. The objectives of faculty and staff training should focus on the following:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>What you should know about food allergy?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What you should know about anaphylaxis?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Treatment of anaphylaxis, preparedness, and prevention</p>
</list-item>
</list>In Alison’s case, the school nurse provides in-service training to all school personnel prior to the start of the school year. During this time, faculty and staff members have the opportunity to ask questions pertaining to food allergies and anaphylaxis. It is important for faculty and staff to know that young children will describe allergic symptoms differently compared to an older child, adolescent or adult. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840511429686">Table 2</xref>
 describes how a child might describe a reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511429686">The Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, 2011</xref>). Additionally, changes in voice such as becoming hoarse or squeaky and the slurring of words could indicate tongue swelling. When faculty and staff fail to recognize the signs of a reaction, time is wasted in treating a child. It is also important for fellow students to have an understanding of food allergies and the importance of following school policies to protect allergic students. In this case, the video <italic>Alexander the Elephant Who Couldn’t Eat Peanuts</italic> was used in the classroom to educate Alison’s classmates about food allergies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511429686">Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, 2008</xref>). It also made Alison feel as if she was not the only child to have food allergies. Staff members should also be given the chance to practice administration of epinephrine with a demonstrator device. Faculty and staff need to be informed of where emergency epinephrine will be stored. In Alison’s case, one dose of epinephrine (Epi-Pen) was stored in the classroom and another in the health room; neither was locked so that easy access was not hampered. It is necessary to review the procedure for calling 911 emergency services in the event of an anaphylactic reaction including communication to the rescue squad of the need for advanced life support and epinephrine. Staff members should be taught to save the used Epi-Pen to give to the emergency medical staff to take to the hospital. School wide communication can be facilitated by typing the emergency instructions and posting them in the health room as well as the school’s main office. Above all, reinforce to faculty and staff the need to follow the emergency plan of action exactly as written. Reinforce statistical evidence that “among children with a known food allergy, 16-18 percent developed a reaction at school” (Jarvinen, 2005, p. 257). Share case studies described by the Food and Allergy Anaphylaxis Network to learn how to avoid errors in judgment and the treatment of allergic reactions. Cases have been cited where although epinephrine was prescribed and readily available, it was not administered in a timely fashion, thereby putting a child at increased risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511429686">Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, 2010</xref>). Educate all parents about the dangers of innocently coercing a child into accepting food which could easily occur in the classroom or on a field trip. Despite the best planning, mistakes can be made and all need to be prepared for an emergency situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511429686">Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Students with food allergies come into the school setting with different backgrounds and needs. As food allergies are becoming a common occurrence, school nurses are faced with the challenge of providing a safe educational setting for children. Many nurses have had experience in managing a student with allergies to only one or two foods but may not have dealt with a child with multiple allergies. The student with multiple, severe food allergies can attend school safely with proper planning beginning with effective communication with parents and health care providers. Using best practice guidelines, school nurses can effectively educate faculty, staff, and students about food allergies with the ultimate goal of preventing accidental exposure to or ingestion of allergic foods. In Alison’s case, a multidisciplinary meeting is conducted at the beginning of every year to ensure that her individualized health plan is followed. Emergency protocols and procedures are also reviewed with all faculty and staff at this time. Alison’s physician continues to monitor the severity of the allergies utilizing periodic RAST testing with the hope of allowing her to eat lunch in the cafeteria with her peers. When that time comes, her plan will be reevaluated so that the school can safely accommodate her needs. Alison has been able to participate in all school activities, other than eating lunch, due to careful planning and cooperation from all parties involved. As she matures, she will be able to accept more responsibility for managing her food allergies and will most likely not require a 504 service agreement. Alison’s parents have expressed their gratitude to the school district for ensuring her safety as she is now entering third grade.</p>
