<p><italic>The Meat Crisis: Developing More Sustainable Production and Consumption</italic> makes a compelling case for realigning our relationship with animals and meat. The book considers this question from multiple perspectives and leaves the reader with no doubt about the need to change our connection to meat and the opportunities this offers. The edited collection deals with (un)sustainable meat production and consumption and how this intersects with the environment, animal welfare, human health, ethics, and policy. In the book’s introduction, the editors challenge “governments, global institutions and policy makers … to find ways to achieve the desired levels of meat production and consumption” (5). From a planning perspective, the book can serve as an important resource about how planners can move issues related to both meat and sustainability forward. The book has the potential to build on food-related planning initiatives in the United States, Canada, and the European Union (EU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X12456257">Morgan 2009</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12456257">American Planning Association’s 2007</xref> Policy Guide on Community and Regional Food Planning is well supported by the contents in <italic>The Meat Crisis</italic>.</p>
<p>The reader is provided with historical information to contextualize issues and the data needed to understand the challenges we face. D’Silva and Webster selected an excellent cross section of expert authors for each topic area. The authors are drawn from academic and practitioner communities so that suggested actions offer balanced, thoughtful, and substantiated alternatives for doing meat differently. Contributors provide convincing reasons to shift how we produce meat to include more sustainable considerations. Each chapter offers well-considered rationales for change and the options available to our current meat system. <italic>The Meat Crisis</italic> is a one-stop, comprehensive, balanced presentation of the current meat consumption–production issues in the context of a sustainable worldview. The main recommendations made in the book are the need to (1) scale down from global, industrial meat systems to community-scale production and (2) reduce overall meat consumption on a per capita basis as a way to dampen our impact on the environment as well as improve human health and animal welfare.</p>
<p>The problems associated with large-scale meat production and the impacts on the environment are clearly laid bare in the first section of the book. In the opening chapter, Tudge encourages people to create and support an alternative food supply that would allow farmers to raise their animals using practices that tread more lightly on the land, provide a decent living to farmers, and allow consumers to purchase humanely raised meat from a more regional food system. In the next chapter, Garnett presents a compelling case to adopt different livestock feeding methods and reduce the scale of production as a means to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Gura makes similar arguments in chapter four but connects the pressures from meat production to biodiversity. She makes it clear the ways meat threatens rainforests through shifting land use to cattle grazing and/or for animal feed production. She also outlines the risks to our meat supply from declining biodiversity within species and how biosecurity and related destruction of diverse flocks erodes the genetic integrity of animal breeds. In the final chapter to this section, Young describes his personal experience as a farmer and how organic farming can provide different metrics for sustainability, offer more resilient, higher-yield production approaches, and produce healthier food for consumers.</p>
<p>Part two of the book (Farming Practices and Animal Welfare) shifts the focus to husbandry methods and animal welfare. Webster begins the section by questioning the logic of the dominant political economic system that privileges quantity as the primary goal. Instead, he suggests we consider using a “virtuous cycle” to facilitate a more transparent and humane animal welfare system for animals, farmers, and consumers. The next chapters on eggs, chicken meat, and pork make similar points while elaborating explicit challenges specific to each production system. Each chapter clearly outlines the unnatural and sometimes inhumane living conditions that animals who end up as food on our plates endure as they are treated as living meat, milk, or egg factories pushed to produce the highest yields in the least space at the lowest possible cost. Each chapter ends with proposed alternative rearing strategies that would attend more to what Butterworth, the author of the chapter titled “Cheap as Chicken,” refers to as the “margin of care” so that society would compensate farmers to care for animals as sentient creatures and not as food production facilities. The chapters also point to links between improved animal welfare and environmental benefits.</p>
<p>The third part of the book, “The Implications of Meat Production for Human Health,” uses the lens of human health to explore sustainability of meat and dairy products (MDP). While making clear the complexity of issues that intersect at the juncture of human health and MDP, the authors leave little doubt that industrial farm production has had a negative impact on a range of human health issues. For example, they make clear links between increased risk from infectious and/or transmissible diseases such as BSE and various strains of flu to diet-related disease including escalating rates of diabetes and some cancers. They make the case again for better animal welfare approaches and decreased meat consumption as a way to confront human health challenges linked to MDP consumption.</p>
<p>The fourth part of the book, “Ethical and Religious Approaches to Animal Foods,” links issues of diet, sustainability, religion, and ethics to meat eating. Rawles makes a good case for the benefits to all sustainability dimensions of considering the ethics of our meat practices. As she explains, “Farming systems based on respect for other forms of life—including the animals with them—should be pursued because this is the right ethics and also because we need to think this way if we are going to continue our tenancy on this, one planet” (223). In the next chapter, Palmer unravels the synergies, whether intended or serendipitous, between religious dietary rituals and rites, human health, and environmental well-being.</p>
<p>The final section, part five, “Devising Farming and Food Policies for a Sustainable Future,” of the book deals with policy. Wirsenius and Hedenus, authors of chapter fifteen, explore the need for both demand and supply regulating policies to effectively confront the challenges of GHG emission’s impacts on climate and biodiversity loss. Working from the fact that most agriculture-related GHG emissions are tied to land conversion, nitrogen fertilizer use, and ruminant (mostly cattle)–related methane, they propose taxes to dampen the demand for high GHG-producing foods and regulations and incentives to encourage more sustainable farming practices. In chapter sixteen, Lang and his colleagues make the case to create policy that moves us from meat as “everyday” to “feast-day.” In making the case for systemic change, Lang et al. espouse a policy “reorientation” to shift meat production and consumption in more sustainable directions in a bid to enable food citizenship. In the final chapter, Porritt makes the case that “you can’t keep a good body of facts down” and suggests that by appealing to public self-interest about personal health and welfare, policy makers can in fact bring about change. Among a broad range of policy levers, Porritt suggests governments can engage in public education, apply pressure on retailers and the food services industry, align farm support to encourage a shift away from meat and feed production, and give more thought to public food procurement to achieve a goal of everyone eating an average of 90 g of meat per day.</p>
<p>While the book is EU-centric, it does offer insights that could be applied to achieve planning goals in the United States. Generally, the book is in keeping with the spirit of the APA Food Policy Guide (FPG). For example, the FPG specifically refers to Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) as “a small percentage of the nation’s 238,000 feeding operations, [CAFOs] produced more than half the 500 million tons of manure. … Health threats from such operations include chronic and acute respiratory illnesses, injuries, infections, and nuisances such as flies, and odor (Bowman et al., 2000). CAFOs are also implicated in spreading stronger strains of <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria and environmental problems such as ground water contamination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12456257">American Planning Association 2007</xref>, 5). <italic>The Meat Crisis</italic> raises opportunities that address problems associated with CAFOs so that planners can help improve human health, reduce fossil fuel use, address ground and surface water pollution, and the overall “recognition that many benefits emerge from stronger community and regional food systems” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12456257">American Planning Association 2007</xref>, 2). Accordingly, the FPG suggests an integrated and comprehensive community-based approach to food planning that accounts for ecological sustainability and human health needs. Recommendations include the ability of planners to consider land use, environmental monitoring, and the reduction of ecological impacts to support sustainable animal husbandry practices. Specifically, incentives can be provided for smaller-scale operations as well as the creation of farmer networks to market smaller-scale meat pitched to a regional or community scale versus a globalized food system. Zoning can also be employed to promote more sustainable production. Energy audits can help to gage where useful interventions could be made that would foster regionally focused meat production to improve energy flows throughout the value chain. Clearly then, the book offers a wealth of evidence and guidance important to planners.</p>
<p>The common theme for all the chapters is the need for a more interdisciplinary and integrated approach to animal protein production as we tackle issues related to climate change, soil and water quality degradation, and human health. As Porritt explains in the final chapter, “most of the changes that need to happen could be driven through by technological innovation, radical fiscal shift and integrated policy interventions that will make low-carbon living relatively pain-free and positively benign from all sorts of environmental, health and well-being perspectives” (285–86).</p>
