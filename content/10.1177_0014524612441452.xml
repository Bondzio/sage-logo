<p>When I entered Pauline studies as an enthusiastic research student over twenty years ago, the field was an enormously exciting and inviting one. The ‘new perspective’ inaugurated by the appearance of E.P. Sanders’ <italic>Paul and Palestinian Judaism</italic> in 1977, was blooming, generating fresh if contentious readings of classic Pauline texts. J. Christian Beker’s, <italic>Paul the Apostle</italic>, which came out in 1980, had sparked off renewed interest in Paul’s eschatology (the topic on which I originally wanted to work) and ‘apocalyptic’ theology. And the social study of Pauline Christianity, showcased by Wayne Meeks in his wonderful book, <italic>The First Urban Christians</italic> (1983), was a promising new sub-discipline, with social-scientific resources offering a new if controversial set of interpretative tools.</p>
<p>Fast-forwarding to the present day, the field has undoubtedly become more saturated as the scholarly literature has exponentially increased. It is much harder now for a budding research student to spot an opening for an original contribution. Mastering the existing literature on any sub-topic is a massive challenge in itself! Also, significant developments have taken place. The inevitable backlash against the ‘new perspective’ has occurred, and the ‘new perspective’ itself has broadened out. Moreover, a ‘post-new-perspective perspective’ (as Michael Bird has labeled it) has emerged. Apocalyptic interpretations of Paul have grown in strength; they have also attracted criticism (e.g., Barry Matlock, <italic>Unveiling the Apocalyptic Paul: Paul’s interpreters and the rhetoric of criticism</italic>, JSNTSS 127; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1996.). Socially-oriented – and sociologically informed - research has burgeoned and diversified. And new research questions have come to the fore: What was Paul’s stance toward the Roman imperial order? How does Paul’s theology relate to ancient philosophy? What can Paul contribute to contemporary philosophical questions?</p>
<p>These developments are charted and elucidated masterfully by N.T. Wright in his article, ‘Paul in Current Anglophone Scholarship’. Wright’s concentration on English-language scholarship reflects another significant turn in Pauline studies: the shift from Germany to North America as scholarly power centre. While acknowledging the new dominance of North America, Wright nevertheless finds regretful the extent to which current Anglophone scholarship on Paul and German Pauline scholarship do not engage with each other. He also bemoans the fragmentation of contemporary Anglophone Pauline scholarship whereby ‘conversations develop in different self-contained groups’. Wright is of course himself one of the most prominent and influential of Paul’s recent interpreters and it is a welcome boon to get his take on the contributions and trends he identifies. For example, he poses sharp questions of J. Louis Martyn’s apocalyptical reading of Paul. For Martyn, the ‘apocalyptic’ character of the Christ event as understood by Paul makes it utterly discontinuous with Israel’s history. Yet Jewish apocalyptic writings, Wright points out, often tell the story of Israel reaching a climax, ‘the very thing Martyn will not allow to Paul’. Wright believes that Martyn and those under his influence are operating with a concept of ‘apocalyptic’ which is quite removed from actual first-century Jewish apocalyptic and rather more in keeping with Barthian dogmatics. Wright, though, is by no means opposed to reading Paul theologically! Indeed, he sees as the main challenge facing Pauline interpreters today the task of giving a consistent account of Paul’s theology. Wright is convinced that it is possible to lay out Paul’s theology in a way that does justice to the insights of the new perspective, Paul’s indebtedness to Jewish apocalyptic, the political and philosophical dimensions of this thought, and the social setting of his mission.</p>
<p>Wright singles out one recently published book on Paul as a ‘breathtaking construction’: Douglas Campbell’s <italic>The Deliverance of God: An Apocalyptic Rereading of Justification in Paul</italic>, published in 2009 (reviewed by Jane Heath in the <italic>Expository Times</italic> 122.3). As Wright notes, this is one of the longest books on Paul ever penned; it is arguably one of the most important. It is not the length of the work that is stunning. What is truly breathtaking is Campbell’s ability to develop and sustain a rigorous, intricate and concentrated argument over the course of more than 1200 pages. The sheer size of the volume, though, is intimidating for many. We are thus delighted that the author has agreed to offer here an article setting out the book’s central thesis (in the hope that some readers will be enticed to go on and read the book itself).</p>
<p>Scholars have long debated how Paul’s ‘participatory’ (being ‘in Christ’, etc.) and ‘forensic’ (the language of justification) categories interrelate, and some have argued that they constitute or betoken discordant schemes of salvation. For Campbell, this seeming conflict within Paul’s theology, or imposed upon it, correlates with a much deeper conflict between Athanasian and Arian approaches to Christian theology. The former grounds theology in the self-revelation of God. The latter requires an anthropological foundation for revelation: the positing of a human plight that God’s saving revelation can resolve. The participatory elements in Paul’s discourse, according to Campbell, link with an Athanasian reading of Paul, while the forensic features cohere with an Arian construal of salvation, or more exactly, a ‘contractual’ form of Arianism, which makes salvation dependent on the meeting of certain conditions. In traditional Protestantism, the saving condition is faith. Campbell finds Arian contractualism deeply objectionable on multiple grounds, and he endeavours to absolve Paul of it. He observes that Paul’s forensic texts are relatively few in number, and the most detailed of them is Romans 1-4. This text is normally read in an Arian contractual way, with Rom 1.18-3.20 articulating a universal plight, and Rom 3.21-4.25 expressing the solution appropriated by faith. Campbell proposes an alternative non-contractual reading of Rom 1.18-3.20. He argues that in this section of the epistle, Paul is directly engaging with and representing the views of his Jewish-Christian opponents in time-honoured Socratic fashion. This means that passages such as Rom 1.18-32 express the position Paul is attacking rather than one that he holds and owns. Campbell further argues that when Paul talks about ‘faith’ in Rom 3.22, 26, etc., he is referring to Christ’s own faith and not faith in Christ as a precondition of salvation. When this re-reading of Romans 1-4 is applied to other seemingly forensic texts, the problem of forensic – and Arian contractual - soteriology more or less disappears. What we are left with both in these texts and elsewhere in Paul is a unified and coherent soteriology expressed in participatory, and thus Athanasian, terms.</p>
<p>Campbell’s bold, brilliant and highly provocative work and the reactions it has engendered show that Pauline studies continues to be an exciting, creative and vibrant field. And with more to come from the likes of Campbell and Wright, its future is looking bright!</p>
