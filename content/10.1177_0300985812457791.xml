Cytological examination of the joint fluid exudate indicated heterophilic arthritis. Radiographic examination in 2 vultures demonstrated periarticular soft tissue swelling in both birds and irregular articular surfaces with subchondral bone erosion in both elbows in 1 bird. Prolonged antibiotic therapy administered in 2 birds did not improve the clinical signs. Necropsy and histological examination demonstrated a chronic lymphoplasmacytic arthritis involving multiple joints and gastrocnemius tenosynovitis. Articular lesions varied in severity and ranged from moderate synovitis and cartilage erosion and fibrillation to severe synovitis, diffuse cartilage ulceration, subchondral bone loss and/or sclerosis, pannus, synovial cysts, and epiphyseal osteomyelitis. No walled bacteria were observed or isolated from the joints. However, mycoplasmas polymerase chain reactions were positive in at least 1 affected joint from each bird. Mycoplasmas were isolated from joints of 1 vulture that did not receive antibiotic therapy. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons from joint samples and the mycoplasma isolate identified <italic>Mycoplasma corogypsi </italic>in 2 vultures and was suggestive in the third vulture. <italic>Mycoplasma corogypsi </italic>identification was confirmed by sequencing the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region of mycoplasma isolates.

Vulture Nos. 1 and 2 weighed 2.1 kg and were in good body condition with adequate muscular mass and abdominal and subcutaneous adipose tissue. Vulture No. 3 weighed 1.340 kg and was in a markedly reduced body condition with moderate to marked atrophy of the pectoral musculature, no subcutaneous adipose tissue, and a small amount of intracoelomic fat store. Both elbow joints were moderately to markedly enlarged, and the soft tissues surrounding them were firmly adherent to the skin (vulture Nos. 1, 2, and 3). In vulture No. 1, the elbow joints had increased mobility in the ventrodorsal plane, reduced range of motion upon extension, and slight crepitus in the left elbow. The range of motion of the elbows in vulture Nos. 2 and 3 was within normal limits. Bilaterally, the joint capsules were distended and markedly thickened, up to 4 mm thick. In the most severely affected elbows, a large synovial cyst (up to 20 × 25 × 10 mm) communicating with the joint space and extending along the humerus in between the extensor and flexor tendons and muscles was present (vulture Nos. 1, 2 and 3). Articular spaces were filled with a moderate to large amount of thick pink-white (vulture No. 1) or translucid (vulture No. 3) viscous fluid containing a large amount of 1- to 3-mm off-white caseous debris or thick dark yellow-orange viscous fluid (vulture No. 2). The volume of joint fluid exudate varied from 1 to 3 ml. The elbow articular surface lesions ranged from a single focal 3-mm-diameter ulcer of the distal humerus (vulture No. 2) or proximal ulna (vulture No. 3) to almost complete eburnation and/or replacement by firm white tissue of the humeral, radial, and ulnar articular surfaces (vulture No. 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812457791">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812457791">2</xref>).

An inflamed layer of granulation tissue (pannus) covered the exposed subchondral bone plate and extended in between epiphyseal bony trabeculae as well as between the radius and ulna. The synovium was diffusely ulcerated with only rare individualized hypertrophied synoviocytes present. Multifocally variable amounts of luminal cell debris, degenerated heterophils, and fibrin clots were adherent to the subsynovial layer. The pannus tissue and the subsynovial connective tissue layer were infiltrated by numerous plasma cells and fewer lymphocyte, macrophages, and heterophils. Occasional lymphoid aggregates consisting of predominantly lymphocytes with peripheral plasma cells were present in the subsynovium. Few scattered granuloma characterized by a thin outer rim of multinucleated giant cells surrounding homogenous eosinophilic material with little karyorrhectic debris were present in the subsynovial tissue, pannus, and bone epiphysis. A subchondral synovial cyst lined by inflamed fibrovascular tissue and communicating with the articular surface was present in the left distal humerus (vulture Nos. 1 and 2) and in between the left proximal radius and ulna (vulture No. 1). Multifocally, deposition of woven bone was evident in the subchondral region of the epiphysis (sclerosis) and along the epiphyseal periosteum (osteophytes formation). In vulture Nos. 2 and 3, the gastrocnemius tendon sheaths overlying the hock joints were markedly thickened by fibrous tissue and an inflammatory cell infiltrate similar to the one described in the joint synovium. A few scattered granulomas were also present. The tendon sheath synovium was ulcerated with multifocal fibrinocellular clots adherent to the subsynovial layer. In vulture No. 2, the gastrocnemius tendon was multifocally hypercellular.</p><p>In addition, a chronic moderate focal lymphoplasmacytic and hyperplastic ventriculitis with bacteria, fungal spores, and pseudo-hyphae within the thickened koilin layer, and a severe diffuse splenic amyloidosis were observed in vulture No. 2. Moderate myeloid hyperplasia with immature heterophils representing 75% of the bone marrow cell population was present in all vultures. No significant histological lesions were observed in the other organs examined.</p></sec><sec id="section12-0300985812457791"><title>Toxicology</title><p>The lead concentrations in the liver samples from vulture Nos. 1 and 3 were 0.08 and 0.4 mg/kg, respectively.

No walled bacteria were isolated by routine bacteriology or observed histologically. However, mycoplasmas were detected by PCR from joints in all 3 vultures, and <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> <italic>spp</italic> was isolated in 1 vulture (vulture No. 3). The amplicon sequences identified<italic> M. corogypsi </italic>in vulture Nos. 1 and 3 and were suggestive in vulture No. 2. Species identification was confirmed by amplification and sequencing of the 16S-23S ISR of 2 mycoplasma isolates. Restriction of the lesions to the articulations and tendon sheaths, lack of detectable walled bacteria, and the histological changes consisting of synovial cell proliferation, ulceration, villus formation, and predominantly lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate with formation of lymphoid nodules were supportive of a mycoplasmal origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985812457791">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0300985812457791">26</xref></sup> Although no walled bacteria were isolated by routine bacteriological culture or seen histologically, it cannot be entirely ruled out that the arthritis was caused by walled bacteria or a mixed infection with walled bacteria and mycoplasma. The antibiotic treatment administered in vulture Nos. 1 and 2 could have eliminated the walled bacteria or impaired bacterial and mycoplasmal isolation despite the termination of antibiotic therapy 11 days prior to euthanasia and necropsy. An underlying viral cause such as a reovirus infection also cannot be ruled out since histological changes induced by reovirus are similar to <italic>Mycoplasma spp</italic> infection, at least in poultry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985812457791">6</xref></sup></p><p>The clinical presentation, gross necropsy findings, absence of detectable walled bacterial infection, and presence of mycoplasma nucleic acid within the affected joints are similar among the 3 cases presented here and the previously published case of polyarthritis in a black vulture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0300985812457791">25</xref></sup> Identification and isolation of <italic>M. corogypsi </italic>from the lesions in this report further support <italic>M. corogypsi</italic> as the likely cause. Demonstration of the presence of <italic>M. corogypsi</italic> within the articular lesions by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization would be useful to strengthen this association and study the pathogenesis of the disease.

The liver (vulture Nos. 1 and 3) or blood (vulture No. 2) lead level detected in the 3 vultures that we examined were low, less than 4 ppm wet weight and 0.2 mg/L, respectively, thus indicating that lead intoxication was not a predisposing factor in these 3 vultures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0300985812457791">24</xref></sup> No potential predisposing factor was identified in vulture Nos. 1 and 2.
