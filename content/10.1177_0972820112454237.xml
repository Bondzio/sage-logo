<abstract>
<p>This case deals with the specialties involved in project management (PM) communication. It purports that project communication has some nuances of emphasis that differentiate it from general business communication. PM has emerged from the discipline of Operations Management (OM), a branch of management science dealing with the hardcore scientific practices in executing work. Thus, like OM, PM quantifies, systematizes and documents almost all actions.</p>
<p>Therefore Project Communication (PC) too follows standardized procedures and manuals, as PM operates within constraints of budgets and deliveries, like in Operations Management. There is little scope for rework. It is even more acute in cases of overseas projects, where challenges like differences in organization and project culture, time zones, language, technology and distance, etc. add to the enormous complexity. Thus, PC entails accuracy and systematic handling of communication networks. Constituent members in the network must follow strict documentation procedures. The project manager should display sophistication in handling interpersonal communication problems. In fact, he must even anticipate probable pitfalls and take proactive efforts to avoid them later in the process.</p>
<p>The present case depicts the efficient communication practices which Nitish followed for Wipro’s overseas project. His success is an outcome of following good interpersonal communication while adhering to the communication plan and the project framework.</p>

<article-title>MCB: Implementation of the Symbols Project</article-title>
</title-group>
<pub-date>
<year/>
</pub-date>
<abstract>
<p>This is a case that facilitates learning about IT-enabled change management. It tracks both the decision to convert to a $1.7 million banking enterprise system and its roll-out between 2002 and 2008. The project was met with resistance by the branches of this major nationwide bank to the point that in 2005 the project team was completely reorganized and a new Senior Vice President (SVP) position was created specifically for the project. The new system would lead to more centralization and integration with faster inter-branch processing as compared to the previous system which granted branches more autonomy in inter-bank transfers and employees only interacted with the system through data operators. Recognizing customers at the bank level and not just at branch level was an important objective. The complete project reorganization allows readers to understand the need to appreciate certain factors that may be deemed as trivial, especially where top-down IT enabled change is being implemented. At the end of the case, the project is still in progress with 818 branches (76 per cent) converted to the new system.</p>

<article-title>Succession Management Challenges: The Case of a Family Business in the UAE</article-title>
</title-group>
<pub-date>
<year/>
</pub-date>
<abstract>
<p>This case study illustrates the story of Raja Garage Ltd, a small car repair services company based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It begins with Izat Raja’s dream to start his own business and follows his journey in pursuit of turning his dream into reality. Shortly after the establishment of his car workshop, Izat is joined by his nephew, Waleed, and together they face the obstacles that arise on their road to success. Years later, Izat’s only son, Kamran, also joins Raja Garage Ltd to find out that the company is slowly regressing and may be on the brink of failure. Kamran decides to take over the family business and shares his ideas with his father, ideas which he believes could salvage the company. Recently recovering from the impact of the financial crisis, Raja Garage Ltd has proven its capacity to overcome multiple challenges throughout its years of existence. Yet, the company’s current survival and future development hinges upon the family members’ ability to make the right decisions.</p>

<article-title>The Employee Strike at University of Health Sciences, Lahore–Punjab</article-title>
</title-group>
<pub-date>
<year/>
</pub-date>
<abstract>
<p>This case traces the series of events that led to the crippling employee strike faced by the University of Health Sciences in 2009–2010. Instigated by a somewhat ambiguously worded directive from the Punjab Government (under whose aegis the UHS functions) regarding the regularization of contract employees, the misunderstanding snowballed into a full-fledged revolt by the majority of the UHS contractual staff against the university management. This led to the university finally having to relieve 65 per cent of its work force from employment.</p>
<p>This case narrates in detail how these events come to pass. It also presents a brief overview of the UHS organizational structure; its decision-making dynamics; and the institutional context in which it functions. A brief outline of the university VC’s leadership style is also presented.</p>
