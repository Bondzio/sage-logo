<p>In <italic>Civil Rights Memorials and the Geography of Memory</italic>, Dwyer and Alderman investigate the spatial distribution of civil rights memorials in the United States, how these memorials are struggled over, and why specific voices are underrepresented in the process of memorialization. Looking at street naming as well as memorials, the book focuses on the legacies of Martin Luther King Jr. The authors successfully integrate a variety of perspectives ranging from the ideas of Pierce Lewis and Wilbur Zelinsky to the scholarship of Ken Foote on the memorialization of violent events. Although the authors make use of poststructuralist insights, they don’t explicitly name key poststructuralists. Indeed, the book is not heavy on citations but points are persuasively argued without them. The authors’ writing style follows in the tradition of other books published through the Center for American Places that attempt to reach academic and educated lay audiences simultaneously. Dwyer and Alderman deserve credit for succeeding in that regard.</p>
<p>Images are essential to this book. Seventy-nine informative black-and-white photographs of civil rights memorials will cause readers to reexamine normative assumptions about landscapes, space, and the politics of memory. What makes these visuals great, though, are the uncommonly rigorous captions paired with each photograph. The captions connect the authors’ readings of each photograph to social theory and the existing literature on memorials in a useful and jargon-free way.</p>
<p>Academics interested in memorialization processes can find useful insights here concerning many different forms of commemoration as well as social groups’ reactions to memorialization efforts. General audiences will be challenged to think critically about their public spaces and landscapes. This is a useful book from which budding scholars may conjure up research ideas based upon the issues Dwyer and Alderman raise. I also see pedagogical value in this book, which would be excellent as a week’s reading in a graduate seminar on cultural, historical, or political geography. And its conclusion offers us thirty questions from which we may continue to investigate civil rights memorials. Most of these questions may be applied to rigorous scrutiny of the broader cultural landscape, and could be useful to share with students in introductory human geography or landscape studies classes. In short, both advanced and introductory scholars of cultural geography will find this provocative and accessible book to be worth reading.</p>
