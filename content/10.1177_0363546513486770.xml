<sec id="section1-0363546513486770">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Questions have been raised concerning the height of the tibial epiphysis as an important factor related to the safety of intra-articular anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in skeletally immature knees. However, normal values for this parameter have yet to be established on cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513486770">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To determine normal values for the height of the tibial epiphysis and width of the lateral femoral condylar epiphysis in children and adolescents by use of MRI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513486770">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513486770">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>An electronic search was conducted for pediatric knee MRI examinations at the authors’ institution from August 2007 to July 2011. The height of the tibial epiphysis was determined on the sagittal T1-weighted image best containing the ACL footplate. Lateral femoral condylar width was recorded on coronal proton-density-weighted images. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to determine interobserver agreement. Knees were stratified by age into 2 groups based on potential risk of iatrogenic growth plate injury: Group 1 consisted of boys younger than 13 years (range, 7-12 years) and girls younger than 12 years (range, 10-11 years); group 2 consisted of boys between the ages of 13 and 16 years and girls between the ages of 12 and 14 years. Each cohort was further stratified by sex.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513486770">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Group 1 consisted of 17 boys (mean age, 10.4 years) and 5 girls (mean age, 10.8 years), and group 2 contained 23 boys (mean age, 14.4 years) and 14 girls (mean age, 13.7 years). There was a total of 59 knees. No difference was found for average tibial epiphyseal height between group 1 (15.26 ± 1.25 mm) and group 2 (15.01 ± 2.14 mm). However, there was a statistically significant difference related to sex in each cohort: boys versus girls in group 1 (15.63 ± 1.15 mm vs 14.00 ± 0.62 mm, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .007) and boys versus girls in group 2 (16.00 ± 1.88 mm vs 13.40 ± 1.47 mm, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .0001). The average femoral condylar width for both cohorts was greater than 28 mm where femoral tunnel location would be expected. The ICC was strong (&gt;0.7) at tibial and femoral locations where tunnel placement would be expected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513486770">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The average height of the tibial epiphysis in both children and adolescents is 15 mm. Girls had shorter tibial epiphyses than boys, but further studies are necessary to determine whether this difference is clinically relevant. Lateral femoral condylar width in children and adolescents can be expected to be greater than 28 mm.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears in children and adolescents is increasing in frequency, as the medical community is becoming more aware of this condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513486770">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513486770">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513486770">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513486770">28</xref></sup> A higher level of clinical suspicion and increased use of confirmatory diagnostic imaging techniques are providing a more confident preoperative diagnosis of complete ACL tears. However, patients with open physes often pose a management dilemma, since iatrogenic complications after ACL reconstruction surgery are key concerns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513486770">2</xref></sup> Leg length discrepancy and angular deformity related to physeal injury and premature closure of the growth plate are potential unfavorable outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513486770">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513486770">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513486770">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513486770">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513486770">19</xref></sup> The risk of iatrogenic growth disturbance is particularly concerning for younger children, especially for those individuals with at least 5 cm of remaining lower extremity growth potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513486770">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513486770">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513486770">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some authors have advocated nonoperative management or a delay of surgery until a more mature skeletal age for young children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513486770">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513486770">22</xref></sup> However, nonoperative management of complete ACL tears is not without its own risks, and several studies have demonstrated poor outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513486770">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513486770">24</xref></sup> Similar to adults, skeletally immature patients are at increased risk for progressive instability and subsequent development of meniscal tears, osteochondral injuries, and posttraumatic osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513486770">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513486770">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513486770">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513486770">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513486770">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513486770">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513486770">24</xref></sup> Some authors believe that the natural history of ACL injuries is actually worse for children than for adults and that surgical intervention is indicated for restoration of ACL function and for meniscal preservation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513486770">2</xref></sup> Noncompliance with medical advice is another pertinent factor that complicates nonoperative management of complete ACL tears. Trends toward increased participation by children and adolescents in competitive and recreational sports have further intensified this problem, since many of these patients are unable or unwilling to limit their activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513486770">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513486770">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513486770">24</xref></sup> Restoring ACL function through surgical intervention is therefore a high priority for many physicians.</p>
<p>Several ACL “physeal-sparing” reconstruction techniques have been developed, many of which are extra-articular or nonanatomic in design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513486770">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513486770">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513486770">27</xref></sup> These were developed for children who are not approaching skeletal maturity, since surgical techniques crossing the growth plate remain controversial. However, these strategies fall short of restoring the ideal isometry of the ACL. An intra-articular placement of the ACL reconstruction graft more closely mimics the anatomic and kinematic properties of the native ACL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513486770">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513486770">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513486770">13</xref></sup> Several techniques that do not cross either the tibial or femoral physis have been described for intra-articular ACL reconstructive surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513486770">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513486770">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513486770">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513486770">18</xref></sup> For patients with at least 5 cm of remaining lower extremity growth potential, these surgeries offer the possibility for isometric reconstruction and avoidance of growth plates.</p>
<p>With the development of these techniques, new concerns have been expressed in the literature. Particularly, what should be the lower age limit for a physeal-sparing surgery, and which children are too young to have an ACL reconstruction?<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513486770">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513486770">26</xref></sup> Some authors have suggested that these procedures may be safe in children as young as 5 years old, although no definite evidence exists to support this claim.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513486770">3</xref></sup> The height of the tibial epiphysis in young children has been identified as an important concern regarding the level of safety for ACL reconstruction and tibial tunnel placement, although an understanding of what the minimum height should be has not been established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513486770">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513486770">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513486770">26</xref></sup> Determining normal values for the height of the tibial epiphysis in the skeletally immature population can provide a starting point for addressing the question of what constitutes a “minimum” height with regard to management of complete ACL tears in children and adolescents. Surgeons can use these values as a reference to aid in the preoperative workup for physeal-sparing ACL reconstructive surgery.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to determine normal values for the height of the tibial epiphysis in children and adolescents on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee. In addition, normal values for the width of the lateral femoral condylar epiphysis were determined, since this is also a common location for tunnel placement during physeal-sparing ACL reconstruction.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The study was approved by the authors’ institutional review board and complied with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act guidelines. The requirement for patient informed consent was waived for this retrospective study.</p>
<p>The study population consisted of boys between the ages of 7 and 16 and girls between the ages of 7 and 14. Patients undergoing an MRI of the knee between August 2007 and July 2011 were identified through an electronic search of our departmental picture archiving and communication system (PACS). Inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) an intact ACL or a mild sprain of the ACL that did not preclude clear delineation of its normal landmarks and morphologic characteristics, (b) normal proximal tibial epiphysis, and (c) normal distal femoral epiphysis. A total of 81 knees were identified during the search. Twenty-two knees were excluded for the following reasons: ACL high-grade partial or complete tear (n = 14), acute tibial fracture (n = 2), Blount disease (n = 2), ACL reconstruction (n = 2), arthrofibrosis (n = 1), and chondroblastoma at the lateral femoral condyle (n = 1). Therefore, 59 knees (40 male and 19 female; mean age, 12.8 years; range, 7-16 years) were included in the study. Proposed stratification systems related to the risk of iatrogenic physeal injury after transphyseal ACL reconstruction surgery for skeletally immature knees have been described in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513486770">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513486770">12</xref></sup> We stratified each knee in our study into either a high or intermediate risk group based on guidelines provided by Anderson and Anderson.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513486770">4</xref></sup> Group 1 consisted of boys younger than 13 years (range, 7-12 years) and girls younger than 12 years (range, 10-11 years); group 2 consisted of boys between the ages of 13 and 16 and girls between the ages of 12 and 14.</p>
<p>All MRI examinations were performed with a dedicated knee coil at 1.5 T (Magnetom Avanto or Espree, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) or at 3.0 T (Magnetom Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The MRI examinations included standard 2-dimensional coronal turbo spin echo (TSE) proton-density (PD)–weighted and sagittal spin echo T1-weighted sequences, with a slice thickness of either 3 mm or 3.5 mm. A single examination had a slice thickness of 4 mm. Each knee examination contained a sagittal TSE T2-weighted fat saturation or short tau inversion recovery sequence that was available for comparison.</p>
<p>Two musculoskeletal radiologists and 1 musculoskeletal radiology fellow independently and retrospectively reviewed the images on a PACS workstation. The height of the tibial epiphysis was obtained from the sagittal T1-weighted image best containing the ACL and its tibial footplate and was determined by the vertical distance from the cortical bone at the site of the ACL footplate attachment to the proximal tibial epiphysis–physis interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513486770">Figure 1</xref>). In this study, we included knees that had intact ACLs or mild sprains so that the location of the tibial footplates could be readily identified. We did so to provide a reliable location for reproducible measurement and to provide a height of the tibial epiphysis that best correlated with the location of the native ACL footprint. Knees with complete tears or higher grade sprains were excluded because of decreased certainty about the location of the footplate. The width of the lateral femoral condylar epiphysis was determined using 2 separate techniques. The first method (method 1) was adapted from an approach used by some authors to estimate the location of the footplate of the ACL on the femur during fluoroscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513486770">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513486770">4</xref></sup> This included finding the sagittal image best containing the ACL and the magnetic resonance equivalent of the Blumensaat line; then, the localizer function at the PACS workstation was used to select the coronal PD image that corresponded to one-fourth the distance along the Blumensaat line in a posterior to anterior direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513486770">Figure 2</xref>); last, the distance from the footplate of the ACL to the lateral cortex of the lateral femoral condylar epiphysis was measured as a horizontal line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513486770">Figure 2</xref>). The second method (method 2) involved measuring the distance from the footplate of the ACL to the lateral cortex of the lateral femoral condylar epiphysis as a horizontal line on the first 3 consecutive coronal PD MRI slices through the lateral femoral condyle, posterior to anterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513486770">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). The mean tibial epiphyseal height and lateral femoral condylar width were calculated for each individual knee from the measurements provided by each observer. Group 1 and group 2 mean measurements were compared by use of the unpaired <italic>t</italic> test. Each cohort was stratified further by sex and also compared by use of the unpaired <italic>t</italic> test. The mean age of group 1 and group 2, and the mean age by sex in each cohort, were compared with the unpaired <italic>t</italic> test. A <italic>P</italic> value less than .05 was considered to indicate a significant difference. In addition, interobserver agreement was assessed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) on a scale of 0 to 1. An ICC 0.0 to 0.2 indicates poor agreement; 0.3 to 0.4 indicates fair agreement; 0.5 to 0.6 indicates moderate agreement; 0.7 to 0.8 indicates strong agreement; and greater than 0.8 indicates nearly perfect agreement.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>With the trend of increasing awareness of ACL tears in children and adolescents, health care providers are more frequently tasked with the challenge of determining best management practices. Physicians must account for open growth plates when determining treatment options, which differs from the standard approach used for adults. Techniques requiring placement of ACL grafts across physes in growing children remain a controversial subject in the orthopaedic community.</p>
<p>Skeletal maturity and degree of sexual development are 2 important factors considered during preoperative evaluation. Adolescents near skeletal maturity who have minimal remaining growth potential are likely to receive an ACL reconstruction that crosses open growth plates, without concern for serious long-term adverse consequences. Adolescents with sexual maturity of at least Tanner stage 4 and less than 50 mm of remaining lower extremity growth potential are compatible with this level of development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513486770">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513486770">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513486770">22</xref></sup> In contrast, children in Tanner stages 1 and 2 who have significant growth potential remaining are generally considered at high risk for suffering iatrogenic growth disturbance related to physeal injury. Intra-articular ACL reconstruction techniques that avoid drilling across the growth plates have been developed to address this problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513486770">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513486770">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513486770">18</xref></sup> Some authors have advocated avoiding intra-articular ACL reconstruction altogether in Tanner stage 1 or 2 patients who are shorter than older siblings and parents by at least 100 to 150 mm because of fear of iatrogenic complications,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513486770">22</xref></sup> although nonoperative management of complete ACL tears in children is not without its own risks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513486770">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513486770">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513486770">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513486770">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513486770">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513486770">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513486770">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since the height of the tibial epiphysis has recently been described as an important concern regarding the level of safety of intra-articular ACL reconstruction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513486770">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513486770">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513486770">26</xref></sup> we sought to determine what normal values exist for the age groups at risk for iatrogenic complications related to physeal plate injury. Kim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513486770">15</xref></sup> used radiographic measurements to determine the height of the proximal tibial epiphysis in children and adolescents. We are unaware of any similar type of study in the literature that measures tibial epiphyseal height on MRI. Anderson and Anderson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513486770">4</xref></sup> recommended intra-articular ACL reconstruction surgery that avoids growth plates in prepubescent children who demonstrate Tanner stages 1 and 2 of development and pubescent adolescents who are categorized as Tanner stage 3. Boys 13 to 16 years of age and girls 12 to 14 years of age were described as the subset of patients in the pubescent group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513486770">4</xref></sup> Our study divided knees into 2 cohorts: (1) boys younger than 13 years of age and girls younger than 12 years of age and (2) boys 13 to 16 years of age and girls 12 to 14 years of age. The difference between the mean ages of the younger and older cohorts was statistically significant with a <italic>P</italic> value less than .0001.</p>
<p>With regard to the height of the tibial epiphysis, no difference was found between the mean values of the younger and older cohorts. Our study found that the expected average normal tibial epiphyseal height was 15 mm. Therefore, we conclude that the height of the tibial epiphysis is unlikely to change significantly as a child develops into a pubescent adolescent. Our results differed from those of Kim et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513486770">15</xref></sup> who reported that the height of the tibial epiphysis increased incrementally from age 7 to age 16 according to radiographic measurements on lateral radiographs, growing from 10.4 mm to 14.8 mm. We believe that our method has a higher potential for accuracy in determining tibial epiphyseal height relevant to intra-articular ACL reconstruction, since measurements were performed on cross-sectional MRIs at the direct site of ACL attachment. Kim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513486770">15</xref></sup> also did not compare male and female patients in their study. In contrast, girls demonstrated shorter mean values for the height of the tibial epiphysis than boys in our study, with a difference of 1.6 mm (<italic>P</italic> = .007) for the younger group and 2.6 mm (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) for the older group, respectively.</p>
<p>We sought to evaluate the width of the lateral femoral condyle, since placing a femoral tunnel has been described in physeal-sparing ACL surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513486770">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513486770">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513486770">18</xref></sup> The average width of the lateral femoral condylar epiphysis was greater than 30 mm for both the younger and older group of patients by our first method (method 1), correlating with the MRI slice through one-fourth the distance along the Blumensaat line from posterior to anterior. The average difference in size between the older group compared with the younger group was 3.8 mm, with a <italic>P</italic> value equal to .0004. Although the older group had larger average femoral width by our second method (method 2), we found no significant difference between the 2 groups when comparing consecutive MRI slices through the lateral femoral condyle at the anterior-most slice (third consecutive image through the lateral femoral condyle) and the middle slice (second consecutive image). The younger group on average measured greater than 24 mm on the middle slice and greater than 28 mm on the anterior-most slice. The differences found between method 1 and method 2 for the average width of the lateral femoral condylar epiphysis were related to the observation that most MRI slices obtained from method 1 were more anterior to the anterior-most slice in method 2. From these data, we conclude that the average width of the lateral femoral condylar epiphysis in our study population increases, scanning in a posterior to anterior direction, toward the anatomic location of the femoral footplate of the ACL. Thus, the lateral femoral condylar epiphyseal width will not likely be a rate-limiting step for ACL reconstruction in prepubescent children and pubescent adolescents within the age range of our study population. This corresponds to other findings in the literature. Lawrence et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513486770">18</xref></sup> stated that femoral tunnel length through the epiphysis was not an issue during ACL reconstruction. Their procedure placed a 23-mm interference screw across the femoral epiphysis in 3 boys aged 10 to 12 years. Anderson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513486770">2</xref></sup> described a procedure that required a minimum of 20 mm of quadruple hamstring tendon graft within the femoral tunnel.</p>
<p>The results of our study serve only as a starting point for addressing the safety of intra-articular ACL reconstruction in children and adolescents at risk for iatrogenic growth plate disturbance. The vertical height of the tibial epiphysis is only one of several important variables that must be considered during preoperative planning. The operative approach and minimum length needed for tibial tunnel placement may differ among surgical techniques. The surgeon’s experience and comfort level and the patient’s anatomic features will no doubt influence management decisions, since no clear consensus exists in the literature. Anderson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513486770">3</xref></sup> emphasized that he had no minimum criteria for tibial epiphyseal height and placed more importance on the height of the tibial epiphysis relative to the size of the drill bit used. Lawrence et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513486770">19</xref></sup> also commented that tunnel diameter and proximity to the physis are important factors to consider in regard to avoiding growth disturbance following physeal-sparing ACL surgery. Future studies will be necessary to determine the optimal ratio of tunnel diameter to epiphyseal size and tunnel position in the skeletally immature knee.</p>
<p>Several surgical techniques require tibial tunnels that are not truly vertical but instead have an oblique course to avoid the growth plate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513486770">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513486770">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513486770">18</xref></sup> Lawrence et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513486770">18</xref></sup> described a minimum length of 20 mm for the tibial tunnel to accommodate the size of the Retroscrew used for their technique of physeal-sparing surgery. Therefore, tunnel course is another critical variable that must be considered. This factor accounts for the difference in tibial epiphyseal height values determined in our study compared with the longer tunnel lengths placed at the time of surgery. Kim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513486770">15</xref></sup> proposed a mathematical formula to convert the vertical height of the tibial epiphysis measured on a lateral radiograph into a longer oblique length to determine the maximum interference screw length that could be used at surgery. Other authors have instead relied on image guidance to direct tunnel placement. Anderson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513486770">2</xref></sup> used intraoperative fluoroscopy to establish the location and orientation of epiphyseal tunnel placement at the knee. More recently, Lawrence et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513486770">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513486770">19</xref></sup> have advocated intraoperative computed tomography with 3-dimensional reconstruction for placement of epiphyseal tunnels during physeal-sparing ACL reconstruction, because this modality has a greater potential for more precise planning of tunnel angle, length, and position. Intraoperative computed tomography imaging may also have the potential to reduce the risk of physeal injury at the distal femur,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513486770">19</xref></sup> in addition to the proximal tibia, during physeal-sparing ACL surgery.</p>
<p>The limitations of our research include the retrospective nature of the study. Patients were identified by a search of our hospital PACS for MRI examinations of the knee without regard to patient history or physical examination findings. Also, no prospective correlation was performed with regard to sexual maturity or skeletal age. The height and weight of study participants were unknown, so direct comparison of knees between males and females of equal size was not possible. Future studies will be necessary to determine whether any sex-related differences for tibial epiphyseal height and lateral femoral condylar width exist between male and female patients of equal size. The use of different MRI scanners within our hospital system was another limitation, since all images were not produced by a single scanner. We believe that the basic nature of our research mitigates some of these limitations, since only simple measurements of tibial height and femoral width were evaluated. We excluded any knee with a morphological abnormality at the proximal tibial epiphysis or lateral femoral condylar epiphysis that would have precluded our measurements. Although different MRI scanners were used, all imaging protocols were similar in terms of sequences acquired, slice thickness, slice gap, and vendor type.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We found no difference for the height of the tibial epiphysis between our younger and older cohorts of skeletally immature knees. Therefore, as a young child develops into a pubescent adolescent, tibial epiphyseal height is unlikely to change significantly; it was on average 15 mm regardless of age in our study population. Girls, however, should receive increased attention if a physeal-sparing ACL reconstruction is contemplated, since they have shorter tibial epiphyses than boys. Future studies will be needed to determine whether these sex differences have actual clinical relevance. The width of the lateral femoral condylar epiphysis in children and adolescents can be expected to be greater than 28 mm at the site of tunnel placement and is unlikely to pose a barrier to physeal-sparing ACL reconstruction.</p>
