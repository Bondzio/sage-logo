<abstract>
<p>Humanistic studies cultivate types of conceptual fluency and modes of awareness important to thought concerning values. Not all knowledge is scientific knowledge. There is genuine comprehension of some valuative matters – they are not all to be interpreted in expressive or subjective terms. Education in the humanities can encourage value-relevant types of discernment, awareness, and articulateness in uniquely effective ways. Though important kinds of thought concerning values may lack formal, theoretical elaboration they involve genuine standards of intellectual responsibility. Engagement with the humanities does not ensure development of sound valuative thought and judgment – nothing <italic>ensures</italic> it – but can have a crucial role in shaping it. Moreover, intellectual and moral imagination should not be constrained by boundaries of academic specialization. Specialization has several merits but it can motivate inappropriately reductionist claims and theoretical over-extension. Often, sound normative understanding is not dependent upon explicit theoretical justification or a specific inquiry’s explanatory idiom.</p>

<body>
<p><sc>This article addresses some issues</sc> at the intersection of the topics in its admittedly ambitious title. One of the main points is that humanistic scholarship and education can encourage a combination of conceptual comprehension, heightened imagination, and modes of attention crucial to thought and judgment concerning several kinds of value. The claim is not that humanistic studies make people virtuous. Nonetheless, the humanities and arts enable us to bring various values into view and enable us to consider their significance in ways not facilitated by other kinds of knowledge and other skills. The second main point is that both specialization and theory – while they have significant roles in humanistic studies – also present certain risks, and those risks can undermine some of what is most important about the humanities.</p>
<p>In thinking about the point and the value of curricula, and about what sorts of ‘preparation’ are afforded by different areas of study, the matters mentioned should be taken into account. Narrowly focusing on specific skills, methods or information can make us blind to the ways in which education is about perspective, awareness, and the ability to consider the significance of what is known. Preoccupation with credential-oriented education and narrowly specialized learning can result in habits of thinking so specifically oriented to certain tasks and types of information that what is claimed to be ‘preparation’ effectively disables students for intellectual versatility and for engaging issues and problems of new or unfamiliar kinds.</p>
<p>An unfortunate tendency on the part of many critics of liberal education is to discount the worth and the significance of humanistic studies and the arts, regarding them as having little instrumental value or seeing them as unaffordable luxuries – perhaps lovely as cultural adornments but not what society, individuals, firms, and institutions <italic>really</italic> need. That is a mistake.</p>
<p>Much of the following discussion explicates respects in which that perspective is both inaccurate and counterproductive. The discussion highlights ways in which humanistic scholarship and education are centrally important. It indicates ways in which the sorts of understanding and judgment they encourage are essential <italic>and</italic> not likely to be supported and encouraged by other kinds of inquiry and education.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1474022212441771"><title>I</title>
<p>A key point that needs to be stated at the outset is that not all knowledge is scientific knowledge. The significance of that fact cannot be overestimated. The scale and complexity of the issue exceed the scope of this article. For present purposes, it suffices to note that if we regard scientific knowledge as the only genuine knowledge we will be badly hobbled for making judgments about various kinds of meaning and significance, about what constitutes a well-ordered society and why that is important, and about what constitutes a well-led life. (The claim that all knowledge is scientific knowledge is itself a philosophical claim rather than a scientific one.)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474022212441771">1</xref></sup> These are not matters of scientific knowledge but neither are they simply matters of preference, non-rational inclination or otherwise uninformed by understanding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474022212441771">2</xref></sup> The view that moral issues and questions concerning what is a well-ordered social world or political community are <italic>either</italic> amenable to scientific resolution <italic>or</italic> they are subjective matters of opinion reflects a false dilemma. Scientific understanding is relevant to those issues and there are ways in which it can be applied in those contexts. But questions about what are the chief goods and concerns of human lives are not scientific questions and the pretense of rendering them thus is likely to result in caricature or catastrophe. Many sciences bear on how we live our lives, though ‘how should we live?’ is not itself a scientific question.</p>
<p>Judgments about worth, significance, and importance – judgments about what I shall call ‘valuative’ matters – involve kinds of understanding distinct from scientific knowledge. With regard to valuative matters we need the sorts of awareness, imagination, and understanding cultivated by the humanities and arts. This is the case even if we are skeptical that there is such a thing as practical wisdom, by which I mean knowledge of genuine human goods and knowledge of what sorts of virtues people need in order to live genuinely worthwhile, gratifying lives without illusion about what is choiceworthy. Indeed, the denial that there is practical wisdom is one of the more pronounced features of modern intellectual culture. But there is a kind of conceptual fluency and understanding attainable through humanistic thought even if there is not a specific end or good proper to human nature. The genuineness of moral and political wisdom does not depend upon there being a single, unique, best kind of life for a human being. Questions concerning what is a well-led life lose none of their significance if there is more than one way to answer them and if there is a plurality of irreducible, incommensurable goods for human beings.</p>
<p>If we consider who seems to us to have the soundest judgment, the keenest insight, and the most articulate comprehension of valuative matters it is highly unlikely that the persons who come to mind do so primarily or exclusively on account of their scientific knowledge <italic>or</italic> on account of opinions or preferences for which they are unable to give justificatory reasons. Valuative matters are amenable to thought and understanding, and in the absence of thought and understanding the empty space is often filled with ideology or fanaticism. To genuinely regard moral matters and other valuative issues as either simply subjective or as fully assimilable to scientific explanation – to <italic>really</italic> mean that and live by it – would involve abdicating serious, informed thinking about such things in their own right or it would mean waiting for a kind of scientific providence to illuminate them and set them right.</p>
<p>For instance, consider the numerous hard questions about morally responsible uses of scientific knowledge and about morally permissible or responsible approaches to attaining knowledge. Those are matters for carefully reasoned, empirically informed, conceptually clear reflection and debate. We can tell the difference between foolish and sensible views, and between better and worse reasons for a position. We need to know what we are talking about (in the relevant scientific contexts) but these issues are not themselves scientific questions. If we really think these are matters of unreasoned feeling or attitude we abandon rational moral agency. If we think that these are themselves further scientific matters we do pretty much the same thing, but console ourselves with an illusion of intellectual alchemy – that scientific knowledge will also tell us what is good.</p>
<p>It is vitally important to recognize that there can be knowledge of valuative matters – not just knowledge of what people have <italic>thought</italic> about them – and that it is not scientific knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474022212441771">3</xref></sup> It is no less important to acknowledge that there is no fixed, universal formula for a well-led life or a good society. The human condition would be much less interesting, and also much less precarious, noble, and anxious if things were otherwise. Being unsusceptible to formal theoretical elaboration does not render knowledge lesser or inferior on that account. For example, knowledge of what constitutes fairness or of what fairness requires in a given situation is not mere pseudo-knowledge on account of defying codification or because it is not straightforwardly derivable from a systematic theory of fairness or from neuroscience or evolutionary psychology.</p>
<p>A judgment that a particular life has been wasted or ill-spent in some ways can be true and important – and can be defended and justified – without being derivable from a theory of something else. A good deal of understanding and insight may be involved in explaining the judgment. But the notion that it is <italic>just</italic> an opinion or that it is mere opinion <italic>unless</italic> it is derivable from a science is a way of endorsing the view that there is no difference between better and worse valuative judgment and between better and worse reasons and inferences upon which to base such judgments. The social, moral, and political world shaped by genuine acceptance of that notion would be, frighteningly, the one deserved. It would reflect a measure of willful blindness to human nature, the human condition, and human abilities.</p>
<p>The kinds of judgment that need to be employed in regard to valuative matters, and the kind of intellectual sensibility that enables people to see that judgment <italic>is what is needed</italic> can be cultivated by humane studies in ways that are just not features of other kinds of inquiry and learning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1474022212441771">4</xref></sup> Coming to see the fact that a judgment’s not being scientific is not automatically a basis for concluding that it is laden with subjectivity or bias is itself a significant step in education. That recognition can also be a step by which people become willing and able to take responsibility <italic>for</italic> their judgments rather than regarding them as merely expressions of preference or feeling. Humanistic education can help us see how there is extensive scope (and need) for rational thought and judgment that is unsusceptible to theoretical elaboration. Too often, when the humanities get caught up in envy of the sciences, it seems to reflect a loss of faith in the genuineness and significance of humane learning.</p>
<p>This is not to say that humanistic studies always or necessarily cultivate virtue. It is painfully plain that they do not reliably have that effect. Still, they can develop capacities for articulate reflection and reasoning regarding values and they can enable people to more fully recognize and understand the different kinds of value that there are. That is a key feature of the humanities and the basis for much of their importance. In humanistic inquiry and learning, the study of people’s conceptions of worth, significance, and meaning can be a crucial resource for our own thought and reflection regarding worth, significance, and meaning. As remarked above, we can learn to <italic>think about</italic> them and not just learn what others have <italic>thought about</italic> them. One answer to the question ‘What good are the arts and humanities?’ is that they can educate people to think about just such matters in informed, illuminating, and discriminating ways. They are an exploration – even if indirect – of intrinsic value. They can be an exploration of what is valuable for its own sake. It is hard to imagine anything more practically significant than that.</p>
<p>The notion that the arts and humanities have no practical import, that they are ‘academic’ in a pejorative sense or that they are a charming cultural accessory but not part of ‘real’ life is symptomatic of an intellectually and imaginatively starved notion of practice and ‘real’ life. All of the most significant (and contested) questions concerning what is worth doing, what should be our most fundamental commitments and guiding concerns, what values should shape political institutions, what are worthy aspirations, what are gratifying attainments, and so forth are exactly the sorts of questions humanistic study can help us formulate and address in illuminating ways. It is true that typically the humanities do not train people in directly applicable technical skills or specialized information. But other kinds of comprehension, perception, and attention, which they <italic>do</italic> teach, are vital to reasonable, critically alert, intellectually plausible and responsible thought and judgment concerning values. Study in the humanities can educate people in ways that cultivate abilities for those.</p>
<p>Again, this does not presuppose that there is one best way to lead a life or just one correct conception of values. The more alert, informed, and educated one’s imagination, the more resources one has to rely upon in valuative judgment – resources other than ideology and fantasy. Moreover, it is just incorrect to think that aspiring to objectivity or truth about values implies a dogmatic disposition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1474022212441771">5</xref></sup> In fact, taking the possibility of objectivity seriously is an excellent reason for thinking that one’s understanding is <italic>of course</italic> only partial, fragmentary, and not fully adequate to the complex issues of human lives. The objectivity of values comports best with a disposition combining intellectual aspiration and intellectual humility, a disposition shaped and sustained by the acknowledgment of the incompleteness of our understanding, of the care and attention needed to enlarge it, and of the myriad possibilities for error, blindness, self-deception, rationalization, and so forth.</p>
<p>Our lives and circumstances can always confront us with challenges requiring new thought and sharper discernment regarding courage or fairness, for example, and also how they are related to each other and to other values (such as loyalty, friendship, and honesty). Whether or not one maintains that there are objective values, it would be hugely implausible to suppose that one’s understanding and judgment concerning values is fully adequate, needing no further growth, depth or refinement. (I will have more to say about this below.)</p>
<p>In claiming that there is non-scientific knowledge and that humanistic studies can aid in the attainment of it I am not also claiming that there is no role for theory in the humanities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1474022212441771">6</xref></sup> Theories can be illuminating, explanatorily fecund, and can help organize thought in highly important ways. Theories can order vast numbers of phenomena in ways that exhibit their intelligibility, and theories can provide us with measures and methods for intellectual endeavor, enabling us to go on and to make connections in ways otherwise not available to us. But it is a mistake to suppose that the proper aspiration of the humanities is to achieve theoretical elaboration, and it is a mistake to think that only those parts of humanistic inquiry and reflection that are most susceptible to theoretical organization are candidates for knowledge. There are respects in which theories can be powerful resources <italic>for</italic> thought without being the primary concern or objects <italic>of</italic> thought. Theories can draw attention to phenomena and issues in focused, helpful ways but the phenomena and the issues are the primary objects of concern. Of course, there are <italic>true</italic> theories, and in that sense theories illuminate and explain reality. And we can also use the term ‘theory’ in a wide manner, without insisting that if T is a theory of something, T must exhibit a complete set of certain formal features and must be employed in a certain rigorously defined manner. (We can sensibly speak of ‘Hume’s moral theory’ without the sorts of commitments we would have in mind when speaking of a theory of celestial motion.) Moreover, there are fascinating and important ways to study theories – much philosophy consists of just that – but again, it is the intelligibility of reality that is the primary concern. Knowledge of a theory can help highlight certain phenomena and bring to our attention facts and factors we would otherwise have missed. But we should guard against rewarding the theory with more power or significance than it has earned.</p>
<p>In the humanities there is to some extent an unhappy tendency for scholars to substitute theory for thought, and that is one pathway to ideological brittleness and dogmatism. Being too tightly in the grip of a theory can blind us to the implausibility of claims, if faithfulness to theory replaces responsiveness to reality. Humanistic education can cultivate the capacities of mind and imagination needed to keep attention directed at its proper objects, and can help us to be less susceptible to an idolatry of theory on the one hand, and thoughtless or cynical skepticism on the other.</p>
<p>If humanistic studies are not undertaken with a view to attaining knowledge in the form of scientific knowledge or, alternatively, not informed by ‘theory’ in the form of a specific political agenda (purporting to thereby make the humanities practical in an important way), that does not render them marooned in a sea of subjectivism. Those are not the only alternatives.</p>
<p>How scientific is the deepest, most compelling thought concerning say, benevolence, gratitude, friendship, cruelty, callousness or human dignity? Even if there are scientific accounts of how human beings have come to have certain kinds of sensibility and concern, and accounts of the physiology, psychology, and neuroscience of them, that would still not be an account of how those attitudes, commitments, and feelings properly figure in our lives. Various psychological inquiries – sometimes involving multiple theoretical and methodological approaches – tell us a great deal of the first importance about human nature. Nonetheless, ethical life, however naturalistic its conditions, involves distinctive concepts, reasons and judgments which merit reflection in their own terms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1474022212441771">7</xref></sup> Indeed, articulating those terms is what a great deal of moral life (and life overall) is about. The psychological knowledge, though it can inform and guide ethical thought, is not a substitute for it.</p>
<p>One mark of humanistic understanding’s resistance to theoretical formulation is that it cannot be straightforwardly transmitted as a body of (more or less settled) knowledge in the manner of various sciences. Much of the most important education facilitated by humanistic study is not the teaching of certain values and perspectives, not the teaching of <italic>doctrine</italic> in a formal sense, but the training and development of abilities, modes of awareness, and articulateness with a vocabulary of value and meaning. (This is not just semantic meaning but meaningfulness or significance in a broader sense.) This involves a complex intersection of being informed (by literature, history, the study of the arts, and of religion, and languages) and testing and extending the imagination.</p>
<p>In this context imagination has nothing to do with fantasy or ‘making things up’. Here imagination has mainly to do with comprehension of reality rather than fashioning unreal conceptions. Valuative thought and judgment often depend upon how sensibility and intellectual perception are oriented and informed. That is crucial to elevating valuative thought above the level of merely expressing feelings and unconsidered reaction. Humanistic education can help us avoid confusing values and ideals on the one hand, with fantasy and consoling illusion on the other. This is because there are significant respects in which the study of literature, art, religion, and philosophy – those things, which might seem to be among the clearest examples of cultural artifacts – inform us about what people and the world are actually like. Humanistic education can make accessible the textured content of an informal but substantive and illuminating anthropology. Humanistic studies can be windows on a great many features of human nature and what human beings are like, even when those studies do not aspire to achieve descriptive accounts measured for success by how many facts they report correctly. It is a fact that friendship can be a vitally important element of a good life. But it is not a fact ascertained and represented in anything like the way nutritional facts about bananas or facts about the tensile strength of a particular aluminum alloy are ascertained and represented. Again, biological and psychological research can help us understand features of our nature and our behaviors. Yet they do not exhaustively explain what is important about human nature, human action, and human relations.</p>
<p><italic>Both</italic> scientific understanding and humanistic understanding are explanatory. The differences are in the different kinds of explanatoriness involved. There is knowledge that is mainly a matter of penetrating comprehension, rather than explanatory integration of strongly confirmed propositions, principles supporting them and their implications. With regard to courage or betrayal or admiration, our knowledge consists in a textured comprehension of what forms they can take, how we can or should respond to them, and what sort of significance they, in all of their open-ended complexity, can have.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1474022212441771"><title>II</title>
<p>What has specialization to do with these points? There is specialization in scholarship and specialization in curriculum. One of the dangers of each type of specialization is that it can lead to seeing too many things in too few terms. It can motivate a reductionist tendency aggravated by inattention to the significance of other phenomena and other approaches. It can lead to thinking that many more phenomena are adequately explained by the theory than in fact <italic>are</italic> explained by it. A kind of explanatory imperialism can combine forces with reductionism. A reductionist tendency, aggravated by explanatory imperialism, renders us insufficiently alive to other, possibly relevant explanatory approaches and methods, and to other, possibly relevant levels of description and explanation.</p>
<p>The recognition that different topical areas may require different explanatory vocabularies and that there may not be one level of description and explanation to which many others are reducible is an important attainment. It can help us avoid becoming overly attached to a certain perspective or a specific conceptual scheme. It is understandable that a scholar in a particular discipline should tend to understand many other sorts of matters through the terms and methods of one’s discipline or the theory to which one is most committed. Nonetheless, it can also be an error to do so, even if understandable as a way of making the unfamiliar accessible. Often, it would be better to just acknowledge one’s lack of expertise and perhaps be willing to learn a conceptual idiom irreducible to, or different from, one’s intellectual ‘home base’.</p>
<p>Another danger of exaggerating the explanatory power of a specialization is that <italic>thought</italic> can become more and more a contest of theories, or a battle of vocabularies, intensifying the temptation to substitute <italic>theory</italic> for <italic>thinking</italic>. Comfort with a theory and confidence in it can turn the project of intellectual engagement with the phenomena into a contest of theories about them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1474022212441771">8</xref></sup> A lack of humility concerning the power or scope of one’s preferred theory can lead to stubborn, needless misrepresentation of phenomena and the unwillingness to hear or even pay attention to discordant (i.e. other) voices.</p>
<p>To be sure, a virtue of specialization is that it can introduce the inquirer into the depth, detail, and complex relations in the subject of inquiry. It can lead the inquirer to recognize the difference between knowing a great deal <italic>about</italic> something and genuinely understanding it. Specialization can cultivate a high level of intellectual conscientiousness and habits of attention to precision and clarity. In those respects it can be very much in the service of intellectual responsibility.</p>
<p>However, another risk that often accompanies specialization, especially when accompanied by some of the features of professionalization that have been increasingly pronounced in recent decades, is that scholars and students become focused on smaller and smaller spheres of concern, isolating thinkers and their studies. Scholars can become more oriented to speaking to, and listening to, only those with closely related specializations. It can seem not very important to be intelligible to others besides a specialized constituency. This risks contracting one’s scholarly horizon and, with it, one’s sense of scholarly responsibility. One might not much care if one’s work is intelligible to those outside the particular specialization. One might not much care whether one’s work and even one’s teaching contribute to any sort of shared intellectual culture. This is not inevitable but there is little doubt that it occurs. Specialization can motivate over-extended explanatory claims at the same time that it can isolate one from other scholars and subjects. There are dangers from both directions.</p>
<p>When there is little of shared intellectual culture there is likely to be little shared sense of intellectual obligation in respect of thinking it important that one’s work should have a recognizable significance beyond the interests of specialists. It is worth asking whether there is much of a common scholarly ethic besides norms of professionalization. Is there a shared understanding of responsibilities one has on account of leading the life of a teacher/scholar on a college or university faculty? There is a good deal of discussion of academic freedom but not so much discussion of academic responsibilities except in the mode of Faculty Handbook treatments concerning promotion, tenure, and grounds for dismissal. It seems that there is often little ongoing conversation about the obligations and concerns unique to the life of the scholar/teacher, conversation that actually resonates with faculty members in ways that meaningfully concern their self-conceptions and the institutional self-conceptions of the places where they work.</p>
<p>One unhappy result is that scholars in the humanities become less able to explain why it is important to do the scholarship they do and teach what they teach. The perception that their work is unimportant is easily reinforced when an effective response, explaining to others the <italic>need</italic> for humanistic study and learning, is lacking. The absence of a shared sense of intellectual obligation and its significance is not an inevitable result of specialization. It is a vice of <italic>certain ways</italic> of specializing. One of them involves giving an exaggerated role to theory. Much humanistic study is not formulated in the language and structure of theory, and it should not be. Some of the most important thinking is without theory, and this is not confined to artistic and literary creation.</p>
<p>It is true also of the understanding of many significant matters. If we think that unless some matter is theoretically articulated it is either unimportant or purely subjective or cannot constitute anything counting as genuine understanding, we will thereby relegate valuative judgment to second-class intellectual citizenship. It would be tantamount to maintaining that there really isn’t any genuine valuative thought and understanding. Perhaps one believes there isn’t any. Still, that needs <italic>showing</italic>; it is not at all obvious. (Indeed, my view is that it is not obvious <italic>and</italic> that it is also not true.) To engage in articulate argument about any matter, argument that might <italic>lead</italic> somewhere rather than just recording disagreement, requires a measure of fluency with concepts and issues of the kind studied in the humanities. It requires a measure of understanding of various sorts of reasons and considerations that are distinct from those of primary concern in most scientific inquiries. In any case, questions about how to place scientific understanding in our lives, and questions about whether and why it is worth pursuing, are not themselves scientific questions. Nothing recognizable as a science in the strict sense <italic>could</italic> count as addressing them adequately or conclusively. As indicated at the outset, there are important kinds of non-scientific and non-theoretical thought.</p>
<p>Some kinds of understanding may use theory as a resource and an instrument, though they are not themselves types of specialized, theoretical knowledge. There are interesting employments of various types of theories in the study of literature and religion, for example. But the kind of comprehension that the study of literature or the study of religion issues in depends upon perception, receptivity, and judgment that cannot be theoretically regimented. The most important insights, conceptions, and ways of relating phenomena and of appreciating their significance in such study deepen our knowledge of human beings in ways that are evidently important both for their intrinsic interest and for the ways they make the human world intelligible.</p>
<p>The core of the case for the humanities is not just that each generation should have its turn at reading Homer or Kant or studying Gauguin’s life and works, in case they can afford the leisure to do so and they find it interesting and diverting. Rather, such study is where we encounter much of the most important evidence regarding human nature, the human condition, and human capability. Humanistic studies introduce us to the evidence, the inquiries, and the conceptions that enable us to engage in moral thought and to think knowingly about the multiple kinds of value that there are. Both their more and their less specialized forms of study have important places in a society’s intellectual culture. That is not just a culture for the intellectuals. By ‘intellectual culture’ I mean (among other things) the ways in which people in a society are (or are not) able to think, reason, and engage each other concerning valuative matters. There is a vital place for the humanities if we want or hope that ours will be a culture in which thinking, reasoning, and rational engagement guide valuative judgment, rather than force, ideology, and manipulation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1474022212441771"><title>III</title>
<p>In part because of the successes of the various sciences, many people hold that all knowledge is scientific knowledge, that the sciences can, at least in principle, attain all of the knowledge that is attainable. This view motivates one or another form of skepticism or subjectivism about valuative matters, the notion that worth, meaning, and significance are projected onto things or are merely matters of affect or sensibility. Value, in that view, is a matter of <italic>valuing</italic>; values are not discerned, recognized as features of agents, actions or situations needing to be understood. Instead, the view is that the world is valuatively neutral or vacuous and that subjectivity alone introduces value as a kind of ‘laminate’. Of course, there are sophisticated views maintaining that, though there are no objective values, value judgments are not simply mindless responses or such that ‘anything goes’. The crucial issue is not ‘objectivity vs. subjectivity’ but whether various kinds of valuative judgment are reasoned or unreasoned; whether they involve comprehension or just expression. If the latter is the case, one might wonder about the point of humanistic studies and whether judgments of value and valuative commitments are supportable by reasons, comprehension, and reasoning.</p>
<p>We should consider whether there is such a thing as sound judgment about the differences between living well and living badly, and what are the marks of that judgment and the grounds for it. We should consider whether we expect the sciences to not only enlarge knowledge but also impart wisdom about how to live, what to be committed to, and what to stand for. Is that expectation a consoling illusion or, in some respects, a flight from moral and intellectual responsibility?</p>
<p>Think about the ways in which the study of literature and philosophy can transform a person’s conception of desire or friendship or loss or happiness and the ways they can influence perception and perspective. Consider the ways in which music, art, and the study of languages can help orient and revise people’s conceptions of the goods important to a well-led life. Study in the humanities can constitute, in effect, an informal, but deep anthropology, illuminating (among other things) differences between a good time and a good life. And such an anthropology, in a broad, deep sense, underlies and supports (or fails to support) normative judgment and whether it is sound and morally sane and decent.</p>
<p>Our reflections may lead us to the conclusion that there is indeed much to be gained from humanistic scholarship and education. At the same time, it is heartbreakingly obvious that cultured, educated people, people with very considerable liberal education, can be moral monsters and examples of almost nothing good, and even remorseless, and seemingly incapable of moral self-correction. The ‘problem’ is not that there is a moral shortcoming in the humanities. No kind of study on its own will make people good. However, it would be an error to conclude that if the humanities don’t ‘make’ people virtuous, they have no significant role in regard to moral life. (I am using ‘moral’ very broadly, to refer to numerous valuative aspects of human action and life.)</p>
<p>Study in the humanities can enable people to become much more realistically informed about human nature, aspiration, desire, the passions, deep sources of concern, kinds of grief and suffering, and ways of coming to grips with them. In that way, study in the humanities can facilitate self-knowledge and more realistic and plausible expectations of others. This does not happen in measurable units, course by course in general education, as though the books or the courses were ‘virtue vitamins’. Indeed, the sort of ‘drive-by’ acquaintance supplied by many liberal arts curricula can actually bring the subjects and the works into contempt. They can be made to seem like little more than props for affectation or a stock of references for certifying that one is ‘cultured’. There is a much more serious issue of whether the humanities ‘do any good’.</p>
<p>My argument throughout has been that there is a kind of good that can be very considerable indeed and that the humanities are a uniquely rich source of possibility for good. The good in question has to do with informed, mature fluency with valuative matters. Whether that possibility is realized in sane and decent ways depends upon many things beside what courses one takes or the articles one publishes. But why would anyone <italic>plausibly</italic> expect the humanities on their own to make people good? That expectation reflects a failure of understanding regarding human beings. If we look at the humanities in an unrealistically instrumental way we will blame them for sins and errors not properly attributable to them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1474022212441771">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>At their best, the humanities can help to educate people in a healthy combination of intellectually humble skepticism <italic>and</italic> commitment. They can teach skepticism by educating us in how difficult and complicated it can be to make judgments with warranted confidence. They can encourage commitment by enlarging and deepening the resources with which to make judgments, making us more capable and better oriented and aware of what needs to be taken into account and how and why things matter.</p>
<p>Whether humane learning and study will have those salutary effects cannot be determined by a syllabus or a curriculum. It involves an ongoing, complex exercise of decision-making, choosing, reflection, revision, and commitment-making in the course of leading a life. However, humanistic studies can be significant resources enabling people to engage the world in a manner that is much more alert to various kinds of significance, value, and meaning. Though the humanities cannot ‘make’ people virtuous they can help them understand how to think about values. They can be a resource for moral agency though they cannot, on their own, direct it.</p>
<p>Education in the humanities can help prepare people for a social world in which there is considerable diversity, several types of friction, and numerous disputed political and moral matters. The attitudes and dispositions needed to live with all that without widespread alienation, distrust, and cynicism are girded and sustained by moral imagination, a responsive but not volatile sensibility, and a willingness to seek reasonableness rather than victory in many matters of valuative controversy. Too often, in controversies concerning valuative matters adjectives are substituted for arguments. If we are to do better than demonizing, invective, and cynicism we will need to be educated to do better. That is not a magical solution nor a swift and easy one. Education in the humanities is not a matter of acquaintance with surface features and there aren’t discrete units of humanistic knowledge. Real education in the humanities requires time, depth, retracings, making departures, and recognizing continuities. However, the gains from it can be enduring and deep, and can extend into all departments of life. Education in the humanities can be the most relevant education of all, the sorts of judgment and insight it facilitates being ‘at home’ everywhere except those places where valuative judgment is not welcome. Sometimes a technical question is just a technical question; and sometimes a factual question is just a factual question. Often, each is more than that and when valuative judgment is not welcome it may be pertinent to ask why, and to expect an illuminating reply and not just condescending dismissal of the question.</p>
<p>These points about the humanities are especially important in a liberal polity. A key element of the rationale for the liberal order is that it permits people greater rather than lesser scope for thought and action concerning what makes for a well-led life. It permits and protects wide scope for individuals to act on their own judgments of good. I have not argued that humanistic research positions its practitioners to be moral experts. Nor would I argue that humanistic education inculcates virtue or qualifies its students to occupy roles and to have responsibilities requiring the making of important judgments and decisions concerning values. It is certainly not part of my view that professors in the humanities have a special responsibility to impart values to their students and advisees.</p>
<p>There is a vitally important difference between claiming that the humanities can educate people in ways that might enable them to attain levels of conceptual clarity, focused, articulate reflection, and alertness to diverse kinds of value, and claiming that as an ‘institution’ the humanities have a special responsibility to encourage virtue and direct people rightly regarding it. Actually, far too often, teaching in the humanities is blemished with projects of psycho-political therapy and competitive-culture. It would be better, I believe, for education to bring into relief the ways in which valuative matters can be formulated and the ways in which they have been addressed without that project serving a particular valuative agenda. This is not a plea for utter value-neutrality. Overemphasis on neutrality can become problematic in its own right, giving the false impression that, after all, values really are ultimately little more than preferences or that being objective means being neutral (which is not true).</p>
<p>Many important issues concerning the relations between education and values cannot be taken up in the scope of the present article. I hope to have at least encouraged willingness to consider the value of humanistic scholarship and humanistic education in ways that are not limited to credentialing, learning-outcomes, and obvious or instrumental practical applications. A civil society in which there is room for different values and commitments, and which is complex, heterogeneous, and dynamic, does not just ‘happen’. While it is true that a broadly liberal political order is needed to make it possible, civil society is not a creation of the state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1474022212441771">10</xref></sup> Civil society and a political order that preserves and protects individual liberties can be mutually reinforcing, and neither can be sustained without the other. Each will wither and become susceptible to being counterfeited, without the other. Education can make a significant difference to what members of a society value and to what sorts of freedom matter to them and why. The differences are real – and are recognizably real – even if not measurable in units or convertible to one standard.</p>
<p>Perhaps the main upshot of my remarks is that the most practical point of humanistic learning is that it can be a crucial element of an education for freedom, for leading lives of thoughtful self-determination. These are lives of persons alert to the complex texture of the natural and social worlds and willing to take responsibility for the valuative judgments that inform their actions and shape their characters. That involves having a <italic>view</italic> – a reasoned conception – and that involves thinking through what has significance, and not just expressing how we feel. People can be educated to enable them to understand what kind of thinking is needed, and it is difficult in the extreme to see how that education could hope to succeed without the humanities.</p>

<fn id="fn1-1474022212441771"><label>1</label><p>None of what I say here about the sciences is intended to be critical of the intellectual enterprise of the sciences or scientific achievements in their own right. The sciences distinguish human beings in ways that reflect some of what is most remarkable and admirable about our nature. Moreover, we should, I believe, be enormously grateful for the achievements of the sciences, from antiquity to the present. However, there seems to be a widely held view, even among educated people, that scientific knowledge is the only genuine knowledge, or that matters not susceptible to scientific explanation are, by virtue of that, beyond the reach of reason or can be considered only subjectively. When the view is held dogmatically it is itself a very apt example of non-scientific, unreasoned subjectivism.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn2-1474022212441771"><label>2</label><p>When referring to science and the sciences, I have in mind the methods, approaches, and idiom of such inquiries as physics, chemistry, biology, neuroscience, empirical psychology, geology, astronomy, and also those parts of economics and the social sciences that seek to emulate and attain the rigor, precision, and form of the more mature, mathematically precise and empirically supported natural sciences.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn3-1474022212441771"><label>3</label><p>This is a controversial claim and a good deal of the history of philosophy, especially moral philosophy, has to do with whether it is true. Much of my own work over the last 25 years has concerned issues having to do with the objectivity of ethical considerations and whether there is such a thing as ethical knowledge. If the reader is unwilling to accept the claim that ‘there can be knowledge of valuative matters – not just knowledge of what people have <italic>thought</italic> about them’ without extensive argument for it, that would be quite reasonable. Still, I would urge the reader to consider whether in the absence of scientific knowledge of values we are confined to unreasoned preference or to feelings and attitudes concerning valuative matters. Are judgments involving values not susceptible to being (better or worse) supported or justified, and held in intellectually responsible versus irresponsible ways?</p></fn>
<fn id="fn4-1474022212441771"><label>4</label><p>Aristotle argued (in <italic>Nicomachean Ethics</italic>) that politics is the ‘master science’ of human good and Aristotle elaborated a great deal of political theory and also took empirical considerations very seriously in regard to this ‘master science’. At the same time, he was very clear in arguing that different subject-matters require different degrees of precision and methods of inquiry and elaboration. (See, for example, <italic>Posterior Analytics</italic> and Books One and Six of <italic>Nicomachean Ethics</italic>.) He did not think that politics or ethics shared the scientific form of, say, astronomy or physics. Aristotle was a very sophisticated methodological pluralist. For all that he said about politics being a science, his view involved marking important contrasts between ethics and politics on the one hand, and physics and astronomy on the other. Indeed, the view I sketch in the present article owes a great deal to Aristotle.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn5-1474022212441771"><label>5</label><p>The thought of several medieval philosophers is relevant to this point. Maimonides, for example, held that the proper perfection of a human being is intellectual perfection; that the most complete realization of human nature (and the way we can come closest to God) is intellectual activity, yet he also held that our comprehension is finite. His view combined intellectual <italic>aspiration</italic> and a rationalistic conception of the human <italic>telos</italic>, with intellectual <italic>humility</italic> in regard to the scope of our intellectual capability. This is discussed in Chapter 1 of my <italic>Law</italic>, <italic>Reason</italic>, <italic>and Morality in Medieval Jewish Philosophy</italic> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn6-1474022212441771"><label>6</label><p>There are respects in which psychoanalytic theory or feminist theory or structuralist theory or other theories can be highly illuminating and can enlarge our conceptual vocabulary in explanatorily constructive ways. Theories can direct attention in new ways and enable us to notice features and relations otherwise undetected. Moreover, the study of theories is itself often very valuable. Their histories, their conceptual content, their intellectual motivations – all of those are important topics of study in their own right. There is a danger, though, in becoming enamored with a theory in such a way that it becomes more important for the theory to ‘win’ than for our understanding to be enlarged and deepened. Over-reliance on theory sometimes results in a tendency to force phenomena to fit with a theory instead of considering more thoroughly and carefully why the phenomena might require explanatory resources not available in the preferred theory.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn7-1474022212441771"><label>7</label><p>Studies in several areas such as neuroscience, evolutionary biology, genetics, anthropology, and others undeniably have a bearing on our understanding of human propensities, susceptibilities, and behavior. However, finding that there is a physical or genetic basis for a tendency or a capability is not the same as a feature or a behavior being ‘purely physical’ or ‘genetically determined’. The actual phenomena are almost always vastly more complex than that, with several different kinds of causal factors at work. Even then there may not be reductive explanations or deterministic explanations. It is important to recognize the continued relevance and conceptual and explanatory significance of ethical thought, whatever discoveries we make in the various sciences. The notion that ethical thought can be safely replaced, or eliminated, by the results of the sciences is quite implausible. Ethical thought can be informed and enhanced by them without the information or enhancement taking over any of the tasks of ethical thought. The issues for it remain fully real and the need to address them in terms of ethical thought remains fully real. It is interesting to consider T. H. Huxley in this regard. He was a stout defender of evolution by natural selection. However, in his ‘Evolution and Ethics’ (1893) he argued that there is a crucial distinction between there being a naturalistic account of how human beings came to be the sorts of creatures for whom morality is possible, and an account of moral considerations. The latter involves moral thought and the use of moral concepts. Ethics is not derived from or assimilable into the evolutionary theory.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn8-1474022212441771"><label>8</label><p>In my own discipline (philosophy) the study of a major area (epistemology or ethics, philosophy of law or philosophy of science, etc.) often involves exploring different views and positions known by various ‘-isms’ (Positivism, Consequentialism, Realism, Intuitionism, and so forth). Developing some facility with these can be very helpful but one has to guard against students coming to think that philosophy is either a ‘menu’ of theories or a contest between ‘-isms’. It is important to remind students repeatedly that the problems, the issues, are the objects of study, not the ‘-isms’. The latter are objects of study in a secondary sense; they facilitate access to the problems and issues. They can be very helpful in attaining a fuller comprehension of the approaches to the issues and the purported resolutions of the problems. Nevertheless, one could have detailed, accurate acquaintance with a long list of ‘-isms’ and still have almost no philosophical understanding. The latter is achieved by considering the problems in ways that bring to light their intellectual motivations and their distinctive philosophical character.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn9-1474022212441771"><label>9</label><p>It is unfortunate that criticism of humanistic studies often seems to involve the complaint that they do not have practical value or that any good that might be claimed for them does not seem very clearly discernible; after all, people with liberal arts educations are sometimes terrible people who do terrible things. How is it that the humanities improve anybody? Where is the evidence? If we are looking for evidence in the way we might look for evidence that vitamin C or folic acid does any good, we are looking in the wrong way. Hopefully, a liberal arts education would at least do some good in <italic>that</italic> respect, namely, helping us understand why that is <italic>not</italic> the relevant way to look for evidence. It is not a defect of the humanities that exposure to them or even immersion in them does not ‘make people good’. Why should we think that they <italic>would</italic> make people good? ‘Make’ is a strong term indicating a strong causal relation. There isn’t some one thing that makes people good in a reliable, universal, direct way. Several different kinds of factors are involved with whether a person acquires virtues or acquires vices. The main point of my discussion is that there are significant kinds of understanding, and especially understanding value, which are developed by the humanities in ways unique to them. That is not to say that without a humanistic education one could not have that kind of understanding. It is to say that humanistic education can contribute to it and develop it in ways that other studies do not. Moreover, part of that understanding is the recognition that some of the most important things we think about and do, and some the most important kinds of decisions we need to make, are matters of <italic>judgment</italic>. The judgments cannot be regimented, codified or exhaustively elaborated, once for all. For instance, it is a general principle that we should strive to be fair; however, ascertaining what fairness requires in a given set of circumstances may involve careful consideration of several kinds of factors. The significance of judgment and its resistance to codification are two of the reasons that undertakings such as ‘learning-outcomes’ assessment for liberal arts education are so difficult and, in some ways, unhelpful. The sorts of judgment relevant here are developed, tested, and revised over the course of a life, in unexpected ways, in complicated circumstances, and in all manner of contexts. Possession of them is not demonstrated by scoring well on a 300-question short-answer exam about novels, philosophical theories, and works of art. We can tell, however, when they are lacking and when we wish people had those kinds of judgment. Evidence of their absence and their corruption is often abundantly clear. There are ways in which certain kinds of understanding and modes of awareness cultivated by the humanities make real differences to what sorts of judgments people are able to make. However, it is very difficult to see what could count as an accurate, general approach to measuring that understanding and capability. In part, that is because what a person <italic>does</italic> with their learning is the crucial thing. A curriculum can help direct attention, stimulate interest, disclose possibilities, and so forth. It can encourage, enable, and engage; but the individual’s intellectual and moral agency is where the chief responsibility lies.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn10-1474022212441771"><label>10</label><p>By a ‘liberal’ political order I mean one in which the rights and liberties of individuals are regarded as fundamentally important and are protected by the rule of law, and the state does not impose or enforce some specific, comprehensive conception of a well-led life. In a liberal political order the rule of law reflects norms and values that are widely endorsed while accommodating value-pluralism and permitting wide scope with respect to the voluntary pursuit of ends and interests.</p></fn></fn-group></notes>
