<abstract>
<p>The uninsured fare worse than the insured on various measures, yet there is little evidence regarding trends in care for the uninsured and disparities by insurance status. Given changes in the health care system and the safety net, disparities between insured and uninsured populations may be changing over time. This article considers trends in access, chronic disease control, and heart attack care by insurance status and the disparity in these measures between uninsured and insured nonelderly adults, controlling for demographic characteristics to account for potential changes in the composition of these populations. Rates for the uninsured for all outcomes have generally been stable from the mid-1990s to mid-2000s, with fluctuation in some measures over shorter periods. In addition, there is a persistent disparity between the privately insured and uninsured on access measures. The gap between the uninsured and insured has not narrowed, though disparities generally have not worsened either.</p>

<body>
<p>Approximately 50 million individuals in the United States were without health insurance coverage in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558711418519">DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, &amp; Smith, 2010</xref>). While the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 aims to expand coverage, even after implementation a substantial number of individuals may remain uninsured; those who are newly insured may still rely heavily on the safety net; and the cost pressures faced by many safety net providers are likely to remain and possibly worsen. While studies have documented disparities in health care received by the insured and uninsured, there is little evidence regarding how care for the uninsured or the gap between the insured and uninsured has been changing over time. Considering how care for the uninsured has changed over recent years provides evidence of whether the system has maintained a minimal level of care for this population. Furthermore, disparities between the uninsured and insured may change even if care for the uninsured is not declining in an absolute sense. As policy makers work to implement the largest expansion of the health care safety net in decades, questions about health care for underserved populations will be central to the decisions they make.</p>
<p>There is a large body of evidence indicating that individuals without insurance are less likely to receive care and that they experience worse health outcomes than insured individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558711418519">Institute of Medicine, 2001</xref>). Uninsured adults are less likely to be able to access care, including preventive care and chronic disease maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558711418519">Ayanian, Weissman, Schneider, Ginsburg, &amp; Zaslavsky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558711418519">Wilper et al., 2008</xref>), and are less likely to receive high-tech and possibly high-value care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558711418519">Glied &amp; Little, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558711418519">Thorpe &amp; Howard, 2003</xref>) than insured adults. In addition, there is evidence that rising health care costs, resulting increases in the number of uninsured, and increasing levels of competition in health care markets have led to mounting pressure on the safety net. Even before the start of the recession in 2007-2008, demand for safety net care was increasing and public budgets were strained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558711418519">Hadley, Cravens, Coughlin, &amp; Holahan, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the large literature on disparities between the insured and uninsured at a point in time and the evidence of strain on the safety net, there is a lack of evidence regarding how care for the uninsured and disparities by insurance status have been changing over time. This article considers trends for three measures for which there is evidence of disparities or potential disparities by insurance status at a point in time: receipt of needed care, control of chronic diseases, and acute care post–heart attack. Access measures are widely considered in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558711418519">Herring, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558711418519">Institute of Medicine, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558711418519">2009</xref>), though little is known about trends in access and access disparities among the uninsured. Uninsured chronic disease patients have greater difficulty accessing care than their insured counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558711418519">Wilper et al., 2008</xref>), and chronic disease control measures provide an objective measure of health among a subset of the population for which health insurance coverage is likely to be particularly important. Invasive care after heart attack represents how likely patients are to receive high-cost, high-tech care in an area where medical technology has led to significant health benefits relative to the cost for the population as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558711418519">Cutler &amp; McClellan, 2001</xref>). While it may seem less obvious that insurance status could affect care in an emergent situation such as a heart attack, evidence suggests differences in heart attack care by insurance status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558711418519">Canto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558711418519">Glied &amp; Little, 2003</xref>). Taken together, trends in these outcome measures indicate how care for this population has been changing over the decade from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s both in absolute terms and relative to the insured.</p>

<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>Existing work has considered trends in racial and ethnic health disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558711418519">Lê Cook, McGuire, &amp; Zuvekas, 2009</xref>) but has not looked at changes in disparities by insurance status, though different factors may drive these different disparities. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) National Healthcare Disparities Report has considered trends by insurance status but without adjusting for key demographic characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558711418519">AHRQ, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, existing work focuses primarily on access to care and little research considers other measures of quality or health outcomes. This work expands on the existing literature by considering trends for the uninsured and disparities by insurance status for outcomes in three domains and adjusting for key demographic characteristics.</p>

<title>Data and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1077558711418519">
<title>Data</title>
<p>Data on access to care, care for chronic disease, and treatment after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) come from three different data sets. We limited our samples to adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years, since programs and resources for uninsured children are different from those available to adults, and because those aged 65 years and older are covered by Medicare. We exclude those younger than 65 years who are covered by Medicare or military insurance. Our final samples consist of nonelderly adults who are uninsured or who are covered by private insurance or Medicaid.</p>
<p>Data from all five available waves of the Community Tracking Study (CTS) Household Survey—1996-1997, 1998-1999, 2000-2001, 2003, and 2007—are used to assess changes in access to care. Observations from the 60-site sample for the first four rounds and the single national sample for 2007 are treated as one pooled sample since the sampling strategy and weights are consistent across the first four rounds for this sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558711418519">Center for Studying Health System Change, 2005</xref>). Two main measures of access are used: (a) forgoing care, defined as whether an individual reports not receiving medical care he or she believed was necessary (<italic>N</italic> = 138,270) and (b) forgoing or delaying care, defined as whether an individual either forgoes or postpones necessary care (<italic>N</italic> = 138,256). Measures such as these are typically used to quantify access to care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558711418519">Berk, Schur, &amp; Cantor, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558711418519">Cunningham &amp; Kemper, 1998</xref>). Insurance is defined according to reported coverage source at the time of the survey. Relevant covariates include age, sex, race, marital status, and income. In alternate models, self-reported health is also included.</p>
<p>Data from four waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1999 and 2006 are used to consider changes in chronic disease management. The NHANES includes information on self-reported health insurance status and health care, as well as a rich set of health status variables, collected through survey, physical examination, and laboratory testing, which are used to assess trends in control of chronic disease. The population of interest consists of individuals who have either diagnosed (based on self-report) or undiagnosed (based on relevant clinical testing) hypertension, diabetes, or coronary heart disease (CHD). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558711418519">McWilliams, Meara, Zaslavsky, and Ayanian (2009)</xref>, we use both self-reported diagnoses and clinical measures to consistently assess disease control across all prevalent cases. Like them, we define individuals with hypertension as those who report taking antihypertensive medication or who have an average systolic blood pressure (BP) greater than or equal to 150 mmHg or average diastolic BP greater than or equal to 95 mmHg (<italic>N</italic> = 3,171), where the BP measures were based on the averages of one to four readings taken during a single examination session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558711418519">National Center for Health Statistics, 2003</xref>); individuals with diabetes as those with a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes or borderline diabetes or HbA1c level greater than 7% (<italic>N</italic> = 2,206); and individuals with CHD as those with a self-reported diagnosis of CHD, myocardial infarction, or angina (<italic>N</italic> = 2,540).</p>
<p>Outcomes of interest include binary measures of BP control among hypertensives, glycemic control among diabetics, and cholesterol control among individuals with CHD, diabetes, or a history of stroke. BP control is defined as systolic BP less than 140 mmHg and diastolic BP less than 90 mmHg. Glycemic control is defined as HbA1c less than 7. Cholesterol control is defined as total cholesterol less than 200 mg/dL. Insurance is defined according to reported coverage source at the time of the survey. Relevant covariates in the NHANES include age, sex, race, marital status, and household income.</p>
<p>Annual data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) for 1996-2006 are used to consider trends in treatment for AMI. The NHDS collects information for an annual sample of inpatient records from a national sample of hospitals, including basic demographics, information on expected sources of payment, and data on diagnoses and procedures. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558711418519">Glied and Little (2003)</xref>, we consider individuals with a diagnosis code of AMI (ICD-9-CM Code 410) and look at the use of invasive cardiac procedures, including <italic>coronary artery bypass graft</italic> (ICD-9-CM Codes 36.10-36.19) or <italic>percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty</italic> (ICD-9-CM Codes 36.01-36.09; <italic>N</italic> = 24,323). We also conduct sensitivity analyses including only patients whose length of stay was 3 days or more (<italic>N</italic> = 15,580), since patients with shorter stays may have been miscoded as AMIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558711418519">Bundorf et al., 2004</xref>). Insurance status is defined according to expected source of payment for the hospital visit. Analyses control for age, sex, race, and marital status.</p>

<sec id="section4-1077558711418519">
<title>Empirical Approach</title>
<p>We summarize the demographic characteristics for the study period using the CTS data. The means and proportions for each of the three insurance groups of interest were calculated from the CTS pooled across years and by year, and we conducted <italic>t</italic> tests of year-to-year changes in demographics to understand how the privately insured, Medicaid, and uninsured adult populations are changing over this period.</p>
<p>To address the questions of how care for the uninsured is changing and how differences in care by insurance status are changing over time, we estimated separate probit regression models for each of the binary access, chronic disease control, or utilization outcomes for the sample of uninsured, Medicaid, and privately insured individuals. The analysis unit of each regression model is the individual.</p>
<p>Models include individual covariates and time-period dummy variables, as well as dummies for insurance status, and interactions between time period and insurance coverage. We also tested models with continuous time trends, though they did not fit the data as well as the models with categorical time variables presented here. All models are weighted. We used the sampling weights for the CTS and NHANES data that were calculated to account for strata and primary sampling units as well as individual weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558711418519">National Center for Health Statistics, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558711418519">Strouse, Carlson, Hall, &amp; Cybulski, 2009</xref>). In analyses involving the NHDS data, we used frequency weights as these are the only available weights. To illustrate trends in care and disparities by insurance status, we have to test the marginal effects of the interacted terms in the probit models, which cannot be properly tested using the model coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558711418519">Ai &amp; Norton, 2003</xref>). We use the method of “recycled predictions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558711418519">Korn &amp; Graubard, 1999</xref>) to calculate the predicted probability of each outcome for each year based on the regression results under three hypothetical scenarios: (a) that all individuals in the sample are uninsured, (b) that all are enrolled in Medicaid, and (c) that all are privately insured. That is, for each year and for each of the three insurance categories (uninsured, Medicaid, and privately insured) the indicators for the given year and insurance category are fixed at 1, and the original values for all other covariates are used to generate predicted probabilities based on the regression results. The predictions are then averaged over the entire sample. For each outcome we estimated the disparities or gaps between insurance groups as the differences in the predicted probabilities between the uninsured and each of the insured groups within each year, and then we estimated the change in disparities over the years as the difference in these gaps between the years. We constructed the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around each of these estimates using the bootstrap methodology (1,000 iterations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558711418519">Efron &amp; Tibshirani, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077558711418519">Mooney &amp; Duval, 1993</xref>). Finally, we tested for the statistical significance of the differences by testing for the inclusion of the zero in the corresponding CI.</p>
<p>One of the main concerns in attempting to accurately estimate trends in care for the uninsured is how changing populations of uninsured and insured over time affect changes in care received. We attempted to control for such changes by focusing on measures that incorporate potential demand for care, examining subpopulations for which underlying health status is likely to be similar over time, and including covariates that control for observable characteristics associated with health status and demand for care. Specifically, we control for observable individual characteristics that may be associated with health status, including age, sex, race, income, and marital status. While self-reported health is not included in baseline models since it is not available in all data sets, for models of access to care we estimated alternative specifications that include self-reported general health.</p>

Nominal family income increases each year for the privately insured, though increases are smaller and less consistent among the uninsured and Medicaid samples.

Regression results indicate that older individuals, males, and Hispanics are significantly less likely to report forgoing or delaying care (detailed appendix tables with regression results are available from the lead author on request). There are statistically significant gaps in access measures between the uninsured and both the Medicaid and privately insured populations that persist over this period. Considering the predicted probabilities at baseline, those with private insurance and Medicaid are approximately 9.1 (95% CI = −10.3 to −7.8) and 3.6 (95% CI = −5.8 to −1.2) percentage points less likely to report forgoing necessary care and 13.2 (95% CI = −15.0 to −11.5) and 4.3 (95% CI = −7.7 to −0.4) percentage points less likely to report forgoing or delaying necessary care, respectively, than those without any insurance coverage.

<p>Considering glycemic (HbA1c) control, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1077558711418519">Figure 3</xref>, we see that those with private insurance are approximately 14.5 (95% CI = −28.5 to −0.7) percentage points less likely to have controlled HbA1c levels at baseline than those without any insurance coverage, while there is no significant difference between the Medicaid and uninsured groups, with a difference of −15.7 (95% CI =, −32.5 to 3.1) percentage points between the groups. Glycemic control is increasing between the beginning and end of the period for the privately insured and Medicaid populations, while control among the uninsured shows no improvement. While the uninsured have significantly better glycemic control than the privately insured at the beginning of the period, this difference disappears by the end of the period since the uninsured do not experience the same improvement as the privately insured.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1077558711418519">Figure 4</xref> depicts changes in BP control among hypertensives. There is a consistent increase in the rate of BP control among the uninsured, while rates of control among both insured groups do not change over the study period. At the beginning of the period, privately insured hypertensives are 29.8 (95% CI = 19.9 to 38.1) percentage points more likely to have controlled BP than uninsured hypertensives, while individuals in Medicaid are 21.5 (95% CI = 3.2 to 39.0) percentage points more likely to have controlled BP. At the end of the period, the predicted probabilities of BP control among the privately insured and Medicaid populations are not significantly different from the uninsured population, with differences of 9.4 (95% CI = −1.2 to 19.7) percentage points and 6.3 (95% CI = −8.1 to 21.4) percentage points, respectively.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1077558711418519">Figure 5</xref> illustrates that there are no significant differences between the predicted probabilities of cholesterol control among the uninsured and either insured group over most of the study period, though a gap between the uninsured and privately insured appears at the end of the period. The differences between the uninsured and those with private insurance and Medicaid are approximately 3.5 (95% CI = −11.6 to 17.0) percentage points and −12.9 (95% CI = −29.9 to 6.5) percentage points at baseline, respectively. While there is no significant difference between the uninsured and either insured group at baseline, a significant gap between the uninsured and privately insured groups materializes in 2006. The difference in the predicted probability of cholesterol control between the privately insured and uninsured populations increases to 14.1 (95% CI = 3.1 to 25.0) percentage points in 2006. The difference between the Medicaid and uninsured populations remains statistically insignificant—14.4 (95% CI = −1.5 to 32.6) percentage points.</p>
<p>To summarize, BP control is improving for the uninsured while trends in cholesterol and glycemic control are flat. The uninsured have significantly worse BP control than the insured at the beginning of the period, though this disparity narrows. In contrast, while there is no significant difference in cholesterol control between the uninsured and insured at baseline, a gap between the uninsured and privately insured groups materializes at the end of the period.</p>

<p>The last panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558711418519">Table 2</xref> describes trends in invasive care after AMI, which does not change significantly for the uninsured over the 1996-2006 period. Regression results indicate that individuals who are older, male, and White are more likely to receive invasive treatment after a heart attack. After controlling for these differences, there is no statistically significant difference in the probability that the uninsured and privately insured receive invasive care in any of the years considered. In contrast, the Medicaid population is significantly less likely than the privately insured to receive invasive care in most years. Results are similar when the sample is limited to those with a length of stay greater than 2 days. There is no statistically significant change in the gap between the uninsured and either insured sample between the first and last year. In short, both the gap between the uninsured and privately insured groups and trend in the gap over time are insignificant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Over the period from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s the uninsured in the United States faced not only a health care system with increasing resources and technological capabilities but also a strained safety net faced with increasing financial pressure and growing demand. The ACA will reduce the number of uninsured but many of those individuals who were previously uninsured as well as those who remain uninsured will continue to rely on safety net providers, and many of the issues of the 1990s and early 2000s will remain or even worsen given the recent recession and its effects. While the ACA aims to extend coverage substantially, how it will affect the disparities in care between individuals with different types of insurance, or without any insurance, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>This article examines trends in care for the uninsured and the gap between the insured and uninsured along three dimensions: access, chronic disease control, and invasive care post-AMI. Using data from multiple sources we find that trends for the uninsured over this period, with the exception of BP control (which is increasing) and access to care (which worsens at the end of the period), are relatively flat. There is a persistent disparity between the privately insured and uninsured in the access measures considered. Considering chronic disease measures, we find that the disparity in BP control narrowed, while a disparity in cholesterol control materialized at the end of the period. Disparities between the uninsured and insured groups are not changing significantly in general. This is generally consistent with unadjusted results from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558711418519">AHRQ National Healthcare Disparities Report (2009)</xref>, which finds no significant change in access disparities between uninsured and insured groups from 2002 to 2006 and slightly widening disparities from 1999 to 2006.</p>
<p>There are a number of limitations to this study. Survey data from the CTS are based on self-report. In addition, different individuals may have differing interpretations of the definition of “necessary care” when responding to questions about whether they had to forgo or delay necessary care. Similarly, some of the data from the NHANES, including previous diagnoses of conditions, are based on self-report, though this is supplemented with data collected through physical exam. Data from the NHDS are based on hospital report and include less information on individual patient demographic characteristics. In addition, the samples of uninsured and Medicaid enrolled adults are small relative to the privately insured samples, leading to less precise estimates for these populations, though this is the case in most surveys covering individuals with all insurance types. All data sources consist of pooled cross-sections over time. While it would be preferable to follow individuals over time, few longitudinal data sources are available, particularly for the uninsured. This limits the ability to control for changes in the uninsured population over time, though the inclusion of demographic covariates and choice of measures should ameliorate this somewhat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while this article describes relative trends in care, there are a number of possible mechanisms that may be driving these trends, and quantifying their role is beyond the scope of this study. For example, improvements in chronic disease control for the insured may be driven by increases in the use of disease management programs over this period. Finally, due to data limitations and in order to be consistent across surveys, data used in this study are derived from survey questions about insurance coverage at the time of the survey. If anything, this may lead to underestimation of access problems faced by the uninsured since even those with part-year insurance are more likely to face access or quality problems than those who are continuously insured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558711418519">Schoen &amp; DesRoches, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>This study presents evidence that disparities in access to care and chronic disease control between the uninsured and insured have generally not been improving over recent years. On the other hand, outcomes for the uninsured are not declining over this period on most of the measures considered and BP control is improving. In addition, Medicaid enrollees fare better than the uninsured on many of the measures considered, though not as well as the privately insured for measures of access to care and AMI care. This suggests that as many of the previously uninsured qualify for Medicaid under the ACA we might expect improvements in, for example, access to care for these individuals (at least over the long term, assuming adequate provider supply) though not necessarily to the level of the privately insured.</p>
<p>Future research is needed to investigate the factors underlying trends in care for the uninsured and in disparities by insurance status, including the roles of different safety net providers and institutions, and policies aimed at supporting the uninsured and underserved populations. Whether the gap in outcomes between the insured and uninsured can and will close over time will depend on various policies and practices regarding insurance and access for low-income and other underserved populations.</p>
