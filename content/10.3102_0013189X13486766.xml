<p>As the commentaries suggest, the <italic>Fisher</italic> case contributes to an ongoing analysis of issues in K–12 schooling and higher education—affirmative action, diversity, and equality—and the implications for the use and significance of social science research in judicial deliberations and decisions. All of the commentaries reinforce the importance of the social science research community’s voice and the perspectives that social science research offers in reflecting the range and complexity of issues facing institutions and in the human experience. They point as well to the existing challenges of communicating research and the importance of enhancing access by legal scholars and the judiciary to this research. The question of research in legal decisions is a matter unlikely to disappear from academic discussions or public discourse.</p>
<p>The commentaries in this special section of the April issue of ER are informative in their analysis of the role of research in judicial decisions. However, they also raise questions about the potential uses of our research, both its conceptualization of problems and its quality. In this way, they advance our purposes and goals for ER. It is critical that the journal continue to be topical and responsive without compromising quality or impact and that it achieves a balance between policy-relevant issues and broader inquiry around a more fundamental understanding of the educational process. We are actively working to publish a journal that is a model of rigorous research, timely dissemination, and engaging format that speak to the wide range of issues in our field.</p>
