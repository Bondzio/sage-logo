<abstract>
<p>This article describes the importance of the nutritional and nurturing effects of breastfeeding for the infant with cleft lip (CL) or cleft palate (CP). Organizations recognize the health benefits of breastfeeding to the mother and infant. Research indicates that use of breast milk decreases childhood disease, reduces infections, and promotes healing, which are especially important for infants with CL or CP. The degree of the defect of the CL and CP influences potential complications associated with feedings and the nutritional status of the infant. The multidisciplinary team should include the infant’s physician, the craniofacial team, dietitian, lactation consultant, and speech and oral pathologist.</p>

<p>For women to successfully breastfeed their infants with cleft lip (CL) or cleft palate (CP), they require a team approach at every stage of development and healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412447237">1</xref></sup> The team should be multidisciplinary and should include health professionals from the time of diagnosis of CL and CP until postsurgery and beyond. The parents and support system should be included in the multidisciplinary feeding approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412447237">2</xref></sup> The team needs to realize the importance of taking each situation on a case-by-case basis and support the family where they are within each stage.<sup>3-7</sup> Infants born with CL or CP will benefit from breastfeeding and close nurturing.</p>

<title>Support for Breastfeeding</title>
<p>The use of evidenced-based practice has come to the forefront, and the importance breastfeeding is at an all-time high.

<title>Nutrition and Nurturing</title>
<p>Research provides an incredible insight into the benefits of the nutritional and nurturing aspects of breastfeeding.<sup>7,8,14-16</sup> Nutritionally, breast milk is considered the optimal food for infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412447237">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412447237">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412447237">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412447237">15</xref></sup> Breast milk includes antibodies, hormones, antiviruses, antiallergens, antiparasites, growth hormones, enzymes, minerals, vitamins, fat, DHA, ARA, carbohydrates, protein, and water,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412447237">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412447237">15</xref></sup> which have been shown to decrease childhood diseases and illnesses especially if the infant is exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months and continues throughout the first year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412447237">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412447237">13</xref></sup> Breastfeeding has also been shown to enhance infant and maternal health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412447237">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412447237">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dr Nils Bergman has researched the concept of Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412447237">16</xref></sup> This practice involves the infant and mother lying skin to skin. The mother acts as the incubator for the infant, the infant lying naked, except for a diaper, on the mother’s bare chest, which allows the infant to reap the rewards of being skin to skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412447237">16</xref></sup> KMC has been shown to stabilize vital signs for both infant and mother.

<title>Mechanics of Breastfeeding</title>
<p>The structures needed for successful breastfeeding are a mother’s breasts, nipple, and areola to provide breast milk and facilitate milk transfer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412447237">17</xref></sup> The infant requires intact lips, jaw, tongue, and cheeks for the milk to transfer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412447237">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412447237">18</xref></sup> The infant’s hard and soft palates are needed during sucking to help maintain suction within the oral cavity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412447237">17</xref></sup> As the milk is transferred from the breast to the oral cavity, the soft palate raises, closing off the nasal passageways allowing the milk to be swallowed into the esophagus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412447237">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>A successful breastfeeding occurs when the infant takes the mother’s nipple and some of the areola deep into the mouth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412447237">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941406412447237">19</xref></sup> The lips and cheeks provide a seal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412447237">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941406412447237">19</xref></sup> The infant’s sucking reflex creates suction within the mouth, causing the nipple and areola to form a teat while the bottom jaw moves upward for compression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412447237">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941406412447237">19</xref></sup> Milk then transfers from the mother to the infant. The infant’s swallowing reflex transports the milk from the mouth into the digestive system.</p>

<title>Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate</title>
<p>The word <italic>cleft</italic> means a split or separation, and in the case of CL and CP, the infant is born with a split in the lip, which might extend into the hard palate. CL and CP are the most common birth defects in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412447237">21</xref></sup> These defects affect the upper lip and roof of the mouth. CL and CP can occur by themselves about 70% of the time or may be a part of a syndrome or other birth defect in about 30% of these situations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412447237">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>CL and CP defects occur early in fetal development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412447237">21</xref></sup> Clefts occur when the structures do not close. The causes range from genetics to environmental factors, including drugs, maternal smoking, infections, maternal alcohol use, and may be related to a deficiency of vitamin B or folic acid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412447237">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>A CL is an opening in the upper lip between the mouth and nose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412447237">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412447237">21</xref></sup> The cleft may range from a small notch to a complete separation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412447237">21</xref></sup> A complete separation extends up into the nose. A cleft in the gum can occur in association with a CL. A CL can be unilateral, that is, affecting only one side of the mouth, or bilateral, that is, there is a cleft on either side of the mouth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412447237">21</xref></sup> A CP involves the hard palate that is not completely joined. A CP can range from a small hole to a larger hole affecting a major portion of the roof of the mouth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412447237">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>The complications associated with feeding can be an inadequate suck, lack of a tight latch or seal, and regurgitation out of the lip, palate, or nose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412447237">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412447237">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412447237">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412447237">22</xref></sup> Without intact structures successful breastfeeding is challenging for the mother and infant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412447237">18</xref></sup> The negative pressure within the oral cavity needed for appropriate suction is decreased when the infant has a CL or CP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412447237">18</xref></sup> Complications with feeding can lead to poor weight gain if not addressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1941406412447237">26</xref></sup> A dietitian and an international board-certified lactation consultant (IBCLC) are important members of the professional team to monitor the nutritional status and feeding problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412447237">6</xref></sup> Early intervention has been noted to decrease incidence of feeding difficulties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412447237">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1941406412447237">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>When helping the mother feed an infant with CL only, the breast may be soft enough to make a seal. As the infant latches, the soft breast tissue closes off the cleft causing a seal. Alternately, the mother can use a finger to cover the cleft to help with the seal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412447237">18</xref></sup> To assist colostrum and milk transfer, the mother can hand massage her breast, which helps the flow into the infant’s mouth. A team approach to counseling families of the importance of breast milk and breastfeeding will provide education and support to families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412447237">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>When feeding the infant with both CL and CP, the infant should be in the upright or sitting position.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412447237">18</xref></sup> The use of the football or modified hold while breastfeeding allows the infant to be upright or sitting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412447237">18</xref></sup> The upright position decreases the chances of regurgitation into the cleft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412447237">18</xref></sup> In the first days after birth, the CP infant usually can tolerate breastfeeding because of the small amount of colostrum transferred with little regurgitation noted. The use of special feeders with soft nipples and bottles assist the delivery of milk during feedings and help boost nutritional status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412447237">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412447237">22</xref></sup></p>

<title>Case Study 1</title>
<p>The first case is a 40-week gestation male infant born by spontaneous vaginal delivery. The infant’s Apgar score was 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. The parents and delivery team were aware that the infant was diagnosed with bilateral CL prenatally. The father of the infant had a unilateral CL at birth that was repaired in infancy. The parents had met with the craniofacial team prenatally. They were well educated and calm under the circumstances.</p>
<p>The delivery hospital promotes Baby Friendly practices and allows for KMC immediately following birth. The nurse taking care of the infant assessed the infant on the mother’s chest. Vital signs were stable and infant and mother had good initial bonding. The mother and father adapted very well to the infant having bilateral CL and treated the infant and defect as if they went through this before.</p>
<p>The lactation consultant visited with the family and obtained their breastfeeding goals. The parents had attended a prenatal breastfeeding class and were educated on the benefits of breast milk and breastfeeding. Their goal was to exclusively breastfeed if it did not interfere with the health of the infant.</p>
<sec id="section9-1941406412447237">
<title>Feeding</title>
<p>The infant was skin-to-skin and crawled to the mother’s breast within the first hour of life. The breast was soft and infant was able to latch. Both mother and infant were learning. The mother was encouraged to hand massage her breasts so that colostrum would transfer into the infant’s mouth. The infant started moving his tongue and trying to breastfeed. With each try the infant got stronger at the breast and demonstrated effective breastfeeding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1941406412447237">
<title>Written Plan of Care</title>
<p>The IBCLC discussed the plan of care with the medical team and explained this to the parents. The infant’s vital signs were stable and the infant was breastfeeding well. The infant was able to “room in” with the parents, allowing the infant to stay with the parents around the clock. The nurses and lactation consultants did rounds on the patient every hour. Safety measures are taught to the parents, such as the use of call bells and bulb syringe. With this in place the parents were excited to be responsible for their infant’s care. Rooming in has been noted to improve parent–infant bonding and skills by the time of discharge.</p>
<p>The IBCLC discussed breastfeeding the infant at least 8 to 12 times in a 24-hour period with the parents. A feeding log was initiated to record feeds, wet diapers, and stools. The IBCLC encouraged the mother to start pumping at least 3 to 4 times daily to stimulate her milk supply and to use any expressed breast milk for supplemental feeds in case her infant became too tired to breastfeed effectively over the next few days. The mother recorded when she expressed her milk in a pumping log. All breast milk obtained was dated, timed, and appropriately labeled and placed in the freezer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1941406412447237">
<title>Discharge</title>
<p>The infant remained exclusively breastfeeding. Vital signs, weight loss, and jaundice levels were all in an appropriate range for the infant to be discharged home exclusively breastfeeding. Follow-up with the pediatrician was scheduled for the next day. Follow-up with the craniofacial team was in 2 weeks. This mother stayed home during the infant’s first year of life, and she was able to follow-up with the team on an as needed basis.</p>

<title>Case Study 2</title>
<p>This case study involves an infant male born with a unilateral CL extending far up into the gum and nose with a large CP. The infant was born by c-section at 38 weeks gestation for failure to progress. Mother, father, and delivery team were aware of the prenatal diagnosis. The infant was delivered and immediately showed signs of breathing difficulty due to extreme CL defect, which caused some blockage of the formed nares. The infant was held by the parents for a short period but then transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit for observation.</p>
<sec id="section13-1941406412447237">
<title>Feeding</title>
<p>The infant took a while to adjust to life outside the womb but by 4 hours of age vital signs were stable. The mother was brought from the recovery room to the neonatal intensive care unit via stretcher and both parents held the infant. The parents prenatally had met with the craniofacial team and were educated on the diagnosis and surgeries.</p>
<p>The father held his son and talked with him. The mother held her son and was visibly upset regarding the CL and CP. The mother’s prenatal medical history was benign. The mother was grieving and seemed to be in a state of shock. Mother and father discussed with the medical team the plan of care and went to the postpartum room.</p>
<p>The physician ordered feeds for the infant and stated the infant could breastfeed. The father and grandparents offered support for the mother. The nurse and IBCLC spoke with the parents about the plan of care and the mother’s breastfeeding goals. The mother stated she was overwhelmed at this time and would think about breastfeeding later in the day.</p>
<p>The infant’s father used a special feeder to assist in the delivery of milk into the infant’s mouth by compressing the nipple to provide the first feed to the infant. The father was educated by the team on positioning of the infant and the use of the specialized feeder. The feeder uses a membrane between the bottle and nipple to prevent milk from flowing back into the bottle. Each squeeze of the nipple allows a certain amount of milk to flow into the infant’s mouth. The infant adjusted to the bottle and fed well.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1941406412447237">
<title>Written Plan of Care</title>
<p>The father was available to feed the infant every 3 hours. The mother was adjusting to her first day postpartum. The mother initiated pumping on the second postpartum day. The family was educated on the importance of pumping every 3 hours. The IBCLC demonstrated to the family how to set up the breast pump and the cleanup process. The father fed the infant while the mother observed. Each day the mother seemed to better accept the difficult situation and the father continued to be very supportive. The mother took responsibility to record sessions in the pumping log. The infant was able to meet nutritional goals with each feeding using the special feeder.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1941406412447237">
<title>Discharge</title>
<p>A social service consult was ordered and the family stated they were getting stronger each day. The family agreed to rent a breast pump after discussion with the IBCLC.</p>
<p>By the day of discharge the mother was able to feed the infant with the specialized feeder. The mother continued to grieve and did not want to breastfeed. The professional team encouraged the mother to breastfeed and stressed the importance of breast milk and bonding but the mother stated she was not ready for breastfeeding.</p>
<p>The infant was tolerating feeds using the specialized feeder and was discharged home. Follow-up with the pediatrician was in a day, the craniofacial team in 3 weeks, and with the IBCLC on an as needed basis. The mother went home pumping every 3 hours and kept accurate records of milk expression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1941406412447237">
<title>Postdischarge</title>
<p>The infant was able to thrive and gained weight using the specialized feeder. The mother was able to express milk for half of the infant’s feeds. The mother continued to express her milk for the first 6 months. An IBCLC is a member of the craniofacial team and encouraged the mother during each clinic visit.</p>
