<abstract>
<p>To date, there is a paucity of empirical research documenting the essential environmental conditions that must exist before teachers of the gifted will integrate technology into their instruction. To establish baseline data documenting the frequency with which teachers of the gifted use technology for instructional purposes and to build theory describing the critical environmental conditions that support technology integration, researchers administered the Perceptions of Computers and Technology (PCT) survey to 255 teachers of the gifted. This survey measured teachers’ self-reported use of technology and other factors that contributed to computer integration. Results suggested five conditions (general school support, infrastructure, professional development, teacher attitude, and teacher personal use) are necessary for teachers of the gifted to create a classroom digital ecosystem. In this model, personal use accounted for the greatest amount of unique variability. Conclusions are drawn, new lines of inquiry are posed, and implications are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As business and industry continue to transform the digital marketplace, it requires workers who can assimilate, communicate, and present critical evaluations of information. Gifted students’ natural capacity for advanced information retention, knowledge recall, abstract thought, and creative productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1932202X12461005">Reis &amp; Sullivan, 2009</xref>) means they are well positioned to meet marketplace demands; however, they will not automatically become creative-productive digital citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1932202X12461005">Eshet-Alkalai &amp; Chajut, 2010</xref>). To become workplace ready, most require learning environments that prepare them for the digital marketplace. As such, teachers of the gifted must develop a classroom digital ecosystem that allows for the confluence of student potential and marketplace demands.</p>
<p>The analogy linking instructional practices and a digital ecosystem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1932202X12461005">Burger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1932202X12461005">Chin, Chang, &amp; Atkinson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1932202X12461005">Zhao &amp; Frank, 2003</xref>) is used to demonstrate that certain environmental conditions must exist before teachers of the gifted will integrate technology into their classrooms. Similar to any ecosystem found in nature, a classroom is a system that evolves from the interactions among all living and nonliving things. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1932202X12461005">Burger (2007)</xref>, an ecosystem’s sustainability depends on how well it adheres to a particular model that allows energy to flow in and out of the environment. As the field of gifted education continues to investigate technology integration models, it is important to consider the conditions that promote a sustainable classroom digital ecosystem. Given the capacity of gifted and talented learners, one may suggest that sustainability is but one level of the ecosystem. A second tier, synergy, may also be a product of an appropriate ecosystem. The sum of the parts should exceed the whole when technology is effectively matched to gifted programming and learners.</p>
<p>A digital ecosystem effectively affords gifted students the opportunity to engage with a variety of technology applications. A robust digital ecosystem is a combination of equipment and experiences that allow students to perform and redefine tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1932202X12461005">Burger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1932202X12461005">Chin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1932202X12461005">Zhao &amp; Frank, 2003</xref>). Rather than integrating technology simply as a way to engage gifted learners, a healthy digital ecosystem is a process-oriented ecological environment that prepares learners. An ecologically sound classroom brings together a multitude of cognitive processes that enables students to experience, create, and transform knowledge. Given these circumstances, how do teachers of the gifted create such a climate? More specifically, what environmental conditions permit these digital ecosystems to thrive?</p>
<p>To date, there is paucity of research investigating the environmental conditions that facilitate technology integration into the gifted education classroom. The purpose of this manuscript is to contribute to the body of literature describing appropriate practices for utilizing technology with gifted students. By measuring the systemic conditions that promote a sustainable classroom digital ecosystem, gifted education researchers can begin gauging the instructional impact of technology integration strategies. Teachers who follow empirically sound technology integration principles may be able to establish classroom digital ecosystems that nurture gifted learners’ digital workplace readiness. In so doing, graduates from an appropriate technology-infused environment may mature into a generation of inventors, entrepreneurs, and innovators. Effective instruction and learning environments should return a dividend on the synergy harvested from these dynamic environments.</p>

<title>A Model Supporting a Sustainable Classroom Digital Ecosystem</title>
<p>A goal of integrating technology into educational settings is to increase student learning and prepare students to enter the digital workplace. Yet, successful technology integration neither happens in isolation nor is it the result of a single variable. In fact, research has documented that there is no single factor that increases the odds that a teacher will integrate technology into the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1932202X12461005">Chin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1932202X12461005">Holden &amp; Rada, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1932202X12461005">Maninger &amp; Holden, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1932202X12461005">Mouza, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X12461005">Palak &amp; Walls, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1932202X12461005">Siegle &amp; Mitchell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1932202X12461005">van Braak, Tondeur, &amp; Valcke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1932202X12461005">Zheng, Perez, Williamson, &amp; Flygare, 2008</xref>). Rather, researchers concur that technology integration is the result of a variety of interrelated factors.</p>
<p>It is important to view the factors, described below, through a future-needs lens and not define the work readiness paradigm by current technologies and systems. Current sustainability will not measure up to the workplace a decade from now. In fact, an argument can be raised that we do not know the specific technologies that the future workplace will require. As such, a digital ecosystem’s quality should be evaluated based on the creative-productive thinkers it produces.</p>
<p>Studies that investigated the factors influencing technology integration generally have been organized around one of four themes: (a) philosophical approach (i.e., attitudes toward computers, teacher-centered versus student-centered teaching style), (b) demographics (i.e., age, gender, years of teaching, and personal computer use; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1932202X12461005">Kahveci, Sahin, &amp; Genc, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1932202X12461005">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>), (c) school climate (i.e., support and infrastructure; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X12461005">Palak &amp; Walls, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1932202X12461005">Shaunessy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1932202X12461005">Staples, Pugach, &amp; Himes, 2005</xref>), and (d) professional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1932202X12461005">Eshet-Alkalai &amp; Chajut, 2010</xref>). In describing their results, these researchers acknowledged the difficulty in trying to identify one single factor and concluded that it was a set of factors that correlated to a teacher’s use of technology for instructional purposes.</p>

<title>Philosophical Approach</title>
<sec id="section4-1932202X12461005">
<title>Teacher attitude toward technology</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1932202X12461005">Shaunessy (2007)</xref>, a teacher’s attitude toward technology integration, coupled with computer-focused professional development, was a strong predictor of technology integration. Although this particular study measured attitude toward technology, and not the impact that other conditions had on technology integration, the conclusions indicated that professional development and access to sufficient resources had a positive influence on a teacher’s attitude toward technology.</p>
<p>One significant finding in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1932202X12461005">Shaunessy’s (2007)</xref> study was that “attitudes of teachers of the gifted toward information technology are a critical consideration in understanding the broad context of the role information technology plays in gifted education” (p. 119). The conclusion was that technology-focused professional development had the strongest impact on a teacher’s attitude toward technology. These findings supported previous research studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1932202X12461005">Bybee &amp; Loucks-Horsley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1932202X12461005">Southern &amp; Spicker, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1932202X12461005">Subhi, 1999</xref>), which found that teachers did not integrate technology into their classroom unless they were equipped with (a) a theoretical knowledge of why technology is an important educational tool and (b) practical skills to successfully integrate technology into their specific classroom. The implications suggested that teachers of the gifted who held a more positive view of integrating digital technologies into the classroom were more likely to utilize them as an instructional tool.</p>

<sec id="section5-1932202X12461005">
<title>Teacher-centered versus student-centered practices</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X12461005">Palak and Walls (2009)</xref> conducted a sequential mixed methods study to determine the relationship between a teacher’s pedagogical philosophy and technology integration strategies. In particular, these researchers were curious about how a set of contextual factors contributed to a teacher utilizing technology for student-centered instruction. All participants (<italic>n</italic> = 4) had ample access to technology resources, reported positive attitudes toward technology, had a supportive school climate, and were comfortable with using technology as an instructional tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X12461005">Palak &amp; Walls, 2009</xref>). To measure these variables, the researchers first surveyed participants using the Perceptions of Computers and Technology (PCT) survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1932202X12461005">Hogarty, Lang, &amp; Kromrey, 2003</xref>). The PCT was used to measure a participant’s self-reported use of technology in his or her classroom across four categories: (a) integration; (b) support; (c) preparation, confidence, and comfort; and (d) attitude. Next, researchers observed classroom instruction and analyzed participants’ lesson plan reflections.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X12461005">Palak and Walls (2009)</xref> concluded that there were a variety of conditions that influenced a teacher’s technology integration practices. Although participants in this study had sufficient technology resources, not all used technology for student-centered, creative-productive purposes. Only teachers who attended technology-focused professional development sessions were likely to design technology-based learning activities. Another significant condition was a teacher’s philosophical views. A teacher who believed more strongly in a student-centered classroom was more likely to use technology for those types of instructional purposes. In fact, Palak and Walls noted that the only teacher who regularly integrated technology for student-centered, creative-productive purposes was one who had been trained to work with gifted and talented students.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X12461005">Palak and Walls (2009)</xref>, this particular participant’s training in educating the gifted allowed her to use technology to (a) develop students’ process and thinking skills, (b) provide students with choices, and (c) explore multiple perspectives. “The role of curriculum was to help students become lifelong learners, and her role in the curriculum was to teach process skills as opposed to focusing on the product or content” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X12461005">Palak &amp; Walls, 2009</xref>, p. 429). This teacher reported utilizing a variety of instructional strategies to teach with technology. These strategies ranged from “independent learning” and “research tool for students” to “cooperative groups” and “to promote student-centered learning”; however, this teacher reported never using technology as a “reward” or “to tutor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X12461005">Palak &amp; Walls, 2009</xref>). These researchers concluded that this teacher’s pedagogical views were consistent with gifted education best practices.</p>
<p>In describing steps for future research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X12461005">Palak and Walls (2009)</xref> recommended “creating and modeling a theory of change toward a student-centered paradigm while being sensitive to context-specific factors” (p. 437). Although this particular study was limited in scope, thus making it difficult to project generalizations onto a larger population, it does suggest that teachers of the gifted may be a good population with which to begin developing and modeling a theory of technology integration.</p>

<title>Demographics</title>
<sec id="section7-1932202X12461005">
<title>Gender and personal use</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1932202X12461005">Kahveci et al. (2011)</xref> used the PCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1932202X12461005">Hogarty et al., 2003</xref>) to survey 136 high school teachers (<italic>n</italic> = 76 females, <italic>n</italic> = 54 males) who taught at schools with “sufficient technology resources . . . and unconstrained access to technology and the Internet during school time” (p. 72). While this study did not specifically investigate gender differences in integration frequency, Kahveci and colleagues found that males were more confident and comfortable with technology than their female counterparts were. However, deeper analysis revealed “ownership of personal computers emerged as a key factor in improving both computer expertise and attitudes towards computers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1932202X12461005">Kahveci et al., 2011</xref>, p. 77). Furthermore, the findings revealed that those teachers who had formal technology integration training and personal experiences with technology were more likely to use technology for instructional purposes. According to the researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1932202X12461005">Kahveci et al., 2011</xref>), these subsequent findings minimized the role of gender and placed greater weight on how a teacher engages with technology.</p>
<p>In describing the significance of personal use of technology by teachers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1932202X12461005">ChanLin (2007)</xref> suggested a correlation exists between personal experience with technology tools and classroom integration. Although personal use alone did not determine computer integration, it significantly impacted the classroom digital ecosystem. Furthermore, the results supported earlier research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1932202X12461005">Voogt, Almekinders, van den Akker, &amp; Moonen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1932202X12461005">Zhao &amp; Frank, 2003</xref>) that suggests frequent, personal technology use strengthened the classroom technology bond. These findings suggest the existence of a relationship between classroom technology integration and personal technology use.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1932202X12461005">Egbert, Paulus, and Nakamichi (2002)</xref> described the correlation between personal use of technology tools and classroom integration, and found that “teachers use what they know well, and that much of what they learn is driven by personal exigency rather than by coursework” (p. 119). As these studies did not include teachers of the gifted, they are not generalizable to that particular population. However, it appears that personal use might be a significant condition for other teacher populations and one that warrants further investigation.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1932202X12461005">
<title>School Climate</title>
<p>School climate is another strong predictor of teacher technology integration. Teachers are more likely to experiment with technology integration instructional strategies if they feel their attempts are encouraged, supported, and rewarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1932202X12461005">Siegle &amp; Mitchell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1932202X12461005">Staples et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1932202X12461005">Zhao &amp; Frank, 2003</xref>). These researchers concluded that a supportive climate instills a sense of confidence and willingness to explore with new instructional approaches. There are two conditions that can be used to measure a supportive technology integration school climate: (a) general school support and (b) technology infrastructure.</p>
<sec id="section9-1932202X12461005">
<title>General school support</title>
<p>General school support refers to the degree to which teachers’ efforts are bolstered. According to researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1932202X12461005">Siegle &amp; Mitchell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1932202X12461005">Staples et al., 2005</xref>), there are three categories of support: (a) administrative, (b) technical, and (c) peer support. Each variable is important, and the degree to which teachers perceive they exist correlates to technology integration.</p>
<p>The first variable that contributes to school support is administrative encouragement and/or advocacy. As school and district administrators set curricular goals, it is important they expect and encourage teachers to utilize technology for instructional purposes. By setting these expectations and establishing a supportive environment, administrators can enhance teachers’ technology confidence. Research has suggested that administrators can help increase the frequency of technology integration by allowing teachers time to learn new technology and providing curricular freedom for teachers to experiment with novel strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1932202X12461005">Besnoy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1932202X12461005">Egbert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1932202X12461005">Siegle &amp; Mitchell, 2011</xref>). By establishing a school climate that expects technology integration while allowing for instructional experimentation, the administrator can positively impact any classroom’s digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>The availability of a technical expert is a second variable that contributes to school support. Although technology coordinators appreciate a teacher who can trouble shoot basic technology glitches, they do not expect, or want, teachers overstepping their level of expertise. At the same time, teachers are comforted in knowing that their technology issues will be addressed in a timely manner, which increases their likelihood of integrating technology. Coordinating these two entities is vital because teachers are motivated to try new strategies while realizing the necessary comfort that their endeavors will not be wasted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1932202X12461005">Staples et al., 2005</xref>). As teachers of the gifted explore new technologies and strategies for implementation, their efforts are strengthened by the presence of an expert who can resolve technical issues.</p>
<p>The third variable for school support is a collegial support network that rewards teachers who explore and share new ideas. In describing key elements to effective gifted education programs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1932202X12461005">Dettmer and Landrum (1998)</xref> asserted that peer coaching was indicative of a supportive school climate that promotes pedagogical innovation and change. Whereas these researchers did not focus specifically on integrating technology into the gifted education classroom, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1932202X12461005">Siegle and Mitchell (2011)</xref> echoed this idea by asserting that supportive peer relationships will positively affect technology integration. To further illustrate the importance of positive peer support groups, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1932202X12461005">Zhao and Frank (2003)</xref> wrote, “The informal help and information that teachers provide to each other have important associations with computer use that are comparable to those of more commonly recognized factors” (p. 830). Collegial relationships allow teachers to share their success and frustrations in a supportive atmosphere, thus increasing the likelihood that they will integrate technology into their classrooms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1932202X12461005">
<title>Technology infrastructure</title>
<p>Infrastructure, as an environmental condition, refers to all computer technology hardware and software components that support information transmission among two or more sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1932202X12461005">Raths, 2012</xref>). Few things are more frustrating for teachers than realizing their new, exciting technology-based lessons will not work because of an outdated operating system, slow computer processor, or inadequate Internet access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1932202X12461005">Besnoy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1932202X12461005">Clarke &amp; Besnoy, 2010</xref>). Many technology savvy teachers are confident enough to modify on the fly, continue with the lesson, and maintain an acceptable technology integration level. However, research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1932202X12461005">Holden &amp; Rada, 2011</xref>) demonstrates that less sophisticated and confident users will abandon the computer focus of that particular lesson and grow more skeptical of technology’s educational value. By ensuring an acceptable level of technology infrastructure, teachers know that their time and efforts will not be wasted.</p>
<p>There appears to be a connection between a teacher’s technology comfort level and the introduction of new technology tools. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1932202X12461005">Zhao and Frank (2003)</xref>, teachers find it problematic if they are bombarded with a cornucopia of new infrastructure items; rather, it is more efficient for them to master one new skill and tool at a time. Thus, although it is a great public relations news story for the classroom infrastructure to be equipped with the latest technical innovations, researchers suggest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1932202X12461005">Siegle &amp; Mitchell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1932202X12461005">Zhao &amp; Frank, 2003</xref>) it is more ecologically sound to make sure teachers are comfortable with the tools already in their possession before introducing new ones into the environment.</p>

<title>Professional Development</title>
<p>The effect that professional development has on affecting pedagogical change is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1932202X12461005">Dettmer &amp; Landrum, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1932202X12461005">Karnes &amp; Shaunessy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1932202X12461005">Shaunessy, 2007</xref>). According to researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1932202X12461005">Besnoy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1932202X12461005">Dettmer &amp; Landrum, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1932202X12461005">Karnes &amp; Shaunessy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1932202X12461005">Shaunessy, 2007</xref>), impactful professional development must be (a) focused, (b) sustained, and (c) meaningful. To further their pedagogical shift, teachers of the gifted must participate in professional development sessions that meet these criteria and highlight how to use technology in the gifted education classroom. Without opportunities that focus on using technology to meet the specific needs of gifted children, teachers are left wondering, “How does this relate to my situation?” Currently, there is a dearth of literature demonstrating the impact that professional development has on the frequency with which teachers of the gifted integrate technology into the classroom; thus, it is necessary to look outside the field for guidance.</p>
<p>Lessons drawn from the larger educational community demonstrate a strong correlation between professional development and technology integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1932202X12461005">Bybee &amp; Loucks-Horsley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1932202X12461005">Eshet-Alkalai &amp; Chajut, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1932202X12461005">Holden &amp; Rada, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1932202X12461005">Staples et al., 2005</xref>). Professional development offers teachers adequate time to explore the technical aspect of a new tool or strategy, establishes a support group where ideas can be tested and successes can be celebrated, and gives access to an expert who can provide trusted technical support and advice. When afforded these resources, teachers are more likely to create a sustainable classroom digital ecosystem.</p>

<title>Computer Integration Among Teachers of the Gifted</title>
<p>To help gifted students to successfully transition to postsecondary settings, teachers of the gifted should create classroom digital ecosystems that harness the technology’s power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1932202X12461005">Siegle &amp; Mitchell, 2011</xref>). When gifted students enter the postsecondary settings, they will be expected to use technology to collaborate with others, triangulate data found on the Internet, and communicate their findings through social media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1932202X12461005">Besnoy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1932202X12461005">Besnoy, Housand, &amp; Clarke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1932202X12461005">Clarke &amp; Besnoy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1932202X12461005">Mioduser, Nachmias, Lahav, &amp; Oren, 2000</xref>). Their ability to manufacture and distribute digital goods and services is paramount to their future success. To meet this demand, educators of the gifted “must be willing and able to incorporate those tools purposefully into the curriculum” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1932202X12461005">Siegle &amp; Mitchell, 2011</xref>, p. 350). Although technology should not be the sole instructional medium in the gifted education classroom, it must be an integral part of the equation. Creating sustainable digital ecosystems is one way that teachers of the gifted can support their students’ future success.</p>

<title>Current Study</title>
<p>This study explores environmental conditions that contribute to teachers’ integration of technology into their classrooms. The purpose of this line of inquiry is to begin developing theory around which future experimental studies can be conducted. To meet this goal, researchers explored the following three research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-1932202X12461005" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: How frequently are teachers of the gifted in a southeastern state integrating technology into the classroom?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: Which instructional strategies are teachers of the gifted in this sample utilizing as they integrate technology into the classroom?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 3</italic>: What are the environmental factors that influence technology integration into the gifted education classroom?</p></list-item></list>
<p>Given the multicontextual factors that influence technology integration into the classroom, we decided to build on Palak and Walls’ (2009) recommendations to develop a theory of technology integration that promotes student-centered learning. In the Palak and Walls study, the only teacher who used technology for student-centered teaching purposes was one who had gifted training. We were encouraged by this finding and decided to explore it in more depth by surveying the instructional practices of a larger sample of teachers of the gifted.</p>
<p>We recognized that a variety of factors contribute to classroom technology integration. However, in trying to build a theoretical model that can eventually be tested, the research team considered, and then eliminated, several factors previously discussed in the literature. We attempted to include only factors that could be influenced by school administrators and policies. For example, school administrators can control how much technical support they provide and technology resources they make available. Furthermore, they can reward attendance at professional development sessions and encourage the integration of technology into the classroom. At the same time, they cannot legally alter hiring practices to change a teacher’s gender or years of teaching experience.</p>
<p>After reviewing the literature and considering the conclusions of previous studies, the research team selected conditions around which to begin building a theoretical model: (a) strong school support, (b) robust technology infrastructure, (c) sustained professional development opportunities, (d) positive teacher attitude toward technology, and (e) ample personal use of technology. We theorize that these five conditions allow teachers to create sustainable digital ecosystems that will support technology integration into the gifted education classroom (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1932202X12461005">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section15-1932202X12461005">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants for this study were solicited from 641 public schoolteachers of the intellectually gifted in a Southeastern U.S. state. According to this particular state’s Department of Education, teachers of the gifted may renew a teaching license once every 5 years by earning Continuing Education Units (CEUs) or completing semester coursework at a university. All coursework must be in content or job/skill-related areas that are designed to improve teaching and school leadership. Examples include, but are not limited to, courses specific to the endorsement area, computer technology, cooperative learning, learning styles, or methodology.</p>
<p>Individuals who have earned a teaching license are expected to meet one of the following requirements for license renewal: (a) 10 CEUs, (b) 5 CEUs and 3 semester hours, or (c) 6 semester hours. Semester hours may be completed at either the undergraduate or graduate level from an accredited senior college, university, or community college. Furthermore, 0.5 CEUs constitutes 5 contact hours from an approved workshop/staff development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1932202X12461005">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>A convenience sample was recruited from the most current list of teachers of the gifted provided by the state’s Department of Education. All teachers were mailed an introductory letter summarizing the nature of the study and informing them they would receive the PCT survey in the mail asking them to self-report their classroom computer integration methods. The following week, a survey and a cover letter restating the nature of the study were mailed to potential participants. The complete survey packet included the following: (a) the cover letter from the researcher explaining the purpose of the study, (b) directions for completing the survey, (c) the PCT survey, and (d) a self-addressed stamped envelope so that participants could return the survey. All those who did not respond to the initial mailing were mailed a reminder letter approximately 2 weeks later.</p>
<p>A total of 255 (<italic>N</italic> = 255) of the 641 teachers responded to the survey, yielding a 39.7% response rate. Most participants were female (98%) and Caucasian (93.7%). In all, 18 of the participants (7.0%) reported their highest degree as an educational specialist degree, 167 (65.5%) as a master’s degree, and 70 (27.5%) as a bachelor’s degree (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1932202X12461005">Table 1</xref>). Participants’ years of teaching experience ranged from 1 to 38, with a mean of 18.3 and a standard deviation of 8.8 years (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1932202X12461005">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Instrumentation and Variables</title>
<p>The PCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1932202X12461005">Hogarty et al., 2003</xref>) was selected for this study. We selected this survey because it has been used previously with teachers of the gifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X12461005">Palak &amp; Walls, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1932202X12461005">Kahveci et al., 2011</xref>) and because it reliably measures multiple domains, thus allowing researchers to use a single survey to begin building a theoretical model. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1932202X12461005">Hogarty et al. (2003)</xref>, technology integration into the classroom is a multifaceted process that is the result of a variety of interdependent variables. In reviewing the existing surveys, Hogarty et al. found “[n]o single instrument reported in literature appears to provide an adequate measure of the important dimensions underlying the use of technology” (p. 140).</p>
<p>The developers of the PCT designed the instrument to measure several domains instead of a single underlying construct. The questions for each domain, or scale, of the PCT were examined using exploratory factor analytic techniques with an oblique rotation model to insure that each measured one common factor. A total of 1,850 teachers comprised the sample. The factor analysis of the 11 scales provides strong evidence of construct validity for each domain. Given the developers’ intent to design a survey that measures multiple domains surrounding computer use in the classroom instead of a summative rating scale measuring one underlying construct, the various scales on the PCT can be used as dependent and independent variables in modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1932202X12461005">Dunn-Rankin, Knezek, Wallace, &amp; Zhang, 2004</xref>). Cronbach’s alpha internal reliability estimates for the 11 scales were .74 (Personal Use), .75 (Student Application Software Use), .77 (Technological Affinity), .76 (Teacher Application Software Use), .79 (Teacher Instructional Software Use), .76 (Student Instructional Software Use), .79 (Technological Aversion), .82 (General School Support), .86 (Technical Support), .89 (Integration), and .90 (Confidence and Comfort).</p>
<p>In testing the theoretical propositions described in this article, the PCT-validated scales and a new, researcher-generated scale were used as variables. Six variables were utilized for this analysis. The Integration scale of the PCT was used as the measure of the dependent variable. The Integration of Technology in the Classroom scale consisted of 12 Likert-type questions measured on a 1 to 5 scale. The highest response on each question indicated use of technology every day in the classroom for a specified purpose, whereas the lowest response indicated that the teacher never uses technology in the classroom for a specified purpose. The range of possible total Integration scores was from 12 to 60. Higher scores were indicative of more frequent and varied use of technology in the classroom.</p>
<p>Five independent variables were extracted from PCT and demographic data: (a) general school support, (b) infrastructure, (c) professional development, (d) attitude toward integration, and (e) personal use of computers. The variable used to measure the independent variable “infrastructure” was generated from demographic data gathered from each respondent. Specifically, this question asked the respondent to report the number of computers used in the classroom for instructional purposes. The variable “attitude toward integration” is the “confidence and comfort” domain from the PCT.</p>
<p>The professional development independent variable was generated from a set of four questions on the PCT that were not originally treated as a domain by developers of the survey but as single questions designed to develop an understanding of where a respondent received technology-related training (e.g., “as part of your undergraduate or graduate coursework, workshops, independent learning, and distance learning courses?”). These four questions ask the respondent to indicate on a 5-point Likert-type scale those sources from which they acquired technology skills. Response options range from “not at all” to “entirely” using a Likert-type scale.</p>
<p>As the four items were not originally developed into a scale and were not used in any other scale on the PCT, an exploratory factor analysis using maximum likelihood extraction was conducted to assess the evidence of validity for these items as a single scale. A single factor model detailed the best simple solution with an eigenvalue of 1.54, explaining 38.5% of the variance of the items. Factor loadings for each item ranged from a low of .31 to a high of .56. The Cronbach’s alpha reliability estimate for the four items was .46, and Spearman–Brown reliability estimate was .55. These results indicate that the four items together exhibit adequate evidence of validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1932202X12461005">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>) but limited evidence of reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1932202X12461005">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994</xref>). The scale was retained as a measure of professional development; however, the results should be interpreted with regard to the possible weakness of this measure of professional development (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1932202X12461005">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>In the first step of analysis, professional development contributed the highest amount of unique variance to the model with 8.6% of variance explained by this one variable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1932202X12461005">Table 3</xref>). Infrastructure and general support contributed approximately 5% and 4%. Once attitude was entered into the Step 2 model, the unique variance contributed by professional development and infrastructure was decreased by more than half to around 4% and 2%, respectively. Attitude was the strongest variable, contributing 6.6% of unique variance to the model, and general support contributed less than 1%. The third step of the model, which included personal use and displayed a total adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of .50, showed a steep decline in the unique variance contributed by attitude with only 2.5% explained by this variable. The contribution from professional development was decreased by more than half from the previous step with 1.8%, and both general support and infrastructure contributed approximately the same amount of unique variability from the second step. Personal use contributed a very large portion of unique variance at this step with 18.5% indicating that this variable was the most influential in the model.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study’s results contribute to the body of research describing how to establish robust classroom digital ecosystems. These findings document the frequency that teachers of the gifted, in this sample, integrate technology into their classroom and provide insight into the types of instructional strategies they use. Although the self-reported data support the model described in this article, the study sample was not extensive enough to generalize the findings beyond this particular sample. Furthermore, the implications from this study are based on self-reported data and must be viewed through that context. Still, the results seem to suggest that certain environmental factors can influence the way technology is integrated into the gifted education classroom. However, future quasiexperimental studies could yield additional useful, informative results.</p>
<sec id="section22-1932202X12461005">
<title>Computer Integration Frequency</title>
<p>The results from this study contribute to the body of knowledge about the frequency with which teachers of the gifted are integrating technology into their classrooms and the types of instructional strategies they utilize. A majority of teachers in this study reported integrating technology at least once a week, whereas many do so more frequently. Furthermore, participants reported using technology as a tool to promote research, collaboration, communication, production, and dissemination of knowledge. Although caution must be exercised with self-report data, these response summaries, when compared with the existing literature, provide somewhat of a baseline and document technology integration with gifted learners. These results are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X12461005">Palak and Walls’s (2009)</xref> study documenting how one teacher of the gifted incorporated technology into classroom instruction, and they reflect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1932202X12461005">Siegle and Mitchell’s (2011)</xref> description of suggested best practices for the entire field. However, as there have not been any comparable studies measuring the frequency and type of computer integration by teachers of the gifted, more studies in this area must be conducted to allow for comparisons of results.</p>
<p>These results warrant further investigation about the frequency of technology integration and, more importantly, the impact of various instructional strategies used by teachers. Central to this line of inquiry should be as follows: Are teachers of the gifted utilizing technology to develop instructional activities that promote gifted learners’ precocious abilities and creative-productive potential? Future quasiexperimental study could allow researchers to make more generalizable conclusions about the extent to which teachers of the gifted are nurturing gifted students’ talents in these areas.</p>

<title>Digital Ecosystem Model</title>
<p>In building a theoretical model where multiple variables are used to predict a single outcome, it is important to recognize that each variable influences the others. Researchers were interested in examining how well the linear combination of these five independent variables predict computer integration into the gifted education classroom. Although each variable had unique explained variance, researchers acknowledge that they are not independent of each other. In fact, the interdependence of the variables is what researchers believe potentially make this a reliable model.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1932202X12461005">Siegle and Mitchell (2011)</xref> identified support, infrastructure, and professional development as three essential prerequisites for teachers of the gifted to integrate technology into their classrooms. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1932202X12461005">Shaunessy (2007)</xref> identified a teacher’s attitude toward integrating technology into the classroom as a fourth critical factor. Although this study’s results support these findings, the combination of these four factors accounted for only 32% of the explained variance. However, deeper analysis reveals that personal use of technology is a significant factor and, when combined with the other four factors, accounts for 50% of the explained variance. These findings also support previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1932202X12461005">ChanLin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1932202X12461005">Egbert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1932202X12461005">Zhao &amp; Frank, 2003</xref>) that teachers who use technology for personal purposes are also more likely to use those tools for instructional purposes.</p>
<p>A possible explanation for this finding may be that using technology for personal purposes allows teachers of the gifted to become comfortable with the tools, thus furthering their attitude toward integrating them for instructional purposes. Perhaps by connecting technology use to their personal lives, teachers are able to more easily identify technology-to-curricula connections. This view is consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1932202X12461005">ChanLin, 2007</xref>) studying teachers of general education students, and is also supported by research focusing on teachers of the gifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1932202X12461005">Kahveci et al., 2011</xref>). Without the other four environmental factors, teachers of the gifted would not be able to establish a classroom digital ecosystem. However, when a single variable accounts for approximately 18% of the unique variance, researchers should begin to inquire about its unique impact. Although members of the research team anticipated that the linear combination of the variables would be significant, we did not anticipate that the effect would be so large.</p>
<p>One question this study raises is the impact that teachers’ personal use of technology has on the way they utilize technology for instructional purposes. These results from the present study suggest that teachers of the gifted who use technology in their everyday lives are more likely to integrate technology into their classrooms. Although these results seem to demonstrate a significant relationship, further investigation is warranted before making generalizable conclusions about the veracity of this claim. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1932202X12461005">ChanLin (2007)</xref> reported, “The more experiences they acquire while integrating technology into their lifestyles, the more confident they are likely to feel when using technology” (p. 53). At this time, additional research is needed to determine the impact that a teacher’s personal use of technology has on its integration into the gifted education classroom.</p>
<p>More research is needed in the area of technology-focused professional development. Although researchers generated this independent variable from a set of questions not originally treated as a subscale by developers of the PCT, professional development’s significant contribution to the overall model is important. As acknowledged above, all the variables are interrelated; however, it will be useful to measure the impact that the combination of the professional development and personal use variables can have on integrating technology into the classroom. Without investigating this question first, it will be difficult to determine whether this current model can support the change advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X12461005">Palak and Walls (2009)</xref>, in which technology is used to nurture gifted learners’ digital workplace readiness.</p>

<sec id="section24-1932202X12461005">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There were a few limitations with this current study that prevent generalizing these results beyond this sample. First, we relied on participants’ accuracy in completing and returning a survey. The flaws associated with this method are that respondents might over estimate their abilities, resources, and frequency that they integrate technology into their classrooms. In addition, those who were not interested in technology might not have responded, thus skewing the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1932202X12461005">Shaunessy, 2007</xref>). In light of this, our findings should be viewed cautiously, but this limitation should not detract from the conclusions.</p>
<p>Second, researchers generated the professional development independent variable from items not originally treated as a subscale by developers of the survey. As such, the conclusions drawn about the significance of this independent variable should be viewed with caution. However, the questions used to generate this variable were originally intended to measure teacher preparation for computer use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1932202X12461005">Hogarty et al., 2003</xref>). In reviewing the article describing development and validation of the PCT, the authors did not provide any data describing the reliability of this particular subscale or the questions used in its construction. Furthermore, a review of literature did not produce any studies using this particular subscale. There was no reporting of any data associated with these questions.</p>
<p>A final limitation of this study was the construction and use of the infrastructure variable. The significant contribution of this independent variable to the model should also be viewed with some uncertainty. This limitation raises larger questions about how to define this variable and how the field will certify appropriate infrastructure. Infrastructure is an ambiguous construct; those who are more technologically proficient might be able to successfully integrate technology more effectively using less sophisticated resources. At the same time, there are questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1932202X12461005">Besnoy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1932202X12461005">Siegle &amp; Mitchell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1932202X12461005">Zhao &amp; Frank, 2003</xref>) about how much new technology to introduce at any given time. However, given the comprehensive nature of the PCT, this limitation should be viewed as marginal.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As the field of gifted education continues to describe ways to use technology for instructional purposes, it is necessary to conduct technology-focused, empirical research that will define and support evidence-based practices. Data from this study support the model described in this article and build on previous research defining factors contributing to computer integration into the gifted education classroom. The limitations of the study prevent researchers from generalizing these results beyond this sample. The present body of literature describing computer integration into the gifted education classroom is rich with valuable practitioner-focused works. However, there is a dearth of empirical studies documenting the educational impact that these strategies have on student learning. Initially, this line of inquiry should test this model’s validity. Future research should use control and experimental groups to more critically evaluate this model.</p>
<p>Establishing the reliability of this model, or subsequent versions of it, will help teachers to create classroom digital ecosystems. Technology rich digital ecosystems must materialize to prepare gifted students to compete for their place in evolving business and industrial occupations. The present and future marketplaces require a workforce equipped with the ability to use technology for innovative, novel purposes. Digital ecosystems may foster such a skill set and potentially amplify the precocious abilities of advanced learners to redefine the workplace.</p>
