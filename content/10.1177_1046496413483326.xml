<abstract>
<p>This study investigates cycles of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities over time in teams engaged in creative projects. Drawing on longitudinal case studies of two interactive media development teams, two distinct cycles of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities are identified: experimentation cycles and validation cycles. Experimentation cycles are discovery-oriented processes where teams gather insights into project requirements, constraints, and design specifications through trial-and-error. Validation cycles are correction-oriented processes where teams align their output with project requirements through incremental modifications. These findings are then built on to develop testable propositions about the relationship between the duration of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities and the innovativeness and quality of team outcomes.</p>

<p>Across the globe, firms in many industries face greater competitive pressures in sales and access to resources due to rapid technological advances. Faced with such pressures, the importance of innovation as a means of gaining a competitive edge and for firms’ overall survival is more crucial than ever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1046496413483326">Amabile, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1046496413483326">Ilgen, Hollenbeck, Johnson, &amp; Jundt, 2005</xref>). Innovation in today’s organizations is a complex and complicated process because it requires the unit responsible for innovating to introduce new ideas or reconfigure existing ones in systems with many parts that interact in unpredictable ways. It is therefore not surprising that teams are often at the core of innovation efforts in organizations. Complicated tasks can be completed sooner by having team members work in parallel. Moreover, teams are able to bring a range of expertise to bear on these complex problems. Common examples of teams include those engaged in product development, research and development, entrepreneurship, and producing scientific knowledge or cultural products such as entertainment.</p>
<p>We refer to these teams as creative project teams because teams members share a high level of interdependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1046496413483326">Saavedra, Earley, &amp; Van Dyne, 1993</xref>) with one another and work under time-scarce conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1046496413483326">Karau &amp; Kelly, 1992</xref>) to produce outcomes that are deemed to be novel and valuable to the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1046496413483326">Amabile, 1996</xref>). Because of creative project teams’ prevalence in organizations, models of team performance that account for how these teams can perform more effectively will have significant organizational implications.</p>
<p>This article focuses on better understanding the processes that creative project teams use to innovate. We rely on prior definitions of team process such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1046496413483326">Marks, Mathieu, and Zaccaro’s (2001)</xref>, which defines it as “members’ interdependent acts that convert inputs to outcomes through cognitive, verbal and behavioral activities directed toward organizing task work to achieve collective goals” (p. 357). These acts include interactions such as goal specification, monitoring the progress of goals, coordination, conflict management, and motivation building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1046496413483326">Marks et al., 2001</xref>). Process, according to this definition, is distinct from cognitive, motivational, and affective states such as team cohesion and team climate, that emerge from the interaction processes in teams.</p>
<p>An emphasis on team processes is critical because there is strong support that team processes, such as having clearly stated vision and goals and strong internal and external communication, are positively associated with innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1046496413483326">Hulsheger, Anderson, &amp; Salgado, 2009</xref>). The challenge for creative project teams, however, is how these processes are implemented in highly ambiguous situations. These teams face a high degree of ambiguity in their quest for the next groundbreaking innovation. For most teams focused on innovation, the ideal solution is difficult to define because evaluations of team outcomes are dependent on the social and temporal context as well as beneficiaries’ idiosyncratic preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1046496413483326">Lampel, Lant, &amp; Shamsie, 2000</xref>). Creative project teams are thus commonly faced with multiple and conflicting interpretations about what an ideal solution is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1046496413483326">Daft &amp; Weick, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1046496413483326">Weick, 1979</xref>). This ambiguity surrounding the specifications of an ideal solution also extends to the means of producing or implementing it. Amid ambiguity, team performance is vulnerable to being derailed by a greater likelihood of delays and errors stemming from difficulties with coordination, more frequent disagreements about how to achieve the team’s goals, and a higher potential for interpersonal conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1046496413483326">Okhuysen &amp; Bechky, 2009</xref>). Indeed, ambiguity creates equivocality about what to do, how to do it, who should do it, when to do it, and how fast to complete it. Clear goals, strong communication, and positive processes are undoubtedly critical to performance in creative project teams, but an outstanding concern is how these processes are implemented in situations where there is a high degree of ambiguity. A performance model of creative project teams should thus account for ambiguity reduction processes since these processes are likely to affect team performance.</p>

<title>Innovation Processes in Creative Project Teams</title>
<p>In light of the prevalence and significance of creative project teams, it is not surprising that scholarship on team innovation has proliferated over the last 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1046496413483326">Anderson &amp; West, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1046496413483326">Drach-Zahavy &amp; Somech, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1046496413483326">Hulsheger et al., 2009</xref>). Examined through the lens of an input-process-output model of team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1046496413483326">Hackman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1046496413483326">McGrath, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1046496413483326">Steiner, 1972</xref>), which has also been adopted in the team innovation literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1046496413483326">West &amp; Anderson, 1996</xref>), much of this research has focused on the effect of inputs. For instance, prior work has examined the role of norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1046496413483326">Caldwell &amp; O’Reilly III, 2003</xref>), group composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1046496413483326">West &amp; Anderson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1046496413483326">Woodman, Sawyer, &amp; Griffin, 1993</xref>), and diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1046496413483326">Cady &amp; Valentine, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1046496413483326">Dahlin, Weingart, &amp; Hinds, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1046496413483326">Gibson &amp; Gibbs, 2006</xref>) on team innovation outcomes. However, the importance of team processes in innovation has not been lost on researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1046496413483326">Bain, Mann, &amp; Pirola-Merlo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1046496413483326">Drach-Zahavy &amp; Somech, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1046496413483326">Hulsheger et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1046496413483326">Taggar (2002)</xref> found that team creativity-relevant processes that include task organization and coordination enabled individual creativity to flourish at the group level in student project teams. Consistent with these findings, Hoegl and colleagues have found a positive relationship between teamwork quality and the performance of teams in R&amp;D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1046496413483326">Hoegl, Weinkauf, &amp; Gemuenden, 2004</xref>) and software development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1046496413483326">Hoegl &amp; Parboteeah, 2007</xref>). Most of these studies, however, either measure team process at a single point in time or measure perceptions of overall process quality, without fully capturing the dynamic nature of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Because most studies treat team processes as static instead of dynamic phenomena, the processes used by creative project teams to successfully develop innovative products are still largely unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1046496413483326">Ancona, Okhuysen, &amp; Perlow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1046496413483326">Arrow, McGrath, &amp; Berdahl, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1046496413483326">Cronin, Weingart, &amp; Todorova, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1046496413483326">McGrath, 1991</xref>). This is problematic because static conceptualizations of process do not adequately explain how inputs are transformed into outputs. In the case of innovating teams that face high levels of ambiguity, it is especially crucial to represent dynamic team processes because in the face of ambiguous goals and expectations, innovation must arise primarily from the process itself. This is evident from the following quote by the creative director of an interactive media development (IMD) studio:<disp-quote>
<p>It actually is a lot harder when the goal isn’t clearly stated, because then the team has to kinda figure it out. And very often, the client comes to you and says, “We want to build a thing kinda like this.” But why? Why do you want to build this? How do you know when it is good? . . . There is a lot of: “We’re going to make it look like this. But, not like <italic>that</italic>.” Well then, what? Why? There’s a lot of swirling around trying to find [the right answer].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This quote suggests that ambiguity is resolved over time as teams strive to figure out solutions through dynamic trial-and-error learning and the examination of multiple alternatives. The transformation of inputs to outcomes in the context of team innovation thus cannot be adequately represented as a static phenomenon, but as a dynamic process that unfolds over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1046496413483326">Mohr, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>To fully understand team innovation processes, a more granular perspective of process that accounts for underlying interaction, behavioral, or activity patterns is necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1046496413483326">Ballard, Tschan, &amp; Waller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1046496413483326">Eisenhardt, 2004</xref>). Capturing these patterns as they unfold provides a more accurate map of dynamic processes than static conceptualizations do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1046496413483326">Bourdieu, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1046496413483326">Brown &amp; Duguid, 1991</xref>), and teams engaged in these dynamic processes will understand more about the pathways that lead to innovative outcomes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1046496413483326">Brett, Weingart, and Olekans (2004)</xref> found that the evolutionary process in negotiating groups did not follow a smooth path as proposed by rational models, but instead followed a helix model where phases of interactions twisted and turned as one phase took over from another.</p>
<p>A more accurate understanding of dynamic process can subsequently inform theories about the effect of the timing of various types of interventions on team performance. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1046496413483326">Gersick’s (1988)</xref> punctuated equilibrium model of group development has been central to research on the timing of coaching interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1046496413483326">Fisher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1046496413483326">Hackman &amp; Wageman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1046496413483326">Woolley, 1998</xref>), feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1046496413483326">Druskat &amp; Wolff, 1999</xref>), and novel contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1046496413483326">Ford &amp; Sullivan, 2004</xref>). In addition, a granular perspective of process that accounts for underlying interaction, behavioral, or activity patterns can also shed light on the effect of temporal variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1046496413483326">Ancona et al., 2001</xref>) on team functioning. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1046496413483326">Tschan (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1046496413483326">2002</xref>) found that completed sequences of action regulation involving goal orientation, task performance, and monitoring were positively associated with performance in medical emergency teams. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1046496413483326">Stachowski, Kaplan, and Waller (2009)</xref> found that fewer, shorter, and less-complex interaction patterns are associated with higher team performance in simulated crisis situations among nuclear power plant control rooms crews. A granular perspective of team innovation processes can thus lead to a better understanding of the complex group interactions involved in team innovation, which can, in turn, advance theories of team innovation and performance as well as contribute to our ability to provide evidence-based prescriptions about how teams can innovate more effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1046496413483326">Ancona et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1046496413483326">Arrow, Poole, Henry, Wheelan, &amp; Moreland, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1046496413483326">Cronin et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the relevance of granular models of team innovation processes to managers, such models are underrepresented in the research literature. Researchers have examined interaction patterns in dyadic negotiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1046496413483326">Brett et al., 2004</xref>) and high-reliability teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1046496413483326">Stachowski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1046496413483326">Tschan, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1046496413483326">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1046496413483326">Waller, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1046496413483326">Waller, Gupta, &amp; Giambatista, 2004</xref>), but not in creative project teams engaged in innovation. Research that has examined patterns in the innovation process has been conducted at the firm level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1046496413483326">Utterback &amp; Abernathy, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1046496413483326">Van de Ven, Angle, &amp; Poole, 2000</xref>), with little work at the group level. A granular understanding of team innovation processes can therefore add to extant models of team innovation by providing insights into the innovation process as it unfolds over time. These models can subsequently contribute to evidence-based prescriptions for how the innovation process can be more effectively managed.</p>
<p>Thus in this research, we adopt a granular perspective of the dynamic innovation process by examining iterative cycles of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities in creative project teams working on interactive media development (IMD) as they unfold over time. Cycles of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities are examined because these are fundamental to action regulation in teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1046496413483326">Frese &amp; Zapf, 1994</xref>), and their sequential completion can lead to a high level of team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1046496413483326">Tschan, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1046496413483326">2002</xref>). Moreover, the plan-enact-review framework bears close similarities to the action-transition phases in Marks and colleagues’ (2001) temporal framework of group process. Cycles of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities are therefore an appropriate framework for capturing iterative processes as they unfold in teams.</p>
<p>We focus on iterative activity cycles because they are commonly adopted by creative project teams and have been found to be positively associated with team performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1046496413483326">Dow, Fortuna, Schwartz, Altringer, &amp; Klemmer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1046496413483326">Dow &amp; Klemmer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1046496413483326">Eisenhardt &amp; Tabrizi, 1995</xref>). The iterative process has been described as a way for teams to learn experientially by building their intuition about the solution under development as well as through trial and error. Iterative processes in this context are not simply a passive, empirical observation of the environment but can also be a proactive attempt at shaping it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1046496413483326">Daft &amp; Weick, 1984</xref>). From this perspective, the iterative process involved is a goal-driven, teleological process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1046496413483326">Poole, Van de Ven, Dooley, &amp; Holmes, 2000</xref>) that involves actively constructing a conceptual framework that is imposed on the environment, followed by a period of reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1046496413483326">Brown &amp; Duguid, 1991</xref>). While these descriptions characterize the functional aspects of iterative processes, there is still a poor understanding about the dynamic nature of these iterative processes in terms of how the activities and interactions that constitute these processes unfold over time. Hence, by examining the fundamental action regulation cycles of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities in IMD teams, the question that we seek to address in this research is how team innovation processes unfold over time. A deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of team innovation processes can contribute to new models of team innovative performance. We illustrate this contribution by drawing on these findings to develop testable propositions about the relationship between temporal characteristics of the iterative process—specifically, the duration of each activity phase—and team innovative performance. In the rest of this article, we introduce the research context, discuss the methods for conducting this research, present findings from this research, and develop the theoretical propositions relating the duration of activity phases to team performance.</p>

<title>Research Context: Interactive Media Development Project Teams</title>
<p>The research setting for this study was project groups developing interactive media (IM) products, as the task of interactive media development provides an extreme case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1046496413483326">Pettigrew, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1046496413483326">Pratt &amp; Kim, 2011</xref>) of a creative project team faced with a high level of ambiguity as part of its task of producing innovative outcomes.</p>
<p>As their name implies, interactive media (IM) products (such as video games, educational tools, and applications for mobile devices) are typically valued as an interactive experience. As the definition and assessment of an interactive experience is highly subjective, product outcome specifications and the means for attaining those outcomes are open-ended and difficult to specify. For instance, an IMD team will need to determine how an objective to build a game that is fun translates into actual gameplay mechanics, software code, and artistic styles. Given the multiple ways in which the concept of fun can manifest in the team’s output, IMD team members are likely to find themselves engaged in tasks that fall into the lower half of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1046496413483326">McGrath’s (1984)</xref> circumplex of team tasks, involving judgmental tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1046496413483326">Laughlin, 1980</xref>) with no demonstrably correct answer as well as undertaking the tasks of resolving conflicts of viewpoints, interests, and power. The subjective evaluation of the IM experience therefore renders project goals highly ambiguous and creates a high degree of equivocation in decision making, making this setting an extreme example of teams faced with a high level of ambiguity.</p>
<sec id="section3-1046496413483326">
<title>Research Site: GameCo</title>
<p>The research site for this fieldwork was an IM studio (hereafter called GameCo) based in a mid-Atlantic city in the United States. At the time, GameCo employed approximately 60 employees with expertise in software engineering, game design, and technical art. Most employees were below 30 years of age. GameCo employees worked in cross-functional project teams consisting of software engineers, game designers, and artists. In addition to the technical experts, a producer was also assigned to each team. Producers played a boundary-spanning role and primarily handled administrative and managerial issues.</p>
<p>Prior IM development projects at GameCo included games on various platforms (e.g., mobile phones, stand-alone entertainment systems, TV plug-in games, Internet browser games) for a wide spectrum of clients that included video game publishers, media conglomerates, theme parks, and a startup toy company, among others. The products developed for each client were unique and varied in dimensions such as gameplay mechanics, game objectives, technological platforms, and visual themes. Even though experiences, knowledge, and skills might be transferable between projects, the idiosyncratic requirements and constraints of each project created a high requirement for novelty, with distinct challenges for each project.</p>
<p>In addition, even though the performance of individual project groups in GameCo varied, the studio as a whole was considered to be successful, as evident from its growth since its founding. This was further supported by informal interviews with senior employees who revealed that a key concern for the studio was managing its growth and expansion, rather than survivability. Thus, even though GameCo could be considered to be relatively young in comparison to long-standing organizations in other industries, it is an established organization in an industry where the base rate of organizational start-up and demise is high. The reputation of GameCo’s senior staff was evident from interviews with industry veterans in the initial phases of this research and from their staff’s regular keynote appearances at major industry professional development events. Project teams in GameCo can therefore be considered prototypical of teams in an overall functional IMD studio.</p>

<p>Project team Alpha was tasked with developing a basketball-themed game for Facebook and mobile platforms. In this game, players would create customized characters and play a simulated two-on-two basketball game against their friends. The client for this project was a team in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with an average attendance of more than 20,000 per home game between 2007 and 2012. Project requirements faced by Alpha were ambiguous in that the client did not have a specific idea of what they wanted except for a few high-level goals. These goals were for a game that would (a) be differentiated from current games in the market, (b) enhance the spectator experience during live games, and (c) potentially serve as an additional revenue stream for the team.</p>
<p>Project team Beta’s goal was to develop a 5-min-long motion-controlled multiplayer game that allowed theme park guests to experience a sea turtle’s journey from the deep sea to its nesting habitat. The resultant game was one where players controlled turtles to avoid obstacles and pick up food as their turtles followed a fixed migratory pathway. The client in this project was a theme park operator based in the United States with average annual attendance exceeding 4 million between 2007 and 2012. Similar to Alpha, goals in this project were also ambiguous. Aside from its broad objective of wanting GameCo to create an interactive experience to complement its exhibit, the other primary requirement was that the interactive experience be accurate and logically consistent, in line with the educational aims of the main exhibit.</p>
<p>Both project Alpha and Beta teams consisted of five core members, with up to five additional members joining the team over the course of the project. These were not previously existing teams, but rather were put together primarily on the basis of how a potential member’s expertise matched the needs of the project and that person’s availability to be assigned to that project. Although these teams did not previously exist, team members were likely to have experience working with one another on prior projects.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This research used a two-case replication design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1046496413483326">Yin, 2009</xref>), which improves the external validity of the findings compared to a single-case design. A case study method was appropriate for two reasons. First, little data or prior theory on the phenomenon of interest existed. Second, since the research question asked about how the phenomenon of interest occurred, the case study methodology was appropriate as it allowed examination of the teams’ processes as they unfolded over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1046496413483326">Dutton &amp; Dukerich, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1046496413483326">Pettigrew, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1046496413483326">Yin, 2009</xref>). Decisions for selecting the research setting, the specific organization (GameCo), and the focal project teams (Alpha, Beta) within this organization were made on the basis of a theoretical sampling strategy. Using cycles of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities as sensitizing concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1046496413483326">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1046496413483326">Patton, 2002</xref>) to guide data analysis, cycles were categorized through a constant comparison method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1046496413483326">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>). These methods are described in more detail in the following paragraphs.</p>
<sec id="section6-1046496413483326">
<title>Sampling Strategy</title>
<p>The basis for case selection in this study was first to use IMD teams as an extreme example of project teams confronted with ambiguous goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1046496413483326">Pettigrew, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1046496413483326">Pratt &amp; Kim, 2011</xref>) so that the phenomenon of interest would be transparently observable. Within the IMD domain, the studio GameCo was selected as the research site because it was a positive exemplar in this industry. Within GameCo, data from project teams Alpha and Beta were selected for data collection because these teams were comparable in scope and duration, overlapped in their life span, and did not share common team members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1046496413483326">
<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>Multiple techniques for data collection were used to serve as important triangulation and supplementary sources for understanding team activities, the IMD process, and other key events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1046496413483326">Jick, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1046496413483326">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1046496413483326">Yin, 2009</xref>). These were (a) direct observations, (b) archival documentation of production processes, (c) semistructured one-on-one interviews, (d) informal interviews, and (e) team artifacts such as videos, game prototypes, artwork, and other outputs.</p>
<sec id="section8-1046496413483326">
<title>Direct observations</title>
<p>The primary source of data for this study was direct observations of project team meetings by the first author. These included both prescheduled and spontaneous team meetings, playtest sessions, and client calls. While he had some interactions with individual members in these teams, these interactions (aside from informant interviews discussed later) were casual and not directly related to the work of the teams that were being observed. Hence his role as researcher in this setting was one of an observer-as-participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1046496413483326">Adler &amp; Adler, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1046496413483326">Gold, 1957</xref>) where he had an overt presence in the research setting and interacted with team members but was only passively involved in their work under observation. The site was visited on a weekly basis and extensive field notes were taken based on his observations. Field notes included details that were not only relevant to the research questions but also included details that enhanced our understanding of the situational context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1046496413483326">Pratt &amp; Kim, 2011</xref>). For example, notes included maps of the meetings to record where people stood or sat; information about who spoke to whom; observations of the general mood; which team members were influential; and team member attitudes toward events, the client, and the project in general. Each visit to the site lasted from 60 min to 4 hr. In total, 25 observations at Alpha and 17 observations at Beta were recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1046496413483326">
<title>Archival documentation of production processes</title>
<p>Another source of data were project documents of production processes. These included (a) project schedules that contained information about deadlines and milestones, (b) design documents that contained information about output specifications, (c) production documents that tracked the status of game assets, (d) email communication among team members, and (e) task tracking and planning documents called <italic>scrumsheets</italic>.</p>
<p>Scrumsheets were documents that were updated daily for planning and coordinating team action. These were spreadsheets that contained detailed information (presented for a 3-week period, as described in more detail below) of the task that each individual was responsible for, the status of the task (i.e., whether it was in progress, blocked or completed, the projected total number of hours required to complete the entire task, and the projected number of hours remaining to complete the task), and the capacity of each team member (i.e., number of hours available). These documents were downloaded daily to provide up-to-date snapshots of group activity.</p>
<p>The work done by these teams was highly interdependent in nature, but they used a distributed approach to complete tasks, in which project members often worked on their own for some time on their assigned pieces of the job. Because of this structure, the scrumsheets served as an appropriate and efficient means of capturing the daily activities at the team level. In fact, scrumsheets were used by producers to monitor team progress and inform decisions on staffing allocations and budgets. Furthermore, these documents were shared with clients as a form of accountability, so there was a strong incentive to accurately represent team activities and progress in these documents. The scrumsheets retrieved for this research captured a total of 1,058 unique tasks for Alpha over 76 days and 527 unique tasks for Beta over 37 days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1046496413483326">
<title>Interviews</title>
<p>Over the duration of these projects, informal interviews were conducted with team members. These interviews were spontaneous encounters with project team members to obtain updates on project progress and to clarify events that had been observed. Each interview lasted approximately 5 to 10 min and was conducted in the open. Handwritten notes were taken during the interviews, which were summarized and included in the field notes immediately after each interview took place.</p>
<p>One-on-one semistructured interviews with two members from each team were conducted separately after the teams’ projects were completed. The duration of these interviews ranged from 60 to 90 min. The informants for these interviews were core members of each team who were involved with the project from inception till end and who were involved in key decisions, such as those relating to design specifications. Informants were asked about project background, events preceding and subsequent to milestones and critical incidents, obstacles faced, their relationships with their clients, and their overall assessment of the teams’ performance. These interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Although these interviews involved informants’ retrospective account of events, the reliability of their recall was enhanced by allowing them to reference team documents and communications through a computer terminal in the interview room. The semistructured interviews provided an additional source for triangulating on how events unfolded in these teams.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1046496413483326">
<title>Team artifacts</title>
<p>Team artifacts are outputs produced by the team and include prototypes of the game under development, artwork, video captures of gameplay, and video recordings of playtest sessions. These artifacts were retrieved either from team members or downloaded from a computer folder that was shared among team members.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1046496413483326">
<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>The units of analysis in this study are cycles of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities. These cycles are temporal segments of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1046496413483326">Ballard et al., 2008</xref>) that can be described as “series of acts, usually, though not necessarily contiguous in time, that relate to the same task content or process contribution” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1046496413483326">Futoran, Kelly, &amp; McGrath, 1989</xref>, p. 222). Cycles of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities thus served as sensitizing concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1046496413483326">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1046496413483326">Patton, 2002</xref>) to aid in data analysis.</p>
<p>These cycles were identified by first unitizing activities and interactions from the data. Following the scheme used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1046496413483326">Tschan (2002)</xref>, these units were coded as <italic>planning</italic> if they related to future states or future actions to be performed. <italic>Enacting</italic> was coded if the unit directly related to task performance. <italic>Reviewing</italic> was coded if the unit referred to actions that had been performed or output that had been produced and was being evaluated. These units were then represented in a time-ordered matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1046496413483326">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>) to keep track of “sequences, processes and flows” (p. 119) of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities.</p>
<p>Categories of activity cycles were then developed through constant comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1046496413483326">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>). This process involved forming initial clusters of plan-enact-review sequences to minimize differences within clusters while maximizing differences between clusters. For example, the nature of planning activities between categories was compared in terms of the people involved and the coordination issues faced by team members. Differences in how planning, enacting, and reviewing activities manifested were then developed from these initial categorizations. New activities and interactions were then compared with previous incidents coded in the same category. Any differences between these incidents were reconciled by refining the definitions and properties of these categories to accommodate the new data. This process of constantly comparing new data with existing codes was continued until a level of stability was reached.</p>

<sec id="section13-1046496413483326">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>We present our findings by first giving a broad overview of how tasks were accomplished in project teams Alpha and Beta. Then, we discuss how sequences of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities manifest as experimentation and validation cycles.</p>
<sec id="section14-1046496413483326">
<title>An Overview of Task Accomplishment in Project Teams Alpha and Beta</title>
<p>After a project mandate had been confirmed, a core team was formed comprising team leads who played the role of project visionaries responsible for shaping the direction of the project and acted as gatekeepers who gave final approval for the team’s output. In both Alpha and Beta, the producer, technical director, art director, and lead designer on the team served as leads. Supporting the core group were peripheral members who were functional specialists largely responsible for output production. The membership of these individuals was more flexible than team leads in that some of them either joined the project midway or divided their time between multiple projects.</p>
<p>The task of designing and producing the interactive media artifact involved a high level of reciprocal interdependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1046496413483326">Thompson, 1967</xref>) between functional roles. For instance, to design a user interface (UI) for a game, the artist would need to know what the artistic theme of the game is, where the UI will be located, how much screen space is available, the information that will need to be displayed, and how the controls will be triggered. These were decisions made by others, not by the artist; thus, as all of this information was distributed among the team members working on each of those items, the UI artist had to coordinate with a number of team members from the other functions. In addition, some of this information was also negotiated (e.g., how controls are triggered), requiring team members from different functional areas to mutually agree on what this information was.</p>
<p>In light of this high degree of reciprocal interdependence, project teams in GameCo, including teams Alpha and Beta, adopted a scrum methodology for project management. Scrum methodology is a project management method commonly used in software and product development. At its core, the scrum methodology involves members of a cross-functional team working collaboratively to accomplish team milestones in a short period of time, similar to a rugby team passing the ball between team members to cover as much distance as a unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1046496413483326">Takeuchi &amp; Nonaka, 1986</xref>). This is in contrast to a linear process where team deliverables are passed from one function to another in a sequential manner, similar to track and field relay team members passing the baton from one member to the next.</p>
<p>Under the scrum methodology, projects were broken down into 3-week cycles called <italic>sprints</italic>. Each sprint was marked by specific team goals or deliverables that the team would work together to complete. At the end of each sprint, team members would meet to assess the progress of a project and plan its next steps, sometimes in consultation with other stakeholders. In doing so, the project’s direction and progress was informed by completed work and estimates of short-term productive capacity that were more accurate than long-range forecasts.</p>
<p>On a daily basis, the members of each team would meet at a predetermined time for no more than 15 min to update one another on the tasks they had accomplished the day before and the tasks they planned to accomplish that day. In addition to giving the team a macro view of their progress, these meetings (called <italic>scrums</italic>) also helped members prioritize their tasks and learn about who they had to coordinate with. For instance, a programmer might state that he needed adjustments to be made to a graphic before he could integrate it into the game. The artist responsible for doing so would then be able to make that adjustment a higher priority to avoid delaying the team’s progress. The scrum process thus allowed for near-constant in-process adjustments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1046496413483326">Weingart, 1992</xref>) at the individual level so that the teams could more rapidly adapt to current realities to accomplish short-term sprint goals.</p>

<sec id="section15-1046496413483326">
<title>Iterative Processes in Projects Alpha and Beta</title>
<p>Cycles of planning, enacting, and reviewing were found to manifest in two distinct forms: experimentation cycles and validation cycles. <italic>Experimentation cycles</italic> consisted of sequences of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities that enabled teams to gather insights into project requirements, constraints, and design specifications through trial and error. In <italic>validation cycles</italic>, on the other hand, the sequences of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities provided feedback for teams to adjust their outputs to be in alignment with project requirements. The following sections elaborate on the properties of experimentation and validation cycles and discuss how planning, enacting, and reviewing activities differentially manifest in the two types of cycles. These differences are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1046496413483326">Table 2</xref>. Although these cycles are discussed independently for analytic convenience, note that they are not mutually exclusive and can co-occur.</p>

<title>Experimentation Cycles</title>
<p>Experimentation cycles are sequences of plan-enact-review activities utilized by the project team to gather insights into project requirements, constraints, and design specifications. YI, a software engineer who was primarily responsible for integrating the software code for the game across different gaming platforms in team Alpha, describes this process as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>Before we had actually started, before we had any files on that kind of assignment, we weren’t actually doing anything that we were committed to. We were just kind of playing around to find how do we do this and how do we play these animations? . . . What part of this is fun? We were experimenting. We were prototyping.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>YI’s comment highlights two aspects of experimentation cycles. The first is that experimentation cycles serve exploratory purposes. In Alpha, this exploration revolved around technical constraints (e.g., “how do we do this,” “how do we play these animations”) and project requirements (e.g., “what part of this is fun”). A clearer understanding of these constraints and requirements subsequently affected design specifications of the final deliverable as well as the work flow required to produce it.</p>
<p>The second aspect of experimentation cycles is the notion of <italic>playing around</italic>, which points to the provisional, trial-and-error nature of the activities within and outcomes of these cycles. This idea of enacting and testing various solutions provides opportunities for team members to acquire direct experience with solution implementation. These direct experiences subsequently develop team members’ intuition about the particular solution under development for the project on which they are working (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1046496413483326">Eisenhardt &amp; Tabrizi, 1995</xref>). Experimentation cycles can be considered to be provisional, in the sense that group outputs in these cycles are usually prototypes designed to explore the feasibility of specific features or functionalities. These ideas are then tested against an array of requirements and constraints, the results of which are not possible to predict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1046496413483326">Simon, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1046496413483326">Thomke, Von Hippel, &amp; Franke, 1998</xref>). In team Alpha, for example, these tests ranged from determining whether a basic prototype of the game could work on different mobile platforms to determining an appropriate graphical theme for the game. In team Beta, tests were enacted with early prototypes to ascertain whether the proposed gameplay was intuitive enough for the target audience.</p>
<p>The exploratory, playful, and provisional nature of experimentation cycles is analogous to a rehearsal for a dance that has yet to be fully choreographed because of uncertainties about performer capabilities and audience preference. The choreography emerges over time by having the performers execute different ideas, which allows the choreographers to develop a deeper understanding of their abilities as well as to evaluate ideas from the audience’s perspective.</p>
<p>Having discussed the broad purpose of experimentation cycles, the activities in each phase are elaborated on by first examining activities in the planning phase, followed by those in the reviewing and enacting phases of experimentation cycles.</p>
<sec id="section17-1046496413483326">
<title>Planning phase in experimentation cycles</title>
<p>The objective of the planning phase is to establish the tasks required to accomplish goals for the next cycle, the people responsible for performing these tasks, the duration of these activities, and the deadline for completion. At GameCo, it was found that there was a low emphasis on collective planning efforts in the experimentation cycles of both teams because these tasks were likely to be performed independently, albeit at the cost of lower-quality output.</p>
<p>This emphasis on independent work was evident from the Alpha team’s assessment of the workflow that would have been required to allow players to customize the height of their characters in the game. At issue was whether the team could implement this feature by stretching the animations within the game. To explore the feasibility of this option, one of the software engineers wrote code to stretch some preliminary animations in the game that had already been created. This was a one-step process involving only one member on the team. In contrast, the regular procedure for integrating a piece of animation into the game is a three-step process involving the animator, the technical artist, and the software engineer.</p>
<p>The lower interdependence between team members in this phase is also evident from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1046496413483326">Table 3</xref>, which shows that only 6.6% and 5.0% of experimentation-related tasks in teams Alpha and Beta respectively were blocked—that is, obstructed from progressing—by the activities of other team members, compared to validation-related tasks, which formed 14.9% and 35.0% of total blocked tasks in Alpha and Beta, respectively.</p>

<p>When task interdependencies in experimentation cycles are low, as in the GameCo teams, coordination between team members is correspondingly simpler. Likewise, there will be a lower need for frequent, multidirectional communication among team members to coordinate effectively. We observed that communications between group members in the planning phase could be characterized into two forms, depending on whether the communication occurred within or between functional areas. Within functional areas, communications tended to involve collaborative problem-solving discussions to determine how ideas could be quickly implemented. Across functional areas, we observed more directive communication consisting of instructions from programmers to others on the team.</p>

<title>Enacting phase in experimentation cycles</title>
<p>Activities in the enacting phase of experimentation cycles directly relate to ideas decided on in the planning phase. These activities are typically experiments that provide the team with insights into project requirements and technical constraints. These experiments manifest in the form of prototypes that emphasize a particular feature to be tested. In Alpha, for example, YI describes how the team explored the technical capabilities and limitations of the mobile devices on which the game would run:<disp-quote>
<p>We just made a quick-and-dirty build on the phone [where we] tried to port it and made sure that we could play an animation of the character and have it all run. So . . . it was just a prototype. Does it run? Just take whatever it is and push it on the phone. And, if it completely failed, we would’ve been in a bad place and if it ran, but it ran slow, we could probably make some adjustments to it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Outputs of experimentation cycles are quick-and-dirty because these prototypes are built to represent a particular feature of the final product and are rarely intended to be a part of the final deliverable. Since the emphasis during enactment activities is on the speed of completion, rather than on technical quality, enacted outputs in experimentation cycles are usually improvised and less elegant or polished than the final deliverable. In the previous example given for project Alpha, in which the customized height question was explored, the software engineer’s use of animations that had already been created is an example of improvising a quick-and-dirty test to explore the feasibility of implementing this possible customization feature. It was also common for GameCo teams to use basic shapes and crude renderings of final art assets as placeholders in the virtual environment. For example, a prototype from Project Beta that was used to explore the feasibility of replicating the turtle’s swimming motion contained simple two-dimensional renderings of the ocean environment and also lacked the rich texture and detail that would have made the environment look more realistic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1046496413483326">
<title>Reviewing phase in experimentation cycles</title>
<p>Activities in the reviewing phase of experimentation cycles involve evaluations of the group’s output and the processes undertaken to produce this output in the enactment phase, followed by forming plausible interpretations of these evaluations.</p>
<p>Performance evaluations of the outputs produced by the team in experimentation cycles are usually exploratory, similar to proofs of concepts. For example, in project Alpha, the evaluation of the stretched animation was to determine whether the end result would satisfy quality requirements. Similarly, in project Beta, initial tests were conducted to verify that the movement of turtles in the ocean could be accurately represented in the game.</p>
<p>The workflow required to implement these ideas is also evaluated in the reviewing phase of experimentation cycles. These evaluations allow team members to better understand project constraints, which facilitates decision making related to design specifications, and to more accurately anticipate resource needs such as staffing and process improvement tools. For example, once the number and type of ocean scenes that the turtles would swim through were confirmed, artists in the project Beta team could then begin producing concept art of various graphics for the game. Concept art served two primary purposes: First, it allowed artists to verify their ideas with team leaders and the client. Second, it gave artists a better understanding of the resource requirements. This process was described by UE, the lead artist for project Beta, as such:<disp-quote>
<p>[What] we were doing with the concept art was visually saying “is this what you mean?” . . . That gives a clear picture . . . of how many assets we are really going to need for an area. [The lead designer] can say this area is a kelp forest, but until we really look at a lot of reference, and draw up from that reference what we would want it to look like, it’s not really clear how [many assets are] required for that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Evaluations of group output and processes in experimentation cycles therefore inform decisions about project scope and specifications—specifically, which features to retain, abandon, or modify as well as the tools and resources that are likely to be required at different points in the project’s lifecycle.</p>
<p>A feature of feedback from experimentation cycles is that it is ambiguous and does not always provide definitive answers to future actions. Feedback may only indicate that changes need to be made, or that an idea is good enough, but it offers limited insights into the correct response, or whether a course of action is the most optimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1046496413483326">Van De Ven &amp; Polley, 1992</xref>). Consequently, a future course of action remains equivocal. In project Alpha, for instance, although evaluations of the stretched animations verified that this option would not satisfy quality requirements, the appropriate course of action—whether the team should explore other solutions to implement this feature, or to ask for an increase in the budget and development timeline, or to abandon this feature completely—was still unclear. This decision was made by developing a plausible story of what reality might be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1046496413483326">Weick, Sutcliffe, &amp; Obstfeld, 2005</xref>) and deciding on a course of action consistent with this interpretation of reality.</p>
<p>The ambiguity of feedback is compounded by evaluations of group output in experimentation cycles that are usually derived from a small number of tests using prototypes that are quick and dirty representations of specific features of the end product. These tests are usually conducted on a small scale because of the unfinished, provisional nature of the output. For instance, playtest sessions at GameCo were usually conducted with no more than 10 participants. Consequently, the generalizability and validity of these tests are potentially limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1046496413483326">March, Sproull, &amp; Tamuz, 1991</xref>). The extent of this limitation, however, is not apparent and may only be discovered much later. For example in project Beta, although the team was able to verify that the movement of turtles in the ocean could be accurately replicated in the game environment being tested, it was unclear that the same level of performance could not be maintained in a more graphics-intensive game environment. In fact, later in the project, serious performance issues were discovered and the team had to reduce the quality of graphic art assets to reduce the amount of computational processing resources required for the game to run.</p>
<p>In light of these equivocal options, the team’s interpretation of feedback about their output from experimentation cycles and decisions about future actions also depend on prior information and predictions about the future. Activities in the review phase are thus similar to a sensemaking process involving Weick et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1046496413483326">2005</xref>, p. 415) “continued redrafting of the story as it emerges.”</p>

<title>Validation Cycles</title>
<p>Validation cycles refer to sequences of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities that enable teams to incrementally align their output with project requirements. Feedback obtained from the review phase of validation cycles provides information about shortfalls in the performance or quality of the team’s output relative to project requirements. For instance, YI describes how the team would receive feedback from its GameCo colleagues who had tried the basketball game with comments like, “I click this button and then this button and it crashed,” or “I don’t understand what these shoes do.” Steps to address these shortfalls are then undertaken by the team in subsequent cycles. In response to the feedback, for instance, YI and the Alpha team would then look into fixing the bug that crashed the game or “[change] a little bit of the art to make things a little more noticeable.” Similarly, UE from project Beta describes this sequence of activity in the team as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>There’s this constant balancing act of adjusting something over here and making sure nothing else got messed up along the way. . . . There’s a lot of cycles going back and forth between myself and [the] design [team members] until it was what they were envisioning.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<sec id="section21-1046496413483326">
<title>Difference between validation and experimentation cycles</title>
<p>A key distinction between validation cycles and experimentation cycles pertains to the team’s output. In validation cycles, team outputs are components of the team’s final deliverable—not just quick-and-dirty tests as they are in the experimentation cycle. Consequently, the primary emphasis in the enactment phase in validation cycles is the technical quality of the team’s output. Validation cycles can be considered to be correction oriented, while experimentation cycles are discovery oriented. Essentially, team actions in validation cycles involve modifying the value of known parameters, adding new features, or removing existing ones rather than building components from scratch.</p>
<p>The second difference between the cycles is the sense of permanence that encompasses validation cycles in contrast to the playful, provisional nature of experimentation cycles. If experimentation cycles are analogous to dance rehearsals where the choreography has not been established, the analogous comparison for validation cycles will be to rehearsals in a symphonic orchestra with sheet music in hand. In this case, the parts to be performed by each musician are already defined and codified. The goal of rehearsals is to adjust specific parts to achieve a well-blended sound at a rhythm, volume, and style that is consistent with the conductor’s interpretation of the piece. In the subsequent sections, the planning, enacting, and reviewing activities in validation cycles shall be elaborated on by contrasting these activities with those in experimentation cycles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1046496413483326">
<title>Planning phase in validation cycles</title>
<p>A feature of the planning phases of validation cycles is the emphasis on coordination, which stems from the fact that team output in validation cycles are components of final deliverables rather than provisional prototypes. Consequently, team members need to actively coordinate their understandings of output specifications and the timing of completion during this phase to minimize errors and delays. The emphasis on coordination during the planning phase of validation cycles was evident in the daily scrums of both Alpha and Beta, where it was common for team members to openly ask what their next tasks were to be after completing a task. Although each member had a list of tasks to accomplish within a 3-week sprint cycle, the priorities of these tasks often shifted during the course of the sprint and tasks were often added to or removed from this list. These priorities were often not determined by a single person when the question was asked but had to be discussed later in short, spontaneous meetings (or huddles) involving the team leads and the respective team member. In these huddles, members would discuss team priorities, the process and resources required to accomplish these priorities, and the team’s capacity to accomplish these priorities. These discussions then yielded a clearer answer about how team members would prioritize their tasks.</p>
<p>The greater emphasis on coordination in validation cycles also necessitated a greater requirement for communication between team members. In team Beta, for example, one of the ways that the team attempted to improve the performance of their game was by reducing the number and size of “collision bubbles” around objects. A collision bubble is a space that two objects in the virtual game environment cannot pass through at the same time, or else they would overlap (or collide) into one another. Reducing the number and size of collision bubbles improves game performance by reducing computational processing. However, this has to be balanced with maintaining the realism of the game so that objects “bounce” off one another in a realistic manner. Decisions about the location of these bubbles and how much to reduce the size of each bubble were observed to involve a detailed discussion between the lead artist (who was responsible for implementing these changes) and the technical director (who was responsible for integrating various components into the main game artifact). This example illustrates the collaborative problem-solving communication between team members across different functional areas that is necessary for effective coordination in the planning phase of a validation cycle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1046496413483326">
<title>Enacting phase in validation cycles</title>
<p>As noted above, the main difference between validation and experimentation cycles is related to the teams’ output. That the team had shifted from experimentation to validation, essentially fine-tuning toward the finished product, was evident from the teams’ emphasis on fixing bugs in the days leading up to playtest sessions that involved members of the public and before a milestone deliverable to the client. The emphasis on the technical quality of outputs was also evident in their avoidance of shortcuts that would compromise the quality of their output in spite of time constraints. Instead of relying on short-term fixes like they might have in the experimentation cycle, teams would commit resources to ensuring more robust and elegant solutions that would enable them to accomplish tasks faster without compromising on quality. For instance, YI described a pop-up messaging system in the Alpha team’s product as being “ugly and just in there,” with limited functionality since “it only worked in a battle” when this feature was first built for their game. After learning that the pop-up system would be used in other parts of the game, however, the programmers developed a more robust system that “with like three lines of code, [a software engineer] can add a new pop-up anywhere they want.”</p>
<p>Another strategy to maintain the quality of their output in spite of time constraints was to reduce project scope. In project team Beta, UE described a meeting among the project leads where they “sat down and said we’re not going to get all this done. We need to cut a couple of segments out.” The decision about what aspects of the project to scale back on was based on a determination of “the story and the concepts we knew we needed,” “[art assets] we could reuse,” and whether that feature “was going to take a lot of scope to figure out.”</p>
<p>When more extensive adjustments to the teams’ outputs were needed during the validation cycle, the resulting changes were unlikely to involve modifications to the underlying architecture of the products but were usually extensions of existing features to improve on them overall. In addition to the pop-up tutorial mentioned earlier in the Alpha team’s basketball game, another example from this project is the implementation of leaderboards showing players with the highest point totals, following a suggestion made by the team’s client midway through the project. The team was able to quickly implement the software code to extract scoring information that was already being collected and stored in the database and to present it in a separate part of the game. The addition of this feature thus did not involve deep-level architectural changes to the relationship between components, but rather was a standalone feature that leveraged some existing components within the game’s code.</p>

<sec id="section24-1046496413483326">
<title>Reviewing phase in validation cycles</title>
<p>Similar to activities in the reviewing phase of experimentation cycles, activities in the reviewing phase of validation cycles involve evaluations of team output. However, the emphasis in validation cycles is to verify that output performs to specifications, rather than to develop plausible interpretations of project goals from the feedback received during this phase. Because of the emphasis on verification, feedback content is therefore focused more on output quality and less on production processes.</p>
<p>Another feature of reviewing phases in validation cycles is that feedback is less ambiguous, especially in comparison to feedback during experimentation cycles. The greater clarity in feedback can be attributed to the fact that discrepancies between the quality of the team’s output and the more concretely understood project requirements are more easily identified. Moreover, teams are likely to already be familiar with the actions required to address these discrepancies because these actions involve modifying the properties of components that have already been built, rather than building components from scratch.</p>
<p>An illustration of activities in the review phase of validation cycles are the weekly “run-throughs” in team Beta, where a few members of the team would play the game while the rest of the team observed and made notes of the parts of the game that could be improved on. For example, software engineers might look out for art assets, such as rock, hooks, or other ocean creatures, that the turtles would pass through instead of collide with; artists might look out for artwork that needed to be retextured to improve the realism of the ocean environment in the game; and game designers might look out for parts of the game that were too easy or too difficult for players.</p>
<p>In light of this less ambiguous feedback and a greater familiarity with the actions needed to address issues, the communication requirements between team members were also lower in the review phase of validation cycles than the review phase of experimentation cycles. In project team Beta for instance, UE describes how he would review one of his artist’s work at the end of the work day by “[stopping] by and [seeing] how things had gone for the day.” During these informal review sessions, UE reported that his feedback to this artist was usually along the lines of, “you didn’t take this far enough yet” rather than, “that’s not working at all.”</p>
<p>Due to the lower communication requirements in this phase, information may also be transmitted among team members through media that are less rich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1046496413483326">Daft &amp; Lengel, 1986</xref>). In project team Alpha, for example, it was observed that performance discrepancies in the team’s output, such as technical bugs, could be listed by any team member in a shared database to which all team members had access.</p>

<title>Implications on the Temporal Characteristics of Activity Cycles</title>
<p>In our analysis of activity cycles in project teams Alpha and Beta in GameCo, we identified experimentation and validation cycles as two distinct cycles, each with its own unique configuration of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities. Differences in how these various activities manifest in each type of cycle can be applied to draw inferences about how the mapping of teams’ activities along the temporal continuum can affect their outcomes. In this section, we draw on these findings to explore, and posit on, the effects that different durations of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities can have on the quality and innovativeness of team outcomes.</p>
<p>Of the multiple dimensions of time that have been proposed by organizational scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1046496413483326">Ancona et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1046496413483326">Bluedorn &amp; Denhardt, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1046496413483326">McGrath &amp; Rotchford, 1983</xref>), we focus on the duration of phases because duration has implications for how tasks are to be temporally segmented. As time is a scarce, nonrenewable resource, a team’s ability to effectively allocate time across its multitude of activities can be critical to gaining a time advantage over its peers in terms of “cycle time, time to market and turn-around time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1046496413483326">Gibson, Waller, Carpenter, &amp; Conte, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Duration bears a complex relationship to other important characteristics, such as pace and frequency. Pace refers to the tempo or rate of activity within a unit of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1046496413483326">Levine, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1046496413483326">McGrath &amp; Kelly, 1992</xref>). A shorter duration of phases will imply a higher pace of activity (holding the frequency of activity constant). Similarly, if the pace of activity is held constant, then a shorter duration will allow for a lower frequency of activities within that phase. It is in this way that “[d]uration surrounds—embeds and is embedded within—rate and frequency” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1046496413483326">McGrath &amp; Kelly, 1992</xref>, p. 414). An underlying assumption in the propositions presented here is that shorter intervals can lead to an increase in the rate of performance, a lower frequency of activities, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1046496413483326">Karau &amp; Kelly, 1992</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section26-1046496413483326">
<title>Duration of Planning Phases</title>
<p>In planning phases, teams faced with shorter durations are likely to rely more on in-process planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1046496413483326">Weingart, 1992</xref>), improvisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1046496413483326">Vera &amp; Crossan, 2005</xref>), and greater simplification of complex tasks. In experimentation cycles, where team outputs are prototypes, relying on in-process planning and improvisation is not likely to have a negative impact on performance. In fact, it may even have a positive impact, as it allows teams to rapidly gain an intuitive understanding of the solution at hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1046496413483326">Eisenhardt &amp; Tabrizi, 1995</xref>). On the other hand, in validation cycles where teams are building the final output, it is important for them to plan in advance as their outputs are final deliverables and therefore are more complex with less room for compromising on output quality. Coordinating team action during the validation phase by using in-process planning and improvisation is therefore more likely to result in delays, which will adversely affect team performance.</p>

<sec id="section27-1046496413483326">
<title>Duration of Enacting Phases</title>
<p>In enacting phases, the higher pace of task performance associated with shorter durations for these activities is likely to result in a greater incidence of errors and correspondingly lower output quality. The higher incidence of errors could be caused by team members being less careful in implementing work as well as fatigue due to team members working harder for longer periods of time and reducing the number of breaks. Other likely responses are to simplify the output to be produced so that fewer tasks are required, or to take shortcuts to accomplish their tasks.</p>
<p>In experimentation cycles, these responses to shorter durations of enactment phases will have less far-reaching consequences on the quality and innovativeness of team outcomes. Since team output in experimentation cycles is provisional, output that is simplified and of a lower quality is more acceptable than if the team was producing output that was to be final. Errors committed during experimentation cycles can even be beneficial to team performance, as these allow team members to discover potential problems earlier rather than later when production of the team’s final output has already begun.</p>
<p>In contrast, low-quality output during the enacting phase of validation cycles has more immediate consequences on team performance. Because team activities are directed toward completing the team’s final output, output quality is a high concern and errors will need to be rectified. Errors thus result in delays as work is replicated to rectify these errors, which in turn compresses the time available for future activities, increasing the chances of more errors and even further delays. Furthermore, project requirements of output quality constrain the degree to which its work can be simplified.</p>

<title>Duration of Reviewing Phases</title>
<p>In review phases, shorter review durations will be associated with less in-depth processing of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1046496413483326">Kelly &amp; Loving, 2004</xref>). This approach to information processing is partly influenced not only by the scarcity of temporal resources but also by the corresponding psychological effects of this scarcity. Shorter durations will increase team members’ need for cognitive closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1046496413483326">Kruglanski &amp; Freund, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1046496413483326">Kruglanski &amp; Webster, 1996</xref>), which increases their preference for unambiguous outcomes even if these are not optimal.</p>
<p>In experimentation cycles, the tendency for teams to engage in less in-depth information processing is likely to result in the team deciding on suboptimal solutions, resulting in poorer outcomes for the team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1046496413483326">West, 2002</xref>). This is because interpreting the implications of feedback in these cycles is a complex decision-making process that benefits from more in-depth information processing due to the equivocality of choices available to the group.</p>
<p>In contrast, the negative impact on performance from less in-depth information processing during the review phases of validation cycles will be weaker. This is because information processing requirements in the review phases of validation cycles are lower. As discrepancies between the quality of the team outcomes and project requirements (which are less ambiguous at this point) are more easily interpreted, feedback and the corresponding implications about subsequent actions required to improve outcome quality are more concrete and less equivocal. Additionally, teams are also likely to be familiar with the actions required to address these discrepancies because these actions involve modifying the properties of components that have already been built rather than building a component from scratch.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this research, we examined cycles of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities in case studies of two IMD teams to develop insights into team innovation processes. Models of team innovation in the extant literature do not sufficiently account for the iterative, dynamic nature of team innovation processes. This gap in our theoretical models of team innovation is problematic because innovation processes in teams do not unfold in a smooth, predictable manner and need to be actively managed. Without an understanding of how these processes unfold to inform theory, evidence-based prescriptions to managers about how the chaotic and messy process of innovation can be more effectively managed will be limited.</p>
<p>Our analysis of the activity patterns in two IMD teams revealed two distinct activity cycles consisting of unique configurations of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities. The first, experimentation cycles, were utilized by the teams to discover project requirements, scope, and constraints through trial and error. The second type of cycle identified, validation cycles, enabled the teams to align their final outputs with project requirements through incremental modifications. The manner in which the planning, enacting, and reviewing activities manifested in each type of cycle were elaborated on in detail.</p>
<p>We then drew on these findings to develop a number of testable theoretical propositions about the effects that different durations of planning, enacting, and reviewing activity phases in each type of cycle will have on team performance. These propositions illustrate how findings from the longitudinal study of iterative processes can deepen theoretical models of team innovation, and they can be used to inform future research to extend these models further.</p>
<p>One implication of the relationships between the duration of activity phases and team performance that can be inferred from the findings in this study is that there is an ideal-type rhythm for each cycle based on the activities that team members are performing. Experimentation cycles would be ideally characterized by short intervals of planning and enacting phases punctuated by longer intervals of reviewing phases, whereas validation cycles would be characterized by longer intervals of planning and enacting phases and shorter intervals of reviewing phases. This idea could be tested in future research.</p>
<p>Another implication extends to the literature on temporal entrainment in teams. Teams have been found to be barraged by multiple rhythms that stem from organizational pacers, such as project deadlines, customer schedules, and external shocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1046496413483326">Ancona &amp; Chong, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1046496413483326">Ancona &amp; Waller, 2007</xref>). While the prior research has largely focused on exogenous rhythms, this research emphasizes the endogenous rhythms that are generated internally by the activities required to accomplish project goals. Emphasizing these endogenous or internal rhythms reinforces the idea of teams having to perform a “dance of entrainment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1046496413483326">Ancona &amp; Waller, 2007</xref>, p. 117) to be effective. It also raises further questions about the repertoire of steps available for teams performing this dance. For instance, teams tend to be conceptualized as being engulfed by, and having to adjust project schedules to keep pace with, varying exogenous rhythms. When one recognizes that team activities also generate endogenous rhythms that can affect team performance, the question then becomes one of how they are able to keep both exogenous and endogenous rhythms in sync. What are the strategies available to them? Which strategies are more or less effective and when? These questions can also be examined in future research.</p>
<p>From a practical standpoint, propositions about the relationship between the duration of activity phases and team performance can remind managers about the potential tradeoffs when making decisions about allocating scarce temporal resources across different activities. As organizations and teams are increasingly faced with having to develop and sustain a time advantage to survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1046496413483326">Gibson et al., 2007</xref>), this research suggests that teams should not blindly operate at a higher pace across all kinds of activities, but that greater discernment about what activities to speed up, maintain, and slow down can be beneficial to overall project team performance.</p>
<p>A limitation of this research is that the sequences of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities were not captured as they occurred. Since the exact moments when transitions from one activity phase to another occurred were not recorded, recursive patterns within cycles, interruptions, and incomplete cycles could not be represented. To do so, activities of team members would have needed to be captured on a more granular timescale, which was impractical in the field setting. Future research could investigate these aspects of activity cycles in more controlled settings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1046496413483326">Brett et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1046496413483326">Stachowski et al., 2009</xref>) and with a greater emphasis on their temporal configurations.</p>
<p>Another concern might be that the generalizability of findings in this research to broader theory might be limited by the idiosyncratic product development process (i.e., scrum methodology) adopted by the focal teams. This concern would be valid if this research attempted to draw conclusions about <italic>when</italic> certain activities occurred since different development processes in various fields would affect the timing of these activities. However, as this research was focused on <italic>what</italic> and <italic>how</italic> the studied activities occurred, the generalizability of findings in this research to theory is not adversely affected by the unique development process adopted by the teams in this case study.</p>
<p>In summary, this research reveals two different pathways by which planning, enacting, and reviewing activities in team innovation processes unfold. Discovery-oriented experimentation cycles are characterized by a lower need for collective planning, an emphasis on the speed of completion over the quality of outputs, and a greater need for interpreting ambiguous feedback. Correction-oriented validation cycles, in contrast, are characterized by a higher need for collective planning, an emphasis on the quality of outputs over the speed of completion, and review phase activities involving verification that team outputs meet project requirements.</p>
<p>Although prior research shows that team processes are critical to team innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1046496413483326">Hulsheger et al., 2009</xref>), these dynamic processes are still enclosed in a black box because prior research tends to conceptualize these as static phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1046496413483326">Cronin et al., 2011</xref>). By conceptualizing team innovation processes as dynamic and examining the activity patterns that underlie these processes, this research sheds light on the underlying patterns of planning, enacting, and reviewing activities that teams engage in to produce innovative outcomes. These findings are an initial but necessary step toward developing theories that account for how temporal variables that relate to the different ways of structuring team processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1046496413483326">Ancona et al., 2001</xref>) can affect innovation outcomes. This contribution is illustrated in the theoretical propositions presented about the effects that the duration of planning, enacting, and reviewing activity phases have on the innovativeness and quality of team outcomes.</p>
