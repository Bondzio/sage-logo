<p>This article examines the linguistic patterns associated with the forms of representation of Marxist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries, the main illegal actors in the internal Colombian conflict, on the reporting in the Colombian press of their violent actions. The analysis is based on a 300,000+ word specialised corpus of hard news reports on the conflict from four major Colombian newspapers. The analytical tools used are Van Leeuwen’s network for the representation of social actors and an adaptation of Hasan’s cline of dynamism. In addition, the epistemic modality of ownership of the crimes reported is examined. The results reveal remarkable differences in the reporting of the actions of both groups.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article examines the forms of representation of illegal actors in the internal conflict in the Colombian press. With the second highest number of internally displaced people in the world after Sudan, more fatal victims than all Latin American military dictatorships combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0957926513482063">Viera, 2009</xref>), and serious global ramifications such as the illicit drug trade, it is clearly an issue worthy of attention. The results presented in this article are part of a doctoral research project aimed at identifying linguistic patterns in the reporting of violent actions committed by Marxist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries in four major Colombian broadsheet papers. The purpose is to establish whether there is a correlation between these patterns and the generalised perception of paramilitaries as ‘self-defence’ forces protecting the population from guerrilla attacks in the absence of the State. Contrary to this perception, human rights violations records show that paramilitaries are responsible for at least 75% of the killings in the conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957926513482063">Comisión Colombiana de Juristas (CCJ), 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Examining the media in order to attempt to find at least a partial explanation of this disparity between public perception about the conflict and the statistical evidence seems appropriate, especially considering the fact that a large majority of Colombians (up to 90% according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0957926513482063">Ipsos/International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), 2009</xref>) have not experienced the conflict directly. Hence, it is fair to assume that their main source of information about it is the mainstream media, whose portrayal of events, despite claims of objectivity, does not consist of ‘raw facts’, but is rather an interpretation of events from the perspective not of the journalist as an individual, but as a member of a dominant institution with a particular set of beliefs and interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957926513482063">Fowler, 1991</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957926513482063">Bell (1998</xref>: 64) points out:<disp-quote>
<p>. . . the media are important social institutions. They are crucial presenters of culture, politics and social life, shaping as well as reflecting how these are formed and expressed. Media ‘discourse’ is important both for what it reveals about a society and because it also itself contributes to the character of society.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The inequalities, injustices and prejudices of a society are bound to be evident in the media’s construal of events and social actors. Members of the society sharing these values are likely to accept these as ‘objective’ representations of reality because these interpretations have been normalised in the everyday language used to construe them. For instance, most Colombians seem to be blind to the oxymoronic nature of a headline such as ‘Otra masacre de las autodefensas’ (Another massacre by the self-defence forces). Using the word ‘self-defence’, with its clear denotation of legality and inalienable rights, to denominate a group that massacres helpless peasants on a regular basis is probably inconceivable in other societies. Yet this collocation produced almost 10,000 Google hits from Colombian pages. It is precisely because of the daily repetition of this type of linguistic pattern in media texts that ideologies such as the legitimation of violence by one of the armed groups in the conflict can be successfully assimilated and reproduced in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957926513482063">Fairclough, 1989</xref>: 54).</p>
<p>This study clearly falls within the scope of critical discourse analysis (CDA), a discipline which, among other goals, aims to unpack the ideological content of socially relevant texts through linguistic analysis. Aided by tools and concepts from corpus linguistics (CL), this work is solidly grounded in systemic functional linguistics (SFL henceforth), which, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957926513482063">Chouliaraki and Fairclough (1999</xref>: 139), is the linguistics theory ‘which … has most in common with CDA and most to offer to CDA’. This article focuses mainly on the realisation of experiential meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957926513482063">Halliday, 1978</xref>), more specifically the participants and processes associated with them. The specific analysis tools employed are the concepts of differentiation and indifferentiation from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0957926513482063">Van Leeuwen’s (1996)</xref> network for the representation of social actors and an adaptation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0957926513482063">Hasan’s (1985)</xref> cline of dynamism.</p>
<p>Before delving into the theoretical concepts already briefly outlined, or their application to the analysis of the reporting of the conflict, it is important to gain some understanding of the conflict itself and the complex network of political, economic and territorial interests at stake; for ‘discourse analysis is essentially historical: language cannot be interpreted without understanding what is going on in a particular social and political context’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957926513482063">Fowler and Marshall, 1985</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>Rather than a report of statistics, the following section recounts one of the most tragic attacks on the civilian population, the Bojayá massacre. This event was selected not only because it illustrates the role of all the legal and illegal actors in the conflict, but also because it marked an historical break in the treatment of guerrillas and paramilitaries by the State, the civilian population and even the international community. In addition to providing a detailed context for the analysis, it explains the motivation for conducting this research.</p>

<title>Context and motivation</title>
<p>On the disturbingly long list of war crimes committed in the internal Colombian conflict, the Bojayá massacre in the Chocó province stands out not only because of its devastating consequences, but also because it illustrates the complexity and level of degradation of the conflict. In early May 2002, Colombians were shocked by the single most deadly event in the history of the 40-year-old conflict: over a hundred people, mostly women and children, had been killed by a homemade mortar launched on a rural church by the leftist guerrilla Farc.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0957926513482063">1</xref></sup> The event was presented by the media as ‘genocide’, quoting the then President of Colombia, Andrés Pastrana, who asked for international condemnation of the insurgents. The tragedy not only made international headlines, but had serious repercussions as well. The European Union relinquished its hopes for a negotiated solution to the conflict and decided to add Farc to their list of terrorist groups, which they had refused to do even after this guerrilla’s inclusion in the US list released after the 9/11 attacks. This ended an era of Farc’s diplomatic visits to the Europe, where members presented themselves as Robin Hoods fighting for the rights of the oppressed classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957926513482063">Carroll and Brodzinsky, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Nationally, the attack made the possibility of re-negotiating for peace with guerrilla groups inconceivable. For the past three years, the Farc had enjoyed a 42,000 km<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0957926513482063">2</xref></sup> demilitarised area as part of the conditions for a peace process with the government. Yet this had been used as a sanctuary for retreat following increasing attacks on the military and the civilian population alike. The negotiations were unilaterally ended by the government in February 2002 after the guerrillas hijacked a plane to kidnap a senator. Most of the presidential candidates in the ballot to be held at the end of May of the same year had been promising to start the peace process anew, this time with clear guidelines and the effective supervision of international bodies such as the United Nations (UN) and the Organization of American States (OAS), but the images of the broken Christ among the carnage in the ruins of the Bojayá church changed everything. The winner was Alvaro Uribe, who never participated in the peace process and advocated for a ‘get-tough’ military stand against the guerrillas. At the same time, he started peace negotiations with the right-wing paramilitary, who had committed at least three times more murders than the guerrillas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957926513482063">CCJ, 2007</xref>), and who also played a major role in the Bojayá massacre.</p>
<p>Bojayá is a humble riverside settlement in the province of Chocó, a rainforest area in mid-western Colombia bordering the Pacific Ocean and Panamá. While 80% of its population, mostly of African and indigenous descent, lives in poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957926513482063">Bonet, 2007</xref>), the region is extremely rich in biodiversity; palm oil plantations; mineral resources such as oil, gold and platinum; and a vast hydroelectric potential; all in the hands of multinational corporations. In addition, its strategic location makes it a coveted target of illegal armed groups for drug trafficking and weapon smuggling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0957926513482063">Richani, 2005</xref>). With so many economic interests at stake, the region is no stranger to violence; the massacre of 2002 was the deadly climax of a plot that had been developing since at least the late 1990s.</p>
<p>In May 1997, paramilitaries of the Peasant Self-defence Forces of Córdoba and Urabá (ACCU, Spanish acronym) murdered 22 civilians in different villages along the Atrato River in the provinces of Chocó and Antioquia. Their aim was to obtain information about a guerrilla front which had ambushed a military patrol and kidnapped 10 soldiers. They suspected the guerrillas were hiding in the area with the cooperation of the civilian population. The murders were their way of announcing their control over the area and warning of the consequences of aiding the guerrillas. The massacre continued, but the death toll cannot be calculated since the paramilitaries not only threw the bodies in the river, but forbade anyone to recover them and bury them. Unlike the widespread coverage of the 2002 massacre, these events barely reached a regional newspaper and generated no response from the office of the governor of the time, Alvaro Uribe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957926513482063">Ferrer and Restrepo, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The paramilitaries continued to hold power over the area with the complicity of the local authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0957926513482063">Colombian Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OACNUDH), 2002</xref>) through the strict control of incoming fuel and food, as well as massacres aimed at generating terror among the population and selective murders. Yet in 2000, Farc attacked the police station in Vigía del Fuerte, located across the river from Bojayá, killing 21 officers – some of whom were mutilated – and nine civilians, accused of cooperating with the paramilitaries. The event was qualified as barbaric, and the military did not hesitate to question the validity of the peace negotiations in progress with the government. The press and the media in general covered the aftermath in detail, highlighting the brutality of the attack.</p>
<p>In late April 2002, the paramilitaries tried to regain control of the region. A group of 250 paramilitaries arrived in Vigía del Fuerte by boat, suspiciously escaping detection by three military posts in the river. Again, they announced a ‘cleansing operation’ to rid the area of guerrilla aides. The Red Cross, the UN and the Ombudsman repeatedly alerted the government to the imminent tragedy, but were completely ignored. The guerrillas, determined not to lose control of the area, attacked the paramilitaries, who were greatly outnumbered. These fled across the river to Bojayá, where people had sheltered in the local church, the only cement structure in the village. The paramilitaries tried unsuccessfully to enter the church and continued to repel the attack from its surroundings. The guerrillas launched several mortars, one of which landed in the altar of the church. The survivors woke up in a pool of flesh, blood and debris. The difficulty in gathering scattered body parts set the initial body count at 119, but this was later confirmed as 79. The army did not arrive in the area until four days later, when the image of a crying general holding a bloodied baby shoe exploded in the consciousness of Colombians.</p>
<p>The Chocó situation not only illustrates the complexity of the Colombian conflict, but shows a distinct pattern of concealment and indifference towards paramilitary violence and indignation and outrage at guerrilla actions. An initial version of the events published in the press placed the paramilitaries in the area with the purpose of rescuing a kidnapped governor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957926513482063"><italic>El País</italic>, 2002</xref>); later, the coverage completely omitted their role in the tragedy, focusing on the guerrillas as those solely responsible. The UN report on the events, however, disagreed, assigning most of the blame to the guerrillas, but also accusing the paramilitaries of using civilians as a shield in the confrontation and the State for failing to protect its citizens despite the repeated warnings. Yet in the minds of the public, Farc were the only culprits.</p>
<p>This trend in public opinion is not limited to the case of the Bojayá massacre, but to the conflict in general. Two different polls showed that, to a significant percentage of Colombians, paramilitaries were only minor agents in the conflict, defending areas abandoned by the State from guerrilla violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957926513482063">Ipsos-Napoleón Franco, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0957926513482063">Urtak, 2010</xref>). Despite the 5000 killings committed during the peace negotiations with the paramilitaries, there were no public outcries calling for an end to the dialogue. The peace commissioner’s response to the denouncement of their violations of the truce by the UN and human rights organisations was that ‘the ceasefire is a metaphor that needs to be handled with a lot of flexibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957926513482063">Gallón, 2011</xref>). The mitigation, concealment and legitimation of paramilitary violence in the mainstream media suggested by preliminary studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957926513482063">García, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957926513482063">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0957926513482063">Pardo, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0957926513482063">2007</xref>) may contribute to the perpetuation of a social model where the fight against terrorism is used as an excuse to expand the economic and territorial power of the ruling classes at the expense of the life, integrity and basic rights of the common citizen.</p>

<title>Corpus and analytical framework</title>
<p>In the field of the social sciences, and particularly in CDA, it is widely accepted that ‘mass media and the apparatus of reaching out to collective minds gain a central role in proliferating, topicalizing, de-topicalizing and creating <italic>knowings</italic> and/or beliefs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0957926513482063">KhosraviNik, 2009</xref>: 478), which has made media discourse a central object of study within the discipline. This influence in society is largely, although not exclusively, achieved through language. Media representations of events in the outside world are necessarily encoded in language. As powerful as visual images are, they cannot be interpreted without the help of linguistic cues. This process of encoding and interpretation is not the product of a single isolated individual, but one that involves and reflects the value systems of a society. This has been referred to as ‘the social construction of reality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957926513482063">Berger and Luckman, 1967</xref>) or ‘the construal of experience through meaning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0957926513482063">Halliday and Matthiessen, 1999</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957926513482063">Bennett (2003</xref>: 4–5) explains:<disp-quote>
<p>The ‘objects’ of which language speaks are not ‘real objects,’ external to language, but ‘conceptual objects’ located entirely within language. The word ‘ox,’ according to Saussure’s famous example, signifies not a real ox but the concept of an ox … This is not to deny that there exists a real world external to the signifying mantle which language casts on it. But it is to maintain that our knowledge or appropriation of that world is always mediated through and influenced by the organizing structure which language inevitably places between it and ourselves.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the case of the reporting of the conflict, the layers of ‘signifying mantles’ pile up starting from the witnesses’ and/or authorities’ accounts of the events, the journalist’s account based on that information and occasionally his/her own observations, and the editor’s revisions to the journalist’s text. Hence, the final product is a hybrid displaying to different degrees the interpretation of the events of the sources and the institution providing the information to the public, which ultimately contributes to the establishment of a socially shared set of beliefs on the issue being reported.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, these forms of interpreting the world or ideologies are not the result of one text, let alone one lexico-grammatical feature such as agent deletion or passivisation. Instead, they are the result of a syndrome of patterns across an increasing number of texts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0957926513482063">Whorf (1956)</xref> explored the connections between language and cultural behaviour, contrasting Hopi and Western European attitudes to time, space and matter and how they are construed in language, concluding that:<disp-quote>
<p>They do not depend so much upon ANY ONE SYSTEM (e.g. tense, or nouns) within the grammar as upon the ways of analyzing and reporting experience which have become fixed in the language as integrated ‘fashions of speaking’ and which cut across the typical grammatical classifications, so that such a ‘fashion’ may include lexical, morphological, syntactic, and otherwise systemically diverse means coordinated in a certain frame of consistency. (p. 158)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If concepts that appear as ‘common sense’ and uncontroversial as time and space are understood by communities in the light of the language spoken as manifested by a network of linguistic features, then it can be assumed that the interpretation of complex social phenomena such as the Colombian conflict is also largely influenced by the way it is described and talked about.</p>
<p>The concept of ideology manifested in a set of linguistic patterns or ‘fashions of speaking’ is taken up by several linguists including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0957926513482063">Hasan (1996</xref>: 148), who refers to ‘a configuration of patterns in rapport with each other’ to explain the genesis of attitudes towards women’s work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957926513482063">Butt (1983</xref>: 34, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957926513482063">1988</xref>) refers to a ‘semantic drift’ as ‘the kind of meanings to which the reader’s attention is being drawn’. Hence, in order to establish that an ideology minimising paramilitary violence is being reproduced in the Colombian press, it is necessary to uncover a consistent set of lexico-grammatical patterns backgrounding their role in the conflict.</p>
<p>For this article, the focus will be on three aspects: how guerrillas and paramilitaries are named; what participant roles are assigned to them; and how they are introduced (or not) in descriptions of violence. To answer the first question, concepts from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0957926513482063">Van Leeuwen’s (1996)</xref> system network for the representation of social actors will prove useful. This author maps the options through which social actors are included in or excluded from discourse. One of these options is the dichotomy differentiation versus indifferentiation. The first term refers to a form of inclusion that ‘explicitly differentiates an individual social actor or group of social actors from a similar actor or group, creating the difference between “self” and the “other”, or between “us” and “them”’ (p. 52). Hence, indifferentiated forms make it impossible to distinguish between similar actors or groups, creating the potential for concealment of responsibility, over-generalisation and mystification.</p>
<p>The analysis of participant roles is grounded in the concept of transitivity from an SFL perspective; that is to say, on ‘the type of process expressed … with the participants in this process, animate and inanimate, and with various attributes and circumstances of the process and the participants’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0957926513482063">Halliday, 1967</xref>). To this end, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0957926513482063">Hasan’s (1985)</xref> concept of dynamism will be applied. Dynamism is defined ‘as the quality of being able to affect the world around us, and of bringing change into the surrounding environment’ (p. 45). A participant is said to have a more dynamic role depending on the type of process and the impact of this process on other participants. Thus, a participant carrying out a material process (e.g. run, cook) will be more dynamic than one carrying out a verbal process (e.g. say, tell), for instance. Likewise, a participant acting on an animate entity will be more dynamic than one acting on an inanimate one.</p>
<p>While the analysis of dynamism has the participants as a starting point, it is also necessary to complement this perspective with the process. Thus, the most common processes expressing violence – <italic>asesinar</italic> (to murder) and <italic>matar</italic> (to kill) – were examined to determine what kind of participants (if any) were assigned to them.</p>
<p>In order to be able to make claims about the potential influence of the media in the reproduction and dissemination of this particular ideology, the analysis of a few texts will not suffice. It is necessary to build a specialised corpus, according to a list of criteria, that will ensure appropriate representation for the phenomenon under study. The use of specialised corpora is already a standard practice in discourse studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957926513482063">Baker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957926513482063">Baker et al., 2008</xref>) and their analysis from a systemic functional perspective is gradually gaining relevance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957926513482063">Bednarek, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0957926513482063">Hunston and Thompson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The corpus for this study consists of 554 news reports on violent acts committed by either guerrillas or paramilitaries from the major newspapers of the four largest Colombian cities: <italic>El Tiempo</italic> from Bogotá; <italic>El Colombiano</italic> from Medellín; <italic>El País</italic> from Cali; and <italic>El Heraldo</italic> from Barranquilla. The news reports were selected based on the number of victims, their prominence, or their representativeness as members of a particularly targeted social group (i.e. unionists, community leaders, journalists). The reports were classified first according to the perpetrator of the violent act (guerrillas or paramilitaries), and second according to the time period of the publication (1998–2002 or 2002–2006). In order to establish a limit to the number of reports for each subcorpus, the concept of ‘saturation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0957926513482063">Teubert, 1999</xref>), or ‘point of diminishing returns’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0957926513482063">Matthiessen, 2006</xref>), was adopted. This point is reached once the number of word types remains stable or shows little variation despite an increase in the number of tokens. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0957926513482063">Matthiessen (2006</xref>: 108) suggests a limit for specialised corpora of 15,000 words. The saturation measure based on the number of type and tokens for these subcorpora was established between 15,000 and 20,000 words, equivalent to 30 to 40 texts.</p>
<p>Each text was named with the initial of the newspaper where it was published (C for <italic>El Colombiano</italic>, H for <italic>El Heraldo</italic>, P for <italic>El País</italic> and T for <italic>El Tiempo</italic>) followed by the initial of the perpetrator (G for guerrillas or P for paramilitaries) and 1 or 2 depending on whether the report was published in the first time period for analysis (1998–2002) or the second (2002–2006). This three-character combination was followed by an underscore and the date of publication in the year.month.day format and another underscore followed by a keyword such as the location of the event or the name of the victim. For illustration purposes, the news report on the paramilitary massacre in El Salado published in <italic>El Heraldo</italic> on 23 February 2001 was named HP1_2001.02.23_SALADO.</p>

<title>Representation of the illegal actors in the Colombian conflict</title>
<p>This section aims to answer the following question: How are the illegal actors in the internal conflict represented in the Colombian press? Part of this representation consists of how these are ‘identified’, ‘named’ or ‘referred to linguistically’. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0957926513482063">Hodge and Kress (1979</xref>: 5) point out, ‘Whatever has a name can become familiar, and is easier to classify and remember. Only what has a name can be shared’. Hence, the different names assigned to the illegal actors are a significant factor in the public’s perception of their role in the conflict.</p>
<p>Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0957926513482063">Van Leeuwen’s (1996)</xref> socio-semantic categories, it will be determined how frequently guerrillas and paramilitaries are included in the discourse, and how explicit this inclusion is. Furthermore, the level of dynamism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0957926513482063">Hasan, 1985</xref>: 46) of specific forms of inclusion will be examined. And finally, it will be established how frequently and in what ways the illegal actors are included in relation to the social activities of ‘murdering’ and ‘killing’. In other words, the goal is to obtain a picture of how violent actors are named in general, what type of activities they are assigned when referred to explicitly, and whether they are excluded or included (and if so, how explicitly) when violence is described.</p>
<p>It might be useful to start by defining the terms in question. The word <italic>guerrilla</italic>, literally translated as ‘small war’, originated in the 19th century in reference to the Spanish resistance against Napoleon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0957926513482063">Laqueur, 1975</xref>). It is defined by the Espasa-Calpe Spanish Language Dictionary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957926513482063">2005</xref>) as:</p>
<list id="list1-0957926513482063" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>a group of armed civilians not belonging to the regular army, who fight attacking the enemy by surprise and in skirmishes, thanks to their knowledge of the terrain;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>this warfare technique.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This definition separates guerrillas from official State armies; however, it does not specify who the enemy are or what their motivation or goals might be. A look at a specialised dictionary may help clarify the term. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0957926513482063">Verri (1988)</xref> describes guerrilla warfare as ‘used in national liberation wars, as well as in non-international armed conflicts by dissident armed forces or organised armed groups who act with aims to change by arms the State’s constitutional order’. Hence, the illegality of the group is inscribed in this definition.</p>
<p>The word ‘paramilitary’, on the other hand, was coined in 1935 in France to refer to the fascist-leaning leagues rioting for the imposition of an authoritarian regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0957926513482063">Jenkins, 2006</xref>). While its origins denote clear far-right tendencies, the definitions offered by different dictionaries are void of such connotations, for instance ‘civil organisation with military-like structure or discipline’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957926513482063">Espasa-Calpe, 2005</xref>). The Greek prefix ‘para’ means both ‘alongside, near, beside’ and ‘against, contrary’, but given other uses such as ‘paramedic’ or ‘paralegal’, it is more likely to be interpreted as the first. Furthermore, the specialised definition clearly categorises it as an organisation with legal functions: ‘organ of a party in conflict that, incorporated to its armed forces, is in charge of keeping public order’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0957926513482063">Verri, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Combining manual analysis with frequency lists obtained with the freeware Antconc 3.2.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957926513482063">Anthony, 2011</xref>), a list of synonyms, meronyms<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0957926513482063">2</xref></sup> and superordinates<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0957926513482063">3</xref></sup> of these two terms was compiled. On the frequency list of each guerrilla subcorpus, the most common lexical word was FARC (also Farc), the Spanish acronym for Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia, with up to 70 instances per 10,000 words. Given that each text is about 500 words long on average, this figure means that the word ‘Farc’ statistically appears three to four times per report.</p>
<p>The paramilitary subcorpora offer a more heterogeneous picture. In <italic>El Colombiano</italic> (CP1 and CP2), the most frequent term is <italic>autodefensas</italic> (self-defence forces). The word not only denotes legality, but also an inalienable right. While it could be argued that this use stems from the group’s self-proclamation as ‘United Self-defence Forces of Colombia’ (AUC, Spanish acronym), the Farc are never referred to as ‘revolutionaries’, which has strong positive connotations. The acronym <italic>AUC</italic> (also Auc) is the most common term in <italic>El País</italic> (PP1 and PP2), and <italic>paramilitares</italic> in <italic>El Heraldo</italic> (HP1 and HP2). In <italic>El Tiempo</italic>, in the first period (TP1) the most common term is <italic>autodefensas</italic>, and in the second period (TP2) it is <italic>paras</italic> (short for paramilitaries). None of these terms rank as the most frequent lexical word in any of the subcorpora, and their normalised (instances per 10,000 words) frequencies on average reach only 35 instances in the first period and 25 in the second, that is to say, between two and three instances per text, approximately half the number of times the guerrillas are mentioned.</p>
<p>In addition to these, around 50 different terms were found to refer to guerrillas and paramilitaries. This is not counting the proper nouns referring to specific members of these organisations. Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0957926513482063">Van Leeuwen’s (1996)</xref> network for the representation of social actors, it was established that these terms could initially be classified into two large groups: differentiated and indifferentiated terms. The criteria for differentiation was whether or not the term indicated to which of the two types of illegal actors identified in the Colombian conflict the group or member belonged. For instance, in (1), the term used – <italic>hombres armados</italic> (armed men) – could refer to either guerrillas or paramilitaries, while <italic>insurgentes</italic> (insurgents) in (2) clearly shows the affiliation of the illegal actors.</p>

<p>The differentiated terms were further sub-classified into ‘generic’ and ‘specific’. The ‘differentiated generic’ category covers terms that apply to all the different groups of the same ideology.

<p>As their military structure suggests, each guerrilla or paramilitary organisation is divided into smaller units that operate in assigned territorial areas. These are called <italic>bloques</italic> (blocs) covering large regions of the country, subdivided into <italic>frentes</italic> (fronts) or <italic>comandos</italic> (commands) which control smaller areas and carry out military attacks. While all terms apply to both types of organisation, ‘bloc’ is more frequently associated with paramilitary groups, and ‘front’ with guerrillas. Since these terms denote parts of the larger organisation, they were grouped under the heading ‘meronyms’. In the reporting of the events of the conflict, the specific unit responsible for the attack may or may not be specified in the text, as seen in (5) and (6).</p>

<p>This level of specificity in the reporting depends largely on the information provided by official military forces, and, once established, it adds to the level of certainty of the knowledge about those responsible for the event, or its epistemic modality (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957926513482063">Bednarek, 2006</xref>) or status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0957926513482063">Hunston, 2011</xref>). In other words, once a particular military unit has been pinpointed as responsible for an attack, it is hard for the reader to question the veracity of that statement even when evidence is rarely provided for the claim. The use of meronyms contrasts greatly with the choice of differentiated generic forms collocating with expressions indicating low certainty such as <italic>presuntos</italic> (alleged) or <italic>al parecer</italic> (apparently), as in (7).</p>

<p>Hence, five categories for the representation of illegal actors in the Colombian conflict were identified. These are: indifferentiated, not distinguishing between groups of opposing ideologies; differentiated generic, an umbrella term for all groups of the same ideology; differentiated specific, referring to specific organisations; meronyms, indicating subgroups of these organisations; and nominated forms, or names of specific individuals. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957926513482063">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the different forms of representation. Appendix 1 contains all forms of representation found in the corpus.</p>

<p>The questions now are, first, how frequently each of these categories is used, and second, whether there are any patterns in the assignment of participant roles to these different forms of representation.</p>
<p>In order to answer the first question, each of the terms found for each of the five categories were searched in the corpus; concordance lines were extracted and the number of instances per newspaper recorded and normalised. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957926513482063">Figures 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957926513482063">5</xref> show the results per category for each of the newspapers.

</fig>
<p>In line with the first findings regarding the frequency of the terms ‘guerrilla’ and ‘paramilitaries’, the frequency of guerrilla terms exceeds that of the paramilitaries in every newspaper by 27% in the first period and by 38% in the second period, on average. With respect to similarities in the distribution among the five distinct categories, it is observable that nominated forms and meronyms are much less frequently used for both groups than other forms of representation. However, notice that in the guerrilla subcorpora, meronyms are used about twice as often as in the paramilitary subcorpora in both periods. This suggests a higher level of specificity in the reporting of guerrilla actions.</p>
<p>The most remarkable difference is the contrast between the frequency of indifferentiated and differentiated specific forms by perpetrator, reaching extremely significant levels in all newspapers in both periods. That is to say, in the reporting of guerrilla actions, authorship is assigned explicitly, whereas in that of paramilitary actions, responsibility is attributed to ‘armed groups’ or similar expressions that may refer to any of the groups in the conflict, thus obscuring their visibility.</p>
<p>Furthermore, differentiated generic forms in the paramilitary subcorpora collocate more frequently with expressions denoting low certainty such as <italic>al parecer</italic> (seemingly), <italic>supuestos</italic> (alleged) and <italic>presuntamente</italic> (presumably), which cast a doubt over responsibility for the crimes committed. Before calculating the frequencies of these collocations, it was necessary to examine the concordance lines to establish whether what was being qualified as uncertain was authorship, the event itself or any other aspect of the report. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957926513482063">Figure 6</xref> summarises the results for every newspaper contrasting the two periods.</p>

</fig>
<p>The graph shows that the frequency of low certainty expressions collocating with forms of representation of illegal actors in the conflict is higher in every newspaper and period in the paramilitary subcorpora. The newspaper with the highest frequency of this kind of expression is <italic>El País</italic>, which showed a proportional number of differentiated forms. Thus, in addition to a preference for indifferentiated forms of representation, the degree of certainty in the reporting of paramilitary actions is diminished by the higher frequency of the type of modal expressions mentioned above, as seen in examples (10) and (11).</p>

</list>
<p>Up to this point, a pattern of vagueness versus explicitness in the reporting of paramilitary actions contrasted with that of the guerrillas has been established, based on the high frequency of indifferentiated forms of representation and differentiated forms collocating with expressions of low certainty.</p>
<p>The next step is to determine what participant roles the differentiated forms of representation are assigned. In other words, when illegal actors are named explicitly, what type of actions do they carry out? And who or what do they act upon? For this purpose, the linguistic tool selected is an adaptation of Hasan’s cline of dynamism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0957926513482063">1985</xref>: 46). The criteria for establishing a higher level of dynamism were three: the type of process carried out (material vs other); the type of goal impacted on (human vs other); and the more delicate material process type (elaborating vs other). Unlike in Hasan’s original cline, it was considered necessary to establish the human versus non-human criteria rather than using animate versus inanimate, in order to differentiate between ‘killing humans’ and ‘killing cattle’, for instance. In the same line, a more delicate distinction of process type was required to distinguish between different kinds of material processes. Material transformative processes, as the name suggests, realise a transformation in an already existing participant (as opposed to material creative ones). These are classified according to the outcome of the process – the type of change effected on the participant. Thus (material transformative) elaborating processes indicate changes in the physical features of the participant. For example, ‘to kill’ indicates a physical change in state (from alive to dead). Most processes of violence in the corpus (i.e. shoot, burn, mutilate, decapitate, massacre) belong to this type and are considered to be more ‘dynamic’ than extending or enhancing ones indicating changes in possession (e.g. stealing, kidnapping) or location (displacing) respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0957926513482063">Halliday and Matthiessen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The sample for analysis was selected randomly from each subcorpus by extracting the top 50 concordance lines for the most frequent differentiated forms (e.g. Farc, guerrilla, Auc, <italic>autodefensas</italic> (self-defence groups)) in alphabetical order. From these, lines with participants in grammatical metaphors or not as the head of the nominal group were eliminated. The final samples for each subcorpus were between 40 and 50 concordance lines, for a total of 692 lines analysed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957926513482063">Figures 7</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957926513482063">9</xref> show the percentages of each type of participant role for guerrillas and paramilitaries for each newspaper and period.</p>

<p>Given the seriousness of the violence reported, it is not sufficient to establish how often participants act on humans, but what kind of actions victims are subjected to as well. These range from displacement and robbery to torture and massacre. Hence, a more delicate distinction of material process type was employed, contrasting elaborating processes (i.e. wound, torture, kill) with extending (i.e. rob, kidnap) and enhancing (i.e. throw out, take away) processes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957926513482063">Figure 9</xref> shows the results.</p>
<p>Again, samples from the guerrilla subcorpora show a higher percentage of participants in the role of Actor in an elaborating process with a human goal. The only exceptions are the HP1 and PP1 subcorpora. While in the previous analysis (Actor + Human Goal), <italic>El Colombiano</italic> (CP1) showed a higher percentage of this type of structure in the paramilitary corpus, from the more delicate classification it can be deduced that most of the actions inflicted on the victims were of the extending or enhancing type, as illustrated by example (16).</p>

</list>
<p>Whereas <italic>El Heraldo</italic> and <italic>El País</italic> present more cases of Actor + Elaborating Process + Human Goal in the first period in the paramilitary subcorpora, the trend is reversed in the second period. To summarise, in general the guerrillas are presented as killing people more often than the paramilitaries, despite statistics revealing the opposite.</p>
<p>This result poses the question of whether paramilitary violence is being reported at all. With at least a 4:1 ratio of paramilitary to guerrilla victims, how can the subversives be attributed most of the killings? The frequency lists reveal that in fact the lexical items <italic>asesinar</italic> (to murder) and <italic>matar</italic> (to kill) appear more frequently in every paramilitary subcorpus. This contrast calls for a detailed analysis of the clause configurations used to express violence, more specifically murdering and killing.</p>
<p>As a first step, all concordance lines for the lemmas <italic>asesinar</italic> (to murder) and <italic>matar</italic> (to kill) were extracted from the corpus. From these lists, forms in nominal groups (i.e. <italic>asesinato</italic>: murder, <italic>asesino</italic>: murderer, los asesinados: <italic>the murdered</italic>) were discarded. Then the Agent was identified in each of the concordances, and grouped into differentiated or indifferentiated forms. Whenever the Agent was ellipsed, a common feature in Spanish, the co-text was searched for the referent and coded accordingly. Non-agentive forms such as passive voice or third-person plural (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957926513482063">García, 2013</xref>) were labelled as implicit. Examples (17) to (20) illustrate this classification.</p>

<p>Since indifferentiated forms do not allow the reader to identify the group responsible for the crimes, these and implicit forms were grouped together and contrasted with the differentiated forms. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0957926513482063">Figure 10</xref> shows the percentage of implicit or indifferentiated Agent in clauses where the process is murdering or killing.</p>

<p>Not only are implicit and indifferentiated forms more frequent in each of the paramilitary subcorpora, the contrast with the guerrilla subcorpora is also statistically significant in each case, with the exception of <italic>El Heraldo</italic> in the second period. This means that in up to 88% of instances of the reporting of killings and murders, the paramilitaries are either completely excluded from the clause or referred to in indifferentiated forms such as ‘armed men’ or ‘the armed group’. While they may be mentioned explicitly elsewhere in the text, they are often not directly linked to the activity of killing.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The analysis shows remarkable differences between the reporting of guerrilla and paramilitary actions. The contrast can be characterised as one of explicitness versus vagueness, with the trend increasing in the second period under examination. While guerrillas are frequently referred to in differentiated terms that allow for the identification of those responsible for the attacks, in the paramilitary reports indifferentiated forms are more frequently selected. In addition, paramilitary differentiated forms collocate more frequently with expressions denoting low certainty, casting doubt over the authorship of the crimes.</p>
<p>The examination of participant roles assigned to the differentiated forms reveals that guerrillas are in general construed as more dynamic, or capable of affecting the world, than the paramilitaries. That is to say, guerrilla forms of representation more frequently collocate with material processes, often of the elaborating kind (i.e. killing, wounding) affecting humans. Focusing on this type of process, more specifically <italic>asesinar</italic> (to murder) and <italic>matar</italic> (to kill), the analysis reveals that in the paramilitary reports, these collocate significantly more frequently with either indifferentiated (e.g. ‘armed men’) or implicit forms, again concealing the identity of the criminals.</p>
<p>These are only some of the linguistic patterns present in the reporting of the Colombian conflict that construe a semiotic space where paramilitaries are minor agents of violence in contrast to the guerrillas. Other patterns to explore include the construal of death and killing, evaluative language and textual organisation.</p>
<p>The mystification of the paramilitary role in the conflict may have contributed to a lenient attitude from civilian and military authorities, as well as the population in general, that has remained indifferently unmoved in the face of the genocide and forced exile imposed on the most vulnerable. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0957926513482063">Whorf (1956</xref>: 148) points out, ‘people act about situations in ways which are like the ways they talk about them’. Thus, one step towards the solution of the Colombian conflict is to change the way it is framed in language, assigning responsibility where it is due, identifying the motivations behind every act of violence and acknowledging the suffering of all victims.</p>
