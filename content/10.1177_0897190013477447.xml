      <p>In their pivotal paper on change, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP)<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190013477447">1</xref>
         </sup> outlined a set of visions or goals for building the workforce of pharmacy departments in hospitals. Its overall intent was to maximize our profession’s expertise in medication management to help meet the growing challenges in healthcare of the 21st century. These visions or goals were a

            </list-item>
         </list>
      </p>
      <p>The last Vision or goal in this ASHP article is even more important as we move ahead on our great adventure, our Practice Model Change. I am talking about leadership.</p>
      <disp-quote>
         <p>“Strong leadership will be required to provide and sustain comprehensive Professional vision for pharmacy departments”</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>Miriam Webster’s dictionary defines leadership in many different ways. A leader (lead·er \lē-dər\) is 1: something that leads: as a: a primary or terminal shoot of a plant; (2): something for guiding fish into a trap or a person who leads: a (1): a person who directs a military force or unit (2): a person who has commanding authority or influence. With this said, one begs to question: who in pharmacy is a leader? Is it the director of pharmacy, the college professor, the residency preceptor? I would suggest it’s ALL of us, whether it be the above, a clinical staff pharmacist or specialist, the ambulatory care pharmacy clinician or the IV room practitioner. Leadership in pharmacy is embedded within the first two ASHP goals, the <italic>Vision of Teamwork</italic> and the <italic>Vision for Pharmacist Responsibilities.</italic>
      </p>
      <sec id="section1-0897190013477447">
         <title>A Foundation for Leadership</title>
         <p>The <italic>Vision of Teamwork</italic> states, “Pharmacists will continue to be the only health professionals with the depth and breadth of knowledge about, and interest to focus their full time attention on, the use of medicines.” And why not? </p>
         <p>Pharmacists spend 4 (or more) college years concentrating primarily on pharmacology and clinical therapeutics. Some pharmacists have 1-2 years of post-graduate residency training and <underline>all</underline> have extensive experience in the evidence-based use of medications. This expertise is recognized among our interdisciplinary peers and physician organizations acknowledge the value of the pharmacist including the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). As more physicians and nurses observe the value of a pharmacist at the patient’s bedside, they have and will continue to insist that a pharmacist be on their team. As I like to say “Pharmacists will always know more about medications than physicians and other health care providers – PERIOD.”</p>
         <p>With this competence and confidence in hand, pharmacists can take that expertise in medication use and apply it to the next vision. The <italic>Vision for Pharmacists’ Responsibilities</italic> directs pharmacists to “apply their time to direct, interdisciplinary patient care to ensure the best use of medicines by individual patients.” Whether it be in an inpatient or ambulatory setting, clinical pharmacists review individual patients’ medication orders for safety, effectiveness, and cost and collaboratively manage medication therapy, educate patients and caregivers about medications and their use, and conduct medication use evaluations to ensure we are doing the right thing when it comes to pharmacotherapy. Integrated into this process is the proper and safe preparation and distribution of these medications to our inpatients and outpatients. It is in this environment that we become leaders, leaders in medication management.</p>

         <title>So Why All of Us Are Leaders?</title>

         <p>I have had several of my colleagues ask me why I consider them leaders in health care. They are not directors, supervisors, or managers. They don’t have any pharmacists, technicians, residents, or students reporting to them. Well, the answer lies in what you do, your everyday activities as a pharmacy practitioner. Let me give you a few examples.</p>
         <p>There is no doubt that Dwight D. Eisenhower (Commander, Allied Forces, WWII, US President [1890-1969]) was a leader in the truest sense. He said that leadership is “the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it.” So when a pharmacist convinces a provider during rounds that a particular pharmacotherapy is the correct course of action, they are leading the team. The same can be said when a patient starts taking a medication the correct way after you counsel them. Overall, the pharmacist has led the interdisciplinary team and the patient to the correct use of medications.</p>
         <p>The German novelist Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe (1749-1832) got it right when he stated, “What chance gathers she easily scatters. A great person attracts great people and knows how to hold them together.” I have two great infectious disease clinical specialists at Montefiore Medical Center. Along with the antibiotic stewardship physician, they are responsible for the approval of all restricted antibiotics at our two largest campuses. That expertise never goes unnoticed. The ID teams that Drs Yi Guo and Philip Chung round with don’t start seeing patients without them. They recognize their expertise, their leadership in medication management.</p>
         <p>Just like Drs Guo and Chung, I think all of us in our profession need to consider ourselves as leaders in the management of drug therapy. A leader is one who finds that therapeutic dilemma about pharmacotherapy and challenges it. As the medication expert, pharmacists maximize that drug therapy for the betterment of their patient. Effective leadership is the abilty to get others to perform as you intended them to perform. </p>

         <title>The NYSCHP Leadership Development Program</title>
         <p>Implementing a change in how pharmacists deliver patient-centered pharmacotherapy will require our profession to change the way in which all health care professionals, including patients, view pharmacists and how they deliver medication-related care. This will invariably require, among other things, new or enhanced skills in how we communicate to patients, our colleagues, and health care administrators (ie, the “C” suite), a better understanding of the ever-evolving heath care landscape and that confidence that comes with knowing that we <underline>are</underline> medication experts. </p>
         <p>To that end, the NYSCHP has initiated an ongoing series of lectures or seminars to achieve this needed change. The goals of the NYSCHP Leadership Development Program (LDP) are to:
<list list-type="bullet">
               <list-item>
                  <p>Enhance leadership skills of NYSCHP members,</p>

            </list>
         </p>
         <p>The NYSCHP LDP will be structured as a series of at least 4 lectures or programs offered at established NYSCHP events: Leadership Development Conference (February), Annual Assembly (April or May), Mid-Year Clinical Meeting (October), and the Winter Program (January). Topics will encompass several areas facing current and future pharmacy leaders including:

         <p>These and related topics can help provide the needed tools we as pharmacists need to develop as more effective and successful leaders. Please don’t hesitate to contact the council office or any member of the NYSCHP Board of Directors for any comments or questions on how you can participate.</p>
         <p>John Quincy Adams once said that “If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.”</p>
         <p>You as pharmacists are leading health care providers and patients to optimal medication management. You are that leader…</p>
