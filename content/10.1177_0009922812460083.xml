<abstract>
<p>Home-related injuries are overrepresented in children from low-income households. The objectives of this study were to determine frequencies of home safety behaviors and the level of agreement between parental self-report and observed safety practices in low-income homes. In a prospective, interventional home injury prevention study of 49 low-income families with children &lt;5 years old, a trained home visitor administered baseline parental home safety behavior questionnaires and assessments. There was high agreement between caregiver self-report and home visitor observation for lack of cabinet latch (99%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 88%-99%) and stair gate use (100%, 95% CI = 88-100%). There was lower agreement for the safe storage of cleaning supplies (62%, 95% CI = 46%-75%), sharps (74%, 95% CI = 59%-85%), and medicines/vitamins (83%, 95% CI = 69%-92%) because of the overreporting of safe practices. Self-reports of some home safety behaviors are relatively accurate, but certain practices may need to be verified by direct assessment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>More than 4.5 million US children are injured in the home annually, and children younger than the age of 5 years have a higher risk of being injured in the home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812460083">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812460083"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812460083">3</xref></sup> Many of these injuries are preventable, including falls, poisoning, drowning, and fire-/burn-related injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812460083">4</xref></sup> Socioeconomically challenged children are overrepresented in this population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812460083">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812460083">6</xref></sup> This increased risk occurs primarily because these children are more likely to live in unsafe environments and because safety devices (eg, window guards and cabinet safety latches) may be unaffordable or less of a priority compared with necessities such as food and shelter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812460083">7</xref></sup> Injury prevention efforts directed at home injuries may be based on parental self-reports of home safety practices. It is unclear, however, if these parental self-reports are reliable and if any problems with their reliability are secondary to false reporting or a lack of knowledge of correct safety practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812460083">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812460083"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812460083"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812460083"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812460083">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Safer Homes Program was developed as a home safety intervention program for urban low-income, minority families with children younger than 5 years old in the home, identified through the primary care clinic of an urban hospital. The focus of the program was to provide home safety education and equipment to these families using a hospital-based primary care clinic home visitor. The objectives of this study were to assess baseline home safety practices as well as the level of agreement between parental self-reported and observed home safety practices in this urban, socioeconomically challenged population.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0009922812460083">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>We conducted a prospective home safety intervention study for urban low-income families seen in an urban tertiary care hospital primary care clinic from December 2007 to May 2009. This study was approved by the study site’s institutional review board.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922812460083">
<title>Selection of Participants</title>
<p>Caregivers with children younger than 5 years of age in the home living within certain urban zip codes were eligible for the study. The zip codes of residence were chosen for their proximity to the hospital and high prevalence of low-income families. Eligible families were identified and recruited by a research assistant, who was also the trained home visitor, on the day of a child’s primary care well-child visit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922812460083">
<title>Home Safety Intervention</title>
<p>At the baseline home visit, written informed consent was obtained, demographic information was collected on a structured data collection form, and the home safety assessment was conducted in 2 parts. First, the home visitors would administer the home safety assessment questionnaire by reading the questions (in English or Spanish) and recording the answers on a standardized home safety assessment form. The questionnaire included 27 questions about home safety behaviors and child passenger and bicycle safety as well as questions about any history of injuries to children in the home. In the second part of the home safety assessment, the home visitor recorded on a standardized form whether certain safety practices were observed during the visit and completed a safety assessment checklist. The home visitors provided home safety education to the family as needed as well as a basic home safety kit. For any other needed safety items, as determined by the home safety assessment (eg, stair gates and window guards), the family was referred to the hospital where it would be provided free of charge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922812460083">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive frequencies were calculated for the self-reported and observed home safety behaviors as determined from the home safety assessment and the home safety checklist. Fisher’s exact test was used to analyze home safety behaviors based on type of housing. The percentage agreement was calculated to compare the self-reported answers for home safety practices with the behavior observed during the home visit. κ Agreement statistics are not reported because the prevalence was far from 50%, making the κ artificially low despite high levels of agreement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812460083">13</xref></sup> Analyses were conducted using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).</p>

<title>Study Population</title>
<p>In all, 50 caregivers were enrolled in the study from December 2007 to February 2009; however, 1 caregiver was removed from the study at her own request after a home visit was completed. All families received some type of governmental assistance for low-income families, including 30% living in public housing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812460083">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Home Safety Assessment</title>
<p>In the baseline self-report home safety assessment, caregivers reported low use of cabinet latches and stair gates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812460083">Table 2</xref>). On the observed safety assessment checklist, families were noted to have low use of electrical outlet covers, window guards, and Poison Control Center stickers on the telephone (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922812460083">Table 3</xref>). There was no significant difference in the use of stair gates or window guards, regardless of whether the family owned or rented their home or if they lived in public housing or not. Only 25 caregivers reported that they were able to control the water temperature in their homes; 30.6% of the participating families had water that was tested to be at ≥130°F. In addition, there was no significant difference in the presence of 2 unobstructed exits, evidence of chipping paint, water temperature ≥130°F, or having a family fire escape plan whether the family owned or rented their home or whether or not they lived in public housing.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This home injury prevention study highlights low use rates for home safety devices in this urban low-income population, with higher self-reported rates for safety practices that did not require equipment. There was a high level of agreement between parental self-reporting and observed practices regarding the low use of stair gates and cabinet latches. In contrast, there was less agreement concerning the safe storage of dangerous materials, which was a result of parental overreporting of safe practices.</p>
<p>Home safety behaviors, including the use of working smoke alarms, presence of stair gates, and safe storage of sharp kitchen objects, have been associated with lower rates of hospital admission for injury and suggests that families exhibiting these practices may be “safe” in other behaviors, leading to decreased hospitalizations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812460083">14</xref></sup> A Cochrane Review of studies using home safety education concluded that home safety education programs, especially those providing home safety equipment, were effective in improving behaviors related to fire/burn, poisoning, and fall safety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812460083">7</xref></sup> More importantly, however, these programs have demonstrated decreases in rates of medical visits for injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812460083">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812460083"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812460083">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Compared with previous home safety intervention studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812460083">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812460083">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812460083">17</xref></sup> our urban low-income families reported lower use rates for cabinet safety latches and stair gates, which was consistent with the observations of the home visitor. Our families also were observed to have low rates for other behaviors where home safety equipment was required, including the presence of window locks/guards, poison center phone number sticker on the phone, and electrical outlet safety covers. This may be a result of a lack of knowledge about the importance of these behaviors in decreasing home-related injuries and/or lack of resources to obtain the necessary items.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812460083">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812460083">8</xref></sup> Home visitor–based home safety programs have demonstrated increases in home and child passenger safety practices in low-income families after their intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812460083">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812460083">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812460083"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812460083"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812460083">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our families also reported high rates of positive behaviors in the areas of safe storage of cleaning supplies, knives/sharps, and medicines/vitamins. However, there was discrepancy between the home visitor’s observed behaviors because of the overreporting of some practices. Some of the differences between the self-reported and observed behaviors appeared to be related to lack of knowledge about the potential dangers of these substances. For example, parents did not realize that vitamins with iron are a potential hazard and, therefore, did not store them out of reach of children.</p>
<p>One study measuring the validity of a self-reported questionnaire on fire, fall, sharps storage, and poisoning safety found a high degree of consistency between self-report and observed behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812460083">22</xref></sup> Another study of the validation of parents’ self-reported practices concluded that self-reports of fire/burn, bicycle, and child passenger safety were generally reliable but that parents overstated the presence of working smoke alarms and use of properly fitted bicycle helmets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812460083">12</xref></sup> Head Start parents participating in a home safety study were found to more reliably report the use of a safety practice or device compared with the absence of the behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812460083">10</xref></sup> In contrast, the families in our study had overall accurate reporting of the lack of use of safety devices. However, there was less reliability in the comparison of self-report with observed behaviors in the areas of safe storage of cleaning supplies, sharps, and medicines/vitamins.</p>
<p>Primary care injury prevention counseling can be a cost-effective method to decrease pediatric injuries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812460083">23</xref></sup> and is associated with improved safety behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812460083">24</xref></sup> In pediatric providers’ discussions of the importance of home safety behaviors, those practices that do and do not require equipment should be included. In our urban low-income population, we found low use rates for certain safety devices. Information on resources available to obtain these devices may be helpful if provided during an office visit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922812460083">25</xref></sup> Our study found that unsafe storage of dangerous materials was sometimes the result of a lack of recognition of the potential toxicity of the agent (cleaning supplies, vitamins). In these cases, discussion by primary care providers with the parents about what is potentially toxic and how to safely store these materials, even without devices, is also an important injury prevention intervention.</p>
<p>There were several limitations to our study. One of the primary challenges was recruiting families to enroll in the study, which influenced the population included in the study. There was also difficulty in arranging the home visits and barriers included loss of interest in the study, difficulty contacting the caregiver, and unstable living situations. Families who did participate in the home visit may be more safety conscious, although we still demonstrated low prevalence of some home safety behaviors, especially when safety devices were required. Because of our specific eligibility criteria, including only low-income residents living in an urban area, the results of this study may not be generalizable to other populations.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the results of our study found a high rate of agreement between parental self-report and direct observation regarding the low level of compliance with home safety behaviors that required safety devices. There was a lower level of agreement between parental self-report and observed home safety behavior when a safety device was not required. In areas where there was a lower level of agreement, this was sometimes a result of parental overreporting of safe behaviors or lack of knowledge of what materials could be dangerous to their young children. These differences in agreement rates must be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of home safety programs. Continued anticipatory guidance by pediatric practitioners about what is unsafe for children and how to best use safety devices is important for preventing home-related injuries in urban low-income-group children.</p>
