<body>
<p>The subject of “drugs” is a broad topic that nonetheless tends to evoke a uniformly negative response. The idea that drug use is synonymous with pathology and pain is reinforced by media depictions of drug users in various states of degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094306113491548">O’Malley and Valverde 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094306113491548">Tiger 2011</xref>). Reality television shows such as <italic>Intervention</italic> and <italic>Celebrity Rehab</italic> visually reinforce the idea that habitual substance use is a chronic downward spiral to “rock bottom.” Panics over particular illicit drugs remind us, often in moments where societal concern about drugs is on the wane, that the perils of ignoring the personal and social costs of habitual substance use are great. Images of drug addicts serve as warnings about the dangers of illicit drug use even as many of us seek to improve ourselves through legal drugs, called medicine. These negative views are bolstered by and reflected in much of the social scientific research on drugs, which is characterized by a fetishism for “empiricism” that often masks moral judgments. Habitual drug use is often called “addiction” and researchers tend to emphasize the pathology of drug users, their environments, and increasingly their brains.</p>
<p>The view that drug use is a kind of badness and addiction, a kind of sickness, constitutes the dominant ideology that informs most research and writing on drugs. The editors of <italic>Drugs and Culture: Knowledge, Consumption and Policy</italic>, Geoffrey Hunt, Maitena Milhet, and Henri Bergeron, explain that their goal is to “give voice to an alternative approach to drug research” in an environment where “pathologization and criminalization are the dominant perspectives on psychoactive drugs” (p. 1). <italic>Drugs and Culture</italic> focuses broadly on the “social context” of drug consumption while the second book under review, Leslie Paik’s <italic>Discretionary Justice: Looking Inside a Juvenile Drug Court</italic>, provides an in-depth examination of the criminalization of young drug users in the United States. These two very different books address the origins and consequences of the pathologization of drugs and drug users, and suggest ways to move beyond the status quo of demonization and punishment.</p>
<p>Broken into three parts and comprised of sixteen chapters and an introduction, <italic>Drugs and Culture</italic> briskly moves through an examination of the “social cultural rituals, subcultures and macrostructural factors” of drugs. Part I, “Knowledge: Science, Medicine, and Discourses on Drugs,” attempts to dismantle assumptions about drugs by looking at the origins of this knowledge. Ross Coomber’s chapter connects the prevailing “drug myths” (about their dangers and addictiveness) to fear, specifically “the fear of difference” about who is using drugs; drugs are associated with the abject Other and thus threaten the social order. The problem, as Coomber notes, is that “discourses of fear” prevent “rational discussion” when it comes to drugs. He argues for a “sociology of fear” approach to “empirically understand the nature of fears around drugs” (p. 27). While Coomber hints at the importance of cultural representations of drug users, no chapter in the volume addresses this understudied aspect of the way drugs operate in culture. Popular media is filled with images of drugs users that certainly help bolster the myths addressed by most of this volume’s chapters.</p>
<p>The rest of the chapters in this section focus on the role that “scientific” knowledge plays in framing the “problem” of drug use. Tom Decorte’s brief but important chapter examines the morality behind the “science” of drugs and addiction. The “scientific fear of being high,” he rightly argues, produces a “moral-medical concept of ‘addiction’” (p. 36) and other “ridiculous excrescences” that do little to advance our understanding of drugs and their effects. Patrick Peretti-Watel’s promising but thin chapter focuses specifically on the role epidemiology has played in producing ideas about drug-related “risk” that are “moral and ideological” but couched in the language of science and public health. Peter Conrad and Thomas Mackie provide a brief historical overview of the “emergence of and resistance to the medicalization of opiate addiction” (p. 70) in one of the few chapters to focus on a legal but highly regulated drug. Didier Fassin’s chapter “This is Not Medicalization” attempts to provoke by suggesting that the medicalization of addiction is not always for the worse, arguing that it introduces “new moral forms” and not just “social control.” Like with other chapters in this volume, this author raises promising ideas but does not follow through on them in a way that adds to the existing, and more thorough, critiques found elsewhere. Michel Kokoreff’s chapter uses France as a case study to ask why drug users were an “epistemologically ambivalent object” (p. 99) for so long in that country’s research community. All the chapters in this section point to the interrelationship between ideologies of drugs and the research community, emphasizing, with varying degrees of originality and depth, the morality behind knowledge production about drugs and drug users.</p>
<p>The book’s Part II, “Consumption: Cultures of Drug Use,” focuses on empirical examinations of the rituals around drug use. Randall Collins’ chapter uses the example of smoking to connect status rituals to drug consumption, arguing that prohibition rarely is related to a drug’s physical qualities. The three subsequent chapters in this section focus on drugs in “dance scenes,” “technosubcultures,” and “rave cultures,” providing geographically diverse accounts of the social setting for drug use. Molly Moloney and Geoffrey Hunt discuss the concept of “gender flexibility” showing how rave cultures are about far more than just drug use. Most of these chapters echo other research about drug scenes; they are ethnographically detailed but add few new ideas. Milhet and Catherine Reynaud-Maurupt’s chapter introduces the important idea of “consumer citizens” in relation to drug use in “post-industrialized individualistic society” where individuals are looking for “an immediate and frenzied satisfaction of…desires” (p. 166). The notion of “consumer citizen” could easily be applied to legal drugs; the absence of a discussion of cultures of consumption, around pharmaceuticals especially, is notable in this volume and could have helped this section seem less redundant.</p>
<p>Part III focuses on the policy context for drug control and prohibition. David Courtwright and Timothy Hickman intriguingly argue that drug policy in the United States has moved toward criminalization because of “cultural conflict,” specifically a reaction against “‘soft’ moral liberalism” by “anti-modernist conservatives” who favor policies based on punishment and abstinence (p. 223). Peter Reuter’s chapter offers an overview of global drug policies, showing how the United States is an outlier among Western nations, although his chapter offers a somewhat simplistic account of drug policies, including drug courts (about which Paik’s book goes into great detail). Philippe Bourgois’s chapter on politically structured suffering in the U.S. drug war repeats much of what he has written elsewhere but serves as a theoretically sophisticated analysis of the “structural policy dysfunction” of the war on drugs and “how larger power relations interact with individual failings at the intimate level” (p. 257). The final two chapters examine policy in France and Europe, offering little analytic insight but descriptive balance to the focus on the United States.</p>
<p><italic>Drugs and Culture</italic> is an expansive volume that makes it suitable for an introductory course on drugs. It competently handles existing issues in a clear and readable way and has a broad geographical focus. It does not consistently cover new terrain however, making it somewhat repetitive of the small body of critical research on drugs already extant. Cultural representations of drug users, the proliferation of drug surveillance technologies, pharmaceuticalization, and the increasing dominance of “neuroscientific” constructions of addiction are just a few areas that the volume missed. The volume succeeds as an introduction to many of the issues that affect drug studies and as a compilation of some of the important scholars in the field.</p>
<p><italic>Discretionary Justice</italic> offers an in-depth examination of one particular criminal justice strategy in the United States for dealing with young offenders in the criminal justice system. Leslie Paik’s ethnography of a juvenile drug court in Southern California, where young defendants (called “clients” in the book) who plead guilty to a felony offense serve their sentence in court-mandated (and monitored) drug treatment, focuses on the social construction of compliance and accountability within this hybrid therapeutic environment. Paik explains that the focus of juvenile drug courts is “…not only regulating drug use but also reshaping these youths into more responsible citizens who engage in positive activity” (p. 4). These courts actively construct what it means to be responsible through their punishments of young people for things that are not necessarily illegal but considered inappropriate for youth. Youth in these courts can face punishment ranging from fines to stints in juvenile hall or probation camp for infractions such as skipping school, being disrespectful to their parents or guardians, or staying out late.</p>
<p>As the only ethnographic book about juvenile drug courts, <italic>Discretionary Justice</italic> is a major contribution to the literature about coerced drug treatment (most of which focuses on adults). Her chapter on the social construction of drug tests results offers a fascinating view into how seemingly “objective” data on drug use is interpreted by drug court staff based on their evaluations of a youth’s “character.” Drug tests became “uncertain verdicts” in the hands of staff who sometimes respond to negative tests with increased surveillance under the assumption that the initial drug test failed and more surveillance would root out noncompliance. This chapter in particular stands out as an important contribution to surveillance studies as drug testing in other settings (e.g., schools, families) expands. Also, this chapter provides clear evidence for her argument that “noncompliance is an interactively constructed notion” (p. 7).</p>
<p>As Paik explains, juvenile drug courts are “a surveillance mechanism designed as treatment” (p. 22). While regular drug testing is a crucial form of surveillance, these courts also rely heavily on the youths’ families to serve as the court’s “eyes and ears” (p. 99), for an additional layer of surveillance. Because these courts are dealing with youth, conceptualized as dependent, they require the participation of families in the court processing. The court would routinely categorize parents according to their willingness to cooperate. Good parents understood the importance of accountability and compliance while incompetent ones did not have good “parenting skills,” uncooperative ones resented the court intervention, unreasonable ones were overly controlling of youth, enabling ones covered up their child’s drug use, and uninvolved ones had little interaction with the courts. Most parents resented the financial demands made on them by the court. Youth were fined when they appeared in court, and required to pay restitution fees for infractions, and fees for custodial supervision; the amounts families owed ranged from $200 to $30,000. These courts put a considerable burden on families as well as youth who often had difficulty meeting the demands placed on them. As one mother told Paik, “this probation is not only his but mine. It has really affected me because it is like living, but not freely…It is a lot of stress” (p. 101).</p>
<p>Paik’s concluding chapter refers to the “(In)justice of Discretion” asking the question “Are drug courts truly therapeutic or are they simply a new form of punishment under the guise of help?” (p. 173). For an otherwise excellent book, this question struck me as a bit naïve. The author rightly grounds her book in the sociology of punishment, referring to the “culture of control” and “the new penology” that give rise to a focus on “accountability” and “surveillance,” but ignores the historical work on punishment and juvenile courts. There was no mention of Barry Feld’s <italic>Bad Kids</italic> or Anthony Platt’s <italic>The Child Savers</italic>, two books that go into great detail about the invention of the category “juvenile delinquent” and the hybrid therapeutic and punitive control of lower class immigrant youth and youth of color, who were conceptualized as dependent on the courts as substitute parents, that emerged in the Progressive Era in the United States. Paik does not situate her work within studies of the history of addiction, many of which have shown that treatment is a form of discipline, especially for populations similar to the ones from which juvenile courts were taking their “clientele” (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113491548">Acker 2002</xref>). Juvenile drug courts base themselves on two dependent categories, “youth” and “addict,” both of which are socially and historically constructed. Had Paik situated these courts within these histories, it is not certain she could have concluded that juvenile drug courts, with some alteration, can be a “promising vehicle to shift the criminal justice system’s approach to drug offenders away from punitive policies” (p. 182), especially when it is punitive policies toward youth and drug users that get them into drug court in the first place. Nonetheless, her policy recommendations, based on the premise that the courts need to be more accountable to youth, have depth because of her thoughtful approach to ethnographic research and should be heeded by practitioners hoping to improve juvenile drug court operation and outcomes.</p>
<p>No one book could address both the problems with existing perspectives on drugs and cover new terrain, but <italic>Drugs and Culture</italic> and <italic>Discretionary Justice</italic> make solid contributions to critical studies of drugs and addiction. They competently, and often insightfully, question dominant perspectives by revealing the role that morality, judgment, and discretion play in seemingly “objective” discussions about the problems of drugs. <italic>Discretionary Justice</italic> provides an in-depth view of the effects of the pathologizing construction of drug users that the contributors in <italic>Drugs and Culture</italic> interrogate.</p>
