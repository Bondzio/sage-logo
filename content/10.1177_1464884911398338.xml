<abstract>
<p>Despite significant changes in mainstream journalism in recent decades, journalistic fields beyond the news have been little explored. In an attempt to contribute to a deeper understanding of such fields, this article examines the role perceptions of 85 Australian travel journalists. By viewing travel journalism as a distinct field of practice that is affected by a unique mix of influences, this study identifies five dimensions of practitioners’ role perceptions. These relate to travel journalists’ views of themselves as Cultural Mediators, Critics, Entertainers, Information Providers and Travellers. In addition, the study examines in some depth the ethical standards of travel journalists. Determinants of these views and standards are explored. The study argues that, in light of travel journalists’ increasingly important role in reporting about foreign places, more remains to be done to promote travel stories that show a deeper understanding of other cultures and which contain a more critical appraisal of destinations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past two or three decades, traditional mainstream journalism has seen a turn toward increasing amounts of lifestyle-focused content, at the expense of hard news. Newspapers are replete with sections that focus on soft news, celebrity news, movie and music reviews, food, entertainment and travel. Such content has often been regarded suspiciously by news journalists and scholars alike due to the assumed higher influence of advertising and public relations interests in the field. Lifestyle journalism is regularly seen as unworthy of the term journalism and stories are considered more or less uncritical ‘fluff pieces’. However, this accusation is sometimes made without acknowledging the growing percentage of news stories that are also derived directly from media releases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911398338">Lewis et al., 2008</xref>). And it would seem that, in an era of cost-cutting and rationalization of news departments, lifestyle content, exactly <italic>because</italic> of its ability to attract advertisers to particular sections, is becoming an integral component of modern journalism.</p>
<p>An important part of lifestyle journalism is the practice of travel journalism, which has assumed significant relevance for the study of media representations of foreign cultures as a result of the reduction in foreign news content in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884911398338">Fürsich and Kavoori, 2001</xref>). The growing size of the tourism industry and resulting cross-cultural contact further demand that scholars examine the role travel journalism plays in this process. While recent years have seen an increase in research in the field, the vast majority of studies have focused solely on the representations of foreign cultures in travel journalism, while ignoring those who produce this content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911398338">Hanusch, 2010</xref>). This article therefore aims to help close an important gap in knowledge about journalistic production outside the hard news arena by examining the professional views, ethical standards and backgrounds of 85 Australian travel journalists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1464884911398338">
<title>Literature review</title>
<p>With the exception of sports journalism (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884911398338">Lange et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911398338">Rowe, 2007</xref>), news work outside of hard news has received comparatively little attention from communication scholars. Some have nevertheless repeatedly argued for more research in this field, pointing out that the softer side of the media, such as lifestyle and consumer journalism, could actually have a beneficial impact on audiences who have grown tired of traditional hard news formats. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884911398338">Hartley (2000</xref>: 40) believes that these fields are ‘the ones who extend the reach of media, who teach audiences the pleasures of staying tuned, who popularize knowledge’. Travel journalism, with its potential to educate audiences about foreign places and improve cross-cultural attitudes, plays an important role in this respect. And despite the fact that it is held in low regard by scholars – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884911398338">Fürsich and Kavoori (2001</xref>: 152) point out it is often seen as a ‘frivolous topic, not worthy of research’ – research on travel journalism has experienced some growth in recent years, especially when compared with other areas of lifestyle journalism.</p>
<p>Most of this research has been conducted from a tourism studies perspective, with many scholars in the field realizing travel journalism’s potential in influencing tourists’ destination images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884911398338">Gartner, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884911398338">Nielsen, 2001</xref>). As a result, the vast majority of studies have been concerned with the content of travel stories, in order to examine ways in which to maximize marketing efforts for destinations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884911398338">Pan and Ryan (2009)</xref> have studied the ways in which sensory allusions were present in travelogues about New Zealand, in order to determine an ideal itinerary for visiting journalists.</p>
<p>Increasing interest has also come from the fields of sociology and anthropology, which have begun to look at the practice of tourism more critically. This often included an examination of the role played by the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911398338">Apostopoulos et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464884911398338">Smith and Brent, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884911398338">Urry, 1990</xref>). Critical examinations have also been forthcoming from the field of journalism and communication studies. Much of this work was inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884911398338">Fürsich and Kavoori (2001</xref>: 151–154), who, in a study that has become somewhat seminal for the field, noted five reasons why travel journalism needed to be studied more deeply: a) the boom of the tourism industry, b) tourism and its impact remains under-studied, c) leisure is a significant social practice, d) travel journalism is an important site for international communication research, and e) travel journalism has special contingencies as it is a highly charged discourse strongly affected by public relations.</p>
<p>As a result, a primary focus for many studies has been the way in which travel journalism represents foreign places. After all, ‘to represent Others (within national boundaries or in another country) is […] constitutive to travel journalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884911398338">Fürsich, 2002</xref>: 217). Research has repeatedly found cases of ethnocentrism and othering in travel journalism comparable to what studies of foreign news have identified. Travel shows on television as well as newspaper travel stories thus tend to focus predominantly on the journalist’s experience while providing little insight into local cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884911398338">Dunn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884911398338">Hanefors and Mossberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911398338">Santos, 2006</xref>). TV travel shows also focus on western destinations, while neglecting the rest of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911398338">Mahmood, 2005</xref>). At the same time, when travel journalists do report about culturally more distant destinations, they resort to stereotypical portrayals of foreign cultures, with little contextual information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884911398338">Santos (2004)</xref> has argued that stories about Portugal in four US newspapers regularly excluded local voices, with only 10 per cent of stories making reference to any communication between authors and locals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884911398338">Santos (2004</xref>: 132) noted that ‘American readers are provided with representations that serve to reconfirm their own values and beliefs based on marketing strategies aimed at creating an interesting destination and culture for Americans to visit’.</p>
<p>A further point of contention in research on travel journalism is the field’s proximity to the economic side of journalism, or more specifically its close ties to advertising and sponsorship of travel. Few newspapers would be able to fund the trips required for a weekly travel section, and as a result many travel stories are sponsored by the tourism industry. This has led to the general accusation that travel journalists never write anything bad about an experience for fear of upsetting their sponsors and losing advertising, or not being invited on any future trips. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911398338">Austin (1999)</xref> has argued that even if all trips were sponsored by the media organization, it may still lead to a feeling of obligation on the part of the journalist, who might leave out negative aspects so as to justify the publisher’s expense for the trip. Further, some journalists are indeed critical in their writing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911398338">McGaurr (2010)</xref> notes the examples of travel journalists Jeff Greenwald and A.A. Gill, who both included criticism of forestry practices in Tasmania despite the fact they were sponsored to some extent by that state’s tourism organization. Examining the way in which travel journalists deal with these pressures, such as sponsored trips, but also other freebies, is therefore crucial.</p>
<p>One shortcoming of much of the existing research in this field has been that the vast majority has focused on the content, at the expense of examining its producers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911398338">Hanusch (2010)</xref> was only able to identify one recent attempt which examined a small sample of travel journalists in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911398338">Lischke, 2006</xref>). This article intends to improve this situation by examining in detail the role perceptions, ethical standards and backgrounds of Australian travel journalists.</p>
<p>The professional views of journalists have been the focus of a number of studies in recent decades. In the USA, the regular surveys conducted under the guidance of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884911398338">David Weaver and G. Cleveland Wilhoit (1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464884911398338">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464884911398338">Weaver et al., 2007</xref>) have enabled us to not only arrive at a general portrait of journalists in that nation, but to also track changes over time. The early US studies provided a starting point for similar efforts around the world, leading to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884911398338">Weaver’s (1998)</xref> edited collection of journalist surveys across 21 countries, which allowed for cross-cultural comparisons. A number of individual country surveys followed (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911398338">Hanitzsch, 2005</xref>, in Indonesia; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911398338">Herscovitz, 2004</xref>, in Brazil; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884911398338">Ramaprasad, 2001</xref>, in Tanzania), later expanding to include the changed conditions of news production by investigating online journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884911398338">O’Sullivan and Heinonen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911398338">Quandt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884911398338">Singer, 2005</xref>). Most recently, there has been a renewed large-scale attempt to examine journalists across cultures, with the Worlds of Journalism project conducting surveys in 17 countries simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884911398338">Hanitzsch et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of the professional views of specifically travel journalists, very little research has been conducted. One relevant attempt is an unpublished study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911398338">Lischke (2006)</xref>, who conducted in-depth interviews with 13 German travel journalists. Guided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884911398338">Bourdieu’s (2005)</xref> field theory, Lischke posited two dimensions along which travel journalists could be located. The first referred to whether they saw their role as providing practical information or merely entertainment for audiences. The second dimension was constituted by travel journalists’ motivations, and Lischke argued these ranged from traditional journalistic aims akin to those of political journalists, to motivations that were based solely in a desire to travel.</p>
<p>Most recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911398338">Hanusch (2010)</xref> identified four main dimensions of travel journalism, which lend themselves to a study of travel journalists’ role perceptions. These were termed as cultural mediation, market orientation, motivational aspects, and ethical standards. <italic>Cultural mediation</italic> refers to ‘the way in which travel journalism represents foreign cultures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911398338">2010</xref>: 78), and is here used to measure how travel journalists see their role in explaining and representing other cultures to their audiences. <italic>Market orientation</italic> is concerned with ‘the extent to which travel journalism provides information or entertainment for its audiences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911398338">2010</xref>: 78) and in the context of this study would assess whether travel journalists subscribe to one or the other pole of the dimension. <italic>Motivational aspects</italic> relates to whether travel journalists see themselves more in line with traditional journalistic ideals of critical inquiry, or if they merely want to celebrate travel and motivate others to do the same. <italic>Ethical standards</italic> are immensely important in travel journalism, as this aspect of the work has been repeatedly criticized for not meeting traditional journalistic principles. Travel journalists’ dependence on the tourism industry for subsidized travel has been one of the major points of criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911398338">2010</xref>: 73–75). Because these dimensions were developed following an in-depth overview of existing studies, there is a need to ‘empirically investigate travel journalism using this framework’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911398338">2010</xref>: 78). To take up this challenge, this study designed a questionnaire to measure travel journalists’ views in relation to these dimensions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1464884911398338" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Based on the above literature review and existing theories on journalists’ role perceptions, the following research questions were developed in order to examine the way in which travel journalists regard their jobs. Due to the near-absence of research on travel journalists, this study was largely exploratory in nature, and therefore research questions were posed rather than hypotheses.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>RQ1: What are travel journalists’ role perceptions in relation to the dimensions of cultural mediation, market orientation and motivational aspects?</p>
<p>RQ2: What are travel journalists’ views of ethical standards in their work?</p>
<p>RQ3: Are there any major determinants of travel journalists’ role perceptions and ethical standards?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To answer the research questions, a telephone survey using structured and standardized questionnaires was conducted with a random-stratified sample of 85 Australian journalists between February 2009 and January 2010. Travel journalists were defined as those having some editorial responsibility over travel stories, in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884911398338">Weaver and Wilhoit’s (1986)</xref> definition for mainstream US journalists. Respondents thus included employees of newspapers, magazines and television programs, drawn from published organizational lists as well as cross-referencing with individual organizations. To take account of the large number of freelancers in the industry, the sample included a significant number of freelance travel journalists, drawn from membership lists of the Australian Society of Travel Writers, the Australian journalist union (Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance) as well as industry websites and published travel stories in newspapers and magazines. Two filter questions were asked before the beginning of each survey to ensure freelancers spent a significant amount of their time on travel journalism-related activities. This meant all freelance journalists interviewed for this study spent either more than 50 per cent of their work time on writing or producing travel stories, or they earned at least 50 per cent of their income from such stories. Respondents who did not meet this test were excluded. The reaction from potential respondents was exceptionally positive, with a total of nine sampled journalists either declining to be surveyed or having moved on from their job, thus no longer qualifying for the study. There is no verified list or known total of the overall number of travel journalists in Australia; however, informal conversations with journalists and the tourism industry suggest the total of 85 respondents constitutes a highly representative sample.</p>
<p>In order to examine travel journalists’ views in relation to their professional roles, respondents were presented with two sets of questions: the first set of questions asked them to indicate how important they perceived each of 16 particular role descriptions, while the second asked them about the extent to which they agreed with eight statements about ethical standards. The items were developed on the basis of the existing theoretical research in travel journalism as related to the four dimensions outlined previously, and also drew on questions about role perceptions and ethics from mainstream journalist surveys (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911398338">Hanitzsch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464884911398338">Weaver et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884911398338">Weischenberg et al., 2006</xref>). The goal was to identify whether such dimensions as posited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911398338">Hanusch (2010)</xref> exist, and to determine how important each of these roles are seen by travel journalists.</p>

<p>A total of 85 Australian travel journalists were surveyed for this study, which included 42 freelancers (49.4%), 22 travel journalists working in newspapers (25.9%), 19 in magazines (22.4%) and two in television (2.4%). This distribution can be considered representative of the overall distribution of travel journalists in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884911398338">Llewellyn, 2008</xref>).

<p>One significant feature is an apparent gender balance. Journalist surveys in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911398338">Brand and Pearson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911398338">Hanusch, 2008</xref>) have consistently found considerably more male than female journalists, but it appears that in travel journalism women are actually in the majority. A t-test, which allows us to determine whether group means are statistically different from each other, showed that despite being in the minority, men’s average earnings are in the A$70–80,000 bracket (<italic>M</italic> = 6.29, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.87), which is significantly more than women, who mostly belong to the A$50–60,000 bracket (<italic>M</italic> = 4.62, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.57), <italic>t</italic>(78) = 2.751, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01. Further differences exist between freelancers and employed journalists, with freelancers earning mostly just under A$50,000 (<italic>M</italic> = 3.97, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.51), while employed journalists can be located towards the higher end of the A$70–80,000 bracket (<italic>M</italic> = 6.78, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.41), <italic>t</italic>(78) = 5.1, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001. At a difference of almost A$30,000, freelancers as a group are thus paid significantly less than their employed counterparts. There are fewer tertiary-educated travel journalists, with only just over half holding a university degree, as opposed to around 70 per cent of journalists overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911398338">Brand and Pearson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911398338">Hanusch, 2008</xref>). Of those who have been to university, 68.2 per cent also studied journalism or a related degree, which compares favourably with the overall journalistic workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911398338">Hanusch, 2008</xref>). Their political beliefs also appear to be quite left of centre, with more than 67 per cent of respondents identifying themselves in this way.</p>
<p>At an average age of 49 years, Australian travel journalists are also considerably older than their mainstream colleagues, who tend to be in their mid-thirties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911398338">Brand and Pearson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911398338">Hanusch, 2008</xref>). This finding resonates with anecdotal evidence that travel journalism is a profession one moves into when older and often following a career in a different journalistic field. Freelancers are significantly older, averaging almost 53 years (<italic>M</italic> = 52.55, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.84), as opposed to employed journalists, who are around 46 years of age (<italic>M</italic> = 46.48, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.55), <italic>t</italic>(78) = 3.305, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001. Almost nine out of 10 respondents overall have previously worked in other areas of journalism, while only roughly one-fourth of all respondents have worked in the tourism industry.</p>
<p>Contrary to common perceptions, Australian travel journalists do not actually appear to spend that much time away, with an average of almost 20 per cent of work time spent travelling. Once again, however, there are stark differences based on the type of employment, with freelancers spending around one-quarter of their work time on trips (<italic>M</italic> = 25.57, <italic>SD</italic> = 14.6), while employed journalists only do so for 13 per cent of their time (<italic>M</italic> = 13.54, <italic>SD</italic> = 12.36), <italic>t</italic>(76) = 3.940, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001. A further important finding is the relative lack of foreign language skills in Australian travel journalists. Only 32 journalists – slightly more than one-third of the sample – spoke a language other than English. Half of those were relatively fluent in more than one other language. French was clearly the most popular, with 26 respondents able to speak it reasonably competently, followed at quite a distance by Spanish (seven) and German (six). Despite Australia’s proximity to Asia, only six journalists spoke an Asian language (two each spoke Mandarin, Japanese and Indonesian).</p>

<title>Role perceptions</title>
<p>In order to examine travel journalists’ professional views, all respondents were asked to indicate how important they felt each of 16 role descriptions was in their work. These questions had been developed against the background of the dimensions of travel journalism discussed earlier.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884911398338">Table 2</xref> shows, the most important role perceptions relate to providing true accounts, discovering new and unique travel experiences, and providing specific as well as interesting and entertaining information for audiences. More critical role descriptions, which are usually associated with mainstream journalists, were seen as less important. Australian travel journalists do not feel it is particularly important to provide news about the tourism industry, be critical observers of it, or highlight social or political problems at the destination. Simply because a tourism destination is very popular with Australians may also not automatically mean travel journalists feel they need to focus on it. This corresponds with the high ranking given to ‘discovering new and unique travel experiences’. Views that relate to other cultures rank somewhere in the middle, with ‘arousing an interest in foreign cultures’ and ‘including locals in stories’ seen as quite important, while more active and arguably engaged roles such as ‘playing a role in intercultural understanding’ and ‘explaining foreign cultures to audiences’ are seen as less important.</p>

<p>One dominant thread running through many existing studies of travel journalism was the fact that locals are regularly relegated to marginal roles, with most stories focusing on western destinations and the experience of the author or presenter. There is some evidence here to suggest that travel journalists actually see the inclusion of locals in stories as much more important than ethnocentric approaches, such as viewing experiences through Australian eyes or focusing on destinations popular with Australians. This appears to contradict the studies of travel journalism content, and clearly warrants further investigation in future studies.</p>
<p>In order to examine whether respondents’ role perceptions could be grouped into any meaningful dimensions, responses to the 16 items were subjected to a preliminary principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is a statistical technique that enables researchers to ‘reduce the dimensionality of a data set consisting of a large number of interrelated variables, while retaining as much as possible of the variation present in the data set’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911398338">Jolliffe, 2002</xref>: 1). The goal of PCA is to transform the existing data into a new set of variables or components, which ‘are uncorrelated, and which are ordered so that the first <italic>few</italic> retain most of the variation present in <italic>all</italic> of the original variables’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911398338">Jolliffe, 2002</xref>: 1; emphasis in original). PCA is usually recommended for large samples, which was a problem here due to the fact there probably are only 100 to 150 travel journalists in Australia – a sample size generally considered as poor for conducting PCA. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884911398338">Osborne and Costello (2004)</xref> point out, studies have even been conducted with sample sizes as small as 50. They argue that in terms of sample size more is always better but, as the overall population against which this sample was conducted is small, the sample size of 85 is acceptable. Similarly, while most scholars advocate an item-to-subject-ratio of 10, a minimum ratio of five can be acceptable in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884911398338">Osborne and Costello, 2004</xref>). PCA has been applied to the study of journalists most recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884911398338">Hanitzsch et al. (2010)</xref>, who examined journalists’ perceptions of influences on their work in 17 countries. In the study, Hanitzsch et al. were able to identify six distinct dimensions, based on responses to 29 different influences.</p>
<p>The original examination of travel journalists’ responses resulted in six components, but on closer examination it was decided to exclude three items from further analysis. Two items (‘Include locals’ voices’ and ‘View tourism experiences through Australian eyes’) were excluded because, with scores of less than 0.5, they did not load clearly on any of the components. A third item (‘Provide true accounts of travel experiences’) was the only item loading on component six. The item was excluded from further analysis, because it was deemed to provide insufficient evidence of a dimension in itself, and probably referred more to ethical standards than role perceptions.</p>
<p>Thus, the main PCA was conducted on the remaining 13 items with orthogonal rotation (Varimax). The resulting sampling adequacy was an overall mediocre KMO = 0.657, with Bartlett’s test of sphericity χ<sup>2</sup> = 299.986, df = 78, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001 sufficiently large for conducting PCA. Five components had eigenvalues over Kaiser’s criterion of 1, and combined accounted for 69.99 per cent of variance. Following closer examination of PCA, we can identify five distinct dimensions of travel journalists’ role perceptions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1464884911398338">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>When we examine the five components in terms of their constituting items, they can be categorized as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1464884911398338" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>Cultural Mediators</bold>: The first component in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1464884911398338">Table 3</xref> can be described as the Cultural Mediator role, as the only items which score higher than 0.5 on this component relate to travel journalists’ views on representing foreign cultures. This includes their views on arousing an interest about foreign cultures in their audiences and playing a role in intercultural understanding. It further includes role perceptions such as explaining foreign cultures and working actively against established stereotypes. Thus, journalists who identify strongly with this role description tend to care a lot about local cultures and aim to raise their audiences’ level of cross-cultural knowledge.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Critics:</bold> The second component refers to the way in which travel journalists relate to traditional ideas of political journalism. It mainly sees journalists as sceptical observers, who keep a critical eye on developments in tourism and are not afraid to talk about problems at a destination. This is evidenced by component loadings on items which describe travel journalists as both providing news about the tourism industry (as opposed to simply news about travel experiences) and being critical observers of the tourism industry. Highlighting social or political problems at the destination also belongs to this dimension.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Information Providers:</bold> The items constituting the third component in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1464884911398338">Table 3</xref> relate to a more basic information-relaying role of travel journalists. Perceptions about their role as providing specific and useful information for prospective travellers as well as the focus on these travellers’ most popular destinations are included here. However, this dimension appears to be slightly problematic, as the two items do not necessarily appear to express intuitively similar aspects, and, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884911398338">Table 2</xref> has shown, travel journalists regard them very differently in terms of their importance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Entertainers:</bold> The fourth component includes travel journalists’ views on their role as providing entertaining accounts and interesting information. It does not refer to information that has a practical use for readers, but rather to material that simply makes enjoyable reading or viewing. One noteworthy role perception in this context is the description of the role of ‘providing the most interesting information to audiences’. In PCA, this item loads on both the Information Provider and Entertainer components. On reflection, it is apparent that the question could be interpreted in two ways: a) information that is interesting in the sense that it is absorbing or entertaining; but also b) a stronger emphasis on the word information, implying that such information is interesting because it can be used by audiences. Thus, future studies should further refine this question, and develop additional ones, to better measure the Entertainer and Information Provider dimensions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Travellers:</bold> The fifth component in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1464884911398338">Table 3</xref> refers to travel journalists’ views about their role in encouraging readers and viewers to experience the joys of travel. It sees travel journalists as discoverers who love to travel and want to bring this enthusiasm across to their audiences. Items which loaded on this component included motivating audiences to travel, as well as discovering new and unique travel experiences.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>It must be pointed out that of the five dimensions presented here, the latter three (Information Provider, Entertainer and Traveller) only load clearly on two items each. This relative lack of internal consistency is evident in the reliability values for the dimensions. While Cronbach’s α scores for Cultural Mediator (0.832) and Critic (0.732) indicated adequate reliability, scores for the other three dimensions were considerably below the accepted α level of 0.7 to indicate reliability (Entertainer: 0.554; Information Provider: 0.412, increasing to 0.510 if the item ‘most interesting information’ is added; Traveller: 0.290). There does exist some debate in the literature as to the use of Cronbach’s α, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884911398338">Boyle (1991</xref>: 292) criticizing the use of the coefficient as potentially leading researchers to add essentially similar items to artificially increase reliability, and lose the diversity of measured items. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884911398338">Boyle (1991</xref>: 294) advocates that ‘moderate to low item homogeneity is actually preferred if one is to ensure a broad coverage of the particular constructs being measured’. Nevertheless, as the three dimensions with low α scores are only constituted by two items each, we can essentially merely hypothesize about their existence. Future studies will need to develop additional items with which to measure the dimensions of Information Provider, Entertainer and Traveller, in order to empirically test them further. On the other hand, the dimensions of Cultural Mediator and Critic are supported quite well.</p>

<title>Relative importance of role perceptions</title>
<p>Despite the qualification made here, mean scores across the five identified dimension were examined in order to see whether we can identify any kind of hierarchy. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1464884911398338">Table 4</xref> shows, the role dimension of Entertainer appears to be the most important, followed closely by the fascination for travel, a finding in line with the individual item means in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464884911398338">Table 2</xref>. This result resonates with previous comments by travel journalists such as US writer Elizabeth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911398338">Austin (1999</xref>: 10), who argued that ‘travel publications celebrate travel’. Traditional functions of journalists as Critics rate as least popular with travel journalists, and the Cultural Mediator and Information Provider roles appear to enjoy similar levels of support in between.</p>

<p>From the results presented here it would appear that an overwhelming majority of travel journalists subscribe to high ethical ideals. Almost nine out of 10 respondents agreed with the notions that travel journalists should always disclose if their trip was sponsored by someone else, and also that they should tell the truth about travel experiences, even if it means upsetting sponsors. There is clearly an awareness here that perceived unethical behaviour has tarnished the industry, and those surveyed are trying their hardest to work against stereotypes of travel journalists as mere freeloaders. At the same time, a large majority also recognize that free travel is essential to their job, and only 4.9 per cent believe they should not accept such offers. Respondents were also somewhat aware of the potential implications free travel could have on their job, with half of those surveyed agreeing that free travel does influence reporting to some extent. Yet, even if travel wasn’t paid for by sponsors, most did not think that would make them more credible, with only 23.5 per cent agreeing with this statement. This resonates with a comment made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911398338">Elizabeth Austin (1999</xref>), who believes that stories paid for by a publisher could lead a journalist to feel they owe their employer a positive story for their expense. A further aspect of trips organized by the tourism industry is the occasional provision of small gifts. Just as much as travel journalists believe it is fine to accept free travel per se, only roughly one-third think that accepting gifts of higher than nominal value is wrong. These findings point to a lack of awareness that accepting valuable gifts could potentially compromise journalists in their reporting, a result we return to later. In terms of their views of the absoluteness of ethical rules in travel journalism, however, respondents demonstrated their belief in universal rules rather than making decisions that depend on individual contexts.</p>
<p>The ethical standards travel journalists displayed here are in contrast to arguments from the literature. This is perhaps not surprising as this survey reports journalists’ self-assessments of how ethical they are, and who would want to admit it if they had been unethical. A closer comparison of surveys with content analyses is needed to examine this finding in more detail. In particular, ethnographic approaches and in-depth interviews may be able to provide a more comprehensive picture in this regard.</p>

<title>Determinants of professional views</title>
<p>The final research question was concerned with any potential determinants of travel journalists’ professional views and ethical standards. An in-depth examination of the results shows considerable homogeneity amongst the group of 85 travel journalists surveyed for this study; however, there are some differences that warrant further elaboration.</p>
<p>The analysis of travel journalists’ backgrounds presented earlier suggested a number of differences primarily between freelance and employed travel journalists. However, it seems the two groups do not differ considerably in their role perceptions. The only significant difference, based on using the item means of the dimensions developed through PCA, could be found between the respective groups’ views on their role as Information Providers. A t-test suggests that employed journalists (<italic>M</italic> = 3.99, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.68) see providing useful and practical information to audiences as significantly more important than do freelance journalists (<italic>M</italic> = 3.45, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.71), <italic>t</italic>(79) = 3.483, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001. A further difference exists in terms of travel journalists’ training as journalists and their views on their role as Travellers. Here, it appears that those who have undergone some kind of journalism apprenticeship (<italic>M</italic> = 4.23, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.57) see this role as less important than those who haven’t undergone formal training (<italic>M</italic> = 4.56, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.48), <italic>t</italic>(79) = 2.733, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01. This result indicates that training in mainstream journalism may lead travel journalists to value the cheerleader role for travel and tourism less, arguably owing to the more critically oriented tradition of news journalism.</p>
<p>Gender does not appear to be a major factor in determining journalists’ professional views or ethical standards, as men and women only differ in their perception of their role as Cultural Mediators. Women (<italic>M</italic> = 4.1, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.7) regard this role as significantly more important than men do (<italic>M</italic> = 3.71, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.94), <italic>t</italic>(79) = 2.125, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05. However, some interesting insights can be established when examining the cultural dimension against other variables examined in this study. The data reveal that there exists a strong positive correlation between journalists’ views of their role as Cultural Mediators and the number of hours they spend travelling (<italic>r</italic> = +0.491, <italic>n</italic> = 75, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). This would suggest that those who travel extensively also engage with local cultures more and feel a need to tell others about them. Spending more time travelling is also associated with a more critical view of travel, as the number of hours spent travelling was positively correlated with the Critics dimension (<italic>r</italic> = +.382, <italic>n</italic> = 75, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001).</p>
<p>In terms of ethical standards, there is evidence to suggest that journalists who subscribe to the Critics dimension are more likely to believe that free trips or accommodation influence the reporting (<italic>r</italic> = +.274, <italic>n</italic> = 81, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Having completed a journalism apprenticeship also appears to be related to ethical standards, but in surprising ways. Those who have completed an apprenticeship (<italic>M</italic> = 2.49, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.42) are significantly less likely to believe that ‘accepting gifts of higher than nominal value is wrong’ than those who haven’t undergone any formal journalistic training (<italic>M</italic> = 3.27, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.48), <italic>t</italic>(72) = 5.379, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05. Similarly, those with training (<italic>M</italic> = 2.87, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.23) are also less likely to think that ‘free trips or accommodation influence the reporting’ than those without (<italic>M</italic> = 3.53, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.22), <italic>t</italic>(83) = 2.446, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05. One would think that having had traditional journalistic training, these travel journalists would be more ethical than others, but the reverse seems to be the case. Those who haven’t had formal training display greater awareness of how they can be influenced in their reporting. One potential reason for this may lie with the ideology of journalism, which tends to argue that journalists can free themselves from external influences and be objective in their reporting. Journalists who have had formal training may have a stronger belief in this notion and therefore see accepting free travel and gifts as less of a problem.</p>
<p>Another interesting aspect emerges when we examine how the amount of experience that travel journalists have in the field is related to ethical standards. Here, the results suggest that the longer they have worked in the field, the less likely they are to believe they should disclose when their trip was sponsored by someone else, with the two items significantly negatively correlated (<italic>r</italic> = −.318, <italic>n</italic> = 85, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Those who have been in the business longer also subscribe to an understanding that decides on ethics depending on the situation. This is demonstrated by the significant positive correlation between experience in travel journalism and the statement ‘what is ethical in travel journalism varies from one situation to another’ (<italic>r</italic> = +.259, <italic>n</italic> = 81, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05).</p>
<p>Yet, while there are some interesting differences amongst Australian travel journalists’ professional views and ethical standards, the most important finding is the striking homogeneity of the profession. Based on the evidence examined here, it would appear that travel journalists as a group think very much alike in terms of the way they see their role in reporting on travel.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study has shown that there exists strong support for the existence of at least two distinct dimensions through which travel journalists view their work. These dimensions were termed the Cultural Mediator role and the Critic role. Journalists who value the Cultural Mediator role believe in the importance of bringing foreign cultures closer to audiences, to educate about distant lands and even actively promote cross-cultural understanding. Critics subscribe to a role that to some extent resembles traditional journalism ideals in that they see it as important to question tourism practices and keep audiences abreast of developments in the industry. There exists some support for the existence of three further dimensions, which could be described as the Information Provider, Entertainer and Traveller roles. The three dimensions were identified through conducting a principal components analysis; however, further testing and the fact each was constituted by just two items only allow us to hypothesize about the existence of these dimensions. It is therefore vital that future studies address and test particularly these latter three dimensions.</p>
<p>The dimensions proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911398338">Hanusch (2010)</xref> were broadly confirmed here, but we can also expand on them. In particular, it was found that the dimensions of market orientation and motivational aspects will need to be clarified further, as the study found that both could actually be separated into two dimensions each. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911398338">Hanusch (2010)</xref> saw entertainment and information as opposing poles on the same continuum in the market orientation dimension, this study actually found that travel journalists see them separately and in fact they can value both equally at the same time. The same applies to the motivational aspects dimension.</p>
<p>Assuming that the five dimensions identified here can be deemed constitutive of travel journalistic role perceptions, the analysis using dimension means clearly shows that travel journalists favour less critical roles, much in line with previous research conducted in the field. Respondents evidently favoured roles that relate to the discovery of new and unique travel experiences and aim to provide useful, interesting and entertaining information. Inherent in their work is also a desire to motivate their audiences to travel. In this way, Australian travel journalists very much subscribe to a service function, in line with a traditional understanding of lifestyle journalism that provides ‘news you can use’, as well as a commercial orientation in the vein of ‘soft news’. In contrast, the Critic role, usually associated most with ‘hard news’, is not regarded highly by travel journalists at all, while the Cultural Mediator role is regarded as only relatively important.</p>
<p>It seems that travel journalists see their role as quite different from that of traditional journalists, and are very much anchored in the field of lifestyle journalism. Yet, while the celebration of travel may be what travel journalism is all about, it is also, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884911398338">Fürsich and Kavoori (2001)</xref> pointed out, fast becoming an increasingly important site for cross-cultural understanding. It would therefore seem crucial to examine ways in which critical and cross-cultural knowledge could be included in travel journalism. Perhaps freelancers have a leading role to play in this respect. The results show that they tend to travel considerably more than employed journalists and represent a large part of the profession. While there was no direct correlation between freelancers and the Cultural Mediator or Critic dimensions, the two roles were positively correlated with the amount of travel a journalist did. Thus, the more they travel, the more they believe it is important to aid cross-cultural understanding and provide somewhat critical assessments of destinations.</p>
<p>Enhancing the level of cross-cultural understanding in travel journalism would certainly go some way to improving the image of much of travel journalism. A strong commitment to ethics would also be beneficial, and, as this study demonstrates, on the surface travel journalists have a high degree of ethical commitment. The overwhelming majority agree that free trips should always be disclosed, and that travel journalists should always tell the truth about an experience, even if it means upsetting the travel sponsor. Yet, as content analyses have shown, the vast majority of travel journalism is suspiciously devoid of any negative issues – although, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911398338">McGaurr (2010)</xref> has shown, a few writers can be brutally honest about their experiences. Surprising was also the finding that those who have had formal training in journalism are much more likely to believe that free travel and gifts do not influence their reporting. This may well be related to the ideology of news journalism and a perceived ability to not be influenced by outside forces. Those who have been in the business for some time also do not seem to see disclosure as so important and make ethical decisions depending on the particular situation. There was, however, no clear thread running through the questions on ethical standards to argue with any conviction that one or another group displays higher or lower ethical standards. What is worrying, however, is the relatively low level of awareness that gifts and free travel may influence reporting. Even if they are actually able to not let themselves be influenced, there could be a public perception that they may and this should be a crucial consideration for travel journalists.</p>
<p>There are some important limitations to this study. First, it was largely exploratory, and the aim was to provide food for thought for future studies in the field of travel journalism. The study relies on self-reports of respondents, and therefore suffers from potential biases in that journalists’ perceptions may not always align with their actions and actual published content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884911398338">Hallin and Mancini, 2004</xref>). In-depth discussions with travel journalists and perhaps ethnographic approaches would provide invaluable insights into the ways in which travel journalists conduct themselves when on assignment. The ethical tensions would be worthy of investigation by observing travel journalists on all-expenses-paid trips sponsored by tourism organizations. This would enable researchers to provide deep insights into the tensions that may occur during such trips. Further, this study investigated travel journalists in only one country. As there are significant differences in the way in which journalism is practised around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884911398338">Weaver, 1998</xref>), it will be important to expand this study across a number of countries. For example, it would be interesting to examine whether the here-proposed dimensions can be applied universally, as well as whether travel journalists around the world regard the importance of the various dimensions differently. Such research would go some way to further our understanding of what is an important sub-field of journalism studies.</p>
