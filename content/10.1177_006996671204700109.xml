<p>This book argues that a focus by feminists on the dangerousness of sex in sex work has led to the invisibilising of labour within it. After urging scholars to treat sex work as unexceptional in relation to both marriage and work in her earlier works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-006996671204700109">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-006996671204700109">2011</xref>), Kotiswaran here seeks to build what she calls a ‘work position’ for sex work. This she does in order to address the issues of redistribution in sex markets and highlights the role of law in facilitating this. For this, she brings together marvellously an economic analysis, legal ethnography and materialist feminism.</p>
<p>Kotiswaran begins the book with an image of protesting subaltern sex workers of ‘Durbar Mahila Samanway Committee’ (henceforth DMSC), one of the most celebrated sex workers’ organisations in India. Through this, she significantly challenges the global panic around trafficking and further dismisses the skepticism about bureaucratic rationality of international AIDS control projects. By demonstrating how these sex workers located in the third world sex markets assert workers’ rights, she seeks to open up ways to articulate sex work as a legitimate form of work. Kotiswaran, however, sets herself apart from what she describes as recent ‘decontextualised’ (p. 12) attempts to highlight agency of sex workers in a post-colonial context.</p>
<p>The first part of the book examines how the materialist feminist lens, though opposed to the work position, enables through its method an articulation of sex work as a form of female reproductive labour. In the second chapter, Kotiswaran significantly brings out the limitations of the politics of middle ground that caricatures the polarisation of abolitionists, and sex work advocates and invisibilises their increasing focus on the materiality of sex work. The sex work advocates have gained a structuralist focus with their empirical analysis of informal sex markets in the global South and the radical feminist abolitionists have a focus on ‘historical stages of deployment of sexual subordination’ but this essentialises the non-West (pp. 40–46). Kotiswaran points out the paradox in dismissing the former while foregrounding the latter.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 is significant in broadly mapping competing trajectories of materialist feminist view of sex work from classical socialist feminism, wages for house-work campaign and dependency feminism to materialist feminist analysis of post-industrial capitalism. It outlines how sex work is articulated variously as labour desertion or the anti-thesis of work (p. 55), as an exploitative form of female reproductive labour (p. 58) located in the international political economy (p. 67), or as ‘bounded intimacy’ in late capitalist economies (p. 74). Kotiswaran appreciates these accounts for de-exceptionalising sex work with their focus on connections between varied institutional settings of reproductive labour. However, she argues for drawing from their method so as to adopt the ‘work position’ for sex work, but not from their normative position because it ‘essentialises third world difference’ (p. 68). Albeit her rich discussion of genealogies of materialist feminism brings out that this essentialisation can be addressed through their method, without giving up their normative position. Moreover, further investigation of materialist feminist theorisation on sex work would have brought out that it has enabled sex workers’ organisation such as English Collective of Prostitutes in England of 1970s, with their alliances with housewives, to address the issues of redistribution without asserting ‘work position’.</p>
<p>Part II of the book brilliantly details, through two chapters, legal ethnographies of two different sex markets in India—one in Tirupati, based on pilgrimage tourism, and the other in Sonagachi, Kolkata, centring the ‘iconic’ institution of the brothel. It provides an excellent framework to examine the political economy of sex markets by focusing not just on social relations of labour, but materiality of norms, thus highlighting the role of ‘law’ within it. These two chapters discuss political economy of sex work in terms of its institutional settings, modes of organisation, scales of business, presence of internally differentiated sex workers and other internal, external stakeholders, and dynamics of their relations in sex markets. For example, the chapter on Kolkata’s red-light area unpacks the institutional setting of a brothel with diverse modes of organisation—<italic>chukri</italic> (bonded), <italic>adhiya</italic> (on contract) and self-employed—and with dynamics of relations of labour, service and tenancy. Kotiswaran here points out using the legal realist lens how interestingly the symmetries of illegality created by not just ITPA but Special Local Laws (SLL) keep various stakeholders in check and create fluid enforcement equilibrium, thus leading to the de-facto decriminalisation through self-regulation.</p>
<p>Part III seeks to explore, though cautiously, how redistribution in sex markets can be achieved with self-regulation. Chapter Six examines three draft proposals prepared for reforming ITPA with different forms of regulation of sex work. Considering their consequences for relational dynamics among various stakeholders, it elaborates on their inadequacies for redistribution within the sex industry.</p>
<p>The last chapter then highlights how sex workers’ organisations like the DMSC have sought to produce a structuralist account of sex work as socially useful work in the informal economy, demanding skills as in entertainment work. Though one expects more critical engagement with the ‘overexposure’ of DMSC and the juxtaposition of its ‘work position’ with other divergent articulations of sex work by the organisations of sex workers located in different sex markets—brothel based or otherwise. Kotiswaran thus seeks to articulate sex work as reproductive labour of lumpen proletariat by addressing at a macro level, post-colonial spaces of capital in which sex markets operate (p. 212), and by locating at a micro level, the exploitation in sex markets within the class processes in between (p. 245). In doing so, she challenges the essentialising narratives about the transition from sexual barter to prostitution to sex commerce with changes in work, family and sexual ethics.</p>
<p>The book successfully argues for a focus on the materiality of sex work, not in terms of commodification, but in terms of social norms—legal or otherwise that structure sex work. Interestingly, three instances when caste and community norms are referred to involve, first, external stakeholders such as ‘rowdies’ filing false complaints under ‘SC and ST Prevention of Atrocities Act’ to retaliate sex workers (p. 107); second, sex workers using state welfare schemes for SCs (p. 116); and third, negotiations among Agrawali and Bengali landlords through their community networks (p. 179). What is not investigated here is how the relational dynamics within sex markets are shaped by formal state law or ‘informal’ social norms regarding caste. Such an investigation will enable not just an engagement with the Dalit feminist opposition to the ‘work position’ of sex work, but also to recognise caste underpinnings of sex work. However, whether one is convinced or not by the assertion of work position in this book, its method of working out the materiality of sex markets definitely opens up what was a stalemate in the sex work debate.</p>
