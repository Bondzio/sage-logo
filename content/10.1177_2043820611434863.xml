<abstract>
<p>This commentary responds to the discussion on the shifting ways that geographers approach questions of space. Questioning what is at stake here, this response asks whether the viewpoints of those involved in the exchange can be said to represent the range of possible positions taken on the importance of space and spatiality in theory.</p>

<p>Space, place and nature are often positioned as the three key metaphors which fire the geographical imagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820611434863">Gregory, 1994</xref>) but space tends to be privileged within this triad, having becoming ‘the everywhere of modern thought’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820611434863">Crang and Thrift, 2000</xref>: 1) thanks to the putative ‘spatial turn’. Commonly identified as having unfolded since the 1980s, in no small part due to the combined efforts of Harvey, Soja, Lefebvre, Jamieson et al. in reasserting the importance of space in social theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2043820611434863">Warf, 2009</xref>), this spatial turn is noted to have challenged the privileging of time/history over space/geography in a diversity of disciplines, not just geography’s close relatives, but also its distant cousins. Its effects have been manifold, encouraging a multidisciplinary attempt to appreciate the spatial production of society, as well as the social production of space:<disp-quote>
<p>During the last 20 years or so, a ‘spatial turn’ has made its way across the social sciences and humanities. It has arisen from all kinds of theoretical and practical impulses, but its effect has been clear enough: the identification of what seems like a constantly expanding universe of spaces and territories, each of which provides different kinds of inhabitation … through an emphasis on the unremitting materiality of a world where there are no pre-existing objects. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2043820611434863">Thrift, 2008</xref>: 140)</p>
</disp-quote>
As such, talk of space is now common not just in architecture, urban studies and planning, but also subjects as diverse as archaeology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820611434863">Blake, 2004</xref>), history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820611434863">Gunn, 2001</xref>), business studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820611434863">Beyes and Steyaert, 2011</xref>), law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2043820611434863">Philippopoulous-Mihalopolous, 2011</xref>), criminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2043820611434863">Haywood, 2004</xref>) and theology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820611434863">Bergmann, 2007</xref>): indeed, there are few subject disciplines across the social sciences and humanities in which it is now not possible to identify the influence of geography. Geography has transformed, it appears, from being a net importer of ideas and concepts (e.g. the adoption of ideas from economics, mathematics and physics during geography’s ‘quantitative revolution’ – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820611434863">Barnes, 2001</xref>) to a net exporter.</p>
<p>It is in this sense that the conversation between Olsson, Sheppard, Thrift and Tuan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2043820611434863">Merriman et al., 2012</xref>) is to be welcomed, not just as a way of thinking about the claims being made about space by human geographers, but also the translation of those claims across different subdisciplines and subject areas. As Tuan notes, space is not a concept that translates well between languages; equally, its deployment in other disciplines can sometimes appear puzzling to geographers, with what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2043820611434863">Philippopoulous-Mihalopolous (2011</xref>: 5) terms a ‘new spatial semiotics’ – i.e. references to ‘mapping, scale, horizon, domain, field, space/place, boundary, crossing, topology and so on’ – distracting from the fact that space still remains weakly theorized in many instances. For example, in some disciplines those claiming to be influenced by the ‘spatial turn’ simply take ‘space’ to refer to an empirical reality (i.e. space as a given portion of the world that is knowable in a Cartesian or Newtonian sense): hence some legal scholars think about the spaces of law solely in terms of established jurisdictions, whether municipal or national (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2043820611434863">Philippopoulous-Mihalopolous, 2011</xref>: cf. the legal geography of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820611434863">Blomley, 2003</xref>). Space is, as Merriman and Jones assert, more complicated than this monism implies, being both ‘abstract and concrete, produced and producing, imagined and materialized, structured and lived, relational, relative and absolute’ – but this does not mean it can become simply a synonym for place, territory or region: to use it in such a manner is to avoid what Doreen Massey terms the ‘challenge of space, the multiple ruses through which that challenge has been so persistently evaded, and the political implications of practising it differently’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2043820611434863">Massey, 2005</xref>: 13).</p>
<p>Debates about the theorization of space are particularly timely given that the uptake of Geographical Information Systems across the social sciences and humanities is also taken in some quarters as evidence of the ‘spatial turn’. While it is clear that GIS is a technology that has appeal for those working in a range of disciplines, in many guises GIS remains underpinned by an absolute conception of space and a modernist conceit that imagines space as a container that has effects on the objects contained within it. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820611434863">Cosgrove (2004</xref>) argued, the reassertion of space in social thought in the 1980s was underpinned by a rejection of this epistemology, meaning that recent talk about <italic>neo-geography</italic> and a spatial humanities approach based on ‘rigorously measurable, infinitely sharable information’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820611434863">Guldi, 2009</xref>) seems at odds with the widespread acceptance within geography that space is relative rather than absolute:<disp-quote>
<p>Both in theory and in practice, relative space more readily embraces the fact of scalar continuity and the constant blurring and interaction between scales that are always dependent on process and observation. ‘Local’ spaces are as much a precipitate of ‘global’ processes – for example, the investment decisions of global financial networks – as they are constitutive nodes for such processes – for example, through Internet connections. Geographical ‘place’ is today treated as an instantiation of process rather than an ontological given. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820611434863">Cosgrove, 2004</xref>: 59)</p>
</disp-quote>
The implication of this is that questions of spacing appear epistemological as much as ontological: there seems to be agreement in this debate that space is not simply out there, waiting to be discovered, mapped and analysed. Rather, spatial theorization is, as Thrift notes in this dialogue, about making sense of being as a ‘never-ending production of space’ (and time).</p>
<p>In bringing together a number of prominent (male) geographers to ‘reflect upon past and present attempts to think and practice space and spatiality in geography, the humanities, social sciences and sciences’ Merriman and Jones thus open up a dialogue about space as epistemology. The discussion of the development of geographical knowledge production offered by Olsson, Sheppard, Thrift and Tuan is accordingly valuable for many reasons, not least that it fleshes out existing accounts of the way these four ‘key thinkers’ have approached questions of space and spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2043820611434863">Hubbard and Kitchin, 2010</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820611434863">Barnes (2008</xref>) suggests, a little ‘live theory’ can often go a long way, and here all four protagonists exhibit considerable reflexivity about their own place within the academy, their own intellectual biographies and their sometimes idiosyncratic career paths, linking this to their particular theoretical orientations and preoccupations.</p>
<p>But while this exchange provides some insight into both the history and philosophy of geography over the last 40 years, whether it helps us grasp what is at stake in adopting different epistemological positions is a moot point. Ultimately, each of the contributors offers reflections on their own shifting positionality, but there is rarely a moment where any of the protagonists acknowledges what is lost and what is gained through the adoption of particular modes of theorizing: to quote Nigel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2043820611434863">Thrift (1996</xref>: 16), ‘we cannot do much better than … arguing for politics and epistemologies of location, positioning and situating, where partiality and not universality is the condition of being heard to make rational knowledge claims’. Perhaps then the best we can ever hope for is the type of exchange we see here, a cosy dialogue that ends with an acceptance that different people look at the world in different ways, with no possibility of rapprochement or synthesis of divergent ways of theorizing space, and no sense that any one way of looking at the world is better than another. Relativism reigns.</p>
<p>This Dialogue is then ultimately frustrating in so much that the protagonists dance around one of the key questions about spatial theorizing – i.e. <italic>what is the ontological status of space?</italic> – by continuing to privilege epistemological relativism and holding to a weak spatial ontology. Defending this, Sheppard argues that debates about whether and how space actually exists ‘are always incomplete and never really get us to where we need to go’ and, worse still, alleges that they quickly descend into academic posturing of the worst kind. Writing elsewhere with Trevor Barnes, Sheppard suggests that the adoption of a weak ontology is preferable, because it allows for ‘engaged pluralism’ and conversations in which individuals do not simply argue ‘my reality is more real than your reality’ but instead reach out to one another despite differences in theoretical orientation. One of the key examples of engaged pluralism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820611434863">Barnes and Sheppard (2010</xref>) provide is the emergence of critical GIS, something they suggest has only been possible by dint of positivist spatial scientists and post-positivist critical geographers abandoning the idea that either have privileged access to geographical reality. In a related sense, Thrift argues here that GIS and information technologies – and the associated neogeographies of geotagging and global positioning – are epistemologies bringing new spaces into existence: hence, the renaissance of mapping as a ‘more than representational’ practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2043820611434863">Kitchin et al., 2009</xref>: on the relationship between data capture technologies and ontologies, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820611434863">Cronin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2043820611434863">Thrift, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2043820611434863">Uprichard et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Discussion of the ontological implications of epistemology (i.e. questions of how we know what we know in turn shapes the world that we have knowledge of) are thus to the fore throughout the Dialogue: Olsson suggests ‘when we are trying to understand <italic>how</italic> something is, we are telling epistemological stories, when we are asking <italic>what</italic> that something is, we are drawing ontological pictures’. Olsson’s suggestion that space transcends ontology via a shift into epistemology is a telling one, and should encourage us to reflect further on the power of certain pictures – Thrift refers to diagrams and ‘diagrammatology’ – as ways of knowing the world which also bring that world into being. Gregory’s (1994) assertion that geography was implicated in the ‘world as exhibition’ and served colonial/Eurocentric ends thus finds its contemporary parallel in the geodemography sponsored by the entertainment and security industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2043820611434863">Kitchin and Dodge, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2043820611434863">Thrift, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>But beyond this (obvious) conclusion that geography enters into the constitution of the world, what appears missing in the debate is the sense that there is anything political at stake here, or any acknowledgement that the different geographies outlined by Olsson, Sheppard, Thrift and Tuan are exercises of power in and of themselves. Sheppard’s shift away from spatial science, Thrift’s non-representational geographies, Tuan’s long-standing belief in geopoetry, and Olsson’s self-confessed descent into the categorical abyss are all stories that show that theorizing space is about writing one’s self into the world via processes of inscription. But if the <italic>geographical</italic> (and not just the <italic>spatial</italic>) sets the world in motion (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820611434863">Beer and Burrows, 2010</xref>, on sociology) surely it is important to move beyond the glib acceptance that there are different ways of doing geography? Surely there needs to be more debate about what the implications of theorizing space differently are? And if the personal is political – and it always certainly is – surely there needs to be some acknowledgement that theorizing space from a privileged, male position has important political consequences? In the final analysis, perhaps it was naive to suppose that this debate could reconnect the political and spatial (as Merriman and Jones put it in their introduction) as while the four male contributors to the dialogue may hold positions that are diverse and divergent, they are certainly not divergent enough.</p>
