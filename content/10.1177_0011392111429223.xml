<p>This article examines the troubled connection between feminist research and activism. As a member of the autonomous feminist collective Forum Against Oppression of Women, in Mumbai, the author draws on her participation in the ongoing discussions and dialogue, both within the group and with other organizations, and uses the case of feminist thinking on caste and sexual labour to discuss the challenges and prospects of linking research with practice. The article begins by briefly outlining the relationship between caste, labour and sexuality, drawing particularly on Dalit feminists’ reflections of the lived experience of caste. It highlights the dialogues between multiple women including those involved in different forms of sexual labour. The article seeks to capture the challenges of linking research and practice as feminists attempt to generate dialogue through multiple viewpoints to guide feminist understanding and actions. This endeavour is still ongoing and therefore a process.</p>

<p>Cette communication examine le lien problématique entre recherche féministe et activisme. Elle s’inspire de ma participation aux discussions et au dialogue en cours en tant que membre de l’organisation collective féministe autonome Forum Against Oppression of Women, à Mumbai, à la fois au sein du groupe et auprès d’autres organisations. Je m’appuye sur le cas de la pensée féministe sur les castes et le travail sexuel pour discuter les défis et les possibilités affectant le lien entre recherche et pratique. Je commence par esquisser les rapports entre caste, travail et sexualité, m’inspirant particulièrement des réflexions des féministes dalites sur la réalité vécue du système de caste. Je présente ensuite les multiples dialogues entre les femmes, dont certaines pratiquent différentes formes de travail sexuel. Je m’efforce de cerner les défis auxquels se heurte le lien entre recherche et pratique lorsque les féministes tentent de dialoguer à travers des points de vue multiples afin de guider la compréhension et les actions féministes. Cette recherche est toujours en cours et donc à traiter comme un processus.</p>

<title>Resumen</title>
<p>Este artículo examina la conexión problemática que se produce entre la investigación feminista y el activismo. Basado en mi participación en el proceso de discusiones y el diálogo a largo plazo, como miembro del colectivo feminista autónomo, Foro contra la opresión de las mujeres, en Bombay, tanto dentro del grupo como con otras organizaciones, utilizo el caso de la opinión feminista acerca la casta y el trabajo sexual para discutir los retos y las perspectivas de la integración de la investigación con la práctica. Comienzo brevemente resumiendo la relación entre la casta, el trabajo y la sexualidad, haciendo uso en particular de las reflexiones de las experiencias de casta vividas por las feministas de la casta dalit. Asimismo, destaco los diálogos entre múltiples mujeres entre las que se incluyen aquellas dedicadas a las diferentes formas de trabajo sexual. Yo procuro capturar los retos de la integración entre la investigación y la práctica como un intento feminista de dialogar a través de los diversos puntos de vista para guiar la interpretación y las acciones feministas. Esta búsqueda continúa en marcha y es, por consiguiente, un proceso.</p>

<body>
<p>In March 2005, the government of Maharashtra state in India announced a ban on women performing in dance bars, at first in the entire state and subsequently extending it to the bars in Mumbai. The reason cited for the ban by the Deputy Chief Minister and Home Minister, Mr RR Patil, was that youth were being morally corrupted by the lure of the dance bars where they squandered their fathers’ hard-earned money and even resorted to crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011392111429223"><italic>Times of India</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The matter had raised a furore both in the media and among activists in the women’s movements, which was divided along the fault-lines of support to the government’s ban as women dancers were being exploited in the dance bars by the owners and the clients who paid to see the women dance, and opposition to it stating that the ban infringed women’s right to work. The latter groups argued that eliminating women’s self-sought livelihood was no solution and if protection from exploitation was the issue then their work conditions could be improved along the lines of workers in similar jobs within the unorganized sector. Several studies were undertaken to support the positions, which climaxed at the High Court of Mumbai, with the court declaring the ban unconstitutional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392111429223">Prayas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392111429223">RCWS and FAOW, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011392111429223">2006</xref>). However the state government went on appeal to the Supreme Court, after seeking a stay over the High Court verdict and the case is now pending before the highest court.</p>
<p>As the debate over the ban progressed, the ‘troubled connection’ between sexuality, labour and caste became a subject of controversy and discussion among feminists. In Mumbai, it involved socialist women activists, the All India Democratic Women’s Association affiliated to the Communist Party of India (Marxist), autonomous feminist groups and NGOs, and Dalit-Bahujan feminist groups<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011392111429223">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392111429223">Agnes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392111429223"><italic>Indian Express</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392111429223">Kunda, n.d.</xref>). In September 2006, at the Seventh National Conference of Women’s Movements in Kolkata, the discussions in the sessions on ‘Caste-based identities, discriminations, struggles and challenges’ further complicated these troubled connections, with women in sex work and prostitution from across the country entering the debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392111429223">Saheli et al., 2006</xref>). Moving beyond the threshold of sexuality and labour, the intersection of caste had several Dalit-Bahujan activists stating with anger and hurt that the support offered to the bar dancers from a section of the women’s movements, even if it be in the name of protection of livelihood, amounted to a reinforcement of caste-based sexual exploitation of women of lower castes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392111429223">Kunda, n.d.</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing on my participation in the ongoing discussions and dialogue, as a member of the autonomous feminist collective, Forum Against Oppression of Women, in Mumbai, both within the group and with other organizations, I use the case of feminist thinking on caste and sexual labour to discuss the challenges and prospects of linking research with practice. I begin by briefly outlining the relationship between caste, labour and sexuality, drawing particularly on Dalit feminists’ reflections of the lived experience of caste, to highlight the troubled connection between different feminist standpoints. I then present biographical cases of labouring castes, especially the <italic>lavani</italic> performers, the Devadasi women and the women of the Bedia community even as they negotiate shifts in the nature of their occupations. In the final part of the article I highlight the dialogues between multiple women including those involved in different forms of sexual labour. I endeavour to capture the challenges of linking research and practice as feminists attempt to create dialogue through multiple viewpoints to guide feminist understanding and actions. This search is still ongoing and therefore a process.</p>

<title>Feminists’ understanding of caste/class/gendered labour</title>
<p>While earlier Indian feminist scholarship focused on issues of women <italic>qua</italic> women, in recent years, the writings of Dalit intellectuals and those inspired by such writing have begun to redress the gap in mainstream feminist and social science writing about the ways in which caste privileges and oppressions define relationships among women (and men).</p>
<p>Feminist research has begun to recognize that Dalit women face gender/class/caste oppression, as caste structures maintain a structural isolation by the reinforcement of inequality through violent means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392111429223">Chakravarti, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392111429223">Kamble, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011392111429223">Pawar, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011392111429223">Rege, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011392111429223">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011392111429223">Velaskar, 1998</xref>). The notion of untouchability lies at the core of the hierarchy and exclusion of the caste system. Strict control over women’s bodies and their social markings are gateways to the caste system. Women participate in the perpetuation of the caste system through endogamous marriages that cement caste divisions and maintain the unequal control over land and labour. Although some means by which caste is perpetuated has partially broken down or altered with shifts in traditional occupations or the movement away from original places of residence in contemporary India, patterns of marriage continue to play a crucial role in the sustaining and reproducing of caste. Despite the efforts of the Dalit movement leaders<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011392111429223">2</xref></sup> encouraging inter-caste marriages, prohibited desires instanced in Pratiloma marriages by men from lower castes with upper caste women, or articulation of lesbian desires, are viciously hounded to uphold compulsory caste-based heteronormativity.</p>
<p>The power of this ideology pervades material relations between castes; upper castes gain and maintain control over the means of labour through a system of servitude, keep some as labouring castes and ensuring the ‘permanent servility of Dalit castes in the most menial, filthy and defiled occupations’, while others in privileged positions receive the service of these castes. Thus, structural, interactional and ideological inequality in socioeconomic relations, where lower castes have no or very little access to land and other resources, and where upper castes do not allow lower castes to give up their ‘polluting’ occupations, gets legitimized. This is starkly evident if we look at the intersections of caste/gendered labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011392111429223">Velaskar, 1998</xref>: 8–11). It is appropriate to recall here that it is not without reason that the focus of most anti-caste struggles has been the resistance and abolition of caste-based labour, while class movements have stressed only land reforms.</p>
<p>The sexual division of labour operates very insidiously for women of the lower castes. Where upper caste women are withdrawn from paid labour to establish the power of caste status and to maintain the boundaries of compulsory heteronormativity, lower caste women are condemned to caste-defined domestic service in upper caste households. The abject, exploitative domestic labour performed by women marginalized by society has been discussed eloquently as both lying outside the realm of market but also influenced by familial and patriarchal ideologies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0011392111429223">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some examples of such labour of women of lower castes (or caste-based occupations) are the traditional midwife or <italic>dai</italic>, the female manual scavenger, the agricultural worker and the leather worker, whose labour is on call by the community they serve while being simultaneously devalued in terms of monetary compensation or social status. However, women are in constant negotiation with the meanings of their labour even as they try to break out of caste rigidities. For instance, in the case of the traditional midwife or <italic>dai</italic>, there is a disjuncture between how a Dalit woman’s labour is viewed by upper castes and by the Dalit worker herself. In childbirth the most stigmatized elements are also defined as being most potent to life, like cutting the cord, or the disposal of placenta, which become critical to managing the vulnerability of new life. In this manner she rejects the notion of her work as polluting despite dealing with dirt while taking advantage of caste-Hindu constructs to demand payment, safeguard her work and preserve the domain in which her skill is valued. Further, the upward mobility of families who urge their women to abandon such work and attain modernization, works at cross-purposes with women’s independence and livelihood to avoid economic dependence on and control of their labour by their men and to aim at the development of their own skills. These women’s lives indicate their capacity to turn around the stigma attached to their caste occupation into a tangible part of their work that they can eschew in their negotiations with modernity, their communities and families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392111429223">Nihila, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011392111429223">Omvedt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392111429223">Pinto, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392111429223">Ramaswamy, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the female body in public is not directly sexualized in these caste occupations, this segmentation of labour and class differentiation is compounded by the construction of the binary opposition of procreative and non-procreative sexuality: good wives vs ‘others’ (e.g. widows and prostitutes), who are outside the bounds of marriage. The latter thereby providing a pool for the collective appropriation of their labour and services. The Dalit and other stigmatized women then attain the role of a public labourer whose labour is devalued although often necessary for social reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011392111429223">Sangari, 1993</xref>: 6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011392111429223">Velaskar, 1998</xref>: 10).</p>
<p>Since lower caste women cannot be controlled in a similar manner as the upper caste women – who are mostly confined to households and subject to other trappings of social status –some of these lower caste women’s sexuality is constructed as transgressive and they are deemed promiscuous, making not just their appropriation but their control easily possible. Thus it is not difficult to understand why the women dancers (lower class/caste women) in the dance bars were banned from dancing while film actresses and models (upper class/caste women) continued to perform on screen or walk the ramp! The upper class/caste women gain social status with being visible in a dramatic, larger-than-life sort of way. There is a hungry, consuming voyeurism, characteristic of class society that makes one covet the grand and the unattainable. In contrast, for the bar girls and lower caste women, their very ‘availability’ renders them both vulnerable, ‘cheap’ and marks them out for abuse. Thus these lower caste women are stigmatized while those who exploit them are able to distance themselves from it.</p>

<title>From feminist knowledge to activism: Whose voices and experiences count?</title>
<p>What do we, as upper caste/class feminists know about the lives of lower caste/class women as seen from their perspective of struggle? While the Indian feminist literature has described the struggles of the women’s movements in detail, specific atrocities against Adivasi,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0011392111429223">4</xref></sup> Dalit and Muslim women have not been sufficiently discussed to analyse their caste/gender underpinnings. On the one hand, the Indian women’s movements, which have broadly linked research and practice, rallied around, campaigned and struggled for justice for women based on marginalized identities, for instance, in the case of Mathura, an Adivasi woman, or Bhanwari Devi, a Dalit woman, or Shah Bano, who was a Muslim woman. On the other hand, it has been the all-encompassing category of ‘woman’ that has come to overshadow the diversity that women live out in their lives. Dalit feminists and scholars on caste feel that the women’s movements have not done enough to address caste and the oppression of Dalits, specifically Dalit women, or even sufficiently problematized the Dalit woman’s location as much as other diversities. Therefore, organizing around identity politics has highlighted the impatience of the diverse groups, who feel the need to assert their identities and highlight the specificities of discrimination and injustice that they have faced.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0011392111429223">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The challenge of linking research to practice remains inextricably linked to understanding these diverse knowledge and looking at the construction of everyday experience of caste and how the consciousness of caste emerges through Dalit narratives of everyday life. In other words, the politics of the necessity of engaging with caste begins with listening to Dalit voices, movements for Dalit rights, and recognizing the misperception that the politics of caste is only the onus of Dalits. For those (of us) located within the upper castes, a real understanding of caste does not happen as part of (our) life experience. This is clear from the example of the upper caste students of the University of Hyderabad who had gathered together on the same platform in dealing with and protesting a case of sexual harassment on the campus. A request went around that everybody should identify the caste that they belong to, as part of their introduction, before commencement of the discussion and strategizing. The upper caste students were aghast by this sudden pressure to identify their caste, which they never before had to state in public. Their unexamined assumption was that social and public spaces were casteless or by analysis imbued with upper caste identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011392111429223">Joint Action Committee, 2000</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0011392111429223">6</xref></sup> Dalits, on the contrary, are constantly reminded and identified in terms of their caste status. As Kumud Pawade notes in Antasphot,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>The result is that although I try to forget my caste, it is impossible to forget. And then I remember an expression that I heard somewhere: what comes by birth and can’t be cast off by dying – that is caste.<sup>7</sup></p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0011392111429223">
<title>Caste/sexuality/labour: Listening to Dalit voices</title>
<p>In recent years several accounts by Dalit feminists, in the form of testimonies and autobiographies, have served to reflect their lives not only as individual narratives but as reflections of the consciousness and the material realities of Dalit lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392111429223">Kamble, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011392111429223">Pandian, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011392111429223">Pawar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011392111429223">Rege, 2006</xref>). Apart from autobiographies, scholarship on communities of women of lower castes has focused on the histories of their labours and lives, to reflect on their contemporary realities. These accounts, as I briefly outline in the next section, show how these women negotiate their work/family lives, and what options they have sought for themselves. Even as there is a recognition of Dalit voices within feminist research and practice, one strand of lower caste women, on whom is stamped not just their caste/ethnic status but the public availability of their sexual labour, remains elusive. Their voices are slowly emerging, reflecting not just their material realities, the histories of their transition through different forms of labour, but also their options and the bargains they make in moving out of the bind of caste and class locations. What, specifically, do these women say about their experience as dancers and performers?</p>
<p>Positioning this discussion about bar dancers as caste-based labour within a larger discussion of sexual labour as performance, including historical cases of such labour, will further illuminate the debates where contesting voices place the question of sexual labour at the centre of debate for society and not just the womens movement. Until now the Indian women’s movement has sexual labour understood in terms of prostitution, and largely as sexual exploitation of women. However several other voices have entered the field over the years and ‘the prostitution question’, that is, ‘the contemporary debates around women in prostitution, is <italic>fraught</italic> today [my emphasis] because of the acute divide it has created among feminists and between feminists and sex workers, not to mention among others in the field, in India and elsewhere’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011392111429223">Sunder Rajan, 2003</xref>). Sunder Rajan rightly emphasizes that the question of prostitution has, as in this instance of the dance bar ban and the debate on sexual labour, brought out several of the unresolved issues in feminism such as the relationship between feminists and the female ‘victims of oppression’; the construction of the female subject in terms of ‘agency’ (choice, autonomy, desire, ‘voice’); the conceptualization of women’s work and female sexuality, and the public and private domains of these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011392111429223">Sunder Rajan, 2003</xref>: 117–118).</p>

<sec id="section4-0011392111429223">
<title>Caste-based sexual labour as performance</title>
<p>Moving away from the prior feminist emphasis on sexual labour as prostitution, drawing upon the accounts of women who have provided different types of sexual labour, this section provides a historical and contemporary overview of some of the caste-based sexual labour of these women, the pathways of women entering it, and their specific experiences within sexualized labour. It is important to point out that feminist research – with its objective of documenting women’s lives – uncovers some of these women’s histories and voices; at the same time, these feminist depictions of caste-based forms of cultural labour have become vehicles of waging cultural and political struggles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392111429223">Anandhi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392111429223">Kannabiran and Kannabiran, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392111429223">Rege, 1995</xref>). The histories presented here are the fruits of research, while the linkages of research to practice form the zone of contestation. Such documentation and contestation are germane to the controversy over the bar dancers as sexual labourers.</p>
<p>Historically, several regions of India have had certain castes and communities performing different types of sexualized labour. Here I present three groups whose labour has focused on dance/performance: the Kolhati caste of Maharashtra who perform the <italic>lavani</italic>, the Devadasi traditions that enforced temple-based prostitution on women of different castes, specifically in South India, and the women of the Bedia nomadic community who entertain through dancing and who now make up a significant proportion of the bar dancers in Mumbai. Research shows that in each case, there is an appropriation of the women’s art along with a stigmatization of their sexuality.</p>
<sec id="section5-0011392111429223">
<title>Lavani of the Kolhati caste</title>
<p>Historically, <italic>lavani</italic> is the art of the Kolhati women, and it emerged as a construction of the sexuality of the lower caste women in the Peshwa state of the 17th and 18th century in Maharashtra. Although the art of <italic>lavani</italic> began in the form of Prakrit verses dated between the 1st and 7th century <sc>ad</sc> reflecting the everyday life of the lower caste communities, in the 13th century it entered the realm of exchange when it became known as performance with the ‘explicit aim of provoking men into handing over their wealth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392111429223">Rege, 1995</xref>: 23–24). The Peshwa state simultaneously set about systematically sexualizing lower caste women by intervening in the production of erotic <italic>lavanis</italic>, while also taking advantage of the dancers’ destitution during famine to enlist them as sexual and agrestic slaves.</p>
<p>The rise of the Marathi theatre in the mid-19th century saw the entry of women from the <italic>lavani tamashas</italic>, even as middle-class women imbued with a Victorian morality shunned these theatres. These women performers also started theatre companies, with the <italic>sangeet barees</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0011392111429223">8</xref></sup> branching out from them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392111429223">Rege, 1995</xref>: 29–30). While <italic>tamasha</italic> troupes – which kept <italic>lavani</italic> alive as a folk art – were dying out, Marathi cinema used the <italic>tamasha</italic> genre to gain ascendance, thus effecting a revival of the art form. The films, however, kept out the Kolhati women, whose lives as <italic>nachees</italic> (dancers) remained under patriarchal-male <italic>panchayat</italic> – control. These dancers were prevented from marrying and they had little control over their earnings, as their body and art was symbolically and materially constructed as belonging to the troupe.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0011392111429223">
<title>Devadasis of the Isai Vellalar caste of Tamil Nadu</title>
<p>Unlike the <italic>lavani</italic> which was appropriated by the politically and economically powerful, movements for the reform of Devadasi traditions in South India tried to rescue the art and elevate the performers’ status. However, as this art form became part of legitimated aesthetics, the social concern about the women performers became muted. Nonetheless, we find some voices of these ‘reformed’ women, for instance, Muvalur Ramamirthammal, emphatically insisting on abolishing the practice while also ensuring financial security for the Devadasis who would otherwise have to face destitution.</p>
<p>The debate on the abolition of the Devadasi system in the 1930s had resonances with our own 21st-century debates around the dance bar ban, as I describe in a later section. In the 1930s, on one side were the progressives who sought abolition, like Dr Muthulakshmi Reddy of the Women’s India Association who introduced the Bill in 1929 in the Assembly, often couching her debate as a champion of young girls. Among those who opposed the Bill at that time was Congressman S Satyamurti among the conservatives who pretexted it under the protection of Hindu culture and tradition. There was a third set of actors who supported abolition: the caste <italic>panchayats</italic> of the Isai Vellalars and the Sengundars, who denounced the Devadasi system as a dishonour to their caste, dissociated themselves from those Devadasis who invoked the caste name saying they impeded the progress of the caste, and denied the recruitment of Devadasis from their caste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392111429223">Anandhi, 1991</xref>). Finally, there were those Devadasis who did not want their profession to be stigmatized as ‘mere’ prostitution, claiming a spiritual and aesthetic genealogy and insisting that they enjoyed property and education rights which the current stigmatizing would jeopardize.</p>
<p>In these debates in the 1930s, Devadasis were cast as either ‘unchaste women’ or as protectors and preservers of art and culture, while none cared for the Devadasis’ own voices. In her novel <italic>Dasigal Mosavalai</italic>, Muvalur Ramamirthammal presents contrasting voices of Devadasis: some liberated ‘dasis’, others still practising and others reformed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392111429223">Anandhi, 1991</xref>: 740–741).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0011392111429223">9</xref></sup> Ramamirthammal herself was a rebel within the Devadasi system and an indefatigable campaigner for women’s rights organizing Devadasis for the abolition campaign, first as a Congress worker and subsequently following Periyar into the Self-Respect movement. In order to break the system from the clutches of the Hindu temples she even advocated and organized inter-caste marriages of consent for the ‘dasis’ associated with the temples. The novel itself is radical at a time when even middle-class women hardly wrote full-length novels and when existing novels valourized traditional womanly virtues such as chastity and loyalty to home and husband (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392111429223">Anandhi, 1991</xref>: 741–743).</p>
<p>Steering away from stereotyping of Devadasis, the novel reflects each emerging from her social context; some in control, others as victims, the solidarity among the several women characters be they Devadasis or wives of <italic>zamindars</italic>, and the exposure of the colluding role of religion, class, patriarchy and Brahminical priesthood in entrenching the Devadasi system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392111429223">Anandhi, 1991</xref>: 745). For some, it was an economic system where the skills of music and dance are but instruments for economic gain, while others trapped in poverty sought deliverance by moving into the confines of marriage and family and there are reformed Devadasis who become political activists looking for social change beyond what monogamous marriage may offer. And finally, the ‘centrality of “dasis” at the beginning of the novel is displaced by the centrality of women as such, with “dasis” being a section of women’ affirming how diverse ‘voices transform with transformed contexts’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392111429223">Anandhi, 1991</xref>: 745–746). All of these portrayals in the novel had resonances with contemporary events and happenings.</p>

<title>The dancers of the Bedia community</title>
<p>The lives of women in the Bedia community reveal yet another facet of sexualized/caste labour: in this community, the unmarried women contribute to the maintenance of the family economy via their sexual labour, supporting their brothers or parents and their families, while their children grow up with them or their brothers and their families. The wives of the brothers do not participate in the exchange of sexual labour or the migration related to this form of livelihood. In this community, a good woman is one who selflessly provides for her natal kin and so being a good mother is not an important ideal in itself. Given these ideologies about unmarried women helping to maintain the family economy through their sexual labour, these sisters and daughters are socialized into the ‘traditional’ labour of the community. Where women use the same space for work as their family residence, family complicity is clear. Even when women migrate, their families negotiate the use of this sexual labour as the women explore other options, be it dance bars, stage shows, <italic>mujras</italic>, to support their families back home and secure the future of their children and dependants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392111429223">Agarwal, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011392111429223">2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0011392111429223">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the dance bars of Mumbai, a study has indicated that nearly 42% of women were from Bedia communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392111429223">RCWS and FAOW, 2005</xref>). The women sought out the dance bars because of the absence of family or state support for acquiring any other skill or vocation or possibility of relocation from caste-based professions. Many of the bar dancers from these communities said that while they only danced (and did not engage in sex work), they had some regular customers who were their main sources of income and who they specifically entertained in the bars. The dancers seemed to have a degree of comfort and negotiating power with these customers, which allowed them to confine their work to dancing only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392111429223">FAOW, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>About a quarter of the women in the dance bars in Mumbai mentioned that they had worked in other jobs in the unorganized sector such as domestic work, sales jobs, small-time factory jobs, rag picking, even doing stage shows or singing in <italic>mujras</italic> before coming to work in the dance bars, indicating that they had not been trafficked as is conventionally believed. There was even an instance of a woman doing sex work before coming to work in dance bars. Three-quarters of the women dancers were the sole earning members in their families, supporting dependants either in the city of Mumbai or children and extended kin in their villages of origin. Apart from the fact that the women negotiated the degrees of sexual labour, there is a palpable shift in the nature of their location from the traditional occupation wherein they had less space to negotiate. In their accounts, the bar dancers emerged as migrants and in the context of the feminist recognition of migration in other sectors such as construction, mining, brick kiln work, even international domestic labour, the bar dancers merited recognition as legitimate workers seeking a livelihood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392111429223">Agarwal, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011392111429223">Arya and Roy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392111429223">RCWS and FAOW, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus while larger structures such as the state (<italic>lavani</italic> performers), religion (Devadasis) and family (Bedia women) construct women’s sexuality, it is not as though women themselves do not understand or articulate their position in this structural and ideological framework. A question for feminists and others is what have women themselves been able to do and how have they foregrounded their concerns, even as they are negotiating their situation within structures that establish an ideology of sexual labour and dictate its practice? These accounts of caste-constrained occupations have demonstrated the different levels of leverage that women can tap into. The contentious issue is whether these instances amount to effecting any lasting change in the entrenched structures of discrimination and subjugation. Would it be worthwhile to pursue a research and activism framework of addressing exclusions and discriminations based on caste from the perspective of caste-based labour and the ruptures that women are able to create within it?</p>

<title>Towards an understanding of multiple marginalities and a dialogue across differences</title>
<p>In general it is evident now that knowledge uncovered through the voices of the marginalized –through historical research, through biographies and interviews – has helped collectivize our Indian feminist struggles against discrimination. At this level, research has guided practice. In the Indian context Sharmila Rege has advanced a Dalit feminist standpoint alternatively called non-Brahmin renderings of women’s liberation within the specific context of Maharashtra. The independent and autonomous assertions by Dalit feminists in the 1990s for an identity by naming their difference has been part of a discourse of dissent to the mainstream women’s movement and the male-dominated Dalit movement in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011392111429223">Rege, 1998</xref>). These diverse strains of assertions of agency by Dalit feminists and feminist groups have evoked responses from the autonomous women’s movements as well.</p>
<p>For feminists who are constantly confronted with newer challenges from the margins, this expression of a Dalit feminist standpoint is itself an avenue for further articulations of ‘feminisms’, particularly so in the case of the controversy over the bar dancers before us and that which this article attempts to have a framework to address. As Rege says, ‘adopting a dalit feminist standpoint position means sometimes losing, sometimes revisioning the “voice” that we as feminists had gained in the 80s . . . transforming individual feminists into oppositional and collective subjects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011392111429223">Rege, 1998</xref>: WS44).</p>
<p>The following discussion – where I have relied on my participation in the conversations and dialogue, as a member of the autonomous feminist collective, Forum Against Oppression of Women (FAOW), both within the organization and with other organizations – illustrates the process of talking across differences. These discussions are still ongoing.</p>
<p>Following the differences that emerged among feminists in Western India, most particularly in the city of Mumbai, over the issue of bar dancers, feminists across different streams attempted to come together to engage in conversations. These included the FAOW, one of the oldest autonomous feminist collectives; the Samajvadi Mahila Sabha, a group of socialist feminists; and several Dalit feminist writers and activists, among others. These feminists met on two occasions in 2009 in Mumbai and had intense deliberations that initially attempted conversations across our histories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0011392111429223">11</xref></sup> This effort had germinated in the period following the Seventh National Conference of the Women’s Movements in India in 2006 in Kolkata, when groups from different regions across the country proposed to initiate dialogues across differences.</p>
<p>In the conversations in Mumbai there was an acknowledgement of the locations from which everyone came, the histories of oppression and/or privilege, so that a close understanding of each other’s trajectories could refine one another’s grasp of political realities. Since some locations are better at providing explanations of the world than others, exposures to the other’s histories, struggles and negotiations can expose the contradictions and mystifications that shroud our understanding. There is thus a simultaneous impetus to interrogate the position of privilege that one occupies if one is located in a situation of dominance with respect to any social location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392111429223">Moya, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011392111429223">Wyatt, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The ultimate objective is to develop a strategy of dialogue and alliance building. The groups that were involved in the conversations have endeavoured to come together in joint action over campaigns, even as they kept the conversations alive. One of the important exchanges has been to understand sexuality not just through the lens of caste but from the perspective of queer feminists challenging heteronormativity. At another level, the frustrations and anxieties of Dalit feminists from patriarchal dominance within Dalit collectives, differences among subcastes and the tendency of right-wing dominance within Dalit collectives were other insights. Essentially, these dialogues which incorporated such ‘self-revealing conversations’ were the result of trust built up over time.</p>
<p>Crucially, what has emerged is not the emphasis on seeking a resolution, but increased understanding of diverse histories and contemporary realities. Often some histories of hurt and cruelty have to be accepted without contestation from contemporary locations, as when some middle-class Dalit feminists of Mahararashtra vehemently condemned the Devadasi tradition that pushed their grandmothers into subjugation. At other times, one could not turn away from newer configurations, such as when women from the Devadasi communities of Western India today collectivize as sex workers to battle against police atrocities and raids in their places of work. In the context of white feminists and feminists of colour, Wyatt notes that trust cannot be taken as a given between the women of different racial groupings divided over histories separated by centuries of slavery, land theft and racism. It only takes place over time through a constant and progressive exchange of the experiences of each other’s lived realities and material existences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011392111429223">Wyatt, 2004</xref>: 897–898). Something similar is evident here, though the differences include caste, class, generation, region and occupation.</p>
<p>The new and emerging voices of women in sex work/prostitution have added yet another complex flavour to the dialogues that have begun in various part of the country. Whatever the historical trajectory of the emergence of voices of sex workers, undoubtedly the first voices emerged in the 1990s following the organizing around HIV-AIDS prevention activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392111429223">Sangram-VAMP and Point of View, 2008</xref>). This activism whether in Maharashtra with VAMP (Veshya Anyay Mukti Parishad) or in West Bengal with DMSC (Durbar Mahila Samanvay Committee) went on independently without recognition by the women’s movement. But the need to break down the barriers within the women’s movement was felt by organizations of sex workers as well as those working with sex workers and a few activists within the womens movement. This need and subsequent mobilization resulted in the organizing of a sub-theme session to address issues related to women in prostitution/sex work for the first time in the Seventh National Conference of the Autonomous Women’s Movement in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392111429223">FAOW, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A dialogue was planned at the session at the conference, between women’s groups, sex workers’ groups and groups working with sex workers. Even within women’s groups, there were diverse positions such as between FAOW from Mumbai, who considered it as work and acknowledged that sex workers addressed issues of autonomy and pleasure, or Stree Vedi from Kerala, who were resolute that prostitution could be nothing but patriarchal exploitation and abuse of power while being emphatic that emotions cannot be traded, or Jagori from Delhi, who acknowledged that sex workers’ groups had pushed the boundaries and questioned the women’s movements’ understanding, and advocated decriminalization. Among sex workers’ rights groups, VAMP from Sangli, Maharashtra, stated that sex workers were more empowered than married women in families. They believed that they did business and not work, and demanded decriminalization and rights as citizens; Sanlaap from Kolkata said that they viewed prostitution as violence and exploitation and presented some violence-ridden case studies. They said it could not be work but only commodification of women’s bodies. Nalini Jameela, a sex worker from Kerala, who had also written a controversial autobiography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392111429223">Jameela, 2007</xref>), brought the discussion back to what she termed as the paradigm of the discussion: work. She said that her focus was not to claim respectability as a sex worker, but to locate women like her in a community of labouring poor women, thereby challenging and shifting the dominant notion of the life of a prostitute as decaying and sinful, to its mundane and ordinary nature, placing it alongside other strenuous, exploitative and demeaning work. She also said that sex work added to the dimensions of pleasure and emotional happiness.</p>
<p>There have been several voices now being found in various places, in the media, in film narratives, in autobiographies, slowly but surely raising their voices, where they speak of sex work as work in a very un-self-conscious sort of way, deconstructing the aura around the act of sex. The challenge is to explore the parameters of how one would do this for caste-based sexual labour, for it is not merely the organization of labour and work, but equally about the organization of gendered caste. During the discussions in the conference session, some groups worried that there would be an increase in sex workers if prostitution or sex tourism were legalized as work; Nalini responded that sex work was not easy, so there need be no worry that women would just jump into it. The final weak although persistent voice was that of the bar dancers, who said that the ban on their work in the dance bars had actually pushed many of them into sex work, which now took place undercover in unregulated, harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Although the dialogue set forth different threads of arguments, it was seen as a step forward for feminist understanding as this was the first time sex workers’ groups and sex workers had participated in a conference of the women’s movements of India. Yet contradictory issues remained. On the one hand, in the session itself, there was agreement between all groups that rehabilitation efforts attempted by the state – where sex workers are rescued from their workplaces/homes and placed elsewhere – which gave welfare agencies and the police tremendous powers over them, ought to be obliterated. They were emphatic that rehabilitation does not put an end to the stigma which was the cause of alienation and violence being inflicted on the women in prostitution/sex work. On the other hand, the sex workers’ rights groups were unanimous that they wanted the support of women’s groups, not their advice!</p>
<p>The documentation of emerging voices representing agential articulation of hitherto marginal or unheard voices thus becomes an important component of the research resource now available for feminists to extend the spaces for dialogue and action. Newer insights of a diversity of experience add to the modes of action that can be drawn upon for feminist modes of social transformation. Thus the conference contributed to the beginnings and continuation of dialogue, and a reiteration of the concepts that have emerged and enriched the debates on sexuality and labour, coming from the movements of sex workers’ rights. Both in Eastern India as well as Western India predominantly, trade unions and collectives of sex workers have in the struggle for their rights also critiqued the institutional hold that marriage and family, and the social ideologies maintaining them, have in stigmatizing sexual labour and imprisoning certain castes within it. Finally, the questions raised by these articulations contest the privileged positions from which theorizing had progressed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0011392111429223">
<title>Research/action across differences</title>
<p>In a manner of tying the threads of the debates and informed opinions articulated thus far, Indian feminists try to evolve a framework that weaves together the historical trajectories of both the women’s movement(s)’ shifting articulations as well as the voices of the performers and the women in sexual labour, the latest entrants in this debate being the sex workers and bar dancers. The voices of the performers from history and contemporary reality do add to a framework in addressing discrimination based on caste, when approached from the perspective of labour: they do not leave structures unaltered, be it the voice of ‘dasis’ rebelling against Brahminical patriarchy or the bar dancer who negotiates the discourse of trafficking or the sex worker who posits her labour as mundane and as strenuous as other labour of poor women. The attempt is to offset patriarchal and state control while also leaving an avenue to look at the complexities that emerge in the strategizing that the different historical legacies have created. We could ask and expect an answer to this critical question: is there any meeting ground of the given articulations of feminists, who have their histories of deriving their knowledge, and those of the caste-based performers or the sex workers, among the different types of sexual labourers? The answer most probably lies in the paths of dialogue, continuing dialogue among the diverse voices. These dialogues have been fortified by the emerging agential articulations that question the privilege of existing feminists. It is through the need for enhanced understanding of social realities, and the urgency for alliance building that the strategizing for action is strengthened and the spaces for dialogue opened up. Dialogue thus becomes the concrete manifestation of collective agency.</p>
<p>At the same time, we are left with the task of extending this dialogue through the avenue of transversal politics that is predominant within global social-politics of difference, where strategies are invoked by crossing the boundaries of identities and standpoints, focusing on dialogue and coalition. Recognizing the partial and unfinished nature of knowledge emerging from different locations, our dialogue aims towards expanding this knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011392111429223">Yuval-Davis, 2006</xref>). At a national level in India, the challenges of transversal politics have obtained responses from the women’s movement, albeit with sustained efforts on the part of Muslim women, queer women, Dalit women and so on. Dialogues have been partial and sporadic, due to persistence from the margins, but they have surely foregrounded and expanded our understanding of communal politics, sexual politics and caste politics. Further dialogue will be necessary as more and newer voices emerge challenging the hegemony of the centre.</p>

<p>The assertion of identities, for instance, not just among anti-caste movements but the movement for queer rights in India has challenged the dominant structures of heteronormativity and the gender binary through its long sustained struggle in India, one arm of which was to seek reading down of Sec 377 of the Indian Penal Code that criminalizes consensual sexual acts between adults of the same sex. Having secured the reading down of the said section, activists have critiqued the limits of just gloating over this decriminalization of private sexual acts, and exhorted that the campaign continues to seek a more expansive set of rights that are encompassed in anti-discrimination laws, where even a public depiction of transgression by breaking all bonds is possible. This transgression, in the instance of caste realities, still invites inhuman and unjust backlash as evident in the daily reportage of atrocities.</p></fn>
