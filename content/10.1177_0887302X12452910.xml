<abstract>
<p>Waterproof clothing was an important form of dress in the nineteenth century. The popularity and demand for waterproof garments increased toward the end of the nineteenth century due to improvements in apparel technology as well as an increase in consumption power. Until now, little research has been done to examine the design and function of these garments and the roles they played in the daily lives of people in the late nineteenth century. This research examined United States' patents between 1880 and 1895 as well as catalogs and other materials from the period to better understand the designs, functions and uses of waterproof apparel. The patents were compared with products available in the catalogs to better understand which types of garment designs were necessary and practical for consumer use.</p>

<p>Many technological advancements and social changes culminated in the popularity for waterproof goods toward the end of the 19th century. During this time, there was an increased interest in sports and recreational activities, most of which took place outdoors. Croquet was the first sport that was socially acceptable for women to play in public. For this sport, women quickly realized the importance of rubber-soled shoes or rubber-coated overshoes to protect shoes from being soiled in the grass. In addition, society quickly recognized that skirts required modification in order for ladies to play croquet effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0887302X12452910">Warner, 2006</xref>). During the last few decades of the 19th century, the growth of industrialization led to increased discretionary income among people from all levels of society enabling more expenditure on leisure and recreation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0887302X12452910">Steiner, 1933</xref>). As women began to join the men in activities such as yachting and mountain climbing, the demand for appropriate apparel, such as waterproof clothing, increased.</p>
<p>Transportation systems were becoming more developed, and consumerism was on the rise toward the end of the century giving people of all classes the ability to travel and purchase goods for entertainment and leisure. The railroad, during the second half of the 19th century, played a large role in reducing the amount of time and cost involved with travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0887302X12452910">Taylor, 1951</xref>). According to an 1895 article in <italic>The Chautauquan</italic>, a weekly newsmagazine, “everyone possessing a bank account considers travel of some sort imperative” (Miller, 1895, p. 633). Increased access to travel, leisure, and recreational activities contributed to the growth, popularity, and need for waterproof garments. By the end of the century, many fashion columnists argued that every lady, no matter her station, should have a waterproof garment in her wardrobe (“Answers to Correspondents,” 1896a, 1896b, “Gossip of Dame Fashion,” 1896). Patents from 1880 through 1895 provide an excellent source to better understand the design and function of waterproof garments toward the end of the 19th century.</p>
<sec id="section1-0887302X12452910">
<title>Historical Framework</title>
<p>Historian Sarah Levitt is one of the few who have done research regarding waterproof garments. She thoroughly examined the history of mackintoshes and rubberized coats developed by Charles Macintosh in 19th-century Manchester, England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X12452910">Levitt, 1986a</xref>). He discovered a process to soften rubber enough that it could be spread between two layers of fabric, patented this double-texture method in 1823, and began manufacturing waterproof cloth. He soon realized that traditional tailors were not equipped to handle the waterproof fabric which would lose its waterproof qualities upon being pricked with a tailor’s pin or needle. Macintosh therefore entered into the manufacturing of garments using his waterproof cloth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887302X12452910">Levitt, 1986b</xref>).</p>
<p>Macintosh’s waterproof coats experienced a brief surge in fashion in the 1830s after military officers were seen wearing drab or khaki colored versions of this waterproof garment in public. These garments declined in popularity due to the unstable nature of the rubber which would become stiff when cold and sticky when warm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887302X12452910">Levitt, 1986b</xref>). In 1844, Both Charles Goodyear in the United States and Thomas Hancock in England patented vulcanization which was a process used to stabilize the rubber so that it remained pliable in all climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X12452910">Levitt, 1986a</xref>). After this discovery was implemented, waterproof garments returned to favor in the 1850s. As methods improved, waterproof garments became cheaper and were made in more fashionable styles until they reached a peak in popularity in the 1880s and 1890s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X12452910">Levitt, 1986a</xref>).</p>
<p>Since few garments remain due to the natural degradation of rubber, Levitt used registered designs in her study that included photographs and drawings of actual garments proposed for manufacture in the late 19th century. The registered designs helped to identify fabrics and details that were created for the waterproof garments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X12452910">Levitt, 1986a</xref>). While some designs included features that were purely fashionable, such as a frilled collar, others included functional details including detachable collars or an attached cape aimed at preventing water from seeping into the garment. Other coats were designed to be reversible with a variety of linings including checked patterns, twill weaves, cambric, and muslin. As the 20th century approached, however, the popularity of rubber coats began to give way to the new fashion of chemically treated rainproof coats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X12452910">Levitt, 1986a</xref>).</p>
<p>The history of waterproof garments in the United States is similar to that of England. The types of waterproof garments available throughout the 19th century consisted of oiled cloth, chemically treated cloth, and rubber. Rubber, however, was one of the crowning technological achievements of the century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X12452910">Levitt, 1986a</xref>). Americans were introduced to rubber in the form of shoes from Brazil in the 1820s. By the 1830s, several companies were engaged in making rubberized waterproof clothing. Due to the diverse range of seasonal temperatures which affected the stability of rubber in the United States, many rubber companies struggled to make a reliable product until Goodyear’s patent for vulcanization in 1844 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0887302X12452910">Woshner, 1999</xref>). After vulcanization, manufacturers in the United States and England experienced similar growth and development in making rubber waterproof goods.</p>

<title>Use of Patents in Research</title>
<p>Patents have become a valuable source of information for researchers to better understand the design and development of various types of garments as proposed by their inventors. Several studies have used patents as an important source of information about apparel and related products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887302X12452910">Farrell-Beck, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X12452910">Farrell-Beck, Poresky, Paff, &amp; Moon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887302X12452910">Farrell-Beck, Rhodes-Murphy, &amp; Richardson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887302X12452910">Helvenston Gray &amp; Peteu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887302X12452910">Peteu &amp; Helvenston Gray, 2009</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887302X12452910">Peteu and Helvenston Gray (2009)</xref>, the use of patents provides insights into garment wearability, which may not be indicated in other primary sources.</p>
<p>Patents best serve to tell a story about the trials of inventors to solve particular problems since within the patent descriptions, inventors include statements concerning past deficiencies and previous attempts at a solution. The challenge with using patents is that they do not indicate what was actually being made at the time. It is difficult to determine from the patent itself whether a design was successful and popular enough to be manufactured. In addition, some designs were perfected over a series of patents making it difficult to determine the importance of individual patent designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887302X12452910">Peteu &amp; Helvenston Gray, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This research explored the technology and design of waterproof dress by examining relevant patents in the United States between 1880 and 1895. The patents helped to identify the design and development related to the function and fashion of waterproof garments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0887302X12452910" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>In an effort to better understand design, development, and function of waterproof dress, this research utilized United States’ patents as the primary data source. Catalogs, ladies’ magazines, and other sources including newspapers, letters, advertisements, and archival documents were used as supplementary information to better understand the relationship between the patent designs and the needs and desires important for the consumption of waterproof apparel goods.</p>
<p>Previous research indicated that waterproof apparel reached a peak of mass production toward the end of the 19th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X12452910">Levitt, 1986a</xref>). Preliminary exploration of patent publications indicated that the greatest frequency of patents occurred between 1880 and 1895, thus meriting the most attention. Although searchable databases for patents, such as Google Patents are presently being developed, identifying patents for waterproof garments can be a challenge. Due to the technical nature of the waterproofing process and varying design features, waterproof apparel designs were filed using a variety of classifications. In addition, full-text patents are available on the United States Patent and Trademark Office website (USPTO); however, either the patent number or the classification code is required to locate patents from the 19th century. In order to ensure that no relevant patents were overlooked, every patent between 1880 and 1895 needed to be examined. Therefore, this research required the systematic examination of all entries in the <italic>Official Gazette of the United States Patent Office </italic>(a publication by the USPTO) issued between 1880 and 1895 which included abstracts of the patents, registered designs, and reissued patents.</p>
<p>A bank of terms was created from existing literature to facilitate the identification of patents for waterproof dress. Some of the terms included India rubber, caoutchouc, gutta-percha waterproof, mackintosh, gossamer, storm serge, storm-ulster, oil slicker, and pommel slicker. Once the relevant patent numbers were identified, each full patent was obtained from the USPTO website. Information from each patent was coded and categorized so as to gain a better understanding of the emerging themes. The codes include the following categories: patent number, patent date, patent author, company, author location, patent title, image included (description), type of garment, type of waterproofing technique, patent points (summary), stated improvements, special characteristics, reference to occupations, past problems, and reference to other garments. The data were analyzed using a narrative approach with rich descriptions of the patent design and function originating from each patent to help identify emerging and reoccurring themes. All of the patents for waterproof apparel included images in addition to the patent information which enhanced understanding of the garment designs. Seventy-two relevant patents were identified using this process.</p>
<p>In order to broaden the scope of this research, a variety of individual catalogs, including dry goods catalogs, rubber goods catalogs, and oiled apparel catalogs, were viewed. Twenty-four catalogs were identified as containing waterproof dress which provided a comparison for the information gained from the patents as well as support for the types of designs that were actually being offered to the consumers.</p></sec>
<sec id="section4-0887302X12452910">
<title>Design and Function</title>
<p>Waterproof apparel patents as well as catalogs and other resources helped to demonstrate improvements in the design and function of waterproof dress between 1880 and 1895. The apparel patents often focused on a specific design detail to improve the waterproof ability or function of the garments. The types of garments consisted of coats, ensembles, skirt protectors, or other devices as outside protection for the clothing. The patents illustrated creative and unique approaches used by inventors to find a solution to specific design problems.</p>
<p>Each patent included a description of the design features and details as well as the intended function of the garment as it related to an occupation or recreational activity. The patent descriptions related to occupations typically emphasized how the design features would improve the garment’s function during its specified activity. Patent designs designated for recreational use were either generally described as intended for protection while traveling or walking or included a description for the intended leisure activity.</p>
<sec id="section5-0887302X12452910">
<title>Occupational Garments</title>
<p>Within the categories of occupation or recreation, the patents for waterproof apparel were examined by purpose or function. The occupations discussed within the patents primarily consisted of those where the individual may be exposed to rain or another water source while working. Although some garments included multiple design features, they were categorized based on the primary purpose of the patent. The categories related to occupation consisted of garments for horse riding and other occupations.</p>
<sec id="section6-0887302X12452910">
<title>The horse rider</title>
<p>Several patents addressed the need for coats that could be worn as a protective garment while riding as well as walking. The main design features of these patents focused on the fullness in the skirt of the coat through a retractable gusset or other means. Another approach to enhance protection was to add buttons, straps, detachable flaps, or pouches on the tails of the coat to ensure that the coat would cover the wearer’s legs when walking and, especially, riding. Many of these patents specified that the coat was intended to be an oiled waterproof garment worn by horsemen whose occupations included herding cattle. Abner J. Tower, whose name can be found on a company listed in Boston business directories throughout the 1880s and 1890s obtained a patent in 1882 for a coat made with an additional flap to cover the saddle as well as the rider and described its purpose as the following:<disp-quote>
<p>The object of the invention is to provide a storm flap, which when the wearer of the coat is on horseback, lie over and in front of the pommel of the saddle in such a manner that, although the body of the coat is necessarily spread apart, the person’s clothing and saddle are thoroughly protected from the rain, which otherwise could drive in and saturate the saddle and clothing, and be likely to chill and drench the person of the wearer at that point, often causing serious trouble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887302X12452910">Figure 1</xref>; U.S. Patent No. 267,729, 1882).</p>

</p>
<p>The catalogs reflected the practicality of these garments. Many of the catalogs offered garments that were intended to serve a similar purpose—to cover the wearer’s lower extremities and the saddle from the elements while riding. The catalogs helped to establish that these patents were created to fulfill a real consumer need. The importance of a waterproof garment for cowboys is illustrated in the following excerpt from a poem:<disp-quote>
<p>When the rain’ pourin’ down, my slicker I’ll wear</p>
<p>And not have it lying ‘round camp,</p>
<p>For riding without one when fall rains are on</p>
<p>A cowboy most always feels damp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887302X12452910">O’Malley, 2000</xref>, p. 29)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>L. Frank’s 1891 <italic>Illustrated Catalogue</italic> offered several pommel slickers including the Fish Brand, Shield Brand, and Herder’s Slicker. There is little explanation provided with these garments; however, the Fish Brand Slicker was a brand advertised by Tower’s company and appeared to be similar in design to one of Tower’s patents as well as a patent by John F. Carter (Sampson, 1895; U.S. Patent No. 313,130, 1885; U.S. Patent No. 360,851, 1887).</p>
<p>The 1890s Goodyear Rubber Co. catalog provided better imagery and explanation for their riding garment called the Badger Saddle Coat (Goodyear Rubber, 1890s). The image of the coat appeared to be similar in design to the patent submitted by Henry Emanuel of the Standard Oiled Clothing Co. in 1885 (U.S. Patent No. 329,299, 1885). The coat was cut in the front to cover the pommel of the saddle. Additional patents may have been incorporated into this product, as the description also included “patent reversible elastic inside sleeve” and “patent brass eyeleted metal buttons” (Goodyear Rubber, 1890s, p. 19).</p>
<p>A different solution was provided in the 1882 patent by George B. Thomson who developed a rubber coat with tails that could be converted into leggins [<italic>sic</italic>] or trousers (U.S. Patent No. 267,120, 1882). Due to a long slit in the back, the side pieces could be buttoned around the legs giving the coat a trouser-like appearance rather than being buttoned together to form the standard overcoat. Straps near the hem of the coat fastened around the ankles to help secure the coat. This design claimed that it left no opening for rain to enter. It was particularly intended for rubber coats and appeared to have been successful since similar design images were identified in multiple catalogs.</p>
<p>An identical image appeared in the 1881 catalog published by the Goodyear Rubber Co. (Goodyear Rubber, 1881). With no description, however, it was difficult to determine the catalog garment’s relationship with the 1882 patent. The same image appeared again in the 1895 L. D. Stone &amp; Co. Saddle catalog. By this time, the name of the coat had changed and information accompanying this image stated that the garment was extra long and adjusted for horseback riding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0887302X12452910">Stone, 1895</xref>). Nearly 15 years after the garment style was patented, it either continued to be manufactured and its uses expanded or the image was reinvented for a different purpose as this is the first description for this design that included horseback riding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0887302X12452910">
<title>Other occupations</title>
<p>The patents help to understand the types of occupations for which waterproof apparel was created. Some of the occupations mentioned in the patents included miners, teamsters, car drivers, hackmen, conductors, military officials, and seamen. One patent by Hermann Heynemann created specifically for miner’s overalls included pads at the knees. This patent states that although cotton batting can be used, rubber pads may be desired to make the fabric waterproof at the knees due to repetitive kneeling (U.S. Patent No. 246,674, 1881). A patent created in 1894 by Oscar Hanson was intended for fishermen and men with other sea occupations. The patent was for a life preserver that doubled as a cloak-style garment. Underneath the cloak, the waist could be inflated and used as a life-saving garment in the water (U.S. Patent No. 525,342, 1894).</p>
<p>Some of the patents featured full-body garments or suits that were designed to fit closely to the body and prevent the entrance of moisture. They covered the entire body including the feet, but often excluding the head (U.S. Patent No. 291,854, 1884; U.S. Patent No. 492,643, 1893; U.S. Patent No. 507,466, 1893). Some of the garments appeared to be intended for special purposes, such as submarine diving or water exploration for scientific purposes, which may explain why they were not readily visible in the catalogs. Other garments may have been intended for a wider variety of occupations in which the wearer would be exposed to the elements with little additional protection.</p>
<p>Many of the catalogs featured garments to be used for specific occupations. Rowe’s catalog for oiled clothing provided garments for occupations such as fishing, mining, riding, and sea-related jobs. This catalog indicated that some professions, such as that of the fisherman, had a long history with using oiled garments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0887302X12452910">Rowe, 1892</xref>). Drivers, firemen, officers, and farmers were additional occupations mentioned in the catalogs. Besides coats and cloaks, some of the work-related apparel offerings included ice aprons, packing house aprons, and baptismal pants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0887302X12452910">Howlett, 1890s</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0887302X12452910">Rowe, 1892</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0887302X12452910">
<title>Recreational Garments</title>
<p>While the occupational garments primarily focused on men, many of the recreational garment categories focused on women. The categories consisting of skirt protectors, full-body garments, and following fashion focused primarily on protecting women’s dress while walking or traveling. A common theme was to ensure that ladies’ garments were not harmed by the weather. In general, the garments in the categories ventilation, leakage prevention, drainage, and stabilization, and other recreational activities were not gender-specific and could be worn by either men or women.</p>
<sec id="section9-0887302X12452910">
<title>Skirt protectors</title>
<p>Many patents were developed for ladies’ skirt protectors to prevent the hems of their skirts from becoming muddied or soiled from the rain. Although no products were clearly identified as skirt protectors within the catalogs, primary source information indicates that waterproof garments were used in a way that protected women’s skirts. A letter by Ida Saxton in 1869 includes an account of the usefulness of such apparel on her rainy mountain hike when she states, “I managed to keep my dress dry, but my water proof was all mud as it dragged all the way coming down” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887302X12452910">Belden, 1985</xref>, p. 285).</p>
<p>The patentees took varying approaches on the issue of skirt protection. Some inventors sought to create an overskirt or full-length garment, while others simply covered the hem of the skirt. An 1883 patent by George A. Blanchard formed an overskirt. Inside the overskirt was a fold of fabric to encase the wearer’s skirts which attached at the knee to prevent the encased skirts from touching the ground (U.S. Patent No. 275,014, 1883). Another overskirt patented in 1884 by Mary L. Cummings consisted of an inner and outer skirt that was designed to encase the wearer’s skirts entirely between the two layers. Although the upper portion of the skirt could be made of any suitable fabric, the bottom was made of rubber which would prevent the hem of the skirt from becoming damp or muddied (U.S. Patent No. 308,879, 1884). It was suggested that this design was easy to use and less conspicuous than making the whole skirt of rubber. The appearance of the rubber hem, however, still may not have been considered very fashionable.</p>
<p>Many other variations were attempted to improve the functionality of the skirt protectors. Besides folding flaps of fabric, other patents such as one by Wildfrid D. Stearns incorporated other methods such as lifting the under skirts with cords or straps so they were out of harm’s way (U.S. Patent No. 418,082, 1889). Some of the skirt protector components were detachable and could be removed during periods of fair weather as illustrated in a patent by Loretto Cory (U.S. Patent No. 316,245, 1885). Other skirt protectors included hinges or folds of fabric that were held in place using elastic, hooks, clips, or other fastenings (U.S. Patent No. 289,020, 1883; U.S. Patent No. 319,477, 1885; U.S. Patent No. 510,324, 1893). As many of these techniques only encased the hem of the skirt, they were probably more conspicuous.</p>
<p>The skirt protector, although a potentially practical garment and prevalent in patents, was not mentioned in the catalogs. It is possible that the patents could not resolve lingering concerns with this type of garment or their designs may have been too impractical or unappealing to wear. One such garment from 1883 by Gilbert Baker was created in the shape of a large bag which was to be worn by sliding the feet through the elasticized openings in the bottom and fastening the top opening around the waist (U.S. Patent No. 282,254, 1883; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0887302X12452910">Figure 2</xref>). Although this type of garment could have provided protection, its appearance would have been unconventional.</p>

<title>Full-body garments</title>
<p>Full-body waterproof garments were patented for both men and women. The function of women’s full-body garments, however, appeared to be primarily weather related and worn for recreation. The designs were complex with one garment consisting of a rubber skirt, chest piece, cape, and umbrella apparatus to cover the head (U.S. Patent No. 318,538, 1885). This garment appeared as though it would be awkward to wear. Another garment equally as impractical was patented in 1895. The garment had a combined cape and hood with a drawstring, the wrists were pulled tight, the skirt was made shorter and folded to encase the skirts underneath, and “leggins” were created as a continuation of the skirts with elastic at the bottom (U.S. Patent No. 537,281, 1895).</p>

<title>Following fashions</title>
<p>The design of waterproof coats and cloaks were slow to change; however, certain styles were adapted to conform to current fashions. A few patents were created to combine fashion with function. In 1882, Hermann F. Bindseil created a reversible cloak. The cloak could be worn with the appearance of a standard ladies’ cloak which was composed of a silk exterior and a fur or quilted lining. The lining could be unfastened and reversed to expose a waterproof cover to be worn on the outside during stormy weather (U.S. Patent No. 258,697, 1882). Other inventors sought to create designs that would conform to the silhouette of the current garment styles. One such garment created in 1886 by Martha E. Brown consisted of a waterproof skirt attached to a waist (made of heavy lining fabric) and a jacket (U.S. Patent No. 343,698, 1886). The design was intended to create a garment that could be easily taken on and off and would conform to the style of the dress being worn underneath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0887302X12452910">Figure 3</xref>). Another versatile garment patented by Harriet Judson was cut full in the sleeves to accommodate the varying sleeve styles which began to increase in circumference in the late 1880s. It was also cut full in the back and had lacing on the inside so that the garment could be adjusted to fit prevailing silhouettes which included bustles and panniers (U.S. Patent No. 373,895, 1887). In the 1890s, waterproof garments following the contemporary silhouette with leg-of-mutton sleeves, such as the “women’s newmarket,” appeared in catalogs (Howlett, 1890, p. 14). Although the garment does not directly resemble a specific patent, it illustrates how waterproof garments were adapted to the current fashions.</p>

<title>Ventilation, leakage prevention, drainage, and stabilization</title>
<p>Many of the patented apparel designs addressed function and comfort in terms of ventilation, leakage prevention, and water drainage. Garments that were truly waterproof did not allow air to circulate. Inventors used several methods to provide ventilation without creating a leakage problem. Theodore Hawley’s 1881 patent sought to create ventilation by leaving openings in the coat beneath capes that extended from the shoulders. The idea was that the air could flow from beneath the cape, but as long as the cape was fastened down, the water would not be able to enter the garment (U.S. Patent No. 236,807, 1881). Other inventors including Edward Landstreet and Jay F. Towner sought ventilation through the use of special devices with openings that could be placed under the arm or in the back of the garment (U.S. Patent No. 257,024, 1882).</p>
<p>Several inventors sought to provide ventilation through perforation. This perforation was generally located in the upper portion of the garment and covered with a cape or flap to prevent moisture from entering the garment (U.S. Patent No. 301,118, 1885; U.S. Patent No. 346,087, 1886; U.S. Patent No. 385,306, 1888; U.S. Patent No. 394,558, 1888; U.S. Patent No. 397,543, 1889). Improvements continued to be made to enhance circulation, such as incorporating ribs between the perforations to elevate the garment cape away from perforated areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0887302X12452910">Figure 4</xref>; U.S. Patent No. 367,921, 1887; U.S. Patent No. 375,504, 1887). A catalog image of “the cyclone,” a coat for motormen and teamsters, had a similar appearance to the ventilated coats described in the patents because it had an additional cape or flap that covered the back shoulders. The description of the coat, however, does not specify whether the coat was ventilated (Goodyear Rubber, 1890s).</p>

</fig>
<p>Leakage prevention was mentioned frequently in the patents and was typically directed toward the front and sleeve openings. To prevent water and wind from seeping through the front opening, one coat by William P. Dodge and John Cummings included an inner flap underneath the center front button closure (U.S. Patent No. 289,236, 1883). Improvements to the sleeve design included the use of elastic or a drawstring to pull the sleeve close to the wrist (U.S. Patent No. 297,526, 1884; U.S. Patent No. 301,118, 1884). Another patent by Lyndon C. Lawton of the Chicago Rubber Clothing Company protected the arm openings on a cape by providing a button-down flap to cover the openings (U.S. Patent No. 305,011, 1884). A garment patented in 1895 by John Thomas Taylor sought to prevent the leakage of rubber garments around the seams using lapped seams to reduce the seam bulk. The outside of the garment could later be coated with rubber (U.S. Patent No. 543,662, 1895).</p>
<p>Most garments are designed to protect the wearer only where the garment covered the body. By creating drainage systems within the apparel designs, some inventors sought to lead the water away from the lower extremities. A majority of these designs incorporated troughs in the coat design either along a hem or cascading down the back (U.S. Patent No. 422,814, 1890; U.S. Patent No. 422,917, 1890). One 1883 patent by John Maguire took the design a step further by adding a spout to the trough to ensure that the draining water was carried away from the wearer and prevented the annoyance of dampened clothing (U.S. Patent No. 273,115, 1883).</p>
<p>Several patentees developed techniques to stabilize the waterproof garments in order to prevent tearing around the armholes of cloaks. This was especially important when lighter weight waterproofs were introduced. Stabilization was achieved through either the addition of fabric patches at the opening edges, the addition of elastic bands across the front to create give, or by adding tape from the armhole to the lapel or collar to reduce strain (U.S. Patent No. 313,316; U.S. Patent No. 344,606; U.S. Patent No. 425,439). One of the patentees, Amanda M. Lougee, was also the owner and manager of The Clifton Manufacturing Co. in Boston which was known for producing gossamer or light-weight rubber garments on which her improvement may have been used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0887302X12452910">Johnson, 1893</xref>).</p>

<title>Other recreational garments</title>
<p>The types of recreational activities for which garments were created included traveling, walking, bicycling, shooting, riding, driving, fishing, hunting, and camping. A patent created in 1892 by James Alfred Shelton attempted to create a versatile garment that could be used for multiple purposes related to travel and recreation. The garment was a simple circular style cloak. The patent both illustrated and claimed that the garment could be used as a knee rug for a man or woman to cover one’s legs while seated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0887302X12452910">Figure 5</xref>). It could also be used as an opera cloak, shooting garment, for riding, for driving, for fishing, for hunting, as a military cape, or as ground cover while camping (U.S. Patent No. 471,903, 1892).</p>

<p>Some of the descriptions for patents identified for travel and recreation indicated their possible use for bicycle riding. Bicycling became a popular fad beginning about 1887 through the end of the century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0887302X12452910">Warner, 2006</xref>). The sport’s popularity generated an increased demand in specially designed clothing and other products related to the sport which is evident in the patents. One such patent created in 1894 by Martha C. Geldowsky was for a ladies’ dress skirt. The design was for a divided skirt that could be worn when on the bicycle but was considered less conspicuous than bloomers. The skirt had front and rear vertical slits with elastic fastenings to help the skirt fall on either side of the wheels. The skirt was faced with rubber or thin leather for easy cleaning. Leggins could be worn up to the knee with the garment (U.S. Patent No. 529,828, 1894). Another patent created by John Wade Orr for the bicycle was a cape. The cape was conical in shape to encase the entire body extending from the neck of the rider. The garment could be arranged over the handlebars to help prevent the entrance of rain while riding. The side of the garment had elliptical coverings that protected the arm openings from moisture (U.S. Patent No. 531,695, 1895).</p>
<p>Many of the patents related to recreation provided protection for travel and general outdoor activities. Ladies magazines began recommending these basic types of garments for additional activities such as hiking and camping (Miller, 1895). Catalogs toward the end of the 19th century began to emphasize travel and recreation. On a page titled “For Traveling and Outing,” the Jordan, Marsh &amp; Co. 1891 catalog advertised a traveling costume for ladies which resembled some of the patents for ladies garments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887302X12452910">Jordan, Marsh &amp; Co., 1881/1991</xref>, p. 22). In addition, the catalog offered garments for horse riding and hunting. The attention catalogs paid to travel and recreation indicates the increasing importance society placed on having appropriate clothing for outdoor activities.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Waterproof clothing was an important part of dress in the United States between 1880 and 1895. Examining United States’ patents, catalogs, magazines, and other publications, provided insight into the types of garments developed and offered to consumers and the role those garments played in people’s lives. The main concerns addressed in the patent designs included their ability to protect the clothing beneath, prevent water from leaking into the garment, improve the stability of the garment and prevent tearing or damage during use, and develop specialized garments for specific occupational or recreational purposes. For example, the multitude of patents focused on providing ventilation speaks to the inability of the waterproof garments to breath. It was important that ventilation was balanced with leakage prevention as water seepage would render the waterproof garment useless. Although not all of the patent categories correlated with images found in catalogs, a few of the patents have been identified as being associated with manufacturers of waterproof garments including The Chicago Rubber Clothing Company, the Clifton Manufacturing Company, the Standard Oiled Clothing Company, and the A. J. Tower Company which supports the idea that the inventors sought to fulfill a real consumer need.</p>
<p>Waterproof garments potentially played a critical role in the safety of the wearer for some occupations. Occupational garments, such as officer’s coats and firemen’s coats added to comfort so that the wearer, who likely spent some time exposed to wind, rain, water, and mud while on duty, would remain protected. The most common occupational category identified in patents was horse riding which suggests that this was an important occupation in which the people involved had concerns about their apparel that needed to be addressed during the period studied. Improvements in design for horsemen sought to ensure that the men would stay dry on horseback. If a rider were to get wet while tending to cattle, he would take the risk of falling ill and being unable to work. Due to westward expansion and improved transportation systems, cattlemen likely had more access to waterproof goods and generated increased demand.</p>
<p>A majority of the patents emphasized function over fashion. The fashionability of the garment was identified as a source in need of improvement for some designs. In order to recognize societal norms and overarching trends, designs were created to follow the current silhouette or provide an inconspicuous means of protecting the garment while in public. Besides the category following fashion, the issue of social convention was addressed in several of the patents for skirt protectors as some of the inventors sought to develop less visible devices to protect the skirts. Toward the end of the 19th century, more women were engaging in travel and recreational activities which increased the necessity of waterproof garments. The growing popularity for recreational sports, such as cycling was also evident in two of the patents which were designed specifically to provide protection when riding a bike.</p>
<p>Interestingly, many of the patents related to women’s dress, particularly in the categories of skirt protectors, full-body garments, stabilization, and following fashion, were invented by women. This suggests that women were taking an active role to ensure they had adequate protection for their clothing when exposed to the weather. Although none of these patents could be directly linked to catalog offerings, at least two of the patents for stabilization were either invented by or assigned to Amanda M. Lougee who was the manager and owner of a lightweight rubber garment manufactory. It is possible that many of the inventors were using their experience and practical knowledge of waterproof garments to make continued improvements to their design.</p>
<p>More research is needed to better understand the design and use of waterproof apparel throughout history. Future research can explore different aspects of waterproof clothing, such as waterproof boots and shoes as well as underarm dress shields. Another avenue for research could be the role of waterproof garments in the military, as several resources have indicated that the military were often the first to receive mass produced waterproof merchandise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887302X12452910">Levitt, 1986b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0887302X12452910">Woshner, 1999</xref>). In addition, research should be continued through the 20th century to better understand the changes that have led to modern waterproof apparel. Although waterproof apparel has continued to evolve over the 20th and 21st centuries, some basic concepts, such as underarm ventilation, are still recognized as design features in water-resistant garments. One aspect that has remained constant is our continuing efforts to enhance the design and function of waterproof dress.</p>
