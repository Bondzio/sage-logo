<abstract>
<p>Building on social-cognitive theory and the expectancy-value theory, this study indicated that early parent expectations for children’s post-secondary educational attainment have a stronger effect on 8th-grade achievement than home-based parental involvement. With a nationally representative sample of kindergarten students and their parents in the United States of America, Structural Equation Modeling was employed in order to discern longitudinal effects on achievement via mediators. For instance, expectations held by parents in kindergarten exert much of their positive effect on adolescent academic achievement via expectations held in 8th grade. Student expectations (which are influenced by parental expectations) also significantly predict 8th grade achievement. Parent involvement in homework and grade checking in 8th grade has a slight negative effect on achievement. Home literacy in kindergarten predicts achievement in 8th grade indirectly via kindergarten achievement. These results indicate that parents can have a positive impact on academic achievement through early home literacy and maintaining a strong hope that their children will succeed in college. Because early parent expectations have long lasting effects on children, parent involvement interventions for young children need to be developed that also target elevating parental expectations. This study further clarifies the effects of the family environment on educational outcomes.</p>

<p>In order for school psychologists to effectively promote children’s success in school and life, it is vital for them to develop a deep understanding of the role of parent involvement in promoting children’s success. Unfortunately, many school psychologists in the United States of America (USA) spend very little time assessing and promoting parental involvement, because many of them have not studied parent involvement and lack professional efficacy in this domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143034312454361">Manz, Mautone, &amp; Martin, 2009</xref>). If school psychologists in the USA, who have among the best ratios of school psychologists to pupils in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034312454361">Jimerson, Stewart, Skokut, Cardenas, &amp; Malone, 2009</xref>) spend a paucity of their time promoting parent involvement, it is likely that school psychologists in countries with more challenging ratios are not yet reaching their potential in terms of promoting parent involvement. The good news is that school psychologists with more knowledge about the role of families in promoting child development are apt to confidently promote parents’ educational involvement. However, a recent content analysis of <italic>School Psychology International</italic> revealed that only 2.1% of its articles in the last two decades entailed articles on family school collaboration (including research on family impacts on learning; Little, Akin-Little, &amp; Lloyd, 2011). If school psychologists across the world are going to be on the cutting edge of understanding and promoting parental involvement, related journals with global impact need to provide more research-based insight on parent involvement to school psychologists.</p>
<p>The role of families in promoting children’s cognitive development and achievement is crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034312454361">Froiland, 2011a</xref>; Powell, Son, File &amp; Froiland, in press), yet family involvement is not emphasized enough by school psychologists or educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034312454361">Christenson, Rounds &amp; Gorney, 1992</xref>). Many parents are inadequately involved in their child’s education because they feel that teaching is better left to the experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034312454361">Reynoso &amp; Tidwell, 1996</xref>) or because they do not feel understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034312454361">Graves &amp; Wright, 2011</xref>). This is problematic because children’s academic performance is better predicted by a combination of parent involvement and parental expectations than by long established predictors such as social economic status (SES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034312454361">Keith et al., 1993</xref>). Parents of high achievers usually convey high expectations to their children and consider themselves to be key teachers for their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034312454361">Becher, 1984</xref>; as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034312454361">Christenson et al., 1992</xref>). Parent home-based involvement and parent expectations for their children’s academic success have both been associated with positive academic outcomes in numerous studies, but a paucity of these studies have been longitudinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034312454361">Christenson et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on social cognitive theory, children are greatly influenced by role models that are a consistent part of their lives, such as parents. Parents that hold high educational aspirations for their children convey those aspirations to their children and a belief that they are attainable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034312454361">Bandura, Barbaranelli, Caprara, &amp; Pastorelli, 1996</xref>). Longitudinal studies are needed in the area of parent involvement and parent expectations so that the development of parents and children can be tracked together. Parents, educators, psychologists, and policymakers need further guidance about the extent to which different methods of parent involvement may be more important at different periods of child development (e.g. middle school vs. elementary school; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034312454361">Hill &amp; Tyson, 2009</xref>; Powell et al., in press). This view aligns with the specificity principle of parenting, which posits that specific parenting efforts have the most positive impact during specific periods of child development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034312454361">Bornstein, 2006</xref>). For instance, the utility of school-based involvement declines as children get older and, accordingly, most parents decrease their involvement at school as their children progress into higher grades, possibly to support students’ autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034312454361">Baker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034312454361">Stevenson &amp; Baker, 1987</xref>). Likewise, parents decrease their provision of cognitive stimulation in the home between preschool and first grade, whereas they increase their involvement in community-based learning experiences (e.g. visiting zoos, libraries, and museums); these changes in parent involvement are related to the development of applied mathematics problem-solving skills, suggesting that it is adaptive for parents to adjust the nature of their involvement as children develop (Powell et al., in press).</p>

<sec id="sec2-0143034312454361"><title>Parental home-based involvement and children’s achievement</title>
<p>Many parents of middle school students attempt to help their children with homework, but a meta-analysis revealed that parental homework help is negatively related (<italic>r</italic> = −0.11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034312454361">Hill &amp; Tyson, 2009</xref>) with academic outcomes in middle school. This is quite a contrast to the effectiveness of parental home-based involvement (e.g. shared reading and discussing numbers) at younger ages, such as in kindergarten (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034312454361">Froiland, 2011a</xref>; Powell et al., in press). Effective parent involvement in middle school may have more to do with conveying positive expectations and autonomy supportive communication about school/learning than with helping children with their homework or checking on grades repeatedly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034312454361">Cooper, Lyndsay &amp; Nye, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143034312454361">Froiland, 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034312454361">Hill &amp; Tyson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Early parental involvement increases school readiness skills which greatly influence the academic careers of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034312454361">Arnold, Zeljo, Doctoroff, &amp; Ortiz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034312454361">Mendez, 2010</xref>). In fact, early achievement is highly predictive of later achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034312454361">Davison, Seo, Davenport, Butterbaugh, &amp; Davison, 2004</xref>) indicating early parental involvement may be vital to helping children establish a good academic trajectory. As was mentioned previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034312454361">Hill &amp; Tyson (2009)</xref> found that parent involvement in middle school does not have the same positive effect on achievement as involvement in early grades. Therefore, it may be crucial for parents to be highly involved during preschool and kindergarten as this is when it proves to be the most beneficial; however, longitudinal studies with excellent sampling procedures could bring further clarity to this idea of critical periods of parent involvement.</p>
<p>Parents can help children succeed academically through early parent involvement and holding positive expectations for their children’s long term academic attainment. The combination of parent involvement and expectations robustly predicts academic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034312454361">Englund, Luckner, Whaley, &amp; Egeland, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034312454361">Keith et al., 1993</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143034312454361">Fan and Chen (2001)</xref>, found that parent expectations better predict children’s achievement than involvement at home.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0143034312454361"><title>Positive parental expectations for children’s educational attainment</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034312454361">Bandura, Barbaranelli, Caprara, and Pastorelli (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034312454361">2001</xref>) found Italian parent’s academic aspirations (including whether they hoped their child would complete middle school, high school, technical school, some college, or college graduation) for their middle school children to be a robust predictor of academic achievement measured later in the school year by teacher ratings. Parental SES predicts higher parental academic expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034312454361">Raty &amp; Kasanen, 2010</xref>) and children’s previous academic achievement influences parental expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034312454361">Zhang, Haddad, Torres, &amp; Chen, 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is important to control for parental SES and children’s previous achievement when examining the long term effects of parental expectations.</p>
<p>The current study examines the effects of parent expectations for their children completing secondary and post-secondary schooling (measured separately in both kindergarten and 8th grade) on individually assessed achievement in 8th grade. Whereas it is important that parent expectations predict teacher ratings of children’s achievement, a more objective test of the effects of parent expectations is the extent to which they have an effect on independently administered assessments of science, reading, and mathematics. Moreover, a longitudinal study that controls for early achievement and examines the effects of early parent expectations on later parent expectations is in order because the point has been raised that cross-sectional studies in this domain beg the question as to whether parent expectations are influenced by achievement or vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034312454361">Goldenberg, Gallimore, Reese, &amp; Garnier, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>A few longitudinal studies have found positive effects for parental expectations on achievement. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034312454361">Thompson, Alexander, and Entwistle (1988)</xref> found that parent expectations early in the school year mediated the effects of family status (e.g. parent education) on achievement at the end of 1st grade even when controlling for cognitive abilities measured at the beginning of 1st grade. In another study involving nationally representative data in the USA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034312454361">Keith et al. (1993)</xref> found parental involvement in 8th grade predicts achievement in 8th grade, even when controlling for grades since 6th grade. It is important to point out that their latent variable for parent involvement was most strongly influenced by parent expectations for future post-secondary educational attainment. The authors pointed out the importance of controlling for previous achievement, although achievement as measured by standardized individually administered achievement tests would be a more rigorous control than previous grades. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034312454361">Keith et al. (1993)</xref> also acknowledged that accounting for earlier parent involvement (including expectations) would add to the rigor of future studies. This is important because early parent expectations may help set children on a trajectory for academic success and other studies have indicated that later parent involvement in homework can backfire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034312454361">Hill &amp; Tyson, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, one study found that parent expectations often crystallize when their children are in preschool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034312454361">Raty &amp; Kasanen, 2010</xref>), making it worthwhile to consider early parent expectations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143034312454361">Zhan (2006)</xref> found that parental expectations for children’s post-secondary educational attainment robustly predicted both reading and mathematics achievement two years later. In contrast, neither parent involvement in school nor parent involvement in homework predicted mathematics achievement, although parent involvement in homework did predict reading achievement. This study did not control for previous achievement, nor did it control for previous involvement and expectations. Also, the children in the study ranged from ages 5 to 12 at the beginning of the study making it impossible to discern developmental shifts in the utility of different forms of parent involvement. Nonetheless, this study provided clear and nationally representative (of the USA) evidence that parental expectations are related to later math and reading achievement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0143034312454361"><title>Children’s expectations and achievement</title>
<p>The expectancy-value model of achievement posits that parental expectations are transmitted to children and that it is children’s expectations for success that directly affect achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034312454361">Eccles &amp; Wigfield, 2002</xref>). Although studies have shown that parental expectations are powerful predictors of children’s achievement (e.g. regression coefficient = 0.50 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034312454361">Bandura et al., 2001</xref>), parental expectations are also strong predictors of children’s expectations measured months later (e.g. regression coefficient = 0.57 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034312454361">Bandura et al., 2001</xref>) and parent expectations predict children’s expectations five years later (Rutchick, Smyth, Lopoo &amp; Dusek, 2009). One study found that parent expectations for children’s grades predicted student expectations, which in turn predicted actual grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034312454361">Zimmerman, Bandura, &amp; Martinez-Pons, 1992</xref>). Likewise, recent studies found that parent expectations have a strong impact on children’s expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034312454361">Kirk, Lewis-Moss, Nilsen, &amp; Colvin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034312454361">Wood, Kaplan, &amp; McLoyd, 2007</xref>) and another study in Taiwan found that children’s expectations in middle school have a moderate effect on academic achievement in middle and high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034312454361">Liu, Cheng, Chen, &amp; Wu, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to see if children’s expectations predict achievement above and beyond parent expectations (measured in both kindergarten and in 8th grade), this study included a measure of children’s expectations for post-secondary educational attainment as of 8th grade. Children’s expectations are not thought to crystallize until late elementary school and are not predictive of academic outcomes until then (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034312454361">Thompson et al., 1988</xref>); thus it made sense to only examine children’s expectations in middle school.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0143034312454361"><title>The current investigation</title>
<p>Many studies have established that parental involvement contributes significantly to children’s educational success and emotional health (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034312454361">Froiland, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143034312454361">Froiland, 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143034312454361">Marcon, 1999</xref>). However, few studies have followed the development of parent involvement and children’s achievement over long periods of time.</p>
<p>Whereas some studies have considered high parental expectations for children’s educational attainment to be an important component of a parent involvement composite (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034312454361">Keith et al., 1993</xref>), others have shown that high parental expectations alone are strong predictors of both children’s achievement and children’s own academic expectations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034312454361">Bandura et al., 2001</xref>). This study will examine the extent to which parental expectations (in both kindergarten and 8th grade) effect both children’s expectations in 8th grade and their achievement. This is an improvement over <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034312454361">Keith et al. (1993)</xref> because the effects of early parent involvement are controlled for in the analyses and a more thorough measure of early achievement is used as a control variable (i.e. a composite of individually administered reading, mathematics and general knowledge). Furthermore, examining parent involvement and parent expectations as separate variables is supported by previous studies finding that parent expectations had a greater effect (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143034312454361">Fan and Chen, 2001</xref>) and by the specificity principle of parenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034312454361">Bornstein, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0143034312454361"><title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>This following hypotheses all involve SES and race/ethnicity as a composite control variable: 1) Parental involvement in home literacy at the beginning of kindergarten will be positively associated with achievement in kindergarten; 2) Parental expectations (as of kindergarten) for their children to pursue higher education will predict achievement in kindergarten; 3) Parent involvement at home in kindergarten will predict parent expectations in 8th grade; 4) Parent involvement at home in kindergarten will predict parent homework involvement and grade checking in 8th grade; 5) Parent homework involvement and grade checking in 8th grade will be negatively related to 8th grade achievement; 6) Parent expectations as of kindergarten will predict both child and parent expectations as of 8th grade; 7) Both parent and child expectations in 8th grade will predict 8th grade achievement; 8) Parent involvement in home literacy during kindergarten will predict 8th grade achievement indirectly via kindergarten achievement and parent expectations in 8th grade; 9) Parent expectations as of kindergarten will indirectly effect 8th grade achievement via parent expectations as of 8th grade and kindergarten achievement.</p>
<p>Race/ethnicity is an important control variable in this study, because European-American parents in the USA often provide more home-based involvement in kindergarten (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034312454361">Graves &amp; Wright, 2011</xref>). Likewise, SES has been positively linked to achievement, parent expectations, and parent involvement (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143034312454361">Zhan, 2006</xref>). Findings from this study are likely to be helpful to policymakers, educators and psychologists who are interested in better understanding and supporting the critical periods of parent involvement.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0143034312454361" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>This study involved a nationally representative sample of kindergarten children from across the USA and their parents. Participants were part of the National Center for Education Statistics Early Child Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS–K), which followed families from 1998–2006. Students were a stratified probability sample of kindergarten students in the USA. Families were equally sampled (20% from each) across all five levels of a socioeconomic status (SES) measure. However, by 8th grade there were slightly more participants from the higher SES quintiles. Percentages of the participants at different SES levels ranged from 17.7% at the first quintile to 23.7% at the fifth quintile, indicating that higher SES families were more likely to remain in the study. Most of the analyses involved approximately 7,600 students who remained in the study until 8th grade.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0143034312454361"><title>Measures</title>
<p>Parents completed questionnaires providing demographic and parent involvement information at the beginning of kindergarten and at the end of 8th grade. Children’s achievement was assessed individually by trained ECLS-K staff in kindergarten and 8th grade.</p>
<sec id="sec10-0143034312454361"><title>Home literacy support</title>
<p>A home literacy factor for the beginning of kindergarten was created using Principal Components Analysis in SPSS version 18. The home literacy factor was derived from parent’s ratings on the following three items: How often parents read to their children; how many children’s books they have at home; and how frequently parents told their child stories. Because only one factor was extracted, the use of varimax rotation was obviated. Items involving the number of children’s books at home and shared reading frequency were used to measure home literacy because they are robust indicators of the home literacy environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034312454361">Froiland, 2011a</xref>). Descriptive statistics for each of the three variables that contributed to the home literacy support factor are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143034312454361">Table 1</xref>.

<p>ECLS-K interviewers asked parents what level of education they expected their children to obtain, with the following options: 1 = Less than a high school diploma; 2 = graduate from high school; 3 = attend two or more years of college; 4 = to receive a Bachelor’s degree; 5 = earn a Master’s or equivalent; 6 = to complete a PhD/MD. Parents were asked this question at the beginning of kindergarten and during 8th grade, such that two separate variables were created, Parental expectation as of Kindergarten and Parental expectation as of 8th grade. A comparable single item measure of parent expectations has been used in various studies with elementary and middle school children (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034312454361">Englund et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034312454361">Wood et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0143034312454361"><title>Parent homework checking or help in 8th grade</title>
<p>Based on a principal components analysis, this three-item factor was created. Parents were asked how often they helped their child with homework (1 = never; 2 = rarely; 3 = sometimes; 4 = always), how often they checked on their child’s homework (same scale), and how often they talked to their child about grades (1 = not at all; 2 = a few times a month; 3 = a few times a week; 4 = daily). The two homework items were utilized because many parents are likely to check on their children’s homework at this age, whereas it may no longer be developmentally appropriate to engage in home literacy practices such as reading aloud to their children. Talking about grades was included because many parents at this age check in with their kids regularly about their grades.</p>

<p>ECLS-K interviewers asked children what level of education they expected to obtain, with the following options: 1 = Less than a high school diploma; 2 = graduate from high school; 3 = attend a community college or vocational school; 4 = attend college, but not finish a four year degree; 5 = to receive a Bachelor’s degree; 6 = earn a Master’s or equivalent; 7 = to complete a PhD/MD.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0143034312454361"><title>Kindergarten achievement</title>
<p>Child assessments included individually administered (in the autumn of kindergarten) composite tests of reading, mathematics, and general knowledge of rudimentary social studies and science. Each of these comprehensive tests was based on item response theory (IRT). These three scales were entered into a Principal Components Analysis in order to create the Kindergarten Achievement factor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0143034312454361"><title>Eighth-grade achievement</title>
<p>The 8th grade achievement components included mathematics, reading, and science. As in kindergarten, each of these tests was based on IRT, such that students only completed items that were within and just beyond their optimal challenge range. Whereas the ECLS-K measured general knowledge in kindergarten, it used the science measure in 8th grade to assess knowledge in multiple domains of science (i.e. earth, space, life, and physical science).</p>

<sec id="sec16-0143034312454361"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was implemented to test the final model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143034312454361">Figure 1</xref>). This enabled a simultaneous examination of the multivariate relations between parent involvement and achievement, while controlling for child race/ethnicity and family SES. In addition, SEM enabled testing the significance of indirect effects through bootstrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034312454361">Shrout &amp; Bolger, 2002</xref>). Model fit was determined by a comparative fit index (CFI) of 0.93 or higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143034312454361">Byrne,1994</xref>), as well as a root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) that is less than 0.06 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034312454361">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>). Because a large <italic>n</italic> makes it very unlikely to have a non-significant chi-square (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034312454361">Kenny, 2011</xref>), the Hoelter Index was utilized, which indicates how small the sample size would need to be in order for the chi-square to become insignificant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034312454361">Kenny, 2011</xref>). Because of the very large sample size, the CFI and RMSEA were emphasized as indices of model fit. Use of a longitudinal weight (C2_7FPO) makes the data representative of 8th grade students across the USA

<p>The hypothesized model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143034312454361">Figure 1</xref>) provided a good fit with the data, according to the following fit statistics: CFI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.05. A significant chi-square score (χ<sup>2</sup>(7) = 101.47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) suggests that the data are significantly different than the model. However, the Hoelter Index indicated that 667 cases or less would lead to a non-significant chi-square, whereas this study involved 7,600 cases. Overall, the model demonstrated a good fit with the data.</p>
<p>As predicted in hypotheses 1 and 2, home literacy in kindergarten and parental expectations in kindergarten had positive effects on kindergarten achievement (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143034312454361">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Parent involvement at home in kindergarten predicted parent expectations in 8th grade, confirming hypothesis 3. Parent involvement at home in kindergarten predicted parent homework involvement and grade checking in 8th grade (hypothesis 4). Parent homework involvement and grade checking in 8th grade were negatively related to 8th grade achievement, although the effect was small (hypothesis 5). Parent expectations as of kindergarten predicted both child and parent expectations as of 8th grade. This confirms hypothesis 6; however, the relationship between early and later parent expectations was much stronger than the relationship between early parent expectations and 8th grade child expectations (regression coefficients = 0.35 vs. 08, respectively). Early parent expectations robustly predict later parent expectations, especially when considering that kindergarten achievement was much less predictive of 8th grade expectations (0.35 vs. 0.15) and family SES and race/ethnicity was not related to parent expectations in 8th grade (hypothesis 7). Both parent and child expectations in 8th grade predicted 8th grade achievement.</p>
<p>As predicted in hypothesis 8, the indirect effect of home literacy in kindergarten on 8th grade achievement was significant (standardized indirect effect = 0.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Likewise, hypothesis 9 was confirmed in that the indirect effect of parent expectations in kindergarten on 8th grade achievement was significant (standardized indirect effect = 0.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The effect of early parent expectations on 8th grade achievement was just over twice the effect of early parent involvement. Overall, the predictors in this model yielded an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.49 for 8th grade achievement.</p>

<sec id="sec18-0143034312454361" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>For the average 8th grader in the USA, parent involvement in homework and grade checking has a slightly negative effect on achievement. This supports the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034312454361">Hill &amp; Tyson (2009)</xref>, which indicated that help with homework often backfires in middle school. On the other hand, parent expectations for their child to attain high levels of post-secondary education predict better achievement in 8th grade. Parent expectations in kindergarten have an indirect effect on 8th grade achievement via later parent expectations. In kindergarten, parent involvement helps children develop essential skills that prepare them to succeed academically; home literacy involvement in kindergarten predicts achievement in 8th grade indirectly via kindergarten achievement. These findings further suggest the importance of promoting family involvement in literacy at home prior to the beginning of kindergarten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034312454361">Froiland, 2011a</xref>). Furthermore, conveying positive expectations for long-term academic success may be a much more fruitful parenting technique than checking homework for the parents of typical 8th graders.</p>
<p>Early parent involvement in home literacy is a predictor of later success for children. Parent involvement in home literacy early on can have more of an impact on academic achievement than checking homework in later grades. Knowing this, schools can focus on involving parents early on to create the optimal benefit for their students. Whereas most early childhood interventions with parents seek to enhance parent involvement (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034312454361">Mendez, 2010</xref>), the current findings suggest that elevating early parent expectations is also important because the indirect effect for early parent expectations on 8th grade achievement was twice as large as the indirect effect of early parent involvement.</p>
<p>In accordance with both social-cognitive theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034312454361">Bandura et al., 2001</xref>) and expectancy-value theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034312454361">Eccles &amp; Wigfield, 2002</xref>), parents across the USA convey their early expectations to their children and children’s expectations significantly predict their 8th grade achievement. While the focus of this study was on children from across the USA of all ethnicities and SES levels, the theory-based findings have implications for children across the world and support previous findings in other nations, such as Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034312454361">Bandura et al., 2001</xref>), Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034312454361">Liu et al., 2009</xref>), and Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034312454361">Raty &amp; Kasanen, 2010</xref>). Parental expectations as of 8th grade also have a direct effect on children’s achievement, but these expectations are heavily influenced by expectations that are held by parents when their children are in kindergarten. In accordance with a study in Finland that found that parent expectations for their child’s long term academic success begin to crystallize in preschool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034312454361">Raty &amp; Kasanen, 2010</xref>), the current study indicates that early parent expectations have long lasting effects on parents and children.</p>
<sec id="sec19-0143034312454361"><title>Implications for school psychologists</title>
<p>We suggest that researchers develop early childhood interventions that teach parents not only the importance of involvement and key home literacy techniques (e.g. high quality parent-child shared reading), but also how the most effective intervention strategies vary as a function of age. Meanwhile, school psychologists should also seek to elevate parents’ expectations for their children’s long term academic success. We encourage school psychologists to be cognizant of their potential to elevate parental involvement and parental expectations via psychological consultation and parent training. Because parent involvement intervention developers have repeatedly described the difficulties in getting low SES parents to participate in otherwise effective parent involvement intervention programs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034312454361">Mendez, 2010</xref>), school psychologists need to convey a strong expectation to prospective participants that the programs will likely be valuable to parents and empower their children to thrive. Future parent involvement intervention research should explore the effectiveness of adding a major component that focuses on elevating positive parent expectations, utilizing strategies derived from social-cognitive theory, expectancy-value theory or hope theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034312454361">Snyder, 2002</xref>). Meanwhile, school psychologists can support teachers in promoting high levels of parental home-based involvement early on and realize that parental educational expectations of their children are worth examining in school psychological parent interviews (with parents of both children and adolescents).</p>
<p>While the present results have implications for school psychologists in countries that have established the role of the school psychologist (i.e. usually those that have a higher GDP and embrace a philosophy of empowering women; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143034312454361">Cook, Jimerson, &amp; Begeny, 2010</xref>), we suggest that countries that have especially large numbers of low SES families and school-age children (e.g. India, China, Pakistan, and Tanzania; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034312454361">Jimerson et al., 2009</xref>) are in dire need of school psychologists who can promote positive parental expectations and involvement. Not only do parental involvement and parental expectations play an important role in academic development, they are universal targets that could be elevated preventively to promote academic success and ultimately a better quality of life for multitudes of children. School psychologists are uniquely situated to promote positive expectations for children’s future success on the part of children (e.g. through counseling), parents (via parent consultation or during parent involvement/expectation seminars) and teachers (e.g. during school psychological consultation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143034312454361">Froiland, 2011c</xref>). Teachers and principals have expressed a desire for school psychologists to provide more parent workshops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143034312454361">Gilman &amp; Gabriel, 2004</xref>), which is a way for school psychologists to reach many parents at once with parent involvement training. Furthermore, parent consultation provided by school psychologists is valued by principals in various countries, such as Estonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034312454361">Magi &amp; Kikas, 2009</xref>). When a parent interview reveals low expectations, the school psychologist could seek to elevate their expectations directly through modeling high expectations for the child and calmly persuading the parents of the potential for the child to thrive academically.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-0143034312454361"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>The measures of parent involvement in the current study entailed parent’s self-reports and did not examine the extent to which parents were autonomy supportive vs. controlling while reading to their children, checking on their homework, etc. A plethora of research indicates that autonomy supportive communication has a positive effect on children’s intrinsic motivation, emotions, and achievement (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143034312454361">Froiland, 2011b</xref>; Froiland, Oros, Smith, &amp; Hirchert, in press). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034312454361">Cooper et al. (2000)</xref> found that parent involvement has negative relations with achievement, except when it is characterized by autonomy support, in which case it has positive relations with achievement. Therefore, future longitudinal international studies of parent involvement and child cognitive development would benefit from assessing the extent to which parents are autonomy supportive during home literacy activities and homework support. Because family conflict predicted lower children’s expectations for educational attainment in Ireland, future studies may wish to control for the level of family conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034312454361">Goeke-Morey, Taylor, Merrilee, Cummings, Cairns, &amp; Shirlow, 2012</xref>). The current study did not include child-headed households, which is something important to consider in future studies as it is becoming more common in some nations, such as South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143034312454361">Pillay, 2012</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143034312454361">Pillay (2012)</xref> found in a qualitative study, many children who head their households believe that education is the key to exit abject poverty; therefore, developing positive educational expectations for themselves and their younger siblings may be a key to elevating or sustaining their motivation to learn and achievement. Furthermore, because children who head their households sometimes resent having to act like a mother when they feel in need of nurture, any ‘parent’ involvement interventions in which they might be included would need to be sensitive to this dynamic.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-0143034312454361" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study provided further confirmation that early parental involvement and parental expectations are key longitudinal predictors of academic achievement. However, as children approach adolescence, parental expectations remain vital whereas parental involvement in homework and checking grades backfire slightly. This study is an improvement on many previous studies because of the tight statistical controls including controlling for individually administered achievement in kindergarten, which strongly predicts later achievement. Parental expectations early on strongly predict parental expectations in 8th grade which positively effects both the expectations that children hold for their educational futures and 8th grade achievement. Due to the importance of early involvement, we encourage policymakers and educators to diligently help children get on a trajectory for academic success at an early age (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034312454361">Davison et al., 2004</xref>). We also suggest that more research on early parental involvement interventions be developed and that elevating parental expectations be included with interventions focused on elevating home-based involvement activities.</p>
