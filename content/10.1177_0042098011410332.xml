<abstract>
<p>In the lead-up to the peak of the financial bubble (and before the onset of the global financial crisis), property was regularly promoted as a ready-made alternative to private pensions. This paper explores the importance of owner-occupied housing for the retirement savings strategies of defined contribution (DC) pension plan members. Based upon a unique survey of over 2300 participants in the DC pension scheme of a London-based international bank, an assessment is made of the statistical significance of respondents’ socioeconomic status and risk preference in predicting the significance or otherwise of their home for retirement saving. Relatively few respondents indicated that they were likely to rely on their home. Those that indicated reliance were relatively older, higher-paid and married employees. The paper concludes with implications for understanding the connection between savings behaviour and housing before and after the global financial crisis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Each week in the ‘Money’ section of <italic>The Sunday Times</italic>, a minor celebrity is interviewed about his or her financial circumstances. The questions posed include ones about their intentions regarding saving for retirement. More often than not, the celebrity is asked to choose between a pension and property (sometimes identified as the family home) when saving for retirement. In the lead-up to the peak of the financial bubble (May 2007), many of those interviewed indicated that property was preferable to a pension. When respondents explained their choice, they often indicated that property is ‘easier to understand’ than a pension.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042098011410332">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Property has occupied a unique place in the British economic and financial imaginary, influenced by precisely this kind of media framing (including countless property programmes and the popular financial press) (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098011410332">Smith, 2010</xref>, on the expert host; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011410332">Clark <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>, on finance and the media). It has, for many, been an attractive investment over the past two decades. Economic growth, limited supply and constraints on the planning process, increasing household incomes and the fact that housing has become a crucial instrumental variable for gaining access to high-quality social goods like education have conspired to accelerate the long-term trajectory of urban property prices. It is also true that the deregulation of mortgage markets, which facilitated increasing levels of leverage and ever-higher loan-to-value ratios prior to the sub-prime crisis of 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098011410332">Langley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098011410332">Martin, 2002</xref>), offset the stagnant wages of low- to middle-income households. This facilitated an increase in homeownership and a concomitant increase in household debt as more Britons than ever crowded onto the housing ladder: homeownership reached a historical peak, exceeding 70 per cent, in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098011410332">Strauss, 2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>Property prices are also highly geographically differentiated, not least because ‘bricks and mortar’ and neighbourhood amenities are fixed non-divisible assets (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098011410332">Fingleton, 2006</xref>, on the UK) and returns to property are also highly geographically differentiated. Even so, it is apparent that there was a bubble in property prices over the first decade of the 21st century in a number of Western economies including the US (Reinhardt and Rogoff, 2009, Fig. 13.2), Spain and Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011410332">Conefrey and Gerald, 2009</xref>), in part fuelled by the explosion in mortgage lending. Elsewhere, research has shown that UK property prices ‘took off’ after 2001 in a manner consistent with a financial bubble and that there was close correlation between the paths of property prices, earned incomes and the prices of other financial assets like equities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011410332">Clark <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). In other words, the housing bubble was multidimensional; Bone and O’Reilly suggest that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What has been exceptional about this particular period of housing market instability … is that its causes and consequences can be understood as being one feature of a wider climate of instability and excess that has its roots in the (re)marketization of economy and society, and the deregulation of financial markets, that emerged in the late 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011410332">Bone and O’Reilly, 2010</xref>, p. 232).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is thus plausible that people believe property is ‘easy to understand’ because, if considered on a neighbourhood basis, ‘bricks and mortar’ carry knowable location-specific risks. Yet this belies the complexity of mortgage products and what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098011410332">Langley (2008</xref>, p. 192) calls “the reconfiguration of mortgage networks to create closer intersections with the networks of capital markets”. While the individualisation of welfare has created ‘investor subjects’ who increasingly recognise the fungibility of housing wealth (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098011410332">Langley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011410332">Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098011410332">Strauss, 2008a</xref>), not least because of the promotion of equity release schemes and the prospect of paying for social care in old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098011410332">Terry and Gibson, 2010</xref>), this process has been highly uneven. How people understand housing wealth (and debt) in relation to other forms of saving and insurance is furthermore complicated by the cultural and social constructions of ‘home’ <italic>vis-à-vis</italic> the experience of ‘being in the market’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011410332">Munro and Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011410332">Smith, 2008</xref>) and the reconfiguration of risk, choice and responsibility in homeownership and retirement savings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098011410332">Langley, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098011410332">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042098011410332">Strauss, 2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>Our paper attempts to shed some light on this complexity of attitudes. In it, we look more closely at the preferred role of property and in particular respondents’ homes for a group of participants in a defined contribution (DC) employer-provided pension plan. Elsewhere, we have considered the preferred role of investment property distinguishing that from the family home given the characteristics of the latter in relation to the former. Here, we are particularly interested in whether respondents, in relying upon the family home, could be characterised as more or less risk averse than those who would not rely upon the family home. Our data come from a survey conducted at the peak of the bubble (May 2007) and before the onset of the global financial crisis. Because respondents came from a financial institution, and were thus presumably more knowledgeable of the costs of financial volatility, we assume that our respondents were more aware of the risks associated with housing than the average person.</p>
<p>We start from the hypothesis that relying upon property and in particular one’s home for future retirement income is consistent with risk aversion in the context of saving and investment strategies. This is not to deny that property investment and reliance on one’s home for future retirement income has been a risky strategy if we take into account the systemic risks correlated with global financial markets and the highly leveraged situations of some homeowners. If people are myopic about the scale and scope of the embedded risks, risk aversion at the ‘local’ level could clearly be misleading about the true nature of risks faced by individuals and their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098011410332">Smith, 2009</xref>). In any event, whether investing in property was, or is, more risky than relying upon an occupational or personal pension depends a great deal upon the nature of the pension: defined benefit (DB) versus defined contribution (DC).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0042098011410332">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Three Pillars of Retirement Saving</title>
<p>By exploring the link between pension saving and the home, we need to explain the significance or otherwise of this possible connection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0042098011410332">3</xref></sup> Most Western societies arrange the retirement saving of their citizens through three pillars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042098011410332">World Bank, 1994</xref>): pillar one, social security and insurance; pillar two, occupational or employer-sponsored pensions; and pillar three, individual or personal pension saving, tax preferred or not. It is widely assumed that because first pillar social security is underwritten by the nation-state it is the least risky form of saving for retirement even if promised value is typically some premium on basic needs and welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011410332">Clark, 2003</xref>). Nonetheless, there are significant national differences between the expected value of government-sponsored social insurance (compare the UK with the US and much of continental Europe; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098011410332">de Deken <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Traditionally underwritten by the employer, occupational pensions were conceived to top-up social security so as to bring retirement income close to final earned income. If less secure than social security, it was assumed that supplementary pensions were more secure than individual saving for retirement—the risk of the former being borne by the employer, whereas the risk of the latter is presumably borne by the individual.</p>
<p>In combination, the three pillars of retirement saving were expected to provide successive generations with an adequate retirement income—a higher average standard of living than was the case prior to the Second World War. By the mid 1990s, the UK government believed it had produced a winning formula for funding retirement income superior to that of continental Europe. However, the demographic ageing of Western societies combined with global economic turmoil has undercut the capacity of nation-states to deliver on promised benefits to future retirees. Most important for the UK, private-sector occupational pensions have come under sustained attack not only for the value of promised benefits but also for the assumption that employers can afford to underwrite promised benefits with automatic cost-of-living adjustments. Private-sector occupational pension coverage rates have declined dramatically over the past 15 years; furthermore, employers have forsaken defined benefit (DB) pension plans in favour of defined contribution plans (to the extent that employers replaced closed DB plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011410332">Clark, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>When enrolling in a defined contribution pension scheme, participants are often required to make decisions about the allocation of contributions to different asset classes and, within those asset classes, decisions about investment products and service providers. As is widely noted, however, the younger a plan participant, the less likely he or she will reflect upon the significance of these decisions and the virtues or otherwise of alternative courses of action. The available evidence suggests that participants are quick to decide and once decided are very slow to change their initial allocations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098011410332">Madrian and Shea, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098011410332">Iyengar <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Intuition and inertia dominate unless the plan sponsor provides information, decision tools relevant to participants’ age, income and gender, and the means by which participants can cut through the available choices to points of reference that are salient to their circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098011410332">Clark, Knox-Hayes and Strauss, 2009</xref>). In some jurisdictions, plan providers are permitted to offer so-called default settings such that if participants are unwilling or unable to make such choices they are automatically enrolled in a common investment fund.</p>
<p>Defined contribution pension plan participants are required to make decisions in the context of market risk and uncertainty. Hence, the lessons of the behavioural revolution allied with Herbert Simon and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011410332">Kahneman and Tversky (1979)</xref> apply with some force; that is, identified behavioural biases and anomalies can be shown to be especially relevant to the defined contribution domain. For example, the fact that many people are short-term oriented where in fact they are required in the defined contribution domain to act in terms of their long-term interests and the fact that many people are quite myopic where in fact they are required in the defined contribution domain to judge the significance of events in relation to the underlying process whereby pension contributions accumulate to retirement suggest that, when left to themselves, most people are quite poor at planning for an adequate retirement income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098011410332">Strauss, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098011410332">Thaler and Sunstein, 2008</xref>). Since professional portfolio managers are, on average, unable systematically to ‘beat the market’ (i.e. provide consistently better returns through active allocation than are achieved by simply tracking stock markets), this gives some indication of the challenges individuals face when acting as portfolio managers in their own right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098011410332">Sharpe, 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, the design and structure of many defined contribution schemes remain firmly wedded to the ideal of the rational actor. This can have implications for retirement planning and saving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011410332">Lusardi and Mitchell, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Retirement Saving and Housing</title>
<p>Just as government has discounted the future value of state pension entitlements, employers have effectively discounted their future commitment to occupational pensions. One implication is that third pillar retirement savings will have to compensate for the discounted values of pillars one and two, despite the fact that private pension wealth is extremely unevenly distributed in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098011410332">Pensions Commission, 2004</xref>). Another implication is that retirement saving should be seen as an exercise in portfolio management such that reliance on any one element such as the basic state pension or an occupational pension should be balanced against individuals’ other options including savings accounts, insurance, ISAs, property and housing. At a time when academic research has revealed the limits of human cognition and reasoning in the context of risk and uncertainty, effective planning for future retirement income requires a high level of conceptual understanding and judgement about balancing the risks of various savings options.</p>
<p>Focusing upon the participants of a plan sponsored by a large financial institution provides access to a group of participants whose skills and competencies are relevant to investment management. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011410332">Clark <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)</xref> showed that there were, in fact, a number of younger, relatively lower income plan participants who apparently relied heavily upon investment property for their future retirement incomes. The paper also demonstrated, however, that the majority of plan participants’ savings portfolios were biased towards low-risk financial instruments rather than property or equities. Importantly, it was shown that when higher-income plan participants invested in property, they did so in a manner that seemed to imply a quite sophisticated balance between property and other much less risky financial instruments. This suggests that certain groups—women, young people, those on low incomes—who self-report relatively high or low levels of risk tolerance are in fact those least able to hedge against losses or the risk of inadequate income in old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011410332">Clark and Strauss, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>By focusing upon property excluding the family home, previous research has sought to treat the available financial products as a set of complementary instruments that may generate a long-term retirement income. Most obviously, property investment such as buy-to-let attracts significant tax benefits, whereas the mortgage interest paid on the family home does not. By contrast, the family home is a more complicated entity combining consumption and investment as well as cultural and social meaning that goes well beyond an instrumental conception of utility maximisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011410332">Smith, 2008</xref>). Where people live, the type of house they live in and the social standing of neighbours also carry a symbolic, even emotional value partly capitalised in house prices and partly capitalised in cultural respectability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011410332">Munro and Smith, 2008</xref>). Thus, the family home may be seen as a significant instance of conspicuous consumption and an important component of identity formation over the life-course.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0042098011410332">4</xref></sup> In any event, the family home represents a form of current consumption (shelter) essential to its occupants while being, simultaneously, a means by which family members gain geographical access to the workplace, social goods such as health and education and cultural amenities.</p>
<p>Retirees have to live somewhere; the family home thus is also a long-term commitment to a certain quality and quantity of housing. To the extent that life-cycle issues dominate the consumption of housing, retirement may mean rationalising the ‘overconsumption’ of housing through equity release in exchange for a flow of income.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0042098011410332">5</xref></sup> The family home is an investment in a number of ways. For those concerned about the possible costs of old-age nursing, holding and even enhancing the equity embedded in the family home is a means of self-insurance thereby ensuring independence from children and the state as long as possible. Closely related is the prospect that the family home may be a bequest to surviving family members should its value be protected from the financial costs of the last years of life. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098011410332">Poterba (2006)</xref> noted, the bequest motive is a significant factor in explaining the resistance of retirees to annuities.</p>
<p>As the most recent financial crisis demonstrated, there is actually a close correlation between the performance of property markets, the volatility of financial markets and the performance of defined contribution pension fund investments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011410332">Clark <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098011410332">Reinhart and Rogoff (2008)</xref> argue that discontinuities in property markets often trigger market uncertainty and financial crisis. In this sense, the assumption of ‘separability’ reflects either a lack of understanding about the macro performance of related markets and/or a lack of understanding about the correlated nature of the risks associated with property investment and defined contribution pension investment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0042098011410332">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Survey Design and Risk Measures</title>
<p>Our survey targeted more than 7000 London-based employees of a large international investment bank. The questionnaire was administered on-line in May 2007 and achieved a sample size of <italic>N =</italic> 2372 responses. One response did not contain enough usable data to be counted, so the final sample size for the purposes of analysis was 2,372. The sample was compared with actual population statistics of the company workforce and found to be broadly representative (even so, the sample was not intended to be representative of the general population, but rather to provide insight into the attitudes and behaviour of people working in the financial services industry).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0042098011410332">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The survey was based upon a related national, representative survey developed with our project sponsor augmented with a series of questions that focused upon participants’ savings portfolios wherein the employer-sponsored DC plan was identified as one source of saving for the future. A total of 31 questions were asked, mixing together the collection of personal data with attitudes and prompted solutions to puzzles. A number of questions focused upon the role of property investment in savings portfolios, distinguishing between investment vehicles like buy-to-let and respondents’ homes. The full survey is available from the authors.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we sought to clarify how respondents conceptualised the risk of long-term savings strategies given evidence to the effect that employees/participants were faced by overlapping and reinforcing risks related to their current incomes and future prospects. Previous studies have shown that older, higher-income participants pursued rather sophisticated ‘safety-first’ investment strategies seemingly designed to dampen risks across their savings portfolio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011410332">Clark <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). In this paper, we sought, in the first instance, to characterise participants’ intentions in this regard according to their socioeconomic characteristics and their relative sophistication as retirement planners, focusing upon their levels of expressed confidence, knowledge and understanding of the issues. In the second instance, we also sought to test whether those that indicated that they would rely upon the home for their retirement needs had distinctive risk preferences when compared with those who did not. Specifically, question 8 asked respondents “To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statements?” where six statements were made beginning with “Planning for retirement is an important issue for me” and the fourth statement which read “The house that I live in will provide the majority of my retirement needs”. Following question 8, we asked a series of questions to characterise respondents’ retirement savings portfolios and their knowledge and understanding of retirement planning.</p>
<p>Most important for this paper, in section 4, we asked four questions designed to elicit respondents’ attitudes to risk in the context of ‘pensions and long-term savings’. Each question related to risk preference is expressed somewhat differently and is based upon a particular conceptualisation of risk. For example, question 17 asked</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When you are thinking about long-term savings and pensions, which of the following summarises your attitude: I aim to get the best possible growth in the value of my savings, even if that means taking the chance that I could lose money [or] I prefer to have safe and secure savings and investments, even if that means they do not grow in value as much as they could.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, respondents faced a seemingly simple choice between maximising the risk-adjusted rate of return and pursuing a safety-first strategy albeit with a lower rate of return over the long term. This question represented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011410332">Roy’s (1952</xref>, p. 432) argument to the effect that ‘real people’ do not have “precise knowledge of all possible outcomes of a given line of action, together with their respective probabilities” and are risk averse especially as regards the possibility that an economic disaster might wipe out their savings.</p>
<p>General risk tolerance was addressed in several ways. Questions 18 and 19 tested whether respondents were risk averse in the manner suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011410332">Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979)</xref> prospect theory (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098011410332">Baron, 2008</xref>, p. 277, on the logic of prospect theory and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042098011410332">Trepel <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>, on the different weights attributed to the components of prospect theory). A less sophisticated test of respondents’ risk propensities was set out in question 20, which focused on the level of risk people were willing to accept. Given these measures of risk, we also sought to test whether respondents were consistent in their responses and whether consistency was an indicator of respondents’ likelihood of indicating that their home would be an element in retirement planning. Consistency of response is rarer than might be imagined: people are, more often than not, seduced by the framing of questions and tend not to appreciate the commonalities between supposedly different tests of risk preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011410332">Krueger and Funder, 2004</xref>).</p>

Cross-tabulation of the data revealed low or zero cell counts for some combinations of levels of the dependent variable with levels of explanatory variables. To ensure consistent parameter estimates, some levels of these factors (age, base salary and the dependent variable) were combined to ensure adequate cell counts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0042098011410332">8</xref></sup> The data on partner’s occupational pension were also recoded to a binary variable with levels “is/is not married or cohabiting with a partner with an occupational pension” in view of the minority of positive responses from respondents in the single and separated/divorced/widowed categories. An overview of the modified dataset is presented in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042098011410332">Appendix</xref>.</p>
<p>Candidate models were fitted under a proportional odds assumption using the R and SPSS statistical packages. A stepwise selection algorithm minimising AIC was used to find candidate models, with a model including only a constant used as a starting-point in view of the sparse dataset relative to the number of predictors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0042098011410332">9</xref></sup> The resulting model is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011410332">Table 1</xref>. Both the possession of professional qualifications and the pension status of partners are not included in the selected model minimising AIC. The remaining explanatory variables are each significant at the 1 per cent significance level or above under a drop-in-deviance test. The coefficients for the levels of these factors, together with corresponding standard errors and estimated odds ratios, are also to be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011410332">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The model is formulated such that the interpretation of the coefficients β<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is as follows: <italic>e</italic><sup>β<italic>i</italic></sup> is the ratio of the odds for someone who falls into the set indicated (for example, women, those with higher education degrees) of being in a group which agrees more with the statement “The house that I live in will provide the majority of my retirement needs”, relative to the corresponding odds for the reference group, <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>. The reference group is set to include males of age 29 years or younger, without a higher education degree, of non-officer job type, single and with base salary less than £25 000. For example, considering possession of higher education, β<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> &lt; 0 indicates that a person who possesses a higher education degree (but otherwise shares the characteristics of the reference group) is less likely to have a positive attitude to this statement than a person from the reference group.</p>
<p>It can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011410332">Table 1</xref> that, with increasing age, respondents were more likely to have more positive attitudes to homeownership as a form of retirement saving, with the odds of being in a more positive group increasing by a factor 2.008 (95 per cent confidence interval (CI): 1.340, 3.008) from between the 29 years and under group and the over 50 age-group, <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>. Holding all other variables constant, the odds of being in a more positive group decrease with possession of higher education by a factor of 0.751 (95 per cent CI: 0.619, 0.912). The odds of being in a more positive group increase for respondents who were married or cohabiting relative to those who were single by a factor of 1.369 (95 per cent CI: 1.136, 1.652). The magnitude of the standard errors for the other coefficients prevents a definitive interpretation of the relationship between the remaining factors and attitudes to homeownership as a form of retirement saving, although each factor itself is significant at a 1 per cent level or greater.</p>
<p>Assessment of the adequacy of model fit is complicated by the fitting of the model to a large number of factors, some with several levels. With sparse data, assumptions regarding the approximate distribution of the deviance statistic may not hold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098011410332">Wrigley, 2002</xref>). Hence we examined the adequacy of the model in other ways</p>
<list id="list2-0042098011410332" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>—A likelihood ratio test of the drop in deviance between the saturated model including possession of professional education and partner’s pension status and the model presented earlier found no evidence to reject the simplification to the earlier model (p value = 0.88).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>—A score test of the proportional odds assumption found no evidence (p value = 0.24) to reject the null hypothesis that the assumption holds.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To examine the sensitivity of our results to potential sparse data effects, we refitted the model by: collapsing categories of the response variable (to {Agree}, {Neither agree nor disagree}, {Disagree}); and, converting age and base salary to continuous variables. In both cases, models including only the six factors listed were found to minimise AIC. Furthermore, the magnitude and direction of the coefficients for levels of gender, age, job type, marital status and possession of higher education were all found to be broadly similar under the different parameterisations.</p>
<p>With the model selected earlier, we considered four additional variables for inclusion in the model. As noted earlier, three variables were concerned with risk aversion, while the fourth was related to loss aversion (in a manner consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011410332">Kahneman and Tversky’s 1979</xref> prospect theory). Drop-in-deviance tests found extremely strong evidence in each case (p value &lt;1×10<sup>−4</sup>) to reject the null hypothesis that the smaller model (excluding the risk variable) was sufficient. The effects on AIC of the addition of each risk variable separately to the model are found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098011410332">Table 2</xref>. In the interests of parsimony, however, only the risk variable with the greatest associated drop in AIC was selected for inclusion in the model—the scaled risk preference measure.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Having tested for the contribution that respondents’ risk preferences make to the estimated model, we also considered the extent to which the various risk measures were related—the extent to which respondents could be thought consistent across the risk measures in their conceptualisation of risk aversion. Here, we can make a number of observations based upon pair-wise comparison. The simplest comparison was made between the scaled risk preference option (from a small degree of risk to a large degree of risk) and the categorical distinction made between a preference for “safe and secure savings” and aiming for the “best possible growth in the value of my savings”. It was found that scaled risk preferences were weighted towards a small degree of risk when paired with “safe and secure” and weighted towards moderate to large risk when paired with “best possible growth”. Likewise, risk preferences were weighted towards small and moderate risk when paired with the preference for “receiving £3000 with certainty” and weighted towards moderate and large risk when paired with “a 4 in 5 (80 per cent) chance of winning £4000”.</p>
<p>However, we could not identify a pattern between scaled risk preferences and loss aversion whether “losing £3000 with certainty” or “a 4 out of 5 chance of losing £4000”, nor could we discern a pattern in responses when pairing “safe and secure” with loss aversion. A chi-squared test of independence of respondent answers to the two questions found no association between responses to “safe and secure” and the loss aversion questions (p value 0.502). That is, in these instances it can be said that respondents’ scaled risk preferences were unrelated to loss aversion. Nonetheless, when “receiving £3000 with certainty” and “a 4 in 5 (80 per cent) chance of winning £4000” were paired respectively with “safe and secure” and “best possible growth”, it was also noted that there was a strong relationship between the first pair but no relationship between the second pair. We also considered whether there was a pattern in responses to the pairing of “receiving £3000 with certainty” and “a 4 in 5 chance of winning £4000” with respectively “losing £3000” and “a 4 out of 5 chance of losing £4000”. If respondents were consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011410332">Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979)</xref> prospect theory, responses would link “receiving £3000” and “a 4 out of 5 chance of losing £4000”. Of the 2240 records used, just 50 per cent were consistent with prospect theory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0042098011410332">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results for the refitted model including the scaled risk preference variable (question 20) are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098011410332">Table 3</xref>. Each of the variables in the fitted model is significant at a 5 per cent level or below. The inclusion of the risk variable results in a drop in AIC of 157 (to 5210). The odds of being in a more positive group with respect to the home as a form of retirement saving, decrease with an increasing preference for risk. Relative to a respondent prepared to accept only a very small amount of risk when making decisions about their own finances, the odds of being in a more positive group to the home decrease by a factor of 0.326 (95 per cent CI: 0.204, 0.522) for a respondent prepared to accept a large amount of risk, holding all other variables constant.</p>

<p>With the exception of the coefficients for levels of base salary, the magnitude and direction of the estimated parameters remain comparable with those in the model without the included risk variable. Again, with increasing age, respondents were more likely to view the home as providing the majority of their retirement needs, with the odds of having a more positive attitude to the statement increasing by a factor of 1.982 (95 per cent CI: 1.316, 2.985) from the youngest group (29 years and under) to the oldest group (over 50), when holding other variables constant. Possession of a higher education degree was associated with a decrease in the odds of having a more positive attitude to the statement by a factor of 0.779 (95 per cent CI: 0.638, 0.950), <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>, whilst the odds of agreement for a respondent who was married or cohabiting increased by a factor of 1.331 (95 per cent CI: 1.100, 1.612) relative to a single person.</p>
<p>Whilst the size of standard errors for other coefficients prevents a conclusive interpretation, it may be noted that increasing seniority of job type was associated with a decrease in the odds of responding positively to the statement. In contrast, females were more likely to respond positively than males. The effects of base salary on attitudes to the statement were less clear, however, and more subject to variation between fitted models.</p>

<sec id="section6-0042098011410332">
<title>Synthesis and Interpretation</title>
<p>In sum, just 250 of the 2256 useable responses agreed with the statement, leaving 1429 that either strongly disagreed or disagreed with the statement. Considering that the statement is framed with reference to the “majority of my retirement needs” as opposed to relying exclusively upon the family home, and is thus a relatively open statement with scope for ready agreement at the margin, it would seem that respondents do not share the view of, for example, those interviewed in <italic>The Sunday Times</italic>. This seems surprising given the media attention devoted to the topic in the lead-up to the 2007 financial crisis; what it in fact suggests, we believe, is considerable complexity in people’s attitude to owner-occupied housing as a fungible financial asset. It could also point socio-demographic differentiation on the basis of occupation in the face of low and declining employer-sponsored pension coverage.</p>
<p>Those who agreed/strongly agreed with the statement tended to be older, were more likely to be married or cohabitating, less likely to have a higher education degree and/or be senior executives, and more likely to have a higher income (but not the highest income). It is possible that, as higher-income individuals, the respondents were those who could afford to pursue such a strategy. Likewise, the fact that older respondents tended to agree suggests that they are from the generation that have done well out of the long-term run-up in property and home prices enabling reliance upon such a strategy.</p>
<p>It is a characteristic of the finance industry that more advanced educational credentials are increasingly required of the average employee and higher education is used to shift-out lower-qualified applicants for jobs. This process of shifting has been in train for at least the past 20 years. Finding that those with higher education tended not to agree with the statement could represent the fact that higher education is actually a proxy for being younger rather than older—notwithstanding the inclusion of age in the model, this could represent a generation of employees under pressure to save for a home albeit with a low equity share in any home they ‘own’ (in conjunction with the bank providing the mortgage). Note, however, that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011410332">Clark <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)</xref> showed that these types of respondents tended also to be (more than older, higher-paid respondents) investors in property (buy-to-let). In this respect, it is possible that the tax benefits associated with investment property enabled younger, lower-paid respondents to claim a share of the property market but remain relatively underinvested in their home; this is also where the discursive framing of buy-to-let (and thus property versus a pension) could be influential.</p>
<p>Of note is the significance of the measures of risk preference in predicting agreement with the proposition that respondents’ homes were important in underwriting retirement income. The stronger respondents’ risk aversion, the more likely they were to indicate, holding constant the socio-demographic independent variables, that they would rely upon the family home for their retirement income. Here, we can accept the hypothesis that respondents tended to believe that the family home was a relatively low-risk investment in their future income. Whether they were justified in that assessment is harder to determine without detailed knowledge of their circumstances before and after the financial crisis.</p>
<p>Since our respondents were likely to have been more knowledgeable than the average defined contribution participant, and certainly more aware of the costs of the irrational exuberance characteristic of financial bubbles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098011410332">Shiller, 2000</xref>), it is possible that older respondents saw their homes as relatively safe havens in an uncertain world. If so one implication is that they must have believed that the location-specific value associated with their homes outweighed the possible downside of being caught up in the financial bubble. A less generous interpretation is that they failed to appreciate the ways in which house prices were implicated in the paths of global equity markets and earned income. Finally, it is possible that their expressed <italic>attitude</italic> to their home does not correspond to future <italic>behaviour</italic>, in the sense that agreeing with the statement is different from actively extracting value from one’s housing assets (through equity release or downsizing) to pay for retirement. This is a point to which we will return in the conclusion.</p>
<p>The most useful measure of risk preference in terms of its contribution to explanation was the simplest measure, dependent, as it is, on a scaled risk measure rather than on a test of reasoning. The next best measure tested respondents’ preference for certainty of reward, followed by safe and secure, and then certainty of loss. While we were not able to interview respondents to clarify their understanding of the relationship between these measures of risk preference, a preference for low risk would seem to be closely related with a preference for certainty of reward and a preference for a safe and secure return over a risk-related rate of return. Even so, the scaled measure of risk preference would appear to require less deliberation than tests of preference that require respondents to judge the value of alternative courses of action with different potential pay-offs. Unfortunately, we were not able to frame tests of risk preference with potential rewards and possible pay-offs at pay-off levels that our respondents may have found particularly salient to their specific circumstances. It is possible that £3000 and £4000 were not taken seriously by our respondents, given their current and expected incomes and the prices of their preference home. Elsewhere, it has been shown that some people are quite willing to take a financial gamble on £10 000 and £100 000, considering their age and family circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011410332">Clark, Caerlewy-Smith and Marshall, 2009</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098011410332">Tom <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, on the scale of bet in gambling).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In the aftermath of the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers, the TMT bubble burst and Western financial markets recorded two consecutive years of negative returns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098011410332">Shiller (2000)</xref> anticipated the turmoil, arguing that financial markets are subject to recurrent episodes of irrational exuberance unjustified by any rational assessment of the fundamentals. Many defined contribution pension plan participants saw their account balances shrink by 25 per cent over just a couple of years, reinforced by a gloomy assessment of the near future (through to 2005). Yet, markets recovered, underwritten by the loose money policies of the Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank of England and the leverage applied to credit instruments that promised a ‘new’ era in house ownership and investment returns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011410332">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Riding the roller-coaster, many defined contribution pension plan participants recovered their losses and saw their account balances grow dramatically year-on-year through exceptional returns. When we implemented our survey of DC plan participants, the sub-prime bubble had carried markets into uncharted territory, just as the subsequent bust carried the global economy into a crisis that threatened to turn the credit <italic>débâcle</italic> into a depression.</p>
<p>In this paper, we surveyed the entire London workforce of a large bank, involving about 7000 people and about 2400 responses. This group of respondents had the advantage (over the average plan participant) of ‘being in the market’ (reworking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011410332">Gertler’s, 2001</xref>, argument about the value of tacit knowledge). Hence, it is arguable that they were more likely to be sophisticated investors rather than naive investors, even if opportunistic rather than long-term investors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098011410332">Clark, Knox-Hayes and Strauss, 2009</xref>, explaining these distinctions and their implications for expected behaviour). Although only about 10 per cent of our respondents indicated that they intended to rely upon the family home for their retirement welfare, our findings indicate that those who expressed an intention to rely upon the family home for a ‘majority of their retirement needs’ were highly risk averse, reinforcing previous findings on gender differences in risk tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011410332">Clark and Strauss, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>When we looked for socio-demographic predictors of this preference, it was noted that older rather than younger employees, higher- rather than lower-income people, and married/with partner rather than single/separated were more disposed to indicate reliance upon the family home for the ‘majority’ of their retirement needs. In other words, it was older, high-income, married people who, among the cohort of financial services employees surveyed, were most likely to see their home as a key asset for funding their retirement. If we assume that these employees are also the most likely, by virtue of their age, income and family status, to have high levels of equity in their homes (as opposed to younger employees and recent purchasers) then this strategy <italic>does</italic> appear rational in the orthodox economic sense, notwithstanding housing market volatility and high aggregate levels of mortgage debt.</p>
<p>It is also possible that, by virtue of age, income and status, these respondents lived in London neighbourhoods that had effectively weathered past financial turmoil compared with the ups and downs of pension balances. It is thus possible that they treated the family home as a low-risk investment for their future wellbeing, while treating their pension account as a risky option on the future value of global stock markets. Respondents may have believed that their pension account was subject to greater market volatility than the value of their home given its location and that, while the upside of financial markets is highly correlated with house prices, the downside of markets is not so correlated for their <italic>particular home and its neighbourhood</italic>. This may be related to the particular dynamics of house price inflation in London, although there is considerable variation within London itself (and in relation to features like the size and type of property). Further research that seeks to understand geographical differences (within and between urban and rural communities, and in the context of the ‘North–South divide’) is needed to shed light on the nature of differences in attitudes to risk.</p>
<p>Several important issues are raised but not addressed in this study. First, it is unclear the degree to which those who claim an intention to rely on housing assets in retirement will in fact do so, and by what means (for example, downsizing, equity release). If DC pensions are unlike any other form of financial product by dint of the complexity involved in making rational investment decisions over the long time-horizon and the complexity of hedging against exogenous risk, a home is quite unlike any other financial asset by virtue of the complex cultural, social and emotional associations it embodies. Research has suggested that current UK retirees are less keen to downsize or use equity release than economic theory would predict (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098011410332">Venti and Wise, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098011410332">Banks <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, on differences between the US and the UK). Much more research, in the vein of Susan Smith and Moira Munro’s excellent work on property markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011410332">Munro and Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011410332">Smith, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098011410332">2009</xref>) is needed to understand the complex interplay of emotion, social and cultural norms, and attitudes to risk, choice and responsibility if we are to attain a better grasp of the relationship between attitudes and behaviours in relation to housing assets and retirement savings. Moreover, factors such as bequest motives, the price of care for the elderly, and rising education costs for younger generations are not touched upon in this study.</p>
<p>Secondly, the study suggests interesting differences in attitudes to risk and housing, but looks only at a select group of ‘in the know’ employees. More research is needed to flesh out differences in risk propensity among groups differentiated by gender, ethnicity, income and urban and regional geography. Elsewhere, differences in attitudes to the purchase of annuities have been demonstrated to have a regional component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011410332">Clark and Knox-Hayes, 2007</xref>). Differences in attitudes to housing assets could have implications both for the composition of local and regional housing markets and for national-level policy aimed at encouraging older people to use housing equity to fund the costs of retirement. DB pensions and house price inflation have perhaps produced a ‘privileged’ cohort of retirees, notwithstanding big disparities in income and wealth. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011410332">Hills (2010)</xref> has noted, UK disparities in wealth and earned income are growing, with significant implications for the retirement welfare of the baby boom generation and, especially, the generations to come. More work is needed to understand these implications for individuals, households, communities and the built environment.</p>

<p>This paper is interested primarily in occupational and, to an extent, personal pensions. Those interviewed in the ‘Money’ section often confuse occupational pensions with personal pensions and, like many people, are probably also confused as to their differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011410332">Clark and Strauss, 2008</xref>). The project did not seek to analyse individuals’ attitudes <italic>vis-à-vis</italic> expected income from the British state pension (BSP), although many current retirees rely on the public pension for a significant proportion of their income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098011410332">Pensions Commission, 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>Defined benefit pensions are those that provide a guaranteed pension, usually based on formula relating to final salary (or some form of career or best-years’ average) and contribution years, and in which employers carry the risk. Defined contribution pensions, to which employers need not contribute, provide a pension based on the level of contributions and their investment performance; the risks are borne by the employee.</p>
