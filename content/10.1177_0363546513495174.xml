</disp-quote>
<p>My first memory of the telephone dates back to the early 1950s. Our family had just moved from my grandmother’s Queens apartment to a two-story house in my dad’s hometown of Dobbs Ferry, New York. The telephone sat on the staircase landing, where it could be conveniently reached from both floors of the home. This was a common arrangement in those days. Phones were expensive to rent, and I don’t remember any house on my block that had more than one. Does the word “rent” surprise you? At that time, all telephones in the United States were the property of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company; you leased the apparatus on a monthly basis and had to return it if you moved to a new location.</p>
<p>The guts of the phone were housed in a square case of some primitive matte plastic. There were no moving parts; the only adornment on its slanted face was a round label bearing the legend <bold>DO</bold>bbs Ferry <bold>3-0073</bold>. Of course, the phone was black. Like the Model T Ford, you could get any color telephone you desired from AT&amp;T, as long as it was black. When you needed to call someone, you simply lifted the receiver to your ear. The pleasant voice of the operator, a woman located somewhere in downtown Dobbs Ferry or maybe Hastings, came on the line and asked for the number you were calling.</p>
<p>This arrangement came in handy when I had to make my very first phone call. My parents had gone to show off my newborn brother Jeffrey to my grandparents down on Main Street, leaving my older brother Ronald in charge. Those of you who grew up in all-boy families know that this is an invitation to fraternal combat. I was only 3 or 4 years old, but I knew exactly how to defend myself. I grabbed the telephone receiver off the hook and shouted into the mouthpiece, “I want my mommy!” Given the small size of our village, it’s probably not too surprising that the operator was able to use that limited information to locate the requested parent. The end of the story is rather predictable: my parents returned home within minutes, and Ronald and I both went to bed with backsides that were considerably pinker than they had been that morning.</p>
<p>I could continue to recount my life’s story through the lens of evolving telecommunications technology. Our move to New Jersey and our first dial phone. Friends who shared phone service on a “party line.” Dickie Thiras, the switchboard operator and receptionist who presided over our high school lobby, dispensing motherly advice and manual telephone connections with equal aplomb. The shiny red telephone that abetted the vibrant social life of our college dorm room. The end of AT&amp;T’s monopoly on phone ownership, followed by cheap extension phones for every room in the house. My first cell phone, so tiny you could carry it in a backpack. My new iPhone, a gadget with so many capabilities that its telephonic function seems almost incidental. Perhaps we’ve come full circle: A 21st-century toddler might be able to appeal to Siri for help locating a much-needed parent with the same success that I obtained from that anonymous operator in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Modern smartphones, and their big brothers the tablet computers, seem to have an unlimited ability to do whatever emerges from the imaginations of 21st-century software designers. They continue to transform almost every aspect of modern life at a dizzying evolutionary pace, and medical journals have not escaped their reach. In 2010, the <italic>American Journal of Sports Medicine</italic> and <italic>Sports Health</italic> launched their mobile editions, customized variations of the journal websites designed to function more easily in a smaller, touch-screen format. As useful as these mobile sites are, they do not fully utilize the myriad capabilities of modern mobile devices. Last month, our journals introduced new applications—“apps” in the current vernacular—designed to provide a versatile, enhanced experience for individual <italic>AJSM</italic> and <italic>Sports Health</italic> subscribers. The <italic>OJSM</italic> app is scheduled to follow shortly.</p>
<p>Apps are simply focused computer software programs designed to accomplish specific tasks on smartphones and tablet devices. Apps put the <italic>smart</italic> into smartphone, and there are literally hundreds of thousands of them. When you want your smartphone to learn a new skill, you merely download an app with that capability. Apps are designed to function in specific cybernetic operating systems. Since <italic>AJSM</italic> readers predominantly access the journal on Apple devices, its app will initially only be available from the Apple App Store. Any current subscriber can download the <italic>AJSM</italic> app at no charge.</p>
<p><italic>AJSM</italic>’s dedicated app combines the familiar experience of a cozy print journal with the flexible functionality of an electronic website. Upon arrival at the app’s home page, the reader can choose from several visual displays, including an array of thumbnail images of the covers of recent issues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513495174">Figure 1A</xref>). Once an issue is selected, it can be downloaded to the device for offline use—think long airplane flights, sojourns in hotels with exorbitant Internet charges, or fishing trips in the Canadian wilderness. This alone represents a convenience, since multiple issues can be taken along with no increased bulk.</p>

</fig>
<p>The cover of each virtual issue closely resembles the cover of its print counterpart. If the reader wishes, the app version can be read just like the print version, leafing through page by page. However, so much more is possible with the app, starting with its cover. Every article title on the cover is an active hyperlink that can take the reader directly to the corresponding paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513495174">Figure 1B</xref>). The same is true for all titles in the table of contents. Supplementary electronic features, such as data appendices, surgical videos, and Brett Owens’ marvelous podcasts, can be accessed from the table of contents, the audio drop-down menu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513495174">Figure 1C</xref>), or the article itself, with just a touch. Have a question for the authors? Another touch on the email address of the corresponding author launches a missive from your email application. See an advertisement that piques your interest? You can access linked videos, email the manufacturer, or even visit their website with similar ease, yet still keep your place in the journal.</p>
<p>Additional features abound. Articles may be perused in layout mode, which is identical to the print PDF; plain text format that, fittingly, just contains the plain text of the article; or a split-screen mode that features both and allows users to browse each independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513495174">Figure 2A</xref>). Plain text, which is accessed by touching the article’s title in the PDF, is a boon to presbyopes, who can enlarge the font to the desired size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513495174">Figure 2B</xref>). If a reader wishes to bookmark an article for future reference, tapping in the upper right-hand corner adds it to the list of favorites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513495174">Figure 2C</xref>). The reader can alert colleagues to interesting articles via email (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513495174">Figure 3</xref>) or create notes for favorites that are retained as long as the issue remains on the device.</p>

<p>Since 2005, <italic>AJSM</italic> articles have been “published prior to print” in the PreView section of the electronic journal. This allows rapid publication of each article as soon as production is complete. App users can read these new articles online within 24 hours of electronic publication by selecting the Rich Site Summary (RSS) feed from the basic app menu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546513495174">Figure 4</xref>). Once these articles appear in print issues, they will move into the corresponding downloadable issues within the app. Other features accessible via RSS feed include the catalogues of most read and most cited full-text articles.</p>

<p>The new <italic>AJSM</italic> app is designed to give subscribers the portable multimedia experience made possible by modern technology. Our editorial and production staffs have worked hard to make the learning process richer and even fun. As technology evolves, we anticipate that additional features and capabilities will appear. Fifty years hence, the Editor-in-Chief of <italic>AJSM</italic> may write a nostalgic editorial recalling the primitive yet quaint mobile technology used to access the latest in orthopaedic sports medicine research in the halcyon days of 2013.</p>
