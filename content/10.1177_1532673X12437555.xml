<abstract>
<p>A primary goal of congressional elections is to create a link between constituent opinion and representative behavior. Explanations of congressional campaign agendas, however, have focused on national measures of issue salience and ownership, ignoring opinion within districts. Moreover, no study has systematically assessed the relative influence of issue salience and ownership. This article seeks to address these gaps using several public opinion surveys and a content analysis of 2010 House campaign websites. The analysis demonstrates significant across-district variation in citizens’ priorities and preferences, yet finds no discernible relationship between district opinion and campaign issue agendas. In contrast, the analysis suggests that campaign issue emphasis is positively associated with the issue’s national salience and party ownership, but salience appears to be the stronger predictor. Together, the results suggest that the 2010 candidates used their campaign issue agendas to forge a national strategy, rather than emphasize identification with their constituents.</p>

<p>For most of the 20th century, congressional campaigns were typically local affairs, where candidates focused on personal qualifications and local issues. Perennially the minority in Congress, Republicans, in 1994 decided to alter their strategy, drafting the “Contract with America.” This party-centered strategy emphasized a set of national issues that all members would work to address and ushered in the first Republican House majority since the Eisenhower administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1532673X12437555">Jacobson, 1996</xref>). The 1994 elections may have marked a transition toward nationalized, party-centered campaigns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532673X12437555">1</xref></sup> This conjecture is only tentative, however, because few studies have sought to systematically explore the relative influence of national and local opinion on candidate’s campaign rhetoric.</p>
<p>A shift toward party-centered national campaign strategies would have important normative implications for scholars’ conceptions of representation. In Federalist No. 10, James Madison argued that the regional nature of congressional elections would connect legislators to the interests of their constituents. Thus, the diverse interests of the nation would be mirrored in government. Indeed, scholars of the candidate-centered era found a clear link between representatives and their constituents. Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1532673X12437555">David Mayhew (1974)</xref> argues that members of Congress work constantly to satisfy the needs of their constituents and that Congress is organized to maximize their ability to meet this demand. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X12437555">Richard Fenno’s (1978)</xref> classic study of representatives in their districts shows that representatives make a concerted effort to identify with their constituents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X12437555">Fenno (1978</xref>, p. 58) argues, “Every congressman also conveys a sense of <italic>identification</italic> with his constituents. Contextually and verbally, he gives them the impression, ‘I am one of you’; ‘I am like you’; ‘I think the way you do and I care about the same things you do.’” The recent shift away from local issues toward national problems may signal a weakening of this electoral connection and, potentially, a central mechanism of representation.</p>
<p>Proponents of Responsible Party Government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1532673X12437555">Ranney, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1532673X12437555">Sundquist, 1988</xref>), on the other hand, may praise the shift toward party-centered campaigns, provided the increased cohesion of party rhetoric is reflected in policy outcomes. A cohesive party agenda would increase the informational value of the party label, helping voters make informed choices about government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532673X12437555">Arceneaux, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1532673X12437555">Huckfeldt, Mondak, Craw, &amp; Mendez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1532673X12437555">Rahn, 1993</xref>). Moreover, recent studies suggest that, contrary to common perceptions, candidates seek to fulfill their campaign promises once in office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1532673X12437555">Ringquist &amp; Dasse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1532673X12437555">Sulkin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1532673X12437555">Sulkin &amp; Swigger, 2008</xref>). Therefore, increased partisan cohesion in campaigns may translate into greater unity in office, helping the majority party enact its agenda as advertised. The net benefit, then, may be greater accountability in government as voters can make informed decisions and hold party members responsible for the policy they enact. The importance of these implications highlights the need for systematic evaluation of the local and national sources of congressional campaign policy agendas.</p>
<p>The two dominant explanations of congressional campaign policy agendas are issue salience—candidates focus on the issues that are most important to the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X12437555">Ansolabehere &amp; Iyengar, 1994</xref>)—and issue ownership—candidates emphasize the issues that their party has a better reputation for handling than does the opposing party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1532673X12437555">Miller &amp; Krosnik, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1532673X12437555">Petrocik, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1532673X12437555">Petrocik, Benoit, &amp; Hansen, 2003</xref>). Using national-level measures of salience and ownership, recent studies of campaign agendas suggest that issue salience is a better predictor than ownership, but neither theory consistently predicts candidate strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1532673X12437555">Sides, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1532673X12437555">2007</xref>). No models, however, have systematically assessed the relative impact of each explanatory factor nationally or within districts.</p>
<p>Filling these gaps is crucial for our understanding of the electoral connection between candidates and their constituencies. The framers of the Constitution intended elections to provide the link between constituent opinion and representative behavior. If candidates are eschewing this link in their campaigns, they may feel little incentive to pursue these connections in office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1532673X12437555">Ringquist &amp; Dasse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1532673X12437555">Sulkin, 2009</xref>). Moreover, campaign rhetoric can improve voters’ knowledge of candidates’ positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532673X12437555">Franklin, 1991</xref>), prime voters attitudes on campaign themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532673X12437555">Druckman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1532673X12437555">Iyengar, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532673X12437555">Iyengar &amp; Kinder, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1532673X12437555">Kahn &amp; Kenney, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1532673X12437555">Krosnick &amp; Brannon, 1993</xref>), and mobilize or demobilize voters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X12437555">Ansolabehere &amp; Iyengar, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X12437555">Ansolabehere, Iyengar, &amp; Simon, 1999</xref>). Thus, campaigns have the power to shape whether people participate in an election and, if so, how they evaluate the candidates. It is, therefore, critical for our understanding of elections and representation to explore how candidates decide on which dimensions to focus their campaign and which issues to highlight. If candidates are ignoring the preferences and priorities of the district as they shape their campaign issue agendas, they are forgoing a central component of the representative–constituent relationship.</p>
<p>This article contributes to the campaign agendas literature in three ways. First, it explores the preferences and priorities of voters in a sample of 155 congressional districts during the 2010 midterm elections. In so doing, the analysis demonstrates that national measures of issue salience and ownership mask considerable variation across districts in voters’ preferences and priorities. Second, it estimates the relationship between district opinion and congressional campaign agendas, showing that, despite this variation, district opinion has little effect on the content of congressional campaign agendas. The analysis demonstrates that, instead, candidates in the 2010 elections focused on national opinion when shaping their campaign agendas. In that regard, the article’s third contribution is to systematically compare the explanatory power of national salience and ownership. The findings support the emerging wisdom that national salience is the stronger predictor but find greater support for the role of issue ownership than several recent studies.</p>
<sec id="section1-1532673X12437555">
<title>Determinants of Issue Agendas</title>
<p>Campaign scholars focus primarily on two determinants of issues agendas: issue salience and issue ownership. The issue salience theory argues that candidates seek to capture voter attention by focusing their campaigns on current issues that receive a lot of media attention and are important to the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X12437555">Ansolabehere &amp; Iyengar, 1994</xref>). Because voters’ evaluations of candidates are centered around the issues they feel are most important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1532673X12437555">Krosnick, 1990</xref>), failure to address highly prioritized issues can cause candidates to appear out of touch with constituency concerns and ultimately lead to diminished support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1532673X12437555">Rapoport &amp; Stone, 2009</xref>). Therefore, candidates must often address issues the opposing party owns.</p>
<p>Issue ownership stems from the idea that political parties develop reputations for their handling of various issues. A party “owns” an issue if the public collectively believes that the party is better then any competing parties at handling the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1532673X12437555">Miller &amp; Krosnik, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1532673X12437555">Petrocik, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1532673X12437555">Petrocik et al., 2003</xref>). The theory states that candidates should therefore campaign on issues associated with their party to increase the impact of those attitudes in the minds of voters. In U.S. politics, Democrats typically have an ownership advantage over the Republicans on education, the environment, health care, and social programs while Republicans own crime and foreign policy issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1532673X12437555">Petrocik, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1532673X12437555">Sides, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>National salience appears to be a better predictor of congressional campaign agendas than is issue ownership. National measures of issue ownership are excellent predictors of campaign strategies in national elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1532673X12437555">Petrocik, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1532673X12437555">Petrocik et al., 2003</xref>), but poor predictors in subnational elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532673X12437555">Druckman, Hennessy, Kifer, &amp; Parkin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1532673X12437555">Sides, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1532673X12437555">2007</xref>). In contrast, Druckman et al. show that issue salience is a strong determinant of issue engagement between competing candidates in a congressional race. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1532673X12437555">Sides (2007)</xref> shows a moderate to strong positive correlation, albeit inconsistent across years, between an issue’s salience and candidates’ attention to the issue in their advertising. He finds no such correlation between party ownership of an issue and advertising time. As a result, recent studies argue that the lack of support for issue ownership suggests that national issue salience is the more powerful predictor of congressional campaign agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532673X12437555">Druckman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1532673X12437555">Sides, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1532673X12437555">2007</xref>). This claim is still tentative, however, because these studies have not included measures of both salience and ownership in a single model. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1532673X12437555">Sides (2006)</xref>, for example, explores cross-sectional variation of campaign attention to single issues. As a result, these models hold constant national measures of salience and ownership and, therefore, cannot directly compare the relative impact of each.</p>
<p>Considerably less attention has been paid to measures of district opinion as explanations of congressional campaign issue agendas. The only district-level opinion measure that has received adequate attention is district partisanship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1532673X12437555">Sides (2006</xref>, p. 424) shows that the district’s partisanship, as measured by presidential vote share, has only sporadic and often unpredictable influence on congressional campaign issue agendas. Other district-level explanations of campaign agendas such as district demographics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532673X12437555">Druckman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1532673X12437555">Sides, 2006</xref>), geographic locality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1532673X12437555">Sulkin &amp; Evans, 2006</xref>), and opponent agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1532673X12437555">Kahn &amp; Kenney, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1532673X12437555">Sulkin &amp; Evans, 2006</xref>) are similarly poor predictors. Two exceptions are electoral competitiveness and incumbency. Competition forces candidates to increase their campaign efforts in hopes of mobilizing supporters and winning over undecided voters. This process may often involve broadening the campaign discussion in order to draw in voters that would otherwise stay home. Kahn and Kenney find support for this hypothesis, demonstrating that the rate of issue discussion in televised campaign advertisements is 20% higher in dead-heat races than in electoral landslides. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1532673X12437555">Sides (2006</xref>, p. 425) notes, however, that competition increases the breadth of policy discussion, but not the depth; candidates discuss more distinct issues without devoting more agenda space to the issues. Druckman et al. argue that candidates at a disadvantage are risk-acceptant because they need to gamble for any chance at victory. They show that the incumbency advantage forces challengers to engage in risky campaign strategies such as negative campaigning, unambiguous position taking, and seeking endorsements from potentially polarizing figures.</p>
<p>The general lack of district influence on congressional campaign strategies contrasts with the image portrayed by the representatives in Fenno’s study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X12437555">Fenno (1978</xref>, p. 58) argues that representatives invest great effort to create a connection with their constituents and one component of that connection is demonstrating a shared identity. One Democratic representative from the study, for example, was an African American representing a majority black district. He actively emphasized positions contrary to the Democratic national leadership because he felt the national party was ignoring the needs of his constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X12437555">Fenno, 1978</xref>, p. 117). Many representatives in the study took positions consistent with district preferences even when those preferences were in conflict with their own beliefs:
<disp-quote>
<p>On gun control, I believe we should have it. But my district—a rural district—is overwhelmingly against gun control, 80 percent to 20 percent. So I decided a long time ago not to hassle the issue. I am against all gun control. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X12437555">Fenno, 1978</xref>, p. 143)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Of course, some representatives in Fenno’s study avoided issue discussion and few believed that the content of their issue rhetoric was the primary determinant of their success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X12437555">Fenno, 1978</xref>, p. 132). Nonetheless, district opinion clearly shaped the outlook of many representatives as well as their rhetoric and voting behavior. Therefore, it is worth exploring the influence of district opinion in more detail, despite the lack of support for the influence of district characteristics on congressional issue agendas.</p>
<p>Of course, the dearth of scholarly attention to district opinion will be inconsequential for our understanding of campaign agendas if district opinion simply reflects national opinion. The literature on issue publics, however, suggests that there is, in fact, great variation in the preferences and priorities of the electorate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532673X12437555">Erikson, Wright, &amp; McIver, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1532673X12437555">Krosnick, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1532673X12437555">RePass, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1532673X12437555">Stone &amp; Simas, 2010</xref>). Candidates are aware that voters pay little attention to their voting record as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X12437555">Fenno, 1978</xref>, p. 141). Instead, voters focus on only the one or a few issues that they deem most important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1532673X12437555">Holbrook, Berent, Krosnick, Visser, &amp; Boninger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1532673X12437555">Iyengar, Hahn, Krosnick, &amp; Walker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1532673X12437555">Krosnick, 1990</xref>). Yet the content of those few issues varies widely between different voters. RePass shows that there was great diversity in the issue priorities of the electorate during the 1960s and Krosnick demonstrates that this variation held through the 1980s. If this diversity is shaped in part by demographics and locality, we should thus expect great variation across districts in terms of their chief policy concerns. Thus, candidates should have incentive to focus on the issues that are particularly important to their constituents. National measures of issue salience will be unable to capture this district-level importance if the great diversity in issue importance noted by RePass and Krosnick still exists today. Alternatively, the increasing nationalization of congressional elections may be mirrored by growing homogeneity of voters’ priorities across districts. If so, national measures of salience will act as proxies for district-level salience. Therefore, it will be beneficial to assess the degree of variation of policy priorities across districts in 2010.</p>
<p>The concept of issue ownership is inherently national, but the principles of issue ownership derive from the more general theory of heresthetics, which may provide insight into the role of district preferences for congressional campaigns. Heresthetics is the strategy by which candidates structure the campaign agenda to emphasize criteria on which they have an advantage over their opponent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1532673X12437555">Riker, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1532673X12437555">Riker &amp; Enelow, 1990</xref>). By Riker’s conception, candidates should focus their campaigns on issues on which they hold an advantage and avoid issues on which they hold no advantage. Because House candidates are elected within districts, such candidates may determine their relative advantage on various issues at that level. Due to the considerable variation in voter policy preferences across states and districts in the United States (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532673X12437555">Erikson et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1532673X12437555">Stone &amp; Simas, 2010</xref>), national assessments of issue ownership may not reflect candidates’ advantage over their opponents within their district. It will therefore be useful to test the merit of heresthetics as an explanation of congressional campaigns using district-level measures of issue advantage.</p>
<p>The present study serves to assess the relative impact of these various explanations of campaign policy rhetoric in congressional elections. The effect of national issue ownership and salience may be swamped by voter attitudes within the district. Alternatively, the lack of support for an effect of district demographics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532673X12437555">Druckman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1532673X12437555">Sides, 2006</xref>) may suggest that, contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X12437555">Fenno (1978)</xref>, candidate strategies forsake the concerns of the district in favor of national or party interests.</p>

<p>An increasing number of agenda studies have employed campaign websites as the medium of analysis because they provide an unmediated and comprehensive portrait of candidates’ campaigns (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X12437555">Dolan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532673X12437555">Druckman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X12437555">Druckman, Kifer, &amp; Parkin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1532673X12437555">Latimer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1532673X12437555">Norris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1532673X12437555">Stromer Galley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1532673X12437555">Ward &amp; Gibson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1532673X12437555">Warnick, Xenos, Endres, &amp; Gastil, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1532673X12437555">Xenos &amp; Foot, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X12437555">Druckman et al.

<disp-quote>
<p>campaign website potentially captures the aggregation of campaign communications that reflect a campaign’s overall rhetorical strategy. This differs from speeches or television advertisements that require candidates to choose brief snippets of their overall message; candidates cannot possibly incorporate the full range of their rhetorical strategies (e.g., references to endorsements, polls, various issues, personal features).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This point underscores two unique facets of campaign websites. They are unmediated by third parties and impose no time or space limitations.</p>
<p>Many past studies have focused on newspapers or televised news reports to gauge candidate campaign strategies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532673X12437555">Ansolabehere, Iyengar, Simon, &amp; Valentino, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532673X12437555">Arnold, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532673X12437555">Druckman, 2004</xref>), but these mediums may obscure critical elements of House candidates’ campaigns. Reliance on news sources can be problematic because newswriters and editors have their own agendas, which may also depend on the attitudes and opinion of their audience. If so, news media may report candidate position-taking on issues that are particularly salient locally, even if candidates tailor their agendas nationally. Moreover, news coverage varies widely across regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532673X12437555">Arnold, 2004</xref>) and, therefore, will obscure the agendas of candidates living in districts with less media coverage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1532673X12437555">Petrocik et al. (2003)</xref> demonstrate that the <italic>New York Times</italic>’ portrayal of campaign themes in presidential campaigns had little correlation with the candidates’ issue agendas in advertisements or speeches. Importantly for this analysis, Petrocik et al. show that media coverage emphasizes candidates’ discussion of “owned” issues. Therefore, using the media to measure issue agendas may bias upward the measured influence of issue ownership strategies relative to salience strategies.</p>
<p>Campaign advertisements present another potential target for study, but, again, such a medium carriers serious drawbacks for measuring congressional campaign agendas. In particular, virtually all candidates produce websites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X12437555">Druckman et al., 2009</xref>, p. 345), but many candidates do not produce televised ads. Congressional districts typically comprise a small fraction of the media market in which they are located, reducing the efficiency of televised ads and barring many candidates from this form of communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1532673X12437555">Gronke, 2001</xref>). By one estimate, utilizing a content analysis of television advertisements or newspaper articles instead of websites would cut the sample by almost half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X12437555">Druckman et al., 2009</xref>, p. 347). Moreover, it would bias the sample in favor of the highest spending and most competitive candidates, who may pursue systematically different agenda strategies than other candidates.</p>
<p>Political speeches and debate transcripts are useful sources for the analysis of presidential campaign rhetoric, but they are difficult to come by in congressional elections. Candidates rarely provide transcripts of their speeches and, to my knowledge, no databases exist that systematically archive these speeches. In addition, speeches encourage candidates to tailor their message to a narrow audience and, as a result, will not necessarily reflect the complete scope of their campaign. Candidates face few costs by articulating different priorities to different audiences, and thus, speeches may not reflect candidates’ overarching campaign strategy. The issue content of debates, in contrast, is often out of candidates’ control as citizens, media, and moderators all occasionally have influence over the agenda. Thus, neither venue can offer a comprehensive and unmediated portrait of candidates’ campaign agendas.</p>
<p>Despite the many differences between various campaign mediums, the issue agendas candidates provide on their websites are largely representative of their broader campaign communications. Sulkin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1532673X12437555">Sulkin, Moriarty, &amp; Hefner, 2007</xref>) compare the content of campaign websites and televised ads and find the frequency that candidates address individual issues is quite proportional between the two venues. They therefore conclude that inferences about which issues are most and least popular will be similar across venues. The most glaring difference between the two mediums in their study is the size of the issue agenda, with websites averaging nine issues and campaign ads averaging five issues across all ads. More important, for the topic of this article, they find that there are not significant differences across venues in partisan differentiation on the issue (i.e., the relative attention each party gives to individual issues). The authors note, however, that candidates are more likely to address issues owned by the opponent in televised ads. In addition to content similarities, viewership between various campaign venues is becoming increasingly similar. A large and growing proportion of voters visit campaign websites and that segment is diverse and roughly representative of the U.S. population in several important ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X12437555">Dolan, 2005</xref>, p. 33).</p>
<p>Campaign websites are hence a useful medium with which to study candidates’ issue agendas; Websites give candidates complete control over the messages they provide, provide an opportunity to measure the rhetorical style of the widest variety of candidates, and provide a representative portrait of candidates’ campaign rhetoric.</p>

<title>Data and Measures</title>
<p>This analysis seeks to explore the distribution of salience and ownership nationally and across congressional districts and compare the effects of each on the issue agendas of congressional campaigns. Therefore, the analysis requires measures of district salience and preferences, and national salience and ownership. To that end, I use the University of California, Davis/William and Mary (UCDWM) module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1532673X12437555">Rapoport &amp; Stone, 2011</xref>) from the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Elections Study (CCES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532673X12437555">Ansolabehere, 2011</xref>) to measure district salience and preferences on six policy issues in a sample of 155 districts. The issues included in the survey are the Afghanistan war, environmental regulation, health care reform, immigration, same-sex marriage, and taxes. These issues were selected because they provide across-issue variation in terms of salience and ownership, which I demonstrate as follows. I use an average of national polls to measure national salience and ownership on each of those six issues and, to measure congressional campaign issue agendas, a content analysis of campaign websites drawn from those same 155 districts.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, it is useful to review some of the events during the 2010 campaigns surrounding the six issues under analysis. <italic>Afghanistan</italic>: Obama’s 2009 pledge to deploy an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan shifted many voters’ attention from Iraq to Afghanistan. <italic>Environment</italic>: Two environmental issues were potentially on voters’ minds during the campaigns. First, in June 2009 the House passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act, though the bill never made it out of the Senate. The bill proposed capping total national greenhouse emissions while allowing companies to buy and sell the right to emit these gasses. Second, in April 2010, an explosion at BP’s Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico caused an oil spill that leaked for 3 months. The explosion resulted in the largest accidental marine oil spill in history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1532673X12437555">Robertson &amp; Krauss, 2010</xref>). <italic>Health care</italic>: Although often a major campaign theme, health care was particularly salient in 2010 due to the March passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. So salient, in fact, that before the bill was passed, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell explained that Republicans intended to turn the 2010 elections into a “Referendum on health care” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532673X12437555">Fox News, 2010</xref>). <italic>Immigration</italic>: Much of the discussion of immigration policy in 2010 focused on Arizona SB 1070, which requires aliens living in the United States to register with the U.S. government and carry proof of their registration at all times. In addition, the bill requires law enforcement officers to verify the registration status of anyone pulled over or detained if there is reason to suspect they are undocumented. The law gained national attention due to its notably restrictive approach to immigration policy. The bill generated mass protests in Arizona and across the nation, with opponents arguing that the bill would encourage racial profiling and foster anti-Latino sentiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1532673X12437555">Preston, 2010</xref>). <italic>Same-sex marriage</italic>: The major events associated with same-sex marriage were the various changes in state policy affecting the institution, many of which expanded same-sex marriage rights. For example, New Hampshire legalized same-sex marriage at the start of the year and California’s Prop. 8—a 2008 amendment to the state constitution banning same-sex marriage—was overturned in U.S. District Court. <italic>Taxes</italic>: Tax policy was an interesting issue because it was a major focus of the Tea Party rallies that were spreading across the country. The rallies appear effective in getting their message across; although 94% of citizens received a tax cut in 2010, only 8% of citizens recognized this fact and 33% believed that taxes had actually increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1532673X12437555">Jacobson, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>Although these six issues account for a significant portion of election themes, they exclude one of the biggest issues of 2010: the economy. Although the GDP had grown throughout 2010 and unemployment dropped marginally over that span, the economy had not recovered from the recession of 2008 and 2009. As a result, the economy was the most frequently cited issue in polls measuring the “most important problem” facing the United States throughout the year. The issue of the economy provides several challenges to the present study. First, because the economy was so salient in voters’ minds, including this issue in the survey instrument (discussed as follows), could potentially suppress meaningful variation in survey respondents’ prioritization of other issues. This problem would inhibit a chief goal of the study: to model candidates’ campaign agendas as a function of variation in issue priorities across districts and across issues. The issue of the economy presents a second challenge for this study because partisan ownership of the economy varies from year to year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1532673X12437555">Sides, 2006</xref>). For this reason, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1532673X12437555">Petrocik (1996)</xref> refers to such issues as “leased,” explaining that indicators of a poor economy quickly shift the advantage on these issues toward the out party. Obama’s election and the Democratic majorities in Congress were due in part to the poor performance of the economy under the Bush administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1532673X12437555">Jacobson, 2009</xref>). Yet the poor economy that the Democrats inherited remained through 2010, clouding citizens’ attributions of responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1532673X12437555">Jacobson, 2011a</xref>). Thus, the particular context of the 2010 elections and the ephemeral nature of party reputation on the issue combine to thwart analysis of the economy in the present study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532673X12437555">2</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section4-1532673X12437555">
<title>Measuring District Opinion Using the CCES</title>
<p>Previous research may have ignored district opinion for a practical reason: It is difficult to obtain sample sizes within districts large enough to reliably estimate district opinion. This study overcomes this challenge by employing a recent survey designed precisely for this purpose. To measure the priorities and preferences within districts, I employ the UCDWM module of the 2010 CCES. The module asks 2,000 CCES respondents located across 155 districts to identify the level of priority that they attach to each of the six issues and to identify their own position on each issue. Thus, there are an average of 13 respondents per district (median of 12.5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532673X12437555">3</xref></sup> The sample follows a set of districts that were originally chosen for a study of the 2006 midterm elections. The sample consists of 100 districts randomly selected from the 48 contiguous states, as well as 55 districts chosen because their 2006 House races were expected to be competitive. In the 2010 race, 149 of these districts featured a candidate from each major party.</p>
<p>To measure the salience of these six issues in each district, the preelection survey instructed respondents, “Regardless of your position on these issues, please indicate the priority of each of the following issue areas to you personally.” The choices were 0 = <italic>very low priority</italic>, 1 = low priority, 2 = high priority, and 3 = <italic>very high priority</italic>. I use an issue’s average priority within the district as my measure of district salience.</p>
<p>To measure candidates’ congruence with district preferences on these issues, I calculate the distance between each candidate’s position and that of the average preference within his or her district. For each issue, the preelection survey asked respondents to place themselves on a 7-point Liberal-Conservative Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532673X12437555">4</xref></sup> Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532673X12437555">Achen (1978)</xref>, I treat the mean constituent position as the district preference.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532673X12437555">5</xref></sup> In addition to the survey of constituents, the UC Davis team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1532673X12437555">Stone, 2011</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1532673X12437555">6</xref></sup> also conducted a survey of expert political observers within these districts,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1532673X12437555">7</xref></sup> asking them to place the candidates’ positions on each of the six issues. The sample featured at least 23 experts in each district with an average of 31.5 experts per district. I estimate each candidate’s position as the mean expert placement of the candidate, after correcting for the partisan bias of each expert.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1532673X12437555">8</xref></sup> The question wording of these items were identical between the constituent and expert surveys and I therefore assume that they are on the same metric. Hence, I can measure each candidate’s relative advantage or disadvantage on each issue by calculating the Republican candidate’s absolute distance from the district preference and then subtracting the Democratic candidate’s absolute distance from the district. The resulting measure is increasingly positive when the Democratic candidate is closer to the district issue preference than the Republican candidate and increasingly negative when the Republican candidate is closer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1532673X12437555">
<title>Measuring National Opinion Using iPoll</title>
<p>The “most important problem” survey question is the most commonly employed measure of public issue salience (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532673X12437555">Behr &amp; Iyengar, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532673X12437555">Edwards, Mitchell, &amp; Welch, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1532673X12437555">Iyengar &amp; Simon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1532673X12437555">Jones, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532673X12437555">Jones, Larsen-Price, &amp; Wilkerson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1532673X12437555">McCombs &amp; Shaw, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1532673X12437555">Monroe, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1532673X12437555">Soroka, 2006</xref>) and I therefore follow suit. I use iPoll to collect all national polls published between January 1 and September 1, 2010, which asked respondents to identify the most important issue or problem facing the country. This time period ensures that the polls are drawn from the period over which candidates were formulating their campaigns. The polls should be largely free of influence from the campaign, however, because most congressional campaigns do not heat up until after Labor Day. I measure national salience of an issue as the average proportion of respondents listing the issue as the most important issue or problem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1532673X12437555">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the ongoing debate of the Health Care reform bill, it is no surprise that health care was the most salient of the six issues over those 8 months. Health care received an average of 12.2% of respondents listing it as the most important issue. The second most salient issue nationally was the Afghanistan war, with 4.1% of respondents listing the issue as the most important. Immigration, the environment, and taxes received prioritization from 3.2%, 2.8%, and 0.8% of respondents, respectively. The least salient of these six issues was same-sex marriage, for which no polls reported respondents listing it as the most important issue.</p>
<p>Although these six issues were some of the most salient in the race, for reasons discussed earlier, they omit the economy, the most commonly cited issue. The economy accounted for 55.9% of all responses to the “most important problem” question over the 8-month span. This salience both precludes the economy from the present study and highlights its centrality for the 2010 elections. Thus, the present analysis does not claim to capture a representative portrait of all congressional campaign themes. I return to this point in the conclusion. Other issues receiving attention from the surveys were government size and corruption (7.4%), government spending (6.7%), personal wealth or poverty issues (3.1%), education (1.8%), and foreign relations and affairs (1.2%).</p>
<p>To gauge national issue ownership, I again used iPoll to collect all national polls published between January 1 and September 1 that asked respondents to identify which of the two major parties is best at handling each of the six issues. Unfortunately, no polls in that time frame asked the question for same-sex marriage, though one from May 2009 was available. Using this poll for same-sex marriage, and the average of all the 2010 polls for the remaining issues, I follow convention by calculating national ownership as the proportion of respondents identifying Democrats as best at handling the issue minus the proportion identifying Republicans as best at handling the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532673X12437555">Druckman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1532673X12437555">Sides, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1532673X12437555">2007</xref>). The resulting measure suggests that Democrats held a reputation advantage for handling the environment (+.26), same-sex marriage (+.13), and health care (+.08), while Republicans owned taxes (–.06), immigration (–.04), and the Afghanistan war (–.01).</p>

<sec id="section6-1532673X12437555">
<title>Measuring Issue Agendas Using Campaign Websites</title>
<p>I analyze the “On the Issues” section common to most campaign websites to identify the issue agendas of candidates running in the UCDWM districts. The content analysis involved myself and two undergraduate research assistants who each independently coded the webpages to measure the topic of each issue the candidates mentioned on their On the Issues pages. A total of 300 candidates from the sample districts fielded campaign webpages in 2010 and I used a web-scraper to download screen shots and the HTML files from these websites. In all, 20 of these websites were not archived because they were written in a language other than HTML. An additional 68 campaign websites omitted an “On the Issues” portion of the webpage. I am thus left with 212 candidates under analysis.</p>
<p>The candidates in the analysis are similar to the other candidates in the sample in most ways. Looking only at candidates in the random sample of districts, however, the candidates under analysis were better funded than the other candidates in the sample. The 132 candidates in the analysis spent about 30% more on their campaigns than did the 63 remaining candidates, though the difference is not statistically significant (<italic>t</italic><sub>193</sub> = 1.59, <italic>p</italic> = .11). The marginal difference in campaign spending likely occurs because better funded campaigns should be more likely to field websites and more professional campaigns are likely to adopt the common On the Issues website format.</p>
<p>One concern for the study is whether these On The Issues pages are representative of candidates’ campaign agendas spanning all campaign communications. I have leverage to evaluate this threat because the expert survey asks respondents to assess the level of priority that candidates attach to each of the six issues and name the candidates’ number one priority among the six issues. When a candidate mentions an issue on his or her website, it is associated with a significant increase in experts’ assessments of the priority the candidate attaches to the issue (<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>1 264</italic></sub> = 14.0, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and the likelihood that experts will name the issue as the candidate’s top priority (<inline-formula id="inline-formula1-1532673X12437555">

Regardless of mechanism, however, campaign websites appear to correspond with experts’ perceptions of candidate priorities.</p>
<p>Another concern for the study is whether the candidates under analysis are significantly more or less prone to addressing the issues than other candidates. The candidates under analysis were not significantly different from the other candidates in the random sample of districts in terms of experts’ assessments of the priority they placed on each issue, with one exception. According to the experts, the candidates in the sample placed a higher priority on Afghanistan (1.42 on a 0-3 scale) than did the other candidates (1.34) and the difference was statistically significant (<italic>t</italic>
<sub>194</sub> = 2.07, <italic>p</italic> = .04). For the most part, however, the candidates under analysis appear to be representative of House candidates in general.</p>
<p>The analysis proceeds as follows. First, I assess the extent of variation in issue salience and issue preferences across districts. I then explore how candidates addressed each of the six issues. Finally, I employ a model to estimate and compare the roles of salience and ownership, within the district and nationally.</p>

<title>Variation in Issue Salience Across Districts</title>
<p>Nationally, health care was the most salient of the six issues, followed by the Afghanistan war, immigration, the environment, taxes, and, finally, same-sex marriage. That is not to say, however, that all districts prioritize these issues equally. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1532673X12437555">Figure 1</xref> shows the distribution of salience across districts using kernel-density plots. The figure shows that the priority citizens attach to these six issues varies substantially across districts. For the issues of the environment, same-sex marriage, immigration, and health care reform, the standard deviation of salience across districts is about a half unit on the 4-point scale. The salience of the Afghanistan war and taxes features slightly less variation across districts than the other four issues, with a standard deviation of about 0.4 for each. Still, the figure demonstrates that few districts place high priority on the environment and same-sex marriage while many districts do so for the other four issues. Likewise, few districts place low priority on health care, the Afghanistan war, immigration, and taxes, whereas a fair number of districts place low priority on same-sex marriage.</p>

Consider the top priorities in Idaho’s two districts. Idaho’s first district, which borders Canada, prioritizes immigration over health care and the other issues. Idaho’s second, on the other hand, prioritizes taxes above the five other issues. Nevada’s second district, just to the south, features health care reform as the top average priority. Nevada’s second district is one of 58 that prioritize health care above the other issues. Following closely behind health care, 55 districts place taxes as the most important issue, on average. Recall that the common national measure of salience, the “most important problem” surveys, suggest that taxes is the second least salient of the six issues nationally. Thus, the national measure ignores the fact that taxes are a highly salient issue in many districts. This contradiction may stem from the fact that the “most important problem” wording conflates issue importance with whether the public perceives the topic as a problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1532673X12437555">Wlezien, 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>Although same-sex marriage was rarely a top priority for most voters, regional variation in prioritization of the issue appears to respond to external events. No states had same-sex marriage propositions on the ballot in 2010, but Iowa’s ballot featured a retention election for three state Supreme Court justices who voted in a 2009 case to allow same-sex marriage in the state. Conservative organizations from across the country poured an unprecedented amount of money into a successful campaign to remove the justices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1532673X12437555">Sulzberger, 2010</xref>). Accordingly, the two Iowa districts in the sample both feature an average priority of about 1.7 on the issue, which is almost twice the national average of 0.9.</p>
<p>In summary, a national average of issue salience belies a great deal of variation in the priorities of individual districts. Hence, if candidates focus only on national salience, they may ignore the priorities of their constituents.</p>

<title>Variation in Issue Advantage Across Districts</title>
<p>Focusing on national party reputation for handling an issue may overlook candidates’ relative advantage within their districts. The national polls indicate that significant portions of the electorate favor each party’s handling of the issues. We cannot tell from these polls, however, how those preferences are distributed across districts.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, districts vary greatly in their political preferences on each issue, as can be seen by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1532673X12437555">Figure 3</xref>. The kernel-density plots in the figure show that the issues feature unimodal preference distributions, with the majority of districts located toward the middle of the 7-point scale. It appears that many districts lean liberal on health care and conservative on immigration, with the remaining issues featuring modes near the midpoint of the scales. Nonetheless, all issues feature standard deviations of district preferences greater than one on the 7-point scales. The Afghanistan war features the least district-level variation, with a standard deviation of 1.1, whereas health care and same-sex marriage feature the most variation, each with standard deviations of 1.3. All issues, however, feature a fair number of districts on each side of the ideological divide. Thus, if Democratic candidates tend to be liberal on the issues and Republican candidates tend to be conservative, a significant number of districts should feature candidates with an advantage in the district despite the opposing party owning the issue nationally.</p>

</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X12437555">Table 1</xref> demonstrates that, in fact, many candidates are at a disadvantage on nationally “owned” issues and at an advantage on issues their opponent’s party “owns.” For each issue, the table shows the number of districts in the UCDWM sample in which the Republican candidate is closer to district preferences than is the Democratic candidate and, conversely, the number of districts that the Democratic candidate is closer to district preferences than is the Republican candidate. It also displays the Democratic national ownership score for each issue (positive numbers indicate greater Democratic reputation and negative numbers indicate greater Republican reputation). Despite the Democratic party’s favorable reputation for handling the environment, 83 of the 149 districts in the sample with two candidates featured Republican candidates closer to district preferences than the Democratic candidate. Thus, a majority of districts in the sample actually preferred Republicans on the issue. Although the survey item refers to general support for environmental regulations, the Republican advantage within districts on the issue may reflect public backlash against recent cap and trade initiatives, particularly the American Clean Energy and Security Act. Although about half the public supported the bill immediately following its passage in the House (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1532673X12437555">Pew Research Center, 2009</xref>), the bill became a rallying point for Tea Party followers, who felt it symbolized the overreach of the federal government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532673X12437555">Broder, 2010</xref>). Thus, districts with large Tea Party movements may be particularly distant from national opinion on environmental policy.</p>

<p>The other Democratic-owned issues featured similar preference variation across districts. The issues of same-sex marriage and health care each feature a majority of districts favoring Democratic candidates, but still 57 districts (38%) preferred the Republican candidate on same-sex marriage and 50 districts (34%) preferred the Republican on health care reform. Thus, among the Democratically owned issues, Republicans held an advantage over their Democratic opponent within their district 43% of the time. These districts, not surprisingly, tended to be conservative. Many of the districts that preferred Republicans on same-sex marriage feature disproportionately large populations of Christian Fundamentalists and Evangelicals. For instance, the respondents of Missouri’s seventh district strongly preferred Republican candidate and eventual winner Billy Long to Democratic candidate Scott Eckersley. This district, located in the Ozark Mountains, is nested in the heart of the Bible Belt and and was previously held by Republican Roy Blunt for 14 years, until 2010 when he left to become the junior U.S. Senator from Missouri. In his time in the House, Blunt actively supported an amendment to the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage and voted to ban adoption for same-sex couples.</p>
<p>Turning to Republican-owned issues, Democratic candidates dominated their Republican opponents in terms of their proximity to district opinion related to the Afghanistan war. A total of 101 districts (68%) preferred the position of the Democratic candidate over that of the Republican. Immigration, on the other hand, featured only 35 districts (23%) in which the Democrat held an advantage. Finally, a majority of Democratic candidates held a district advantage on taxes, the issue for which Republicans had the strongest reputation nationally. 80 districts (54%) preferred the Democratic candidate’s position and 69 districts preferred the Republican’s. In total, there are 406 instances (45%) where candidates hold an advantage over their opponent in terms of proximity to the district preference on the issue, <italic>despite the opposing party’s national ownership of the issue</italic>. Thus, like national salience, national ownership masks great variation in district preferences.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1532673X12437555">Figure 4</xref> visualizes the data from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X12437555">Table 1</xref>, mapping the relative magnitude of candidates’ issue advantage within their districts. The figure shows that the intensity of candidates’ issue advantage varies greatly across regions. For the issues of taxes, same-sex marriage, and immigration, there is at least one district that prefers the Democratic candidate’s position over the Republican’s by a full 5 points (or more) on the 7-point scale. On the issue of health care reform, there are nine districts with such an intense preference for the Democrat’s position. No districts hold such an intense preference for the Democratic candidate on the the environment and, in fact, only 16 districts prefer the Democrat by 4 or more points, and 29 prefer the Republican candidate by that magnitude. On all issues except Afghanistan, there is at least one district that prefers the Republican candidate by greater than a 5-point margin, including 7 districts with such a preference on health care.</p>

</fig>
<p>The figure also demonstrates variation across issues in terms of district support for each candidate. Texas’ 28th district, which starts south of San Antonio and heads to the Mexico border, strongly preferred the Democratic candidate’s (incumbent and eventual victor, Henry Cuellar) position on health care reform, moderately preferred his position on same-sex marriage, and weakly preferred his position on the environment and taxes. Yet the district moderately preferred the Republican candidate’s (Bryan Underwood) position on immigration and the Afghanistan war. In contrast, Texas’ sixth district, south of Dallas, moderately preferred the Democratic challenger’s (David Cozad) position on immigration and the Afghanistan war (as well as the environment and taxes), while preferring the Republican incumbent’s (Joe Barton) position on the remaining issues. Hence, these districts demonstrate that district preferences vary across issues and within regions.</p>

<title>Issue Agendas in the 2010 Elections</title>
<p>This article has thus far demonstrated that districts vary considerably in terms of the priority they place on issues as well as their partisan preference on the issue. Do candidates respond to this variation in their campaign issue agendas? I first consider the influence of each variable individually and in comparison to national measures of salience and ownership. I then estimate a model to assess the relative impact of each factor and control for alternative explanations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1532673X12437555">Figure 5</xref> plots the percentage of sample candidates with “On the Issues” pages who mentioned each of the six issues (light grey bars) as well as the average percentage of citizens who list the issue as the most important (dark grey bars). Many candidates discussed war and defense without mentioning explicitly Afghanistan, and thus, the chart also displays the percentage of candidates discussing defense/war (striped bar). The general trend in the figure suggests that candidates are more likely to address an issue as the issue’s national salience increases. Only the issue of taxes diverges from this trend, which may suggest that candidates are responsive to the electorates’ high prioritization of this issue, despite their reluctance to name it as the “most important problem.”</p>

<p>How might issue ownership and district advantage affect issue agendas? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1532673X12437555">Figure 6</xref> plots the number of candidates with “On the Issues” pages who mentioned each of the six issues, by whether they held an advantage in the district (dark grey bars) and whether their party owned the issue nationally (light grey bars). No clear trend between issue agendas and district advantage or national ownership emerges among these six issues. Immigration is the only issue that featured more advantaged candidates, both within districts and nationally, addressing the issue than did disadvantaged candidates. Conversely, candidates disadvantaged on the issue of same-sex marriage at either level were <italic>more</italic> likely to address the issue than were the advantaged candidates. Republican candidates discussed taxes at a higher rate than did Democratic candidates, and the reverse was true for the issue of the environment. Therefore, candidates with a national ownership advantage were more likely than candidates of the opposing party to emphasize these two issues. Yet when comparing issue emphasis by district advantage, advantaged candidates discussed taxes less often than did disadvantaged candidates and each group featured the same number of candidates discussing the environment. On the two remaining issues, Afghanistan and health care, a minority of candidates who addressed the issue owned the issue nationally. In other words, despite a slight national ownership disadvantage, Democrats were more likely than Republicans to address Afghanistan and Republicans were more likely than Democrats to address health care. On these issues, however, the majority of candidates who addressed the issues held a preference advantage within their districts. Thus, candidates may be playing to their district’s preferences when they shape their agenda on these issues. Still, the figure shows that many candidates address these issues, even when they are further from district opinion than their opponent. In short, national ownership and district advantage may each have some explanatory power for candidates’ issue agendas, but further analysis is necessary to tease out these relationships.</p>

</fig>
<p>The analyses in this article thus far cannot determine how much each source of salience and preferences contribute to campaign issue agendas. Likewise, previous studies of issue agendas have focused on models of attention to individual issues, holding constant national measures of salience and ownership. One way to overcome this problem and compare the effects of each is to pool candidate attention to multiple issues in a single model. To that end, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X12437555">Table 2</xref> models issue agendas as a function of district-level salience and district preferences and compares those effects to those of national-level measures. The response variable is whether candidates prioritize each of the six issues in their campaign and equals one for each candidate that prioritized the issue on their On the Issues webpage and zero for those that did not. Thus each candidate has six observations with one observation corresponding to each of the six issues. I therefore employ a multilevel logistic regression that allows the intercept to vary across candidates and issues to account for this data structure. This approach is necessary to ensure that the standard errors are not biased downward due to repeated observations of the variables of interest at the candidate and issue levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532673X12437555">Gelman &amp; Hill, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1532673X12437555">Hox, 2002</xref>).</p>

</inline-formula> = .44). Hence, the equation finds systematic support for the prevailing belief that the national salience of an issue increases campaign attention to issues. Unlike recent studies, however, the equation also finds support for the issue ownership theory. The coefficient on national ownership equals .25, more than 3 times the size of its standard error. Perhaps surprisingly, given the considerable variation across districts, the model suggests that candidates ignore the preferences and priorities of the electorate when shaping their campaign agenda. Neither district salience nor district issue advantage produce a significant coefficient in the model. The coefficient on candidate party suggests that Democratic candidates were significantly less likely to address these six issues than were Republican candidates.</p>
<p>Equation 2 introduces controls for common predictors of campaign agendas. First, it controls for the influence of party leaders with an indicator of whether the candidate’s party included the issue in their 2010 national platform.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1532673X12437555">12</xref></sup> Of the issues in the model, the Democrats included in this list same-sex marriage, the environment, immigration, and health care, whereas the Republicans included only defense and health care. This control thus provides a strong test of each mechanism as the national parties may have also formed their platforms using these strategies. The other controls include incumbency status (1 if incumbent and zero otherwise), an indicator of whether the seat was open, electoral competitiveness, and campaign spending.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1532673X12437555">13</xref></sup> This equation preserves the central results from Equation 1, though the magnitude of the coefficients on national salience and ownership increase slightly. The model predicts that the odds that candidates address an issue in their campaigns will increase 3.5 times with a standard deviation increase in the national salience of the issue. By comparison, a standard deviation increase in public approval of the party’s handling of an issue will be associated with a 40% increase in the odds that the candidate addresses the issue. Thus, both national measures appear to be valuable predictors of issue agendas though these results support recent arguments that national salience is a more powerful predictor then is national ownership (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532673X12437555">Druckman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1532673X12437555">Sides, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1532673X12437555">2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Turning to the controls, the effect of the party platform indicator is moderate in size and statistically significant. The sign, however, is opposite from expectations, suggesting that candidates in the sample were about 2 times <italic>less</italic> likely to prioritize an issue if it was on their party’s national platform. This finding is surprising and suggests that the national focus of campaigns may not be due to the influence of party leaders, specifically. Incumbents in the sample are less likely to discuss each issue than are challengers and challengers less so than open-seat candidates, but the effects are not statistically significant. The model finds no effect of competition or campaign spending on candidates’ prioritization of these six issues. The null spending result may reflect the nature of campaign websites, specifically, rather than campaign agenda setting, generally. One advantage of campaign websites for analysis is that they are accessible to even the poorest candidates. As a result, however, website agendas may mask campaign spending effects that occur for more expensive mediums.</p>
<p>Equation 3 further explores the relationship between national salience and ownership by introducing an interaction between the two. The interaction is negative and statistically significant, suggesting that the salience and ownership work in opposition. As the salience of an issue increases, the influence of issue ownership decreases. Conversely, as a candidate’s party develops a stronger reputation for handling an issue, the influence of national salience decreases. Thus, issues have multiple pathways onto candidates’ agendas, but these pathways are not complimentary. This finding supports the notion that salient issues can force candidates to discuss issues that they would rather avoid based on issue ownership grounds. At the same time, issue ownership may shelter candidates’ need to attend to public opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532673X12437555">Egan, 2008</xref>). The interaction supports this contention, suggesting that a strong party reputation can shelter candidates from the pressure of addressing salient issues: The effect of salience is significantly attenuated as the party’s reputation on the issue increases.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The campaign agendas of candidates in 2010 appear to embody the nationalization of congressional races. Instead of using their agendas to highlight their connection to district interests, they responded systematically to national opinion. The most salient issues nationally received the most attention from candidates, but candidates tempered these appeals when the opposing party held a better national reputation for handling the issue. Candidates pursued this national strategy despite significant variation in preferences and priorities across districts.</p>
<p>By focusing on district and national influences of congressional campaigns, this study leaves out other potential sources of influence. For example, candidates’ apparent inattention to district opinion may miss their attention to particular subconstituencies. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X12437555">Fenno (1978)</xref> explains, representatives conceive of their districts as concentric rings of constituents; therefore, candidates may pay more attention to the opinion of constituents on whom they depend most. For example, representatives policy positions are closer to their activists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1532673X12437555">Stone &amp; Pietryka, 2011</xref>) and more responsive to the positions of wealthy constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532673X12437555">Bartels, 2008</xref>). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532673X12437555">Bishin (2009)</xref> shows that candidates respond primarily to constituents holding particularly intense preferences on an issue. It is therefore plausible that candidates’ campaign agendas are inattentive to the district as a whole even while being attentive to particular groups of constituents. Unfortunately, the relatively large sample sizes of the CCES module are still too small to measure opinion of subgroups within districts.</p>
<p>Moreover, in addition to votes, candidates require funding and sources of their funding often extend beyond district boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532673X12437555">Gimpel, Lee, &amp; Pearson Merkowitz, 2008</xref>). Candidates therefore have incentive to address the priorities of major donors. Likewise, interest groups often attempt to influence the agenda indirectly, through the use of advertising, demonstrations, and grass roots lobbying. American Crossroads, for example, spent millions of dollars in 2010 running ads across the country, focusing primarily on economic issues. Candidates may have felt compelled to address the economy, in part, due to the salience of these ads specifically rather than due to the salience of the economy generally. The models in this analysis cannot account for these potential influences.</p>
<p>A related limitation is that regional influences may cause candidates in a given region (e.g., state, media market) to address the same set of issues. Candidates running in districts targeted by American Crossroads, for example, may have felt disproportionately compelled to address the economy. Likewise, candidates in Iowa may have focused on gay marriage due to Everyday America’s ads targeting the state’s Supreme Court recall. Thus, campaign agendas may exhibit spatial dependance and spatial heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532673X12437555">Anselin, 2007</xref>). Similarly, district borders occasionally divide communities and candidates may be unable to isolate the opinion of their constituents from that of nearby districts, perhaps inducing a spatial lag. Such possibilities are beyond the scope of this article but suggest the need for future analysis to explore spatial dependence in campaign agendas.</p>
<p>Although these results suggest that candidates ignored district opinion as they selected the issues they would address in their campaigns, they do not rule out the influence of the district in other aspects of congressional campaigns and elections. In fact, many studies suggest that district opinion has significant influence over campaign strategy and electoral outcomes (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532673X12437555">Burden, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532673X12437555">Canes-Wrone, Brady, &amp; Cogan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X12437555">Druckman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1532673X12437555">Gartner &amp; Segura, 2008</xref>). This study has focused solely on issue emphasis and treated candidates’ positions as exogenous. This choice is necessary to gain traction on the influence of district opinion, but it is clearly an abstraction from reality. Candidates likely choose to run in districts, in part, based on their congruence with the district and they are likely to tailor their positions to maximize policy congruence. This analysis can make no claims about the role of district and national opinion on congressional candidates’ policy positions. Moreover, policy is only one component of candidates’ relationships with voters. Fenno argues that representatives’ accessability and casework are equally important components of the representative–constituent relationship. In fact, some candidates in his study chose to ignore policy discussion almost entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X12437555">Fenno, 1978</xref>, p. 241). Likewise, candidate traits are a separate and crucial component of candidates’ electability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532673X12437555">Buttice &amp; Stone, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1532673X12437555">Fridkin &amp; Kenney, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1532673X12437555">Mondak, 1995</xref>). Thus, this analysis does not suggest that local events and conditions are unimportant. Rather, the primary contribution is to demonstrate that local opinion did not systematically shape candidates’ campaign agendas in 2010.</p>
<p>The results of this study add to the emerging consensus that the 2010 elections were some of the most nationalized midterm elections in history. In most midterm elections, voters tend to place equal weight on local and national issues. In 2010, however, voters prioritized national issues over local issues by a greater degree than ever before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1532673X12437555">Jones &amp; McDermott, 2011</xref>). Moreover, partisan identification and party favorability in 2010 were inexorably tied to approval of Obama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1532673X12437555">Jacobson, 2011a</xref>) and a record number of prospective voters reported that their support or opposition to the president would determine their 2010 congressional vote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1532673X12437555">Jacobson, 2011c</xref>). Subsequently, districts’ 2010 House vote had a .92 correlation with their 2008 presidential vote share—the strongest ever observed correlation between midterm and presidential vote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1532673X12437555">Jacobson, 2011a</xref>). The connection between the nationalization of candidates’ campaign behavior and voters’ decisions remains unclear and there is potential for future research to disentangle the causal order of this relationship.</p>
<p>The nationalized nature of the election, however, also serves to limit the generality of these findings. Although the elections over the past 15 years have been more nationalized than many in the past (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1532673X12437555">Jacobson, 2011a</xref>), candidates’ focus on national opinion may vary systematically over time and the picture may be quite different in more localized elections. Thus, this article can only speculate about the causal mechanisms producing candidates’ attention to national opinion.</p>
<p>To that end, several mechanisms come to mind that may explain candidates’ focus on national opinion. First, the positive impact of issue ownership on candidates’ propensity to address issues may reflect party leaders’ success in creating a collective policy agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X12437555">Cox, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532673X12437555">Cox &amp; McCubbins, 2005</xref>). Republicans attached relatively more attention to Republican-owned issues such as immigration whereas Democrats focused relatively more on Democratic-owned issues such as the environment. Yet, that collective policy agenda was apparently predicated on national opinion rather than the party leaders’ agendas, as evidenced by the negative coefficient on party platforms in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X12437555">Table 2</xref>. Likewise, the results may reflect the collective nature of the legislative process. Candidates know that agenda time is limited and that they need the support of a diverse set of representatives in order to get issues onto the agenda in the legislature. Thus, they may have incentive to delegate agenda power to party leaders and focus on national issues that all can agree are worth addressing.</p>
<p>Second, candidates’ issue agendas and the national polls may both be responding to the same external events and prevailing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532673X12437555">Behr &amp; Iyengar, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1532673X12437555">Page &amp; Shapiro, 1992</xref>). Candidates and voters alike focused on health care due to the recent reform bill, which was one of the most significant changes in health care policy since the the Social Security Act of 1965. At the same time, there were relatively few changes in the status of same-sex marriage policy, allowing voters and candidates to focus on other issues. Candidates may be relatively less informed about the events and conditions that determine variation in opinion across districts and, therefore, the degree to which their district differs from national opinion.</p>
<p>Third, the 2010 elections featured many other idiosyncracies that may contribute to these results. Aside from the health care reform discussed above, 2010 featured several historic events that dominated much of the national agenda. In particular, the economy was just emerging form the longest recession since World War II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1532673X12437555">National Bureau of Economic Research, 2011</xref>) and the United States was involved in conflict simultaneously in Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition, Democrats held the Presidency along with majorities in House and the Senate for the first time since 1994. The Democratic preeminence coupled with the downturn in economic conditions may have contributed to the emergence of the Tea Party, who were also distinct in that they were disproportionably active politically and thus helped generate an electorate that was “older, whiter, more conservative, and more Republican” than that of recent elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1532673X12437555">Jacobson, 2011b</xref>, p. 20).</p>
<p>On a related note, these results may be sensitive to the particular issues under study. By focusing on only six issues, this analysis cannot provide a representative portrait of the 2010 issue agenda and the present findings may not generalize to other issues. Excluding the economy from this analysis ignores a critical issue in elections generally and 2010 in particular. Interestingly, despite the predominant salience of the economy, about 15% of candidates did not address the issue on their websites. This study cannot explain why these candidates decided against addressing this issue and must leave that question open for further study.</p>
<p>Despite many idiosyncracies, the 2010 elections and the issues under study were not wholly singular. As partisanship has emerged as a greater predictor of vote choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532673X12437555">Bartels, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1532673X12437555">Jacobson, 2011a</xref>), partisan tides and unified government are increasingly likely to occur. Thus, there is mounting evidence that conditions are shifting in favor of some key tenants of Responsible Party Government. These results provide further evidence of those conditions as congressional candidates appear to have focused on a nationalized policy agenda. Of course, as discussed earlier, party control is only one of several mechanisms that could produce these results. Nonetheless, if candidates focus on national issues—whatever the cause—it may facilitate the development of a cohesive set of policy goals. Since these agendas are associated with party reputation, there should be some divergence of the paries’ agendas, which may strengthen the information conveyed by the party label. Thus, the various trends that suggest a nationalization of congressional elections may produce an increase in accountability. Whether these trends reflect a weakening of the electoral connection between representatives and their constituents remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The growing nationalization of congressional elections can be seen in the increased homogeneity within and polarization between the two parties in Congress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1532673X12437555">Layman, Carsey, &amp; Horowitz, 2006</xref>), increased influence of partisanship on citizens’ vote choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1532673X12437555">Jacobson, 2011a</xref>), and the increasing importance of national issues for voters’ decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1532673X12437555">Jones &amp; McDermott, 2011</xref>).</p></fn>

As detailed below, I find that Republicans held the better reputation on the issue in 2010, though the advantage is the weakest of the three Republican-owned issues under study.

<p>Experts were chosen in two ways. First, respondents were drawn from a large panel of respondents in the YouGov/Polimetrix online panel. Panelists were asked a series of screening questions gauging their political information levels, media exposure, ability to recognize the names of the House incumbent and challenger, and confidence in answering questions about their district. Those respondents who passed the screening questions were given the expert survey. An average of 26.7 experts per district were chosen in this manner. Second, an identical survey was given to national convention delegates from 2008 as well as sitting state legislators. An average of 4.7 experts per district were chosen in this manner. For a detailed analysis of this approach, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1532673X12437555">Stone and Simas (2010)</xref>, who show that the use of delegates as expert informants produces valid and reliable placements of the candidates.</p></fn>

<p>Health care, immigration, and tax salience were straightforward to categorize, but the issues of the Afghanistan war, the environment, and same-sex marriage required making several choices. I counted all mentions of “War,” “Defense,” and “Afghanistan” in the proportion listing Afghanistan as a top priority, but excluded those mentioning “Terrorism.” I counted all mentions of “The environment,” and “National disaster relief,” in the proportion listing the environment as a top priority. This choice may inflate the average salience of the environment because of the spike in respondents choosing disaster relief as the top problem in the wake of the BP oil spill in April 2010. Including disaster relief in the measure is appropriate, however, since it was a relevant environmental issue for congressional campaigns. Finally, no polls explicitly mentioned same-sex marriage as the top issue, though many polls included some proportion of respondents mentioning “Morals” or “Values” as the top issue. I omit these responses and code national priority of same-sex marriage as a zero because there are many concerns other than marriage that may fall into each of those categories. All models presented in this article are robust to this coding choice, producing substantively interchangeable results when those categories are included.</p></fn>
