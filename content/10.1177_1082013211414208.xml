<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to optimize all parameters implied in the process of obtaining orange segments as minimally processed product by enzymatic peeling, from the method of segment obtaining to the storage conditions, and also to evaluate two films with different permeability. Enzymatic peeling was carried out by fruit infusion under vacuum conditions in a commercial preparation of pectinases and cellulases (Peelzym II). The best condition to obtain Cadenera segments by enzymatic peeling was 1 mL/L of Peelzym II applied at 53 kPa with three vacuum pulses of 2 min and a subsequent period of 30 min in the enzymatic solution at atmospheric pressure. The segments were packaged in two films with different permeability and they were stored for 10 days at 4 °C. Samplings were carried out after 4, 7 and 10 days of storage. The results showed that the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the less permeable film (PA 120) ranged between 0.7 and 1.2 mL/100 mL, while in the most permeable one (PA 240) was around 0.2 mL/100 mL. Under these conditions, the weight loss was kept at low levels until day 7 of storage, showing a significant increase after 10 days. Colour (a/b) increased with the peeling process and it remained without significant changes during the whole storage period for both films. The antioxidant capacity slightly decreased after 10 days of storage. The microbial flora was reduced after the enzymatic peeling. Both the sensory and the microbiological quality were kept in adequate levels for consumption during 7 days. From this moment, they lost sweetness and aroma and the microbial development increased. Thus, the use of the most permeable film and a maximum storage time of 7 days are recommended to maintain the most quality of the segments.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1082013211414208" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The main lines of innovation in the agri-foodstuffs industry are focused on obtaining foods that preserve their sensory characteristics and bioactive compounds by the use of storage techniques like controlled or modified atmospheres, among others. The storage with high levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and low levels of O<sub>2</sub> (keeping the sensory and nutritional quality) of fruits and vegetables considerably extends the storage period at low temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1082013211414208">Robles-Sánchez et al., 2009</xref>). On the other side, the increase in the standard of living of the population has implied a change in the eating habits by increasing the preference of consumers for natural products, without addition of preservatives, with a high quality and easy to prepare. In response to this demand, ‘ready-to-use’ (RTU) or minimally processed products have been developed, that is, fresh fruits and vegetables, washed and cut, ready to be consumed and packaged in modified and cold atmospheres that allows an extension of their shelf life under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013211414208">Artés and Artés, 2003</xref>). The oranges present ideal conditions for being prepared as RTU products, since their distribution in segments allows the sectioning of the fruit without modifying the integrity of the vesicular structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 1997</xref>). At present, the removal of both albedo and segment membranes of the citrus fruits is carried out by chemical or mechanical procedures that imply high water expenditure and significant negative impact for the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 1998</xref>). Enzymatic peeling is an alternative that could reduce the use of water and the degree of contamination in the obtaining of peeled citrus fruits. This new method to obtain peeled citrus fruit is based on infusion under vacuum conditions of an enzymatic preparation, which degrades the pectic substances present in the cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013211414208">2008</xref>). Many parameters must be taken into account in order to obtain good peeling effectiveness, such as type of enzymatic preparation and its concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211414208">Baker and Bruemmer, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013211414208">Bruemmer, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1082013211414208">Soffer and Mannheim, 1994</xref>), and the vacuum conditions to allow the entrance of enzymatic solution towards the interior of the mesocarp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013211414208">Baker and Wicker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211414208">Prakash et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013211414208">2005</xref>). Moreover, the effect of the incubation time on peeled fruits quality may also be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211414208">Prakash et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1082013211414208">Rouhana and Mannheim, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1082013211414208">Soffer and Mannheim, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the market sales of RTU fresh vegetables have grown rapidly in recent decades as a result of changes in consumer attitudes, especially consumption of fresh-cut lettuce and carrot due to their use in prepared salads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1082013211414208">Rico et al., 2007</xref>). However, the marketing of fruits, in particular orange, as RTU is nearly nonexistent because there are not enough scientific studies regarding their elaboration or preservation. It is well known that processing of vegetables promotes a faster physiological deterioration, biochemical changes and microbial degradation of the product even when only slight processing operations are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013211414208">O’Beirne and Francis, 2003</xref>), which may result in degradation of the colour, texture and flavour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211414208">Kabir, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1082013211414208">Varoquaux and Wiley, 1994</xref>). Reduced O<sub>2</sub> and high CO<sub>2</sub> levels have proven to effectively control enzymatic browning, softening and decay in fresh-cut vegetables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013211414208">Oms-Oliu et al., 2008</xref>), the full beneficial effect of modified atmosphere being attained by correctly choosing the packaging materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013211414208">Allende et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This work offers new data about a topic that has not been deeply studied, that is, the obtaining and storage of RTU citrus fruits by non-contaminant methods (enzymatic peeling) using a Spanish traditional orange variety. Moreover, this is the first work that globally optimises all parameters implied in the process of obtaining orange segments as RTU product, from the process to obtain fruit segments by enzymatic peeling until their storage under atmospheres slightly enriched with CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec>

<p>A traditional variety of orange fruit (<italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> (L.) Osbeck cv. Cadenera) grown in the South-east of Spain was used. This variety belongs to the group of common oranges that includes white oranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1082013211414208">Rivera et al., 1998</xref>). Fruits were harvested at the optimal ripening stage (average respiratory rate 14.53 ± 2.30 mg CO<sub>2</sub>/kg h, ethylene production rate 0.12 ± 0.01 nL/g h, titratable acidity 1.04 ± 0.04 g/100 g and soluble solids content at 20 °C 14.3 ± 1.26 °Brix). The acidity and soluble solids were analysed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211414208">Pretel et al. (1998)</xref>.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1082013211414208"><title>Plastic films</title>
<p>The plastic films employed were provided by the firm Sidlaw Packaging P-Plus. Two microperforated polypropylene plastics with non-selective permeability were employed: Film PA120 (permeability at 25 °C for CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>: 120,000 mL/d m<sup>2</sup>; thickness: 35 µm) and Film PA240 (permeability at 25 °C for CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>: 240,000 mL/d m<sup>2</sup>; thickness: 35 µm).</p></sec>

<p>The pectolytic enzyme preparation used, provided by the company Novo Nordisk Fermemt Ltd (Dittingen, Switzerland), was Peelzym II produced by <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>. This enzymatic product is very suitable for the degradation of albedo and carpelar membrane due to its high pectinase and polygalacturonase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec8-1082013211414208"><title>Determination of the best combination of vacuum pressure and application time</title>
<p>Potential enzymatic saturation of albedo (PESA) was considered as the amount of enzymatic solution that the albedo fruit would be able to absorb. To evaluate PESA, oranges without any visible external damage were placed in a water bath at 40 °C to reach the recommended temperature for enzymatic peeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1082013211414208">Soffer and Mannheim, 1994</xref>). The entire fruit surface was homogeneously perforated by rolling the oranges over a 1 m<sup>2</sup> wood plate provided with cylindrical metal parts of 5 mm long and 1 mm diameter. The distance between each cylindrical metal part was 10 mm. With this system 8 ± 3 perforations per cm<sup>2</sup> in the albedo fruit were produced. After perforation, the fruits were placed in a vacuum tank containing 9 L of the Peelzym II solution (1 mL/L) with Chinese ink (1:10) at 40 °C and submitted to different vacuum pressures, 27, 40, 53, 67, 80 and 93 kPa during different application times (pulses of 2 min). The PESA was measured using two parameters: percentage of fruit weight increase and percentage of the albedo surface dyed with ink. In all experiments, 10 fruits were taken for each vacuum pressure and application time according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1082013211414208">Pretel et al. (2007b)</xref>. From this experiment, the best combination of vacuum pressure and application time was selected.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1082013211414208"><title>Optimization of the incubation time for enzymatic peeling process</title>
<p>Peelzym II concentration at 1 or 2 mL/L were used according to the previous experiments. A total of 60 orange fruits (30 for each concentration of Peelzym II) without any visible external damage were washed with chlorinated water (300 ppm), placed in a water bath at 40 °C and perforated as previously described. Then, orange fruits were exposed to the vacuum conditions previously optimised and thereafter vacuum was released and orange fruits were left to incubate with the enzymatic solution at atmospheric pressure. Samplings of five fruit were undertaken after six different incubation times (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min) and the peeling efficiency was evaluated, according to five visual parameters dealing the final product quality. Since these parameters were subjective, each of them was independently assessed by five judges for each of the five fruits of each experiment. The quality parameter evaluated and scores for them were the following (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 2007b</xref>):

<sec id="sec10-1082013211414208"><title>Enzymatic peeling and sample preparation.</title>
<p>Enzymatic peeling was carried out by vacuum infusion of an enzymatic solution of Peelzym II (1 mL/L) applied at 53 kPa with three vacuum pulses of 2 min, 40 °C to remove the peel, and a subsequent period of 30 min in the enzymatic solution at atmospheric pressure (these were the best conditions for obtaining orange segments according to the results of the experiments described above). Then, fruits were rinsed by immersion in water for 30 min at 4 °C. The segments were withdrawn and manually centrifuged to remove water from their surfaces and then packaged. Different plastic bags (interchange surface 1000 cm<sup>2</sup>) were filled with approximately 300 g of oranges and each was fitted with a silicon septum used for sampling the internal atmosphere to analyse gas composition. All samples were stored during 10 days at 4 ± 1 °C, the temperature normally used in the commercialization of these products. Variation of the atmosphere composition inside the bags was checked daily. Periodic samplings were carried out on three trays of each film at 4, 7 and 10 days of storage in which weight loss, colour, sensory quality, antioxidant capacity and microbiological and sensory quality of segments were analysed. Some parameters like colour and microbial content were also analysed before peeling (BP) and after peeling (AP) in order to know if, apart from the preservation method, the peeling process has any effect on the quality of segments.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1082013211414208"><title>Evaluation of the quality of segments during storage</title>
<sec id="sec12-1082013211414208"><title>Gas analysis inside packages</title>
<p>A silicone septum was located on each bag’s surface in order to enable sampling gas inside each package. In all, 1 mL of the bag headspace atmosphere was withdrawn using an airtight syringe and the CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations were measured by gas chromatography with a GC 14B (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan), equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a molecular sieve 5A column, 80–100 mesh (Carbosieve SII. Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, USA), of 2 m length and 3 mm i.d. Oven and injector temperature were 50 °C and 110 °C, respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 50 mL/min. Results are expressed as mL/100 mL of O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> inside the bags and are the mean ± SE of duplicate determinations in each bag (<italic>n</italic> = 5). A further 1 mL of the bag atmosphere was used to quantify ethylene concentration using a Hewlett-Packard gas chromatograph model 5890 (Wilmington, DE, USA) equipped with a flame ionisation detector and a stainless steel column packed with 80/100 mesh-activated alumina. Oven temperature was 90 °C and injector and detector temperatures 150 °C. N<sub>2</sub> was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 28 mL/min. Results are expressed as µL/L inside the bags and are the mean ± SE of duplicate determinations in each bag (<italic>n</italic> = 5).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1082013211414208"><title>Weight loss and colour</title>
<p>Citrus segment were weighted before packaging and after the storage period, and weight loss was calculated as percentage of their initial weight (<italic>n</italic> = 3). Colour was determined using a reflection colorimeter Hunter model D-25A-2 with 45° illumination, which expresses colour in coordinates L*, a* and b*. Two measurements were made at opposite sides of each fruit segment and results represent the mean ± SE of the measurements taken from 10 fruit segments of each bag.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-1082013211414208"><title>Sensory evaluation</title>
<p>Sensory analysis to compare the quality of orange segments was carried out by 10 trained adults, aged 25–40 (5 female and 5 male). The panel was trained in a pretest in which orange fruit with extremely low or high attributes (aroma, lack of bitterness, chewiness and segment firmness) were evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 1998</xref>). A laboratory of sensory analyses with an individual booth for each panellist was used. Panellists were randomly served five segments from each film for each variety to evaluate the above mentioned attributes on a ranked scale of 1 to 5. The selection and training of tasters, as well as the fitting-out of the tasting room, were carried out according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211414208">AENOR (1995)</xref>.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec15-1082013211414208"><title>Determination of total antioxidant activity</title>
<p>Total antioxidant activity (TAA) was determined using the enzymatic system composed of the chromophore 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), the horse radish peroxidase enzyme (HRP) and its oxidant substrate (hydrogen peroxide), in which ABTS<sup>•+</sup> radicals are generated. After that, the vegetable extracts are added and their antioxidant compounds regenerate the ABTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013211414208">Cano et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 2004</xref>). The reaction mixture contained 1.5 mM ABTS, 15 µM hydrogen peroxide and 0.25 µM HRP in 50 mM glycine–HCl buffer (pH 4.5) in a total volume of 2 mL. The assay temperature was 25 °C and the reaction was monitored at 414 nm, until a stable absorbance was obtained using a UNICAM Helios α spectrophotometer (Cambridge, UK). After that, a suitable amount of orange extract was added and the observed decrease in absorbance was determined. A calibration curve was performed with ®-(+)-6-hydroxy-2, 5, 7, 8-tetramethylchoman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox; 0–20 nmol) from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, UK), and results are expressed as milligram of Trolox equivalent per 100 g of fresh weight (mg/100 g).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec16-1082013211414208"><title>Microbiological analyses</title>
<p>Microbiological growth during the storage of samples was determined by total plate count on plate count agar (PCA, Oxoid), by <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> count on MRS agar (Oxoid) and by yeast and mould count on Rose Bengal chloramphenicol agar (Oxoid). Samples were examined on days 3, 7 and 10. Three bags were opened under sterile conditions and a 10 g sample was placed into a stomacher bag with 90 mL of peptone water (Oxoid). Samples were homogenized in peptone water. Appropriate dilutions were placed on two duplicate plates of PCA, MRS or Rose Bengal medium. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48–72 h and counts were obtained.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec17-1082013211414208"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data for the physical, chemical and visual quality parameters were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA). Sources of variation were storage time and treatments. Mean comparisons were performed using the honestly significant difference Tukey’s test to examine if differences between plastic films and storage time were significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. All analyses were performed with a statistical software package SPSS v. 11.0 for Windows least significant differences (LSDs) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.05) were calculated for mean separations and are showed in figures.</p></sec></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec19-1082013211414208"><title>Ideal peeling conditions</title>
<p>Different vacuum conditions were applied to orange fruit to determine the minimum vacuum pressure and the minimum number of pulses to be applied to the fruits to allow the entrance of an adequate amount of the enzymatic solution in the albedo and between the segments of the Cadenera orange. A total saturation of the enzymatic solution in the albedo was achieved with pressures between 53 and 93 kPa applied in three vacuum pulses of 2 min, as it can be deduced from the results of the PESA studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013211414208">Figure 1(a) and (b)</xref>). In order to obtain segments, it is important to determine the vacuum conditions at which the fruit medule begins to be dyed. This would indicate the penetration of solution inside the fruit and its separation into individual segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211414208">Baker and Bruemmer, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 2007a</xref>). The vacuum pressures with which the medule was dyed began from 53 kPa and three vacuum pulses. Therefore, to obtain segments from Cadenera variety, the best vacuum conditions are 53 kPa with three vacuum pulses. The use of 67–93 kPa would not be recommended because an excess of enzyme solution in tissue as porous as the albedo could be a disadvantage for the process of enzymatic peeling, in which the infiltrated material cannot be used again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013211414208">Baker and Wicker, 1996</xref>).

<p>On the other hand, it was shown that the effectiveness of the process varied greatly depending on the concentration of the enzyme used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013211414208">Bruemmer, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1082013211414208">Toker and Bayindirli, 2003</xref>). The enzymatic solutions are expensive and it is possible to reduce the amount of enzymatic solution by increasing the incubation time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211414208">Prakash et al., 2001</xref>). The highest albedo percentage not attacked by the enzyme was found after 10 min of incubation with 1 mL/L of Peelzym II (17.7 ± 3.2%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013211414208">Table 1</xref>), which would decrease the quality of the final product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 2007a</xref>). However, after 20 min, the percentage of albedo not attacked was less than 3%, a percentage that allows a very good peeling efficiency. The ease of skin separation was reached from 10 min of incubation with 2 mL/L of enzyme preparation, while with 1 mL/L, the maximum ease of skin was reached after 20 min of incubation. The degree of segment separation with 1 mL/L of enzyme preparation has its optimum after 30 min incubation time (4.67 ± 0.47) with a percentage of albedo not attacked of 3.34 ± 2.36%. With 2 mL/L and more than 30 min incubation time, the segments separation did not greatly differ. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211414208">Prakash et al. (2001)</xref> found that for the enzymatic peeling of grapefruit a minimum of 12 min of incubation was needed to obtain a good ease of peeling, while with incubation times above 30 min, the segments texture was damaged. Therefore, 30 min could be considered as the best time for obtaining peeled segments from Cadenera variety, and the best Peelzym II concentration was 1 mL/L. With 20 min of incubation, good results were also obtained but increasing the concentration of Peelzym II up to 2 mL/L.

<p>The evolution of the internal atmosphere in the bags containing the orange segments is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013211414208">Figure 2</xref>. An increase of CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013211414208">Figure 2(a)</xref>) and decrease of O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013211414208">Figure 2(b)</xref>) took place within both films. The composition of the atmosphere in the less permeable film (PA 120) was around 0.7 mL/100 mL of CO<sub>2</sub> and 21 mL/100 mL of O<sub>2</sub> during the first 7 days, although 1.2 mL/100 mL of CO<sub>2</sub> was achieved after 10 days of storage. In the most permeable film (PA 240), the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> was 0.2 mL/100 mL during the whole experience, and the concentration of O<sub>2</sub> was kept in the same levels than the film PA 120, that is, around 21 mL/100 mL. In both films, especially in the most permeable PA 240, the concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> were low and the oxygen was almost not modified compared to the normal air. Therefore, although both films modified the atmosphere, the O<sub>2</sub> was less affected than CO<sub>2</sub> by films. Thus, development of off flavours or undesirable effects could not be expected, since they usually appear when high CO<sub>2</sub> and low O<sub>2</sub> concentration are achieved inside film (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211414208">Del-Valle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 1998</xref>). However, the packaging plays a significant role in order to prevent dehydration and to maintain texture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013211414208">Brecht et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown in table grape that the atmospheres slightly CO<sub>2</sub> enriched can affect some quality parameters like reducing the weight loss or delaying the microbial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 2006</xref>). The ethylene level inside the bags was very low in both films during the whole storage period (under 0.06 µL/L; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013211414208">Figure 2(c)</xref>).

<p>On the other side, the characteristic colour of the segments is defined by a mixture of red (+a*) and yellow (+b*), so the a*/b* coefficient gives an idea of the degree in which the red and yellow colours contribute to the orange colour typical of these fruits due to the accumulation of different carotenoids. There are evidences that show that the ratio between yellow carotenoids and orange carotenoids is a good indicator of the characteristic colour of each variety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013211414208">Alquézar et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, a high a*/b* value should indicate a more intense orange colour, while a low a*/b* value should indicate a loss of the characteristic colour. There were slight changes in colour during storage, and no differences between films were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1082013211414208">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, storage in modified atmospheres kept the initial colour of the segments, as it has been observed in other orange fruits like mangoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211414208">Pesis et al., 2000</xref>). However, after the process of peeling, the segments showed significantly higher values (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) of the parameter a/b (−0.18 ± 0.002) than BP (−0.21 ± 0.010). This means that the process of enzymatic peeling increased the orange colour of segments, so they were more attractive for the consumer; probably due to the fact that the enzymes employed during the process remove the rests of albedo and skin that can hide the colour of the segments before the enzymatic peeling.

TAA in orange segment did not change after the enzymatic peeling or after the first 7 days of storage.

<p>The segments, in both films, were kept in optimum conditions during the first 4 days (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013211414208">Table 2</xref>). For both films, changes along storage time in sweetness and chewiness were not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05%). However, a decrease in aroma was found after 7 days of storage in both plastic films. In addition, a significant increase in segment firmness was found after 7 days of storage, irrespectively of the film used, probably due to a rigidification of the segment surface caused by dehydratation processes leading to increases in weight loss. These results state that the enzymatically peeled orange segments can be stored in atmospheres slightly enriched in CO<sub>2</sub> (between 0.2 mL/100 mL and 0.7 mL/100 mL) for a week without loss of sensory quality, because the atmospheres with high levels of CO<sub>2</sub> cause higher losses of aroma and flavour, as was shown in manually peeled orange segments under modified atmospheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 2008</xref>).

<p>Influence of the enzymatic peeling and the film permeability on the microbial development. The use of low temperatures is one of the main microbiological control methods, but some authors have mentioned that atmospheres with high CO<sub>2</sub> and low O<sub>2</sub> also delay the microbial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013211414208">Carlin et al., 1990</xref>). It is interesting to mention the decrease of the microbial development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1082013211414208">Figure 6</xref>), especially of moulds and yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1082013211414208">Figure 6(b)</xref>) after the peeling process, probably due to the fact that the enzymes employed in the peeling also have a fungicide or bactericide effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013211414208">Pinnavaia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 1998</xref>). However, it was possible that the enzyme peeling removes excess peel, which may harbor bacteria, and this may explain the decrease in bacterial count AP. The mesophilic aerobic microflora (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1082013211414208">Figure 6(a)</xref>) remained in acceptable levels close to the initial ones up to day 7 of storage with few differences between both films, although it was always slightly higher in the most permeable film. After a week of storage, the development of mesophilic flora experienced a considerable increase so the segments were not commercially viable. This can be due to the fact that the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the internal atmosphere of the bags is not high enough for stopping the development of the mesophilic flora, as was observed in manually separated orange segments with CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over 5 mL/100 mL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211414208">Pretel et al., 1998</xref>). The evolution of the content of moulds and yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1082013211414208">Figure 6(b)</xref>) showed a similar behaviour, with levels close to the initial ones up to day 4 in the less permeable film. The CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations reached inside the bags (0.7 mL/100 mL) could probably have a fungistatic effect, as it has been suggested by some authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013211414208">Carlin et al., 1990</xref>). From day 7 in the film PA 120 and from day 4 in the film PA 240, the levels of moulds and yeasts increased. The lactic microflora (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1082013211414208">Figure 6(c)</xref>) remained close to the initial values during the first week of storage in both films and then considerably increased after 10 days. The differences between the films were not significant. However, one of the main concerns about the use of treatments for extending the shelf life of RTU products associated to the use of high levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and low levels of O<sub>2</sub> is that these treatments can create favourable environments for the development of pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1082013211414208">Rico et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1082013211414208">Rosnes et al., 2003</xref>).

<p>The best condition to obtain Cadenera segments by enzymatic peeling was: 1 mL/L of Peelzym II, applied at 53 kPa with three vacuum pulses of 2 min and a subsequent period of 30 min in the enzymatic solution at atmospheric pressure. The enzymatic peeling did not affect the antioxidant capacity of the segments, reduced the microbial flora and increased the orange colour. The segments packaged in atmospheres slightly enriched with CO<sub>2</sub> (0.2–0.7 mL/100 mL) had a shelf life of 7 days, because after 10 days of storage, and especially with higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub> (1.17 ± 0.31 mL/100 mL), the antioxidant capacity of the segments significantly decreased, the weight of loss increased, the microbial contamination increased and loss of aroma occurred.</p></sec>
