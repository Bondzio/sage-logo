<p><italic>Wearing My Tutu to Analysis and Other Stories</italic> is both a delightful title and a very useful and well-written book. Three practicing psychoanalysts—Kerry Malawista, Anne Adelman, and Catherine Anderson—have gathered stories and vignettes from their own lives and used them as brief introductions to core psychodynamic concepts, which they then explicate in greater detail. In so doing, they have developed a very clear and reader-friendly way of exploring a wide range of complex principles and examples of psychoanalytic theory and practice. The authors do intend to present not a comprehensive overview of psychoanalytic thinking, but rather a method that engages the reader.</p>
<p>This book could be useful as an aid in psychoanalytic education. Experienced analysts know this material and may forget how complex and confusing much of it may be to beginning students. I am currently scheduled to teach a course in psychoanalytic technique to a group of young therapists, many just out of training. They are all smart and eager, but pressed for time and relatively unfamiliar with psychoanalytic thinking. As I read this book, I found myself musing about which chapters would be useful as illustrative introductions to complex ideas. We are all appealed to by stories: introducing potentially disturbing concepts, such as castration anxiety, incest, boundary violations, and self-destructive behavior through personal vignettes humanizes and softens their emotional impact.</p>
<p>The book is divided into five parts: psychoanalytic theory, developmental concepts, clinical technique, treatment challenges, and stories of overwhelming loss and trauma. Part One, on theory, elucidates such concepts as screen memories, magical thinking, dream theory, superego development, and transference-countertransference enactments. The last vignette in this section is the title story: “Wearing My Tutu to Analysis.” In the story an analysand has a conflict. Her father, to whom she is very attached, is to be given an award an hour after the end of one of her analytic sessions. She doesn’t want to wear her party dress (the “tutu”) to analysis, or to cancel her appointment. Since she has only an hour between the two events, she decides to change into the dress in the analyst’s bathroom once the session is over. She doesn’t tell the analyst her plan. She tells us in advance that her father always admired her ballet outfits and would tell her how pretty her dresses were. Predictably (perhaps) she changes into her dress, only to find that she has locked her keys in her car in the process and now will have to return to the analyst’s office to call a locksmith. At that moment, she can think of no other solution. When she reappears at the analyst’s office, he comments, “My, what a pretty party dress!” This vignette sets the stage for a very convincing discussion of transference wishes, countertransference feelings, and the enactments that may ensue.</p>
<p>The authors begin by elaborating the development of transference understanding, starting with Freud’s view that the patient repeats <italic>actual</italic> childhood conflicts with the analyst. They compare his view to our more contemporary understanding—that the transference is a melding of the past with current unconscious fantasies in the patient’s psyche. They go on to discuss the feelings that develop in the analyst’s mind in response to the patient—the countertransference. When the countertransference becomes sufficiently powerful, it can be expressed as an enactment on the analyst’s part. In this example the analyst’s reaction to his patient’s powerful wish that he love and admire her is expressed in his reaction to her appearance in her “tutu”—“My, what a pretty party dress!” The humor and vividness of this story convey to beginning students both the intensity and the likelihood of such interactions.</p>
<p>Part Two illustrates elements of development—the phenomenon of transitional objects and spaces, castration anxiety, adolescence and the development of sexuality, the transition to adulthood, and motherhood as a developmental phase. I found the stories in this section charming and moving, particularly “Ode to a Tissue,” which deals with a transitional object in the life of an infant, and “Mommy Broke It,” which describes a three-year-old boy’s castration anxiety and his parents’ tactful responses.</p>
<p>Part Three deals with difficult problems of technique: beginning treatment with a withdrawn child, creating a holding environment with a shy and developmentally delayed child, the power of interpretation and insight on a chronically negative patient, and issues surrounding termination.</p>
<p>I found the chapter on interpretation and insight particularly powerful and potentially quite useful as a teaching tool. In this vignette a young therapist, working in a clinic setting, inherits a very difficult and demanding patient. Over time she realizes that the patient, who generally speaks freely, does not talk about a developmentally delayed younger brother who drowned in a public swimming pool while in her care. The patient blames herself and remains stuck in a mire of guilt and anger that precludes therapeutic progress. As the therapist gradually and patiently wins the patient’s trust, the patient is able to talk more about her brother. In the midst of describing his drowning, she suddenly remembers something that shows that the accident was not her fault. Although this realization does not produce an instantaneous cure, it reveals the patient’s lifelong need to protect her mother (whose inattention was the actual cause of the drowning) and forever punish <italic>herself</italic>. It is the beginning of a series of insights that gradually lead to improvement. This kind of “recovered” memory does not happen often, but can be very powerful when it does. The reader is dramatically shown the value of careful and extended analytic work.</p>
<p>Part Four deals with various treatment challenges: the powerful countertransference pressures that arise in dealing with a chronically self-destructive patient, racial tensions arising between analyst and patient, and the effect of boundary violations on a patient’s treatment. This last vignette is powerful and disturbing.</p>
<p>A young woman envies her best friend Fiona’s relationship with a male analyst and deeply wishes he could be <italic>her</italic> analyst too. She knows this is neither legitimate nor advisable, yet she pursues the possibility until the analyst agrees to take her on as a patient while her friend is still terminating with him. This first boundary crossing by the analyst is followed by a cascade of further violations. After becoming deeply involved in treatment, the patient learns that her analyst and Fiona have fallen in love and that he is leaving his wife. The patient is devastated when the analyst attributes <italic>her</italic> distress to the conflict between psychoanalysis and reality. She leaves this treatment and makes frequent attempts with other analysts, none of which work out for her. It is only when a no-nonsense female analyst points out the vengeful quality of her carrying her story “all over town” that the patient is able to contain her rage and work through the trauma of what happened in her first analysis. This kind of analytic misbehavior is not easy to write about, and it is to the patient’s credit that she was able to work it out and continue her professional development.</p>
<p>The final part of the book—“When the World Shatters”—focuses on three traumatic occurrences in the lives of both analysts and patients: abuse and incest, the transgenerational transmission of trauma (as in children and grandchildren of Holocaust survivors), and the loss of a child, a tragedy from which few people fully recover.</p>
<p>All of these stories are clearly written and followed by sophisticated clinical and theoretical discussions. They reel the reader in, eager to find out what happens and how to understand the theoretical meanings and ramifications. Another appealing quality of the book is that, though it has three authors, there are no jarring stylistic transitions. It all flows.</p>
