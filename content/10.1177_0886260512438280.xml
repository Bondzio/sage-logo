<abstract>
<p>Although there has been an increase in research on sex offenders’ modus operandi, geographic decision making, and hunting behavior, most studies still tend to emphasize criminal motivation while overlooking the role of situational and environmental factors. Studies of mixed samples of rapists and child molesters typically neglect to conduct comparative analyses. Consequently, the full nature of their distinction is not clear. This is particularly problematic for the understanding of crossover or polymorphous sex offenders, who target victims from various age groups. Using a sample of 216 incarcerated sexual offenders, hunting behavior patterns were identified and tested to establish which hunting behavior patterns were associated with each type of offender. Relationships between modus operandi, geographic decision making, and hunting behavior were also examined. Three types of offender were identified: (a) manipulative; (b) opportunist; and (c) coercive. The manipulative offender is typically a child molester. The coercive offender is typically a rapist. The opportunist offender includes both rapists and child molesters. These findings emphasize the relevance of polymorphous, crossover, or versatile sex offenders and suggest new ways of conceptualizing sex offenders and their study.</p>

<p>Violent criminals are predators—they search for human victims in manners similar to carnivores hunting for animal prey. And like wildlife, they employ various hunting styles in their efforts to seek out and attack victims.</p>

<p>Sex offenders were traditionally described as irrational individuals, with low self-control, who committed impulsive crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512438280">Simon &amp; Zgoba, 2006</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated that they are, in fact, decision makers and act in a rational, though sometimes bounded, manner during the commission of their crimes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512438280">Beauregard &amp; Leclerc, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512438280">Beauregard, Proulx, Rossmo, Leclerc, &amp; Allaire, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512438280">Beauregard, Rossmo, &amp; Proulx, 2007</xref>). This is also true of their victim selection process, namely the victim (or target) acquisition stage of the crime (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512438280">Felson &amp; Massoglia, 2011</xref>). Like animal predators in the wild, they search for targets to victimize and gain profit from (e.g., sexual gratification) and attack them in the most effective way possible, from a rational standpoint. In this sense, sex offenders actively hunt for victims and act as human predators (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512438280">Rossmo, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Underlying the human offender’s hunting process is a complex decision making process, composed of various stages, each of which demanding a number of assessments and choices. This process is influenced not only by the offender’s individual characteristics and activities but also by the victim’s characteristics and activities, by the environment, and by situational cues. The analysis of the criminal hunt must, therefore, consider all these factors as well as their interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">Rossmo, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">Rossmo (2000)</xref>, hunting for humans largely resembles the search for other criminal targets, but the offender is faced with two complicating factors: (a) people move about and (b) they must be controlled. Thus, the offender needs to use search and attack methods that address these issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512438280">Rossmo (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">2000</xref>) developed a hunting typology, similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512438280">Schaller’s (1972)</xref> description of the hunting methods used by the Serengeti lions and to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512438280">Bennett and Wright’s (1984)</xref> burglar typology of planners, searchers, and opportunists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512438280">Rossmo, 2006</xref>), where he identified four victim search methods: (a) hunter, (b) poacher, (c) troller, and (d) trapper. <italic>Hunters</italic> specifically set out to search for a victim, basing the search from their home base and searching through areas in their awareness space that they believe contain suitable targets. Their crimes are confined to their city of residence. <italic>Poachers</italic>, on the other hand, commute or travel outside of their home city or base their search for targets on an activity site other than their residence. <italic>Trollers</italic> are opportunistic offenders who encounter their victims during the course of their routine activities. Their crimes are often spontaneous, but many offenders have fantasized and planned their crimes in advance so they are prepared when an opportunity presents itself (premeditated opportunism). Finally, <italic>trappers</italic> have an occupation or position where potential victims come to them, or, by means of subterfuge, entice victims into their home or other location they control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512438280">Rossmo, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In his hunting typology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512438280">Rossmo (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">2000</xref>) isolated three victim attack methods: (a) raptor, (b) stalker, and (c) ambusher. <italic>Raptors</italic> attack their victims almost immediately upon encounter, whereas <italic>stalkers</italic> follow and watch their targets, moving into the victim’s activity space, and wait for an opportune moment to strike. <italic>Ambushers</italic> attack victims they have brought to some place where they have a great deal of control, such as their residence or workplace. Although offenders may use different hunting methods, there is a tendency for them to adopt and stay with one, or at the most two approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512438280">Rossmo, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">2000</xref>).</p>
<p>To complement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512438280">Rossmo’s (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">2000</xref>) hunting patterns, the concept of <italic>hunting process</italic> was developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512438280">Beauregard, Proulx, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512438280">Beauregard, Rossmo, et al., 2007</xref>), incorporating hunting patterns as well as cognitive, behavioral, and geographic aspects. From a rational choice perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438280">Beauregard, Rossmo, et al. (2007b)</xref> identified a descriptive model composed of nine phases: (a) routine activities of offenders and victims; (b) choice of hunting field; (c) victim selection; (d) method of approach; (e) attack location choice; (f) method to bring victims to crime sites; (g) crime location choice; (h) method to commit the crime; and (i) victim release location choice.</p>
<p>The hunting process model provides a comprehensive approach to the relationship between the geographic and behavioral components of the sexual assault. While demonstrating that not all sex offenders hunt for victims in the same manner, the model shows that the decision making surrounding the hunting process varies according to the offender’s strategy, the type of victim and the victim’s reaction, the situational context of the crime and the environment, in direct accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512438280">Rossmo’s (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">2000</xref>) hunting pattern typology and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512438280">Brantingham &amp; Brantingham’s (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512438280">1993</xref>) dynamic target site selection model.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886260512438280">
<title>Aim of the Study</title>
<p>Several typological models (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438280">Groth, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512438280">1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512438280">Hazelwood, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512438280">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438280">Knight &amp; Prentky, 1990</xref>) have been developed in an effort to better understand the complex dynamics of the offending process in sex crimes. These approaches, in general, present several limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512438280">Beauregard, 2005</xref>), as they (a) neglect to consider the whole of the criminal event (offender, victim, and context); (b) assume the offending process is stable; (c) assume the offenders’ personal characteristics are the main influencing factors; (d) assume the specialization of sex offenders; (e) lack detail, as they fail to capture the complexity of each phase of the offending process; (f) neglect to include geographic factors; and (g) do not explore the underlying decision making.</p>
<p>Despite the increase in research on sex offenders’ modus operandi, geographic decision making, and hunting behavior, most studies still emphasize criminal motivation while overlooking the role of situational and environmental factors. Rapists’ modus operandi, geographic decision making, and hunting behavior have been documented, but the same is not true for child molesters. Furthermore, studies of mixed samples typically neglect to conduct comparative analyses.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to examine and compare the hunting behavior and modus operandi of rapists and child molesters. For this purpose, we will attempt to identify hunting behavior patterns in a mixed sample of rapists and child molesters and then test which hunting behavior patterns are associated with each type of offender. Finally, we will examine the relationships between the modus operandi characteristics and geographic decision making process and the emerging hunting behavior patterns.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the operational definition of <italic>predator</italic> used in this study corresponds to the one used in environmental criminology, more specifically by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512438280">Rossmo (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">2000</xref>) and not to any other classifications, namely legal ones. Hence, for the purposes of this study, in order for a sex offender to be considered a predator, he does not need to commit serial offenses but rather to behave in a predatory fashion in locating and gaining access to his victims. An offense is considered predatory in nature whenever there is evidence that the offender engaged in active, deliberate victim search and attack behavior, instrumental in nature, seeking specifically to gain profit, namely, sexual gratification, at the victim’s expense (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512438280">Rossmo, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample for this study included 216 incarcerated offenders, convicted for sexual offenses involving direct physical contact with a total of 351 victims. In all cases, there was evidence of some form of predatory behavior, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512438280">Rossmo (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">2000</xref>) in his hunting typology. Offenders whose crimes did not involve direct physical contact and/or hunting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512438280">Rossmo, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">2000</xref>) were excluded from this study (<italic>n</italic> = 84). Only 20.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 44) of these offenders were serial offenders, that is, had sexually assaulted two or more victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512438280">Ressler, Burgess, &amp; Douglas, 1992</xref>). For the purposes of this study, the rapist group included all offenders whose victims were 14 years old or older, and the child molester group was composed of those offenders whose victims were 13 years old or younger. All offenders in this sample were male Portuguese nationals.</p>
<p>At the time of the crime, more than half the rapists (62.1%; <italic>n</italic> = 54) and child molesters (50.4%; <italic>n</italic> = 65) were single. Most rapists (65.5%; <italic>n</italic> = 57) and child molesters (62%; <italic>n</italic> = 80) were employed. The average age of offenders at the time of the crime was 30.9 years (standard deviation [<italic>SD</italic>] = 11.2) for rapists and 39.7 (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.9) for child molesters. The average age of the rapists’ victims was 33.9 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 18.9), while that of the child molesters’ victims was 8.9 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.0). Only 17.2% (<italic>n</italic> = 15) of the rapists and 10.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 13) of the child molesters had previous psychiatric diagnoses. Rapists were more likely than child molesters to suffer from personality disorders, especially antisocial personality disorder (χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.864, <italic>p</italic> = .049). The majority of rapists (66.7%, <italic>n</italic> = 58) and child molesters (77.5%, <italic>n</italic> = 100) did not have a criminal record.</p>

<sec id="section4-0886260512438280">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Data for this study were gathered using an instrument built to collect information from the participants’ institutional records and to help guide in-depth semistructured interviews with the participants. This instrument was based on the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (VICAP) crime analysis report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512438280">Ressler et al., 1992</xref>) and on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">Rossmo’s (2000)</xref> data coding forms and permits the collection of information on precrime factors, hunting process, modus operandi, postcrime factors, and geographic behavior. Institutional records include detailed information on the participants’ sociodemographic background, criminal record, and prison behavior as well as all the proceedings included in the sentencing. Due to inconsistencies and discrepancies between the data collected from institutional records and from the interviews, namely, the underreporting of past offenses, minimization, and/or denial of index offenses, among others, the decision was made to use only institutional record data. All data for this study were collected and coded by the first author, closely following the original descriptions made by the authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512438280">Ressler et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">Rossmo, 2000</xref>) of all the variables, in an effort to ensure the ratings were reliable and reproducible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0886260512438280">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>For the purpose of identifying hunting behavior patterns in this mixed sample of rapists and child molesters, a TwoStep Cluster analysis was performed. The Schwarz Bayesian Criterion (BIC) was used to determine the optimal number of clusters.</p>
<p>Eight variables were used to identify hunting behavior patterns, five of which were dichotomous (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>): (a) structured premeditation; (b) stranger victim; (c) nonrandom/patterned victim selection; (d) kidnap style attack; and (e) vehicle used. Strategies used by the offender to first approach the victim (0 = <italic>manipulative</italic>, 1 = <italic>coercive</italic>, 2 = <italic>nonpersuasive</italic>) was also added to describe the sex offenders’ hunting behavior patterns. Finally, Rossmo’s hunting pattern typology, which includes the victim search methods (0 = <italic>hunter</italic>, 1 = <italic>poacher</italic>, 2 = <italic>troller</italic>, 3 = <italic>trapper</italic>) and the attack methods (0 = <italic>raptor</italic>, 1 = <italic>stalker</italic>, 2 = <italic>ambusher</italic>), was included. This typology applies to both serial and first-time offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438280">Beauregard, Rebocho, &amp; Rossmo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">Rossmo, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Modus operandi characteristics were examined through 7 variables: (a) weapon use during the crime (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>), (b) level of physical force used by the offender to commit the crime (0 = <italic>no force</italic>, 1 = <italic>minimum force</italic>, 2 = <italic>more than necessary</italic>), (c) relation to victim (0 = <italic>nonhostile</italic>, 1 = <italic>hostile</italic>), (d) type of sexual act committed to the victim (0 = <italic>sexual contacts</italic>, 1 = <italic>penetration</italic>, 2 = <italic>penetration and sexual contacts</italic>), (e) offender forced the victim to commit sexual acts (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>), (f) level of risk (0 = <italic>low</italic>, 1 = <italic>high</italic>), and (g) physical harm done to the victim (0 = <italic>no harm</italic>, 1 = <italic>physical harm</italic>, 2 = <italic>death</italic>).</p>
<p>Geographic decision making was assessed through 13 variables. The choice of a residential area (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>), the choice of type of place (0 = <italic>inside</italic>, 1 = <italic>outside</italic>, 2 = <italic>in a vehicle</italic>), and the choice of the victim or offender residence as a location (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>), were investigated for encounter, attack, crime, and victim release site locations. Finally, a variable measured if offenders chose to commit their crime at multiple locations (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>).</p>
<p>Relationships between hunting behavior patterns and type of offender (rapists and child molesters), between modus operandi characteristics and hunting behavior patterns, and between hunting behavior and geographic decision making variables were tested using simple chi-square statistics.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512438280">Table 1</xref>, a three-cluster solution emerged from the TwoStep Cluster analysis: <italic>manipulative</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 112), <italic>opportunist</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 43), and <italic>coercive</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 61). The cluster labels were chosen after a careful process of semantic inclusion and elimination according to the emerging cluster solution characteristic. The selected labels were found by the authors to most adequately reflect the most relevant features of each cluster, namely, the mixed nature of the type labeled as <italic>opportunist</italic>, whose features liken it to what has been described in previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438280">Beauregard et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Manipulative offenders carefully premeditate their crimes and exhibit a nonrandom, patterned victim-selection process. These offenders do not target strangers. Their preferred hunting styles are the trapper and the troller, and their typical attack method is the ambusher. These offenders encounter suitable victims through their routine activities and/or occupation and set up an ambush at a location where they have a great deal of control. Usually they opt for a nonpersuasive approach, defined by the absence of a particular strategy and direct action on the victim (e.g., engaging in sexual activity without initial interaction with the victim), but they may also use a manipulative strategy, bribing or tricking the victim. Manipulative offenders do not kidnap their victims nor use a vehicle in the commission of the crime.</p>
<p>Opportunist offenders show little concern for premeditation and victim selection and may target strangers as well as known victims. They mainly use a poacher hunting style but may also resort to hunter or troller styles. Preferentially, they use the ambusher attack method but may also use the raptor, attacking the victim on encounter. Their typical approach is manipulative, although they may also opt for a nonpersuasive strategy. These offenders usually kidnap their victims and use a vehicle in the commission of the crime (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512438280">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Coercive offenders do not premeditate their offenses. They do not select their victims and generally target strangers. Their usual hunting style is the hunter, but they may also use the poacher. These offenders are typically stalkers, following the victim on encounter and waiting for the right moment to attack, although they may also opt for a raptor attack. Their approach is characteristically coercive, verbally or physically forcing the victim, and they are likely to kidnap their victims and use a vehicle in the commission of the crime (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512438280">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260512438280">Table 2</xref> shows that child molesters are more likely to be manipulative offenders, whereas rapists are more likely to be coercive offenders. The opportunist type includes both rapists and child molesters, in relatively similar proportions.</p>

<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260512438280">Table 3</xref>, manipulative offenders are most likely to not use physical force in the commission of their crime and to not use a weapon.

<p>Opportunist offenders are not likely to use a weapon for the commission of the offense, relying most frequently on the use of physical force. They are likely to establish a hostile relationship with the victim and to inflict severe harm. These offenders are not likely to force the victim to commit sexual acts, penetration likely being the only sexual act performed on the victim. They are the least likely to expose themselves to high risks in committing the offense (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260512438280">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Coercive offenders, however, are most likely to use a weapon in the commission of the crime as well as physical force; they are also most likely to establish a hostile relationship and to inflict severe harm to the victim. These offenders are least likely to force the victim to commit sexual acts, penetration being most likely the only sexual act performed on the victim. They are likely to expose themselves to high risks of apprehension, although less than manipulative offenders (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260512438280">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0886260512438280">Table 4</xref>, offenders who encounter the victim, attack, commit the crime, and release the victim in a residential area are more likely to present a manipulative hunting behavior pattern than an opportunist or a coercive one. The decision to encounter, attack, commit the crime, and release the victim in an inside location is also more likely for manipulative offenders. These offenders are most likely to opt for encountering, attacking, committing the crime, and releasing the victim in the victim or the offender’s residence. Opportunist offenders are most likely to use multiple crime scene locations in the commission of their crime.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study allowed for the distinction of three types of sexual offenders: (a) manipulative, (b) opportunist, and (c) coercive.</p>
<sec id="section8-0886260512438280">
<title>Manipulative Sex Offenders</title>
<p>Child molesters are more likely to be manipulative offenders. Their hunting behavior involves careful premeditation and a nonrandom, patterned victim-selection process. These offenders do not target strangers; instead, they select known victims, with whom they have established some previous relationship, ranging from casual neighborly acquaintances to close relatives. Their preferred hunting styles are the trapper and the troller, and their typical attack method is the ambusher. Having encountered their victims in the course of their routine activities, they proceed to lure them to a location where they have a great deal of control.</p>
<p>The nature of the links between the child molesters’ modus operandi and the crime location has not been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512438280">Leclerc, Beauregard, &amp; Proulx, 2008</xref>), although it has been demonstrated that most child molesters offend close to their residence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512438280">Beauregard, Proulx, &amp; Rossmo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438280">Duwe, Donnay, &amp; Tewksbury, 2008</xref>). Sexual offenses against children occur mostly in private places such as the offender’s residence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438280">Duwe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512438280">Elliott, Browne, &amp; Kilcoyne, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512438280">Lang &amp; Frenzel, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438280">Leclerc, Wortley, &amp; Smallbone, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512438280">Wortley &amp; Smallbone, 2006</xref>), the victim’s residence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512438280">Elliott et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512438280">Lang &amp; Frenzel, 1988</xref>), an isolated place in the victim’s residence, and at a friend’s or relative’s home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512438280">Wortley &amp; Smallbone, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The crime location is relevant in understanding the strategies adopted by sex offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438280">Leclerc et al., 2010</xref>). Offenders using manipulative strategies are more likely to commit their crimes in indoor locations familiar to them than those resorting to coercive or nonpersuasive strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512438280">Beauregard, Proulx, et al., 2007</xref>). Our results are congruent with these findings, as manipulative offenders are most likely to encounter, attack, commit the crime, and release the victim in a residential area, at an indoors location, most often the offender or the victim’s residence.</p>
<p>Typically, manipulative offenders opt for a nonpersuasive approach, although they may also use a manipulative strategy. Offenders who sexually abuse older victims are more likely to use a manipulative rather than a persuasive strategy: it may not be necessary for offenders to resort to a manipulative strategy with younger victims, as the younger the victim, the more successful nonpersuasive strategies are likely to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512438280">Leclerc, Carpentier, &amp; Proulx, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>These offenders do neither kidnap their victims nor use a vehicle in the commission of the crime. Their victims are close to them, relationally and spatially, facilitating the success of more subtle, manipulative strategies, suggestive of a more sophisticated modus operandi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512438280">Kaufman et al., 1996</xref>). These offenders are most likely to not use physical force and to not use a weapon; accordingly, they are not likely to inflict severe harm to their victims. Their relationship with the victims is most often of a nonhostile nature. The offender’s prior relationship with the victim makes it easier for her to trust and obey him, even more so if he is in a position of authority due to family ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512438280">Kaufman et al., 1998</xref>) or for professional reasons.</p>
<p>This type of offender is not likely to force the victim to commit sexual acts, and penetration is not likely to be the only sexual act performed on the victim, most often being associated with, or even substituted by, other sexual contacts. This may be related to the victim’s age, physical and sexual development, as well as the offender’s own desire or need, or the victim’s sexual inexperience and lack of aptitude to perform sexual acts in a way that would be satisfactory to the offender.</p>
<p>These offenders are likely to expose themselves to high risks of apprehension for the commission of the crime. This may be related not only to a measure of “bounded rationality” but also to a lack of self-control, due to the offenders’ personality or the severity of their sexual deviance, that leads them to make “erroneous” decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512438280">Cornish &amp; Clarke, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512438280">Simon &amp; Zgoba, 2006</xref>). There is also the possibility that what appeared to be a low-risk opportunity structure when first evaluated suddenly changed due to unexpected events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512438280">Beauregard &amp; Leclerc, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0886260512438280">
<title>Opportunist Sex Offenders</title>
<p>The opportunist type includes both rapists and child molesters in relatively similar proportions. We hypothesize that these are mostly polymorphous or crossover offenders. “Sexual polymorphism refers to crime-switching patterns along several dimensions such as victim’s age, gender, relationship to the offender, and nature of acts committed by the offender” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512438280">Lussier, Leclerc, Healey, &amp; Proulx, 2008</xref>, p. 98).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512438280">Guay, Proulx, Cusson, and Ouimet (2001)</xref> found much stability as to the victim’s gender, but considerable versatility as to the victim’s age, especially for those targeting adolescents. These offenders were likely to switch either to adults or to children, adolescent victims probably acting as a sex surrogate choice when the preferred partner type was not available.</p>
<p>Offenders who target victims regardless of their age may be overall versatile offenders who, having low self-control, are unable to resist crime opportunities as they present themselves. To satisfy their immediate needs, they exploit every available target or victim. This phenomenon does not appear to be totally random; rather, it seems that offenders try to satisfy their needs with a victim that most closely resembles their preferred victims in terms of physical attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512438280">Lussier et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Opportunist offenders show little concern for crime premeditation and victim selection and may target strangers as well as known victims. They exhibit, thus, a measure of versatility, and it appears that opportunity, rather than victim characteristics, plays a decisive role in target selection. These offenders use a poacher hunting style but may also resort to hunter or troller styles. Preferentially they use the ambusher attack method but may also resort to the raptor, attacking the victim on encounter. Their typical approach is manipulative, although they may also opt for a nonpersuasive strategy. The choice of attack method and approach is likely to be associated with the characteristics of the encounter location as well as the victim’s own characteristic, namely, age and physical build, among other environmental and situational factors.</p>
<p>These offenders usually kidnap their victims and use a vehicle in the commission of the crime, which is consistent with their victim search and attack methods as well as their approach. Typically, poachers travel longer distances in search for a victim, often travelling to other cities—for this, a vehicle is convenient, if not necessary. Similarly, ambushers are more successful if they have a vehicle in which to transport the victim to his location of choice. To lure the victim into the vehicle, the offender may resort to a manipulative approach, such as offering her a ride, or to a nonpersuasive approach, simply pulling her into the vehicle. Opportunist offenders are most likely to use multiple crime scene locations in the commission of their crime.</p>
<p>Opportunist offenders are not likely to use a weapon for the commission of the offense, relying most frequently on the use of physical force. This could be due to lack of premeditation: not having thought out the crime, the offender fails to consider the use of a gun, and therefore does not carry one with him. During the commission of the crime, they are likely to establish a hostile relationship with the victim and to inflict severe harm. Referring to child molesters, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438280">Ouimet and Proulx (1994)</xref> consider that the level of violence used in the commission of the crime is positively associated with the distance traveled by the offender from his home to the victim. The further he travels, the harder it becomes to convince a child to return to his residence, as few are willing to take a car trip with a stranger. He must, therefore, use a more direct approach, which frequently leads to an increase in the level of violence used during the crime.</p>
<p>These offenders are not likely to force the victim to commit sexual acts, penetration likely being the only sexual act performed on the victim. This is congruent with the immediate satisfaction of the offender’s needs, using a sex surrogate rather than an ideal victim, in the context of a crime of opportunity. This is the least likely of the three types of offender to expose himself to high risks in committing the offense, which may be the result of a successful risk evaluation when considering the different locations used to commit the crime. By selecting low-risk (e.g., remote) crime locations, easily accessible by using a vehicle, the offender is able to minimize the risks of apprehension.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0886260512438280">
<title>Coercive Sex Offenders</title>
<p>Rapists are more likely to be coercive offenders. These offenders do neither premeditate their offenses nor select their victims, and generally target strangers. Their usual hunting style is the hunter, but they may also use the poacher. These offenders are typically stalkers, following the victim on encounter and waiting for the right moment to attack, a time and place where the risks will be lower and any guardians will be absent, although they may also opt for a raptor attack and attack the victim immediately on encounter. Opportunity and encounter location characteristics will likely play an important role in the offender’s decision for one of these two attack methods. Their approach is characteristically coercive, verbally or physically forcing the victim, which is congruent with the victim’s age group. The fact that these offenders are likely to kidnap their victims and use a vehicle in the commission of the crime makes the option for coercive approach even clearer, from a cost/efficiency point of view. Unless the adult victim has some added vulnerability, associated with old age, deficiency, or intoxication, sophistication and skill would be necessary to lure her to the vehicle by means of manipulation.</p>
<p>Coercive offenders are most likely to use a weapon in the commission of the crime, as well as physical force, adding to the efficiency of their coercive approach. The offenders’ relationship with the victim is likely to be hostile, in accordance with their physically and verbally coercive approach and crime commission strategies, and they are likely to inflict severe harm to the victim. This is the most violent of the three types.</p>
<p>These offenders are least likely to force the victim to commit sexual acts, penetration being most likely the only sexual act performed on the victim. Their victim search and attack method, as well as their use of only one location to commit the crime, suggest that these offenses are relatively short in duration. This time factor, associated with the resistance potentially offered by an adult victim, makes it reasonable to assume that there would not be much opportunity to perform other sexual acts, at least not without increasing the risks of apprehension. Furthermore, and in keeping with the rational choice approach, the offender’s immediate need for sexual gratification and/or dominance may be satisfied by the penetration alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512438280">Clarke &amp; Felson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438280">Cornish &amp; Clarke, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Results show that geographic decision making is consistent across encounter, attack, crime, and victim release locations, coherent with the type of locations, and significantly different between types: the opportunist will typically have several crime scene locations, whereas the other two types tend to have only one. Moreover, our results are in direct accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512438280">Rossmo’s (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">2000</xref>) hunting typology.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study allows for a better understanding of the relationships between the geographic and the behavioral components of the sexual assault. It permits the examination of relevant components of the offending process of sex offenders, by looking at the hunting behavior in detail, as a specific process of the offending process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512438280">Beauregard, Rossmo, et al., 2007</xref>). Not only from a research standpoint but also for criminal investigation and especially offender profiling, these results are both interesting and valuable as they allow for a more comprehensive analysis of the sexual criminal event and, therefore, for the development of more effective prevention and intervention strategies, namely target hardening resulting from target displacement due to police activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">Rossmo, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the hunting behavior of rapists had been previously documented, the same is not true of child molesters. This study applied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512438280">Rossmo’s (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512438280">2000</xref>) hunting typology to child molesters and performed a comparison between rapists and child molesters as far as their hunting behavior, their modus operandi, and their geographic decision making are concerned. It also permitted the identification of a “third type” or a “mixed type” of sex offenders, polymorphous, crossover, or versatile, hence contributing to the sexual offender “specialization” debate.</p>
<p>This study is not without limitations. Not much is known about the external validity of these results, as incarcerated sex offenders’ behavior may differ from that of those perpetrators who have not been apprehended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512438280">Petrosino &amp; Brensilber, 2003</xref>). Another limitation derives from the chosen approach, looking specifically at situational factors. In future studies, both personal and situational factors should be incorporated. Furthermore, to fully understand the offender’s behavior, the victim’s behavior must also be examined. The offenders’ modus operandi, sexual behavior, and victim participation during the sexual assault may be best viewed as interdependent events in the offense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512438280">Leclerc &amp; Tremblay, 2007</xref>). Person–situation interaction is crucial for the understanding of the decision making of sex offenders while committing their crime and challenges the view of personality as consistent across different situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512438280">Mischel, 1999</xref>).</p>
