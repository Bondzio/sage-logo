<abstract>
<p>This article explores foster children’s agency in their encounters with Child Protection Services (CPS). The article draws on semi-structured interviews with former and present foster children aged 18–22, who have grown up in kinship foster homes in state custody. During their childhood, there has been increased emphasis on client participation within CPS. Based on a sociological framework we understand the relationship between CPS and its clients as an asymmetric power relation. The analyses demonstrate that foster children in kinship care are actors with different motivations and competencies for participation and co-determination within CPS. We point out four types of agency, which range from the agent as an equal, active participant in a cooperative relationship with CPS – to the agent as a powerless client in a relationship marked by distrust.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1473325011428187" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>During the past twenty years, discourses about children as social actors and children’s right to participation have received increasing international attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011428187">Kjørholt, 2004</xref>). This also pertains to the Child Protection System (hereafter referred to as CPS)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1473325011428187">1</xref></sup> in Norway – and other Western countries where social work models are introduced in order to increase children’s participation and co-determination. This study investigates what type of agency foster children exercise in their encounters with CPS.</p>
<p>The participants in this study have spent a large part of their childhoods in state custody in kinship foster homes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1473325011428187">2</xref></sup> CPS has thereby had the formal responsibility for their care, and had great significance in their childhoods. The study explores a type of childhood that has been managed and supported by public authorities to a greater extent than what is normal in our society. Foster home placement, even of the type presented here, in which the foster parents are the children’s relatives, is based on formalized contracts between CPS and the foster parents. This contractual relationship includes agreements and conditions linked to economic compensation, control of care within the foster family, duration of the contract and the amount of contact between the children and their parents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1473325011428187">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The relationship between CPS and its clients can be described as a power relationship, in terms of structural power, intellectual power, and symbolic power. This formal, hierarchical, and institutional power is confirmed by legislation that gives CPS the authority to impose measures on families. This position of power includes control of material and professional resources. The relationship between the CPS social worker and the child, as a CPS client, can be described as an asymmetrical power relationship, in that the CPS represents a form of ‘expert knowledge’, and manages dominant ideas about ‘the child’s best interest’. In the encounter between the social worker and the individual child, age also constitutes an element of power.</p>
<p>Structural conditions constitute the frameworks within which it is possible for agents to act. These frameworks work to activate certain types of behaviour and affect the actors’ positions. Positions refer to how the actors perceive the situation, the other person, and how they themselves wish to be perceived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325011428187">Moe, 1994</xref>: 209). Our perspective is that these frameworks do not determine the relations, but provide different possibilities and limitations for the foster child’s agency and positioning. Thus, despite the structural power, the relationship between CPS and foster children cannot be analysed unilaterally as a power-powerless one, where the foster child lacks co-determination by being subject to the decisions of CPS. Power cannot be reduced to a localized starting point from which it is exercised. According to Foucault, power is decentralized and productive in the sense that, rather than restricting others, it encourages certain patterns of thought and action and motivates the individuals themselves to adopt particular positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473325011428187">Mik-Meyer and Villadsen, 2007</xref>: 17). Our starting point in analysing this material is that power in various forms is present, and influences the interaction between the foster child and the CPS social worker. This is the case, whether we conceive power in terms of public institutions representing the state as the centre of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325011428187">Bourdieu and Prieur, 1996</xref>), as creative, disciplinary power as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011428187">Foucault (1999)</xref>, or by focusing on the individual’s power in interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473325011428187">Goffman, 1967</xref>).</p>
<p>According to Järvinen and Mortensen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325011428187">2002</xref>: 10–11), a typical characteristic of power relations in the encounter between a representative of the system and a client, is that they are not necessarily <italic>perceived</italic> as an exercise of power by the involved parties. This is partly due to the fact that decisions are made with the intention of helping the client, and partly because assessments and decisions are considered to be neutral, unbiased, and professional. In contrast to other welfare institutions, we claim that the power relations (the formal/objective power structures) within CPS are more visible, due to this system’s power to make decisions such as whether children are to be placed in foster care, allowed to visit parents etc. In this article, we discuss how foster children position themselves and what type of agency they display in their encounters with the system through representatives of CPS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1473325011428187"><title>Children as social actors situated in time and context</title>
<p>The interviewees grew up between the late 1980s and 2008. State efforts on behalf of children during this period were expanded through welfare reforms, such as the expansion of kindergartens and after-school care, extension of maternity leave, and prolonged school attendance. The implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in Norwegian legislation (in 2003), and the dissemination of the concept of children as active participants were made apparent in a number of projects within different social fields (local political decision-making processes, environmental movements, school and after-school organizations and kindergartens) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011428187">Kjørholt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473325011428187">Mason and Hood, 2011</xref>). The focus on eliciting ‘children’s voices’ – that is increasing the influence of children and youth and their opportunity to articulate their own opinions about circumstances that pertain to them – originated in the Convention’s (Art. 12) demand for children’s participation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1473325011428187">4</xref></sup> Within the field of child welfare, this perspective has been made visible in recent years through the development of guidelines and methods which facilitate and focus on children’s participation. This development must also be viewed as a part of a general tendency of government in Norway to promote various empowering practices through client participation and legal regulation within public health and welfare services. However, internationally, through reviews of country reports, the Committee on the Rights of the Child urges all governments to ensure that legislation is compatible with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and to make children visible in policy development processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1473325011428187">Unicef, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, we build on a concept within the sociology of childhood which understands children as social actors in socially constructed childhoods. Children have an impact on, and are not merely impacted by, their surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473325011428187">Prout, 2002</xref>). Childhood does not exist in a final or identifiable form, but is situated in time and space and is changed at different times and contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011428187">James, Jenks and Prout, 1999</xref>). The aim of the sociology of childhood is to include children and childhood in sociological thought, by viewing children ‘as participant actors in social relations, and childhood as a social group fundamentally implicated in social relation processes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325011428187">Lee, 2001</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>What is key to the understanding of children within the sociology of childhood is the shift from viewing children as ‘becomings’ to children as ‘beings’. ‘Becomings’ refers to the concept of children as emerging adults, but without the skills and knowledge they will have as adults. Socialization is an essential part of this conception, referring to a future-oriented perspective that focuses on what children are going to become (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011428187">James et al., 1999</xref>). In the perspective of children as ‘beings’, the focus is moved to how children as competent actors understand their own lives here and now. The dichotomization of this paired concept has been criticised by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1473325011428187">Uprichard, 2008</xref>). She points out that in the conception of children as ‘beings’, competency is viewed as being independent of context. Being oriented towards the future is also crucial for children as ‘beings’, which she claims gets ignored far too often. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1473325011428187">Uprichard (2008)</xref>, we base our argument on a perspective of children as ‘beings <italic>and</italic> becomings’. An individual’s competency will, regardless of age, be linked to the context in which the person is situated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473325011428187">Solberg, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1473325011428187">Turnbull, Hernández and Reyes, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The basic concept of ‘the actor’ in this study refers to perspectives that view structure both as a condition for – and result of – the actors’ action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011428187">Berger and Luckmann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325011428187">Bourdieu, 1995</xref>). Like other age groups, children are actors who interact with their surroundings, and both influence and are influenced by it in varying degrees. Culturally determined understandings and categorizations of age set the framework for participation in different arenas. The difference between children and other age categories lies ‘in the degree to which children are permitted to act independently by those around them, particularly adults’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011428187">James and James, 2008</xref>: 121). Children’s freedom to participate and their co-determination is thereby largely a question of adults exercising power over children. Consequently, studying how foster children perceive their relationship to CPS means directing our focus at power relations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1473325011428187"><title>Research on childhood, methodology</title>
<p>The concept of children as actors has become significant in the methodology of social science research, primarily through the inclusion of children as informants when the child’s situation and social position are the topics being studied. Children’s perspectives in research emphasize the child as an actor and subject, rather than as an object for research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011428187">James and James, 2008</xref>: 17). Knowledge about childhood is produced ‘from below’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325011428187">Lee, 2001</xref>). Since the latter half of the 1990s, a number of research projects have been conducted where listening to ‘children’s voices’ has been emphasized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473325011428187">Prout, 2002</xref>). This research has produced knowledge about children’s attitudes and experiences, and shows that what children emphasize is not necessarily in accordance with adults’ assessments of children’s experiences and needs. For example, the general adult assumption about children’s need for more ‘quality time’ with their parents is called into question when children’s experiences and desires are examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325011428187">Christensen, 2003</xref>). Another example is studies that investigate children in critical and difficult life situations, where, in contrast to previous dominant assumptions, evidence shows that children can contribute and benefit from participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011428187">Jensen, et al., 2008</xref>). However, children’s experiences and opinions do not represent a collective, uniform, ‘child voice,’ but different childhoods situated in different contexts (class, generation, culture, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011428187">James and James, 2008</xref>: 29–30). Our study represents a contribution from childhoods in kinship foster homes which are characterized by the fact that the public authorities take on responsibilities that are otherwise assigned to parents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1473325011428187"><title>Sample and methodology</title>
<p>The sample is part of a longitudinal study including children, parents, and foster parents in kinship foster care in 2000 and 2008. Seventeen children were interviewed in 2000. This article is based on semi-structured qualitative interviews in 2008 with youth in kinship foster care (10) aged 18 to 22. The interviewees were originally recruited via child protection services all over the country. Enquiries to all the 17 foster children who were interviewed in 2000, as well as everyone else over the age of 18 were made through the address of their foster parents. Twelve agreed to participate (10 kinship and 2 non-kinship), and they were all interviewed. The recruitment procedures may have had an effect on who participated, both in 2000 and 2008. Extensive consent procedures may for example have led to non-participation of children whose parents did not have a permanent address in 2000. In 2008, one reason for the drop-out may have been that some never received the enquiry.</p>
<p>In 2000, an additional nation-wide questionnaire survey was sent out to foster parents and to 124 children in kinship foster homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473325011428187">Holtan, 2002</xref>). The survey gave us insight into the existence and special characteristics of kinship placements. The 17 children who were interviewed in 2000 formed the basis of this interview-study. The interview group had lived for the same length of time and had the same family relationships with the foster parents as the children in the questionnaire group. The interview group was older (4.1 years) at the time of placement than the questionnaire group (2.7 years). Except by age our sample does not differ significantly from the general population in kinship foster homes.</p>
<p>The interview locations were chosen according to the wishes of the interviewees; seven in their own homes and two elsewhere. The interviews, which were taped and transcribed, lasted 50–100 minutes and had a conversational style. The topics of the 2008 interviews were directed towards childhood and adolescence and may thus be said to be partly retrospective; experiences of and views on kinship foster homes, contact with parents and child protection services whilst growing up. The thematic structure also revolved around the present situation and thoughts about the future, the transition to an independent existence, contact with families and foster families, work and education. Through this, the participants’ experiences and contact with CPS became one of the topics that were illuminated, such as reasons for CPS’s decision to assume care, contact with parents and siblings and relationships in their foster family.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1473325011428187"><title>Interviewees</title>
<p>The interviewees: four male and six female, were all in state custody, placed in long-term kinship foster care. Seven of them were between 0 and 4 years when they moved to kinship foster homes. Of these, six lived permanently with their grandparents or aunts from ages one to four until adulthood. One moved from a kinship foster home to another foster home around the age of 13, having lived in foster homes from approximately one year of age.</p>
<p>Three were six years of age or older when they moved into a kinship foster home, two of whom had lived in an institution and/or a foster home. One of them lived permanently in a kinship foster home until adulthood; one moved to an institution during the teenage years; and one moved around in the family network.</p>
<p>For youths in state custody in Norway, the CPS care responsibility can extend after 18 – until the age of 23. Several of the persons in this sample had chosen this alternative and were still in public care and a relationship with CPS. At the time of interview, half of them (three boys, two girls) still lived in their foster homes. Among the rest, one boy lived in an institution, one girl was co-habitating, and three girls lived alone. All of them were working, at school, or in work-related training.</p>
<p>Most of the interviewees had experienced several case workers and supervisors. In addition to their own case worker, all but one had siblings in the same or in other foster homes. The interviewees’ experience with CPS is thus wider than the contact associated with their own case.</p>
<p>Our epistemological starting point is that the material is constructed through interaction during the interview. The interview text is therefore not a result of the interviewer’s ‘uncovering’ of hidden information, but rather of the necessary and inevitable involvement of interviewer and interviewee during the interview process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325011428187">Holstein and Gubrium, 2003</xref>: 4). The material consists of the experiences and opinions of the interviewees, as they chose to present them in the context. The interview material has been thoroughly read both ‘lengthwise and crosswise’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325011428187">Haavind, 2000</xref>). Longitudinal refers to reading each person’s narrative as a continuous piece. ‘Latitudinal’ interpretation refers to focus on particular themes across each interview. In this way, variations and common features about how the interviewees regard their position in their encounters with child protection services emerge. This is the basis for our construction of typologies. The typologies which are derived are not a generalized reflection of foster children’s agency, but are our interpretations and constructions. The categories are theoretical tools which render variations of agency in foster children’s encounters with child protection services visible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1473325011428187"><title>Foster children as actors within CPS</title>
<p>The relationship between CPS and the foster children is based on the care order. The structural power constitutes the ‘external’ conditions the actors must relate to, and it sets out the framework for the foster child’s freedom to act. In the previous process, the authorities have deemed the parents’ way of life as being incompatible with their responsibilities for children. At the time of the interview, the foster children supported CPS in their decision to assume care. Certain foster children were critical about the time chosen and the concrete execution of the assumption of care responsibilities, but accepted the CPS’s ‘situation definition’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1473325011428187">5</xref></sup> in relation to the degree of severity of social problems in the parental home. In this way, the foster children provided CPS with legitimacy and acceptance with regard to their involvement. However, this approval by the foster children does not pertain to all aspects of the work CPS performs. The interviewees’ understanding of CPS may also have been influenced by family members` views on CPS through their own experiences.</p>
<p>Our analyses of the relationships between CPS and foster children are based on what the foster children emphasized when they talked about their contact with the agency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1473325011428187">6</xref></sup> In our interpretation, we have focused on the nature of the contact. First, how the contact was represented, what type of contact is described, whether or not it was direct or indirect, personal or impersonal, conflictual or cooperative. Second, which topics (or problems) serve as the object of contact or cooperation (economic, practical, emotional etc).</p>
<p>Through this, we saw great variation in relationships. The foster children’s representations of their own positions in these relationships becomes characterized in our analysis respectively as <italic>equal actor, powerless actor, agency as obligation, and pragmatic actor.</italic></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1473325011428187"><title>Equal actor</title>
<p>One extreme in the material is relationships that are characterized by cooperation, stability, flexibility and personal contact, based on a shared understanding of the situation. This type of relationship appears to be characterized by equality, exchange and mutual trust. This can refer to a shared definition of the problem and understanding of the foster child’s situation, and a shared understanding of what can be expected from CPS and what its tasks are. The form of communication is dialogue. Measures executed by CPS are based on the foster child’s consent, and rest on an acknowledgement of the foster child’s wishes and assessment of his or her own need for help. These descriptions can give associations to relationships as between <italic>service provider</italic> and <italic>customer.</italic> The following quotes are extracted from the interview with one boy aged 18.<disp-quote>
<p>So I called Kari (<italic>the case worker</italic>) and said: ‘Come and get me, I can’t cope with it any more. I can’t stand it anymore.’ And then I stayed at her home over the weekend … five days perhaps … . And then … then they sort of began the process of getting me moved.</p>
<p>Yes (…) I spoke to Kari, and said that I really wanted to go to a family around here. – I don’t want to live 50 kilometres away from friends, but seven kilometres isn’t especially far. It takes 10 minutes by car … And then I said that I’ve always been an only child, I would really like to try out having foster siblings. And here they are – (…) my current foster family, they have biological children and foster children – (…) As I said, one of my criteria was to take part in choosing the new family, that I wanted to be close to friends,//and that I wanted to stay at my school.</p>
<p>And there (<italic>in Child Protection Services</italic>) I have a social worker who looks after my interests.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The foster child’s agency in this relationship can be described as an ‘equal actor.’ Based on the foster child’s description, there are no significant differences between how the system representative and the foster child understand the situation. In the narratives, the client has freedom to manoeuvre and to influence her own position. The case worker has a key position and is perceived to be ‘a member of the same team’ as the client, who actively participates in assessments, decisions, therapy situations. The service is experienced as more or less congruent with the client’s needs. Like the ‘converted’ or ‘perfect’ client in Goffman’s study of total institutions, the actor here expresses being acclimatized to the CPS institution in such a way that she identifies herself with the institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473325011428187">Goffman, 1968</xref>: 63). The client seems to share the institution’s values and has a positive attitude toward cooperation with it.</p>
<p>Viewed from an analytical perspective, ‘equal agents’ assumes that the client holds the necessary contextual competency. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325011428187">Bourdieu’s (1995)</xref> terminology, this means that the client must possess the necessary cultural capital in order to call up and utilize the resources to which she seeks access. This involves the client having knowledge about CPS’s framework and resources, and having the ability to articulate her wishes and needs in such a way that they correspond with the agency’s understanding of the problem and its accessible measures. According to Bourdieu, this field-specific cultural capital is necessary to master ‘the game’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1473325011428187">7</xref></sup> The ‘equal’ actor is redeemed in the field’s logic, knows ‘the rules of the games’ – has no need to challenge them, but rather wants to contribute towards improving the existing ones – and will (thereby) strengthen her own position as an actor in the field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1473325011428187"><title>Powerless actor</title>
<p>Another extreme is relationships marked by distrust and conflict. Such relationships are characterized by hierarchical power relations and instability in personal contact. The contact is characterized by misunderstandings, coercion, unpredictability and blame assignation. In the client’s depiction, there is not a shared understanding of the situation, or an understanding about what CPS can contribute. Child protection measures appear to be arbitrary or illegitimate. The relationships have similarities with assailant–victim relationships. The following quotes are extracted from interviews with two girls aged 18 and 22.<disp-quote>
<p>You have to be careful in saying things to them (<italic>CPS)</italic> and stuff …</p>
<p>Yes – you can face consequences, yes – … They are not good at resolving problems. They’re very good at CREATING problems.</p>
<p>Child Protection Services are pretty slow … I remember when I was moved to an institution, then … my old case worker first was ill for a week, and then he was on holiday for a week … So in a way I was left completely on my own then …</p>
<p>I remember as a child … before I went to bed, I usually made sure that the door was locked and that the windows were properly closed, because I was so afraid that they were going to come and get me … in the middle of the night (…) I remember very clearly that night that we were taken – we were taken out of the window. From the children’s bedroom. By Child Protection Services.</p>
<p>They didn’t want to have me anymore under Child Protection Services. Child Protection Services – or the woman who was my social worker, she didn’t want to have me under Child Protection Services any longer (….)</p>
<p>But I received a little bit of help from (<italic>the people she lived with)</italic>, you know. But they tried to fight against Child Protection Services, they did, to help me. And they actually called someone in the government who had – had worked a lot with Child Protection Services. And he said himself that (<italic>the municipality’s)</italic> child protection office was the worst in the entire country.</p>
<p>– I feel anyway that the child welfare office in <italic>(the municipality in question</italic>), they are only there to help the adults, and not the children.</p>
<p>– Because they only listen to what the adults say, and not to the children.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>We characterize the clients in these relationships as <italic>powerless actors.</italic> The foster child describes her room for manoeuvre as being quite limited, with a comparable lack of influence over her own situation and the decisions made regarding it. The hierarchical power structure is represented as dominant, which is something the foster child wishes to oppose – without knowing how. The position taken by the foster child provides an association to a picture of the vulnerable, helpless child in her encounter with the State’s structural superiority. The measures by CPS are perceived as being based on changing assessments of the situation. There can be a great deal of contact at times, but CPS does not offer the help the foster child wishes to receive. The powerless actor does not seem to have the competency to influence the power relationship and the actors’ positions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1473325011428187">8</xref></sup> Through the externalization of causal explanations, the actor finds herself in a position with limited influence, or no influence at all. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325011428187">Jones and Alcabes (1993)</xref>, this is not uncommon in client-case worker relationships. Another way of viewing this is as ‘the encapsulated’ protest against the exercise of power by CPS, in the sense that the clients entrench themselves in order to protect themselves against the superior force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325011428187">Engelstad, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec9-1473325011428187"><title>Pragmatic actor</title>
<p>Between these extremes, there are relationships in this account that have more similarities to the <italic>sponsor/recipient</italic> relationship. The asymmetry in the relationships is obvious with regard to power and access to resources, but both parties negotiate what approaches are appropriate for the problems that arise. The relationships that are largely based on trust are action/solution oriented, and consensus in understanding the problem and measures that will help are sought out. The following quotes are extracted from interviews with three girls aged 18 and 22.<disp-quote>
<p>Yes – and then they had an arrangement with my mum and grandmother that we were to live with my grandmother and grandfather for three years – but now we’ve lived there for 13 years.</p>
<p>… we had agreed with Child Protection Services and all that – that I should live with my aunt and uncle for a while (…) – I needed that. I was in my last year of secondary school then.</p>
<p>Why was that, really? (<italic>that he chose state custody after turning 18)</italic> ‘Well – yeah – the intention was that I would get a flat and stuff in the town – when I started my last year at (college) … And then they were going to pay the rent and stuff instead of – because I – the people in the care of Child Protection Services don’t get a grant and stuff … So because of that, Child Protection Services supported me by paying rent and stuff. But then I quit school. But … then just – then I got a bit of money and stuff from them then –</p>
<p>Would you say it was for economic reasons that you chose that?</p>
<p>Yes, I guess it actually was.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m still under Child Protection Services, because I’m at school, so it gets tiring to work, and then we got like around 5000 … Yes, it’s just because of the money – if it hadn’t been for the money, then I would have opted out a long time ago. As soon as I turned 18 years of age. I actually don’t feel any need to have Child Protection Services.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The positions that the foster children adopt in these narratives can be described as <italic>pragmatic, partially strategic actor.</italic> By strategic actor, we understand that actors, on the basis of dispositions within habitus, act consciously or unconsciously in relation to material or symbolic interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473325011428187">Stax, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473325011428187">Wilken, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>These foster children take a pragmatic attitude where it is possible to choose to ask for, or accept offers from CPS based on what they themselves or their foster parents consider to be useful. Co-determination is made apparent through negotiation. The client is a relatively independent actor who ‘carries the load together’ with CPS and the foster parents. As described by Goffman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325011428187">Mik-Meyer and Villadsen, 2007</xref>) the clients can act in a strategically oriented way towards defining the situation themselves. In this perspective, strategy involves the actor seeking to create a ‘situation definition’ that is to her own advantage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1473325011428187"><title>Agency as obligation</title>
<p>A fourth type of relationship which is also located between the extremes described above, is characterized by limitations, distance, and little direct contact, and can be reminiscent of the relationship between <italic>bureaucrat and citizen</italic>. The control function of CPS is accepted, but beyond that, the relationship is depicted as being more or less insignificant to the foster child. Any potential negotiation of the situation, or need for different forms of help or support, are taken care of by the foster parents. The foster children largely hold themselves back from having contact with CPS, and the relationship is governed by formalities. The following quotes are extracted from interviews with two boys aged 18 and 20.<disp-quote>
<p>No, it’s like regular (<italic>following up)</italic> – that an inspector comes and – makes sure that everything is okay and all that (…) I have never had any conflicts or problems or anything like that, with Child Protection Services. That’s not something I’ve experienced.</p>
<p>Yes, we’ve been there, you know (<italic>with Child Protection Services</italic>) and have had people home with us who have talked to us and stuff. But I’ve never felt that I’ve been like … under supervision, I was gonna say (…) There has just been a woman who has come and spoken to us.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These relationships are characterized by traditional child and adult roles where the foster child is shielded from contact with the authorities – or they have themselves chosen not to be involved. The client’s influence is largely indirect in character. The foster parents represent the child’s interests and they are the ones who communicate and negotiate with CPS, if necessary. The foster child accepts the position of CPS – but is reluctant to enter into a relationship outside of the formally imposed one. This can be described by the concept ‘consent’ – which should not be understood as agreement, but the idea that ‘the relationships are accepted, not in coming from a free discussion, but from a coercive situation imposed from above’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325011428187">Engelstad, 2009</xref>: 84). The foster children’s agency in their direct contact with CPS is thereby limited to a minimum, linked to the relevant formalities. In <italic>agency as obligation</italic> CPS offers of help and more active participation are politely rejected.</p>
<p>In contrast to the other agency types, this actor will hold herself back from participation in the field of child welfare as much as possible. Goffman and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325011428187">2004</xref>: 210) concept of ‘role distance’ can help illustrate this: he writes, ‘actions which in practice, to a certain degree, express that the actor looks down on, and feels separate from, the role he is performing.’ The actor relates to the situation in a way that demonstrates that the person concerned does not really belong within the context. The actor indicates her normality through distancing herself from the field of child welfare. The actor has competency and autonomy that allows for latitude in her actions to define the situation and make decisions. According to Bourdieu’s perspective, this can be described as a marking of boundaries toward the cultural and social capital and the marginal position that is linked to clienthood within the field of child protection.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1473325011428187"><title>Concluding comments</title>
<p>Children in state custody are actors in the field of child protection without having chosen this themselves. In this study, we have seen that foster children in kinship foster homes perform different types of agency in their encounters with CPS. For some of the participants, this relationship has represented a resource in their childhood, for example, where the relationship is characterized by equality or pragmatism. For others, the experience has been a burden, in that they feel powerless or maintain contact with CPS out of a sense of obligation. Whether the relationship has been a burden or helpful is not linked to the extent of the foster children’s active participation.</p>
<p>Like Brownlie et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325011428187">2006</xref>: 64), who use the concepts of ‘research capital’ and ‘participation capital’ when they discuss the opportunities and conditions for incorporating children as researchers, we want to point out the necessity of a relevant competency<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1473325011428187">9</xref></sup> or ‘actor capital’ for participation in the child protection context. This competency, viewed as field-specific cultural capital, includes language, behaviour, style and knowledge. Such competency is necessary for the client to be able to assess whether she wants to participate – and in that event what position the client can and would like to adopt in this field. It is not given that foster children, even after a long period of involvement with CPS, possess the necessary competency to form their own agency (<italic>Powerless actor</italic>). On the other hand, it is not clear that all foster children view it to be useful or significant to master the ‘rules of the game’ for participation in this domain (<italic>Agency as obligation</italic>).</p>
<p>A number of factors help create variation with regard to the foster child’s agency in their encounter with CPS. The relationship’s asymmetry, the actor’s competency, and both CPS and the foster home’s adjustment for participation are essential. The foster family’s ‘child rearing style’ and priorities are also significant. As Thomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473325011428187">2000</xref>: 194) describe it, ‘ … children’s autonomy and their ability to have a say were highly dependent on the values, skills and “style” of the adults in the household – especially foster mothers.’ In our study, the significance of the family is made apparent in that either the foster children have to varying degrees participated in decision-making processes, they have been ‘shielded’ from having contact with CPS, or they could have themselves elected to participate or not. In this way, different understandings of children, childhood, and ‘what is best for the child’ were made apparent. Here, there is also a different emphasis on children as ‘becomings’ (who need protection against involvement and responsibilities) and children as ‘beings’ (who shall participate and have an influence).</p>
<p>Through the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in Norwegian law in 2003, children are given the right to participate in decision processes in cases that concern them. This creates guidelines for CPS’s practices. In realizing the child’s participation, there are implicit assumptions that ‘what is best for the child’ is strengthened through the child’s participation in decision-making processes cf. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473325011428187">Strandbu and Vis, 2008</xref>). Mik-Meyer and Villadsen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325011428187">2007</xref>: 40) refer to such ‘empowerment projects’ as examples of disciplinary power understood as ‘good power.’ In contrast to ‘bad power’, where the state is the oppressor, ‘good power’ is empowering. This implies that certain forms of agency are desirable and cultivated. In this context, this implies foster children who take on particular positions of agency as ‘competent users’ and actively participate where opportunities arise. In our study, we see that the foster child’s agency often, but not always, includes being an active participant in the domain of CPS, and that foster children have different attitudes toward whether such participation is for their own good.</p>
<p>An ideal for the relationship between client and social worker is characterized by Järvinen and Mik-Meyer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011428187">2003</xref>: 20–22) as a ‘service ideal’ where the social worker puts herself at the disposal of the ‘user’. Here, the user perspective is desired, as well as a kind of equality between the provider and recipient of services. A specific feature of this type of ‘service relationship’ is that professionalized social work rests on an assumption that what the institution offers is of benefit – and assumes that the client wants what the institution is offering. As the examples from our material show, we see descriptions that on the one hand can be interpreted as ‘service relations’ (e.g. ‘equal actors’), and on the other, relationships where clients do not utilize ‘the service’ CPS offers (e.g. ‘agency as obligation’). This can be due to the clients lacking both an understanding of what the institution’s benefits are, as well as a knowledge about how they should access such benefits (e.g. ‘the powerless actor’), or having expectations that are not in accordance with what CPS is ‘offering’. Still others do not want to relate to CPS or receive their services. These foster children do not necessarily view such offerings as a benefit, or they consider what CPS has to offer to be irrelevant.</p>
<p>Foster children in kinship care are actors with <italic>different</italic> motivations and competencies that provide different qualifications for competent decisions, participation and co-determination within the domain of child protection. It is therefore a challenge to acknowledge different types of agency, and to develop practices in child protection which arrange for the participation and influence of foster children – without resulting in disciplining towards specific types of agency.</p>
