<abstract>
<p>Paracentesis is a commonly performed procedure in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Useful for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, prior studies have documented the inherent safety of this procedure. In proper hands, modern techniques such as the use of safety (Turkel) tipped needles and ultrasound localization have reduced the risk of major complications to less than 1%. Nevertheless, major bleeding remains a dreaded complication of this procedure, especially in patients with liver failure. Our historical experience has been that this complication is unpredictable, likely because of procedural injury to an abdominal wall artery or peritoneal varix. The authors report a case where the risk of vascular injury was mitigated using portable ultrasound and suggest a simple procedure for future risk reduction.</p>

<title>Case Presentation</title>
<p>A 51-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease, cirrhosis, tricuspid regurgitation, and portal hypertension received hemodialysis 3 times per week and routinely required therapeutic paracenteses for recurrent ascites. Normal anatomic landmarks were chronically obliterated given the massive abdominal distention, so the standard approach was to identify a bowel-free echogenic window in the region of a lower lateral quadrant with the use of a low-frequency, p21 phase array ultrasound probe (1-5 mHz). More than 10 L was usually removed per paracentesis. On 2 prior occasions, despite the use of ultrasound, her immediate postprocedure course was complicated by profuse, superficial, abdominal wall bleeding at the needle entry sites. The reasons for her recurrent bleeding episodes were not obvious, since no visible varices were apparent to the operator at the entry sites and coagulation parameters and platelets were normal (although her blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were elevated from renal failure). Therefore, the bleeding was attributed to small vessel injury, and oozing was attributed to uremic platelet dysfunction; it was controlled both times with infiltration of the puncture site with lidocaine with epinephrine, 2-0 nylon sutures, and local pressure. However, a third incident of postprocedure bleeding resulted in a rapid reaccumulation of intraperitoneal fluid visualized with portable ultrasound within hours of the procedure and a subsequent drop in her hematocrit. DDAVP (desmopressin) and transfusion of packed red cells were given and the patient required 4 additional days of hospitalization.</p>

<p>One month later, she was again referred for paracentesis. On this occasion, in addition to the standard approach of visualizing her ascites in the lower quadrants with a low frequency ultrasound probe, these areas were also interrogated using a high-frequency, HFL 38 linear probe (6-13 mHz). This approach revealed surprising findings: Significant vascular structures scattered throughout the abdominal wall, not visible to the naked eye, but some lying directly adjacent to the peritoneum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1944451612442381">Figures 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1944451612442381">3</xref>). Based on this new information, an alternative entry site was selected approximately 5 cm cephalad and medial to the original location; the paracentesis was then performed without complication (13.2 L removed). A subsequent paracentesis several weeks later was again preceded by similar ultrasound mapping of the ascites <italic>and</italic> abdominal wall; the findings necessitated a small adjustment in needle entry site and resulted in another procedure without incident (15.4 L removed).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although ultrasound use for the localization of ascites has become routine for many proceduralists, we found no literature that speaks to the potential value of using a high-frequency linear ultrasound probe to scan the abdominal wall for aberrant vasculature prior to needle entry. At our institution, we perform ~1200 ultrasound-assisted paracentesis annually (using Sonosite M-Turbo machines, Bothell, WA), and we experience approximately 3 significant bleeds per year. Although a &lt;1% incidence is indeed low, the occurrences have been wholly unpredictable and frequently catastrophic. These events invariably result in ICU admission, transfusion of blood products, prolonged hospitalization, and occasional death. It is conceivable that these abdominal wall varices, the incidences of which are unknown and which have previously gone both undetected and unmentioned in the literature, may be lacerated during needle entry. Whether the damaged varix is superficial or deep is likely the main determinant as to whether the complication involves localized bleeding or results in intra-abdominal hemorrhage.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Paracentesis is generally considered to be a safe procedure with few absolute contraindications and with significant therapeutic benefits to patients. Cirrhotic patients are known to be at higher risk, however, both because of varices as well as abnormal coagulation parameters and platelet dysfunction. The simple yet remarkable discovery outlined in this case report of potential abdominal bleeders lurking “subterranean” suggests there may be value in routine ultrasound surveillance with a high frequency linear probe prior to paracenteses in this patient population. Additional study is clearly warranted to determine the incidence of this vascular pattern in ascitic patients and whether preprocedural identification can systematically prevent unintended bleeding. It is highly likely that this simple preprocedural ultrasound maneuver may allow for the identification of high-risk vessels and prompt the operator to select a different entry site, thereby providing significant benefit to patients (safety) and proceduralists (risk reduction) with minimal expenditure of resources or time.</p>
