<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>The prevalence of bipolar disorder in adolescents is estimated at 0.7% in males and 1.0% in females over a 12-month period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212447663">1</xref></sup> Rarely are these symptoms attributed to an organic cause. We report a case of affective symptoms and behavioural disturbances due to pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH). PCH is a rare group of autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorders of perinatal onset marked by hypoplasia and atrophy of the cerebellar cortex, dentate nuclei, pontine nuclei and inferior olives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212447663">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212447663">3</xref></sup> In the literature, PCH has not been associated with any psychiatric co-morbidities.</p>
<p>T, a 13-year-old adolescent male, was described as a pre-morbidly happy and affectionate child. He was diagnosed with mild intellectual disability of unknown cause, at the age of six. T attends a mainstream school. He was admitted to a child and adolescent psychiatric unit with a six-month history of aggressive behaviours and affective symptoms. These included verbal and physical aggression, with episodes of tearfulness and irritability, alternating with periods of elated mood. There was a family history of mood disorder, and maternal perinatal polysubstance abuse. His motor and speech abilities were delayed. There was no prior psychiatric history or significant medical illness.</p>
<p>On initial presentation to the ward, T presented as angry, irritable and intrusive. However, his mental state changed significantly after the first week, and he became markedly depressed, sad, tearful and amotivated. During this phase, there were elements of inappropriate self-blame and guilt, in the presence of a sullen and downcast affect. This phase lasted six days, alternating with irritable affect. There were no features suggestive of psychosis or delirium.</p>
<p>A complete systems review, including a full neurological examination, was unremarkable. Complete blood count, urea and electrolytes, thyroid function tests and urine drug screen were normal. An EEG did not show any abnormalities. However, brain CT showed a prominent cisterna magna. A follow-up MRI, performed following consultation with the neurologists, revealed a pronounced cerebellar hemispheric hypoplasia and moderate hypoplasia of the vermis, with pontine hypoplasia and reduction in volume of the medulla. There was also a relative enlargement of the cisterna magna with free communication of the fourth ventricle and a prominent pre-pontine cistern. These findings were indicative of PCH.</p>
<p>T was trialled on quetiapine up to 150 mg BD. There was no change in the affective symptoms. The addition of sodium valproate 800 mg/day controlled the symptoms with reduced irritability and better affective control. Subsequently, T was discharged, to be followed up in the community without any further psychiatric admissions.</p>
<p>A family history of affective disorder, maternal alcohol history and intellectual disability seem to have predisposed T for affective disorder. We hypothesised that the affective symptoms may have been secondary to PCH and emerged following the onset of puberty.</p>
<p>Whilst there have not been any documented cases of PCH with psychiatric co-morbidity, there have been several reports of Dandy–Walker Syndrome associated with bipolar affective disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212447663">4</xref></sup> This case illustrates the possible relationship between bipolar disorder and PCH.</p>
