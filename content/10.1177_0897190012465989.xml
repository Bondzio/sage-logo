            <p>Several oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) and factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors have recent Food and Drug Administration approval or are under investigation in late-stage clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic events. Rapid reversal of anticoagulation is typically recommended in patients with severe or life-threatening bleeding and in patients requiring surgery or invasive procedures. However, no antidote exists for DTIs or FXa inhibitors though replacement of coagulation factors using clotting factor concentrates is routinely considered in some clinical scenarios. Clotting factor concentrates available in the United States include prothrombin complex concentrate, <italic>activated </italic>prothrombin complex concentrate, and recombinant factor VII, activated. Coagulation tests to confirm adequate reversal of anticoagulation should be considered and commonly include activated partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time (TT) for DTIs, and chromogenic FXa assay and TT for FXa inhibitors. Monitoring of coagulation tests should continue for 1 to 2 days after achievement of hemostasis, since the duration of the clotting factor concentrate may be shorter than the oral anticoagulant, especially in patients with organ dysfunction. Utilization of decision-support tools and use of standardized reversal protocols are recommended to prevent errors in prescribing and dispensing for clotting factor concentrates.</p>

      <p>Oral anticoagulants are commonly used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (A-fib) or cardiac valve replacement and for the prevention or treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Prescribing of anticoagulants other than warfarin is likely to significantly increase in the future due to the recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of two oral anticoagulant agents, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, for stroke prevention in nonvalvular A-fib. Several other oral anticoagulants are in late-phase clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic events. However, bleeding may occur with any of these medications at any dosage and, regardless of the anticoagulant, rapid reversal of anticoagulation is typically recommended in patients with severe or life-threatening bleeding and in patients requiring emergent surgery or invasive procedures.</p>
      <p>Several guideline statements have been published regarding emergent reversal of anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKA).<sup>

         </sup> However, limited animal and clinical data exist to guide anticoagulation reversal in patients receiving direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) or factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors. Further, much of the available data regarding anticoagulation reversal with these agents is anecdotal or in settings where the clotting factor concentrates were administered as “salvage” therapy, and no specific agent is currently recommended for reversal. This review will focus on contemporary issues related to emergent reversal of anticoagulation with clotting factor concentrates in patients with acquired coagulopathy due to DTIs and FXa inhibitors.</p>

            <title>Prothrombin Complex Concentrates</title>
            <p>Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs), also known as factor IX complex, are prepared from pooled human plasma containing factor II, factor VII, factor IX, and factor X in their nonactivated form. The PCCs are available in 3-factor and 4-factor formulations. The 3-factor PCCs contain therapeutic levels of factor II, factor IX, and factor X with subtherapeutic concentrations of factor VII, while 4-factor PCCs contain therapeutic levels of factor II, factor VII, factor IX, and factor X. Worldwide, there are over a dozen PCCs products but the only 2 products available in the United States are 3-factor PCCs (Bebulin<sup>®</sup>, Profilnine<sup>®</sup>). A new drug application for a 4-factor PCC was recently submitted to the FDA. Currently, the PCCs have FDA-approved indications for bleeding prevention and control in patients with factor IX deficiency. However, PCC products are routinely administered off-label for the reversal of VKAs. A summary of clotting factor concentrates available in the United States is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012465989">Table 1</xref>. Hypersensitivity reactions with PCCs are thought to occur more frequently in hemophilia patients, who may develop factor IX inhibitors with repeated use, than in patients receiving PCCs for reversal of anticoagulation.</p>

            <p>Disease transmission, including hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), posed a serious threat when PCCs were initially developed in the 1970s. During subsequent decades, manufacturers implemented stringent restrictions for donor plasma to minimize disease transmission and developed heat and chemical techniques that result in viral inactivation.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012465989">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012465989">7</xref>
               </sup> As a result, the risk of disease transmission is minimal with the modern day PCCs.</p>
            <p>Thrombotic events, including venothromboembolism (VTE) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), are the predominant concerns during administration of PCCs. When PCCs were initially developed, they lacked coagulation inhibitors. The addition of coagulation inhibitors, including protein C, protein S, heparin, and antithrombin, to many modern day PCC products is thought to decrease prothrombin generation which subsequently minimizes the thrombosis risk.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012465989">8</xref>
               </sup> When administering PCCs for anticoagulation reversal, the risk of thrombosis may be increased as these patients commonly have a hypercoagulable state at the baseline. In clinical studies, thrombosis occurred infrequently after PCC administration and may be attributed to other patient-specific characteristics including malignancy, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and recurrent DVT.<sup>

            <title>Activated Prothrombin Complex Concentrates</title>
            <p>Activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCCs) are developed from pooled human plasma and predominantly contain factors II, IX, and X in their inactivated form as well as activated factor VII (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012465989">Table 1</xref>). Factor eight inhibitory bypassing activity (FEIBA) is the only currently manufactured aPCC and is also known as anti-inhibitor coagulant complex. The aPCC has FDA-approved indications to treat spontaneous bleeding associated with hemophilia A and B with inhibitors and in nonhemophiliacs with acquired inhibitors as well as to prevent perioperative bleeding in these patients.</p>
            <p>Compared to PCCs, aPCC is thought to carry a higher thromboembolic risk. In 2010, prescribing information for aPCC was updated to include a black box warning for increased thrombosis risk. However, the majority of evidence regarding thrombosis with aPCC administration was obtained from the studies involving patients with hemophilia. During a 2002 evaluation of aPCC safety over a 10-year period, thrombotic events occurred 4.05 times per 10 000 infusions and occurred more frequently with doses greater than 200 units/kg/d.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012465989">14</xref>
               </sup> It is important to recognize that the risk of thrombosis may be higher when reversing anticoagulation with aPCC, given the probable hypercoagulable states of this patient population. Unfortunately, there is a lack of evidence regarding the risk of thrombosis in patients requiring emergent reversal of anticoagulation. When administering aPCC for bleeding reversal, it is important that the practitioners evaluate the risk of thrombosis compared to the benefit of reversal and that patients receive no more than 200 units/kg/d of aPCC.</p>

            <title>Recombinant Factor VIIa</title>
            <p>Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is a clotting factor concentrate prepared from the gene for human factor VII which is cloned and expressed in baby hamster kidney cells (BHK; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012465989">Table 1</xref>). The purification process for rFVIIa has been shown to remove exogenous viruses. Administration of rFVIIa activates the extrinsic coagulation cascade to promote hemostasis. Recombinant factor VIIa has FDA-approved indications for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A and hemophilia B with inhibitors to factor VIII or IX, congenital factor VII deficiency, and acquired hemophilia.</p>
            <p>Thrombosis is the most worrisome side effect of rFVIIa administration. A 2010 meta-analysis of rFVIIa use reported a significant increase in the arterial thromboembolic events of 5.5% in patients receiving rFVIIa for off-label indications when compared to 3.2% in patients who received placebo.<sup>

               </sup> Secondary to postmarketing evidence regarding the thrombotic risk of rFVIIa, the product now carries a black box warning regarding the risk of arterial and venous thromboembolic (VTE) events associated with utilization of rFVIIa. It is recommended that providers consider the risks versus benefits when considering administration of rFVIIa, particularly in patients with a hypercoagulable state at baseline.</p>

In addition, 60% of the drug is removed in a 2- to 3-hour hemodialysis session. In an open-label, parallel-group trial, study subjects (n = 23) with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment received a single dose of dabigatran (150 mg for mild and moderate impairment and 50 mg for end-stage renal disease) and blood and urine samples were measured.<sup>

Further, approximately 62% to 68% of a single dose of dabigatran was removed by dialysis. The manufacturer also recommends consideration of aPCC, rFVIIa, and plasma, although clinical usefulness has not been well established. There is a clinical debate regarding the utility of various blood products in the management of dabigatran-associated bleeding.<sup>

               </sup> While packed red blood cells (RBCs) obviously support an active hemorrhage, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) has only a theoretical benefit. FFP contains prothrombin (in addition to all other clotting factors found in blood), which only indirectly increases thrombin concentrations and may not successfully overcome dabigatran inhibition. Other shortcomings of FFP include requirements for thawing, cross-matching, prolonged administration times, and large volumes.</p>
            <p>Reversal of dabigatran has been evaluated in both human and animal studies. Zhou and colleagues evaluated the ability of PCC, FFP, and rFVIIa to control intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in mice receiving dabigatran.<sup>

               </sup> After induction of ICH, 4-factor PCC (25-100 units/kg), murine FFP (200 μL), or rFVIIa (8 mg/kg) were administered and ICH volume, tail vein bleeding time, and ecarin clotting time (ECT) were measured. The results demonstrated that PCC was effective in preventing excess hematoma expansion in a dose-dependent manner. The FFP was also effective but to a lesser extent, while rFVIIa was ineffective. Authors concluded that PCC can prevent hematoma expansion in murine models, but this strategy should be further evaluated in humans for safety and efficacy.</p>
            <p>Eerenberg and colleagues assessed the reversal of dabigatran with PCC in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 12 healthy male volunteers.<sup>

               </sup> The subjects received dabigatran 150 mg twice daily for 2.5 days followed by a bolus 4-factor PCC 50 IU/kg or normal saline. Results demonstrated that dabigatran increased the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) from a baseline of 33.6 to 59.4 seconds, ECT (33-69 seconds), and thrombin time (TT, to &gt;120 seconds in all subjects), but administration of PCC did not reverse this effect at any time point between 15 minutes and 24 hours after the administration. Authors concluded that PCC at the dose used was not effective for the reversal of dabigatran in healthy volunteers.</p>
            <p>The shorter acting IV DTIs may not require pharmacologic intervention for reversal due to a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Due to the short half-life, discontinuation of the drug may be sufficient to reverse the anticoagulant effects, especially in patients with normal renal function. However, there are case reports of successful reversal of IV DTIs with rFVIIa. A 56-year-old man with HIT requiring emergent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and aortic valve replacement experienced excessive bleeding while receiving lepirudin that was unresponsive to traditional therapies and blood transfusions.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190012465989">22</xref>
               </sup> The patient received rFVIIa 35 mcg/kg, which slowed bleeding and allowed for successful placement of chest tubes and completion of surgery. In another case, authors describe a 48-year-old male with a heparin allergy treated with bivalirudin during an emergent aortic aneurysm repair.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0897190012465989">23</xref>
               </sup> Because of presumed alteration in clotting cascade function during induced hypothermia and impaired bivalirudin clearance, the patient’s activated clotting time (ACT) escalated to &gt;999 seconds with significant bleeding during the case. Despite multiple blood products, clotting was not visualized in the surgical field until administration of rFVIIa 5 mcg/kg. The patient eventually required repeated doses of 5 mcg/kg and 10 mcg/kg to complete the procedure. Based on these cases, the rFVIIa may be considered as a treatment option for salvage therapy in patients with life-threatening bleeding who are receiving an IV DTI.</p>
            <p>Current consensus guidelines have limited recommendations for reversal of dabigatran or the IV DTIs. The most recent American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) guidelines for antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy do not provide a recommendation for reversal of dabigatran, but state that rFVIIa and PCC may be useful based on the animal and in vitro models.<sup>

               </sup> In addition, hemodialysis and early administration of activated charcoal may have a role. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the management of A-fib have been updated with a recommendation for use of dabigatran for stroke prevention and state that there is no specific antidote for dabigatran and supportive care for severe hemorrhage may include transfusions or surgical intervention if appropriate.<sup>

For moderate to severe bleeding, local measures, fluid replacement, and blood transfusions should be employed. In addition, consider administration of tranexamic acid, activated charcoal if dabigatran given within less than 2 hours, and PCC. For severe bleeds, rFVIIa 100 mcg/kg bolus may be used and repeated if necessary with hematology guidance. Further, hemodialysis should be considered, especially if renal failure is present.

Although renally cleared, neither fondaparinux nor rivaroxaban is dialyzable due to high protein binding (94% for fondaparinux and 92%-95% for rivaroxaban). Manufacturer recommendations for bleeding complications associated with either drug suggest activated charcoal may be considered within 2 to 3 hours of oral FXa inhibitor.</p>
            <p>Successful reversal of fondaparinux and rivaroxaban has been described in both case reports and animal and human studies. In an in vitro study, fondaparinux was added to human blood samples and followed by aPCC, rFVIIa, or PCC.<sup>

               </sup> Recombinant factor VIIa significantly shortened the thrombin lag time but not in a dose-dependent manner. The aPCC shortened the lag time in a dose-dependent manner and also improved the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP). Finally, PCC increased the thrombin peak in a dose-dependent manner, but a paradoxical longer lag time was observed, which was attributed to the heparin in the PCC formulation utilized in the study. The lag time normalized after administration of protamine sulfate. Authors concluded that there was a complete correction of thrombin-generating capacity with aPCC, while rFVIIa partially corrected the level of anticoagulation achieved with fondaparinux. The reversal effect of PCC could not be clearly established in this in vitro study.</p>
            <p>In a case series, 8 patients with bleeding while receiving fondaparinux (5 ACS and 3 VTE) were treated with rFVIIa 90 mcg/kg bolus, transfusion, and other standard hemostatic methods.<sup>

One patient died in this series. Authors concluded that rFVIIa was effective in 50% of the cases, and failure was associated with higher anti-Xa levels. The conclusions to this series are limited by a small number of patients and the uncontrolled environment that allowed patients to receive multiple other hemostatic interventions at the same time.</p>

One study administered rFVIIa 90 mcg/kg or placebo to healthy volunteers receiving fondaparinux 10 mg or placebo subcutaneously. Results demonstrated normalized thrombin generation after administration of rFVIIa. The second study administered rFVIIa 90 mcg/kg or placebo to healthy volunteers receiving a single dose of idraparinux 7.5 mg subcutaneously. The rFVIIa reversed prolonged APTT and prothrombin time (PT) at both 3 hours and 1 week. The remaining in vitro model studies demonstrated similar results with rFVIIa, and one study found that aPCC significantly decreased thrombin generation time. Authors of the systematic review concluded that the limited literature available supports the use of rFVIIa for serious bleeding associated with fondaparinux or idraparinux.</p>
            <p>Eerenberg and colleagues evaluated the reversal of rivaroxaban with PCC in healthy, male volunteers (n = 12).<sup>

After administration of rivaroxaban, the PT was significantly prolonged from the baseline (15.8 vs 12.3 seconds, <italic>P </italic>&lt; .001). The PCC completely normalized the PT (12.8 seconds, <italic>P </italic>&lt; .001) by 15 minutes, and this result was sustained for 24 hours.

            <p>Fukuda and colleagues conducted an in vitro and in vivo analysis in rats to assess the ability of PCC, aPCC, and rFVIIa to reverse the anticoagulant effects of edoxaban.<sup>

               </sup> In the in vitro study, edoxaban prolonged the PT time compared to control plasma (31-43 seconds vs 18 seconds). The rFVIIa, PCC, and aPCC all shortened the PT time in a dose-dependent manner, but rFVIIa had the most potent reversal effect with a complete return to baseline PT (17.3 ± 0.2 seconds). Note that this result may have occurred because rFVIIa can falsely lower PT/international normalized ratio (INR) since the PT assay is primarily affected by functional factor VII levels. In the in vivo study, after edoxaban was infused IV, reversal agent or control were administered, an incision was made in the right planta, and bleeding times were measured. The rFVIIa and aPCC both significantly and dose dependently shortened bleeding times and plasma PT. The PCC was not assessed in this analysis. Finally, in a rat with venous thrombosis, edoxaban or vehicle was administered followed by rFVIIa in order to assess the potential for thrombus formation. In the rats that received edoxaban followed by rFVIIa, the PT shortened by 39 seconds (25%) and the thrombus formation did not exceed the control group. Authors concluded that rFVIIa, aPCC, and PCC have the potential to emergently reverse edoxaban anticoagulation, but optimal doses in humans should not be extrapolated from this analysis. Recent guidelines suggest rFVIIa may be useful for the reversal of fondaparinux, although evidence is limited.<sup>

Similar to the TT, APTT may be most clinically useful in qualitative detection of DTI concentration.

            <p>In patients with emergent bleeding, it is important to assess the reversal of anticoagulation to control or prevent re-bleeding as well as allow for surgery or invasive procedures. Since many of the hemostatic agents discussed have a rapid onset of action, reevaluation of coagulation studies is usually performed 15 to 30 minutes after the administration, with hemostasis interventions repeated as necessary. However, the duration of the hemostatic effect with some modes of clotting factor replacement may be short when compared to the duration of the newer anticoagulants, especially in patients with renal failure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190012465989">Table 2</xref>). For example, the half-life of dabigatran is approximately 13 hours in patients with normal renal function but increases to 18 hours in patients with moderate renal impairment (defined as an estimated creatinine clearance of 30-50 mL/min). While there are no guidelines for recommendations regarding follow-up monitoring after hemostatic administration, it is reasonable to repeat coagulation studies every 6 to 12 hours following the initial normalization. Additionally, patients should be monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of bleeding including hemodynamic instability, impaired oxygen delivery, pallor, altered mental status, abdominal pain, and decrease in hemoglobin concentration.</p>

         <p>Although the lack of clinical outcome data makes it impossible to provide a recommendation for any specific hemostasis drug in patients with emergent bleeding due to DTI or FXa inhibitor use, it appears reasonable to recommend reassessment of the appropriate coagulation studies within 30 to 60 minutes after the administration of the selected reversal agent. Tests should include at minimum APTT and TT for DTIs, and FXa assay and TT for FXa inhibitors.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012465989">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0897190012465989">36</xref>
            </sup> If coagulation tests do not normalize, consideration should be given for a repeat dose of the same hemostasis agent or supplementation of clotting factor replacement by a different mode (rFVIIa or FFP). Due to the long half-life of some anticoagulants, close monitoring of coagulation studies should continue for 1 to 2 days after stopping the anticoagulant, especially in patients with renal insufficiency. Utilization of decision-support tools and development of institution-specific anticoagulation reversal protocols is recommended to prevent errors in prescribing and dispensing for clotting factor concentrates since these represent “sound-alike, look-alike (SALAD)” drugs (eg, factor IX should only be used for hemophilia, factor IX complex, or PCC may be used for hemostasis in nonhemophiliacs). The safety and effectiveness of clotting factor concentrates in patients with emergent bleeding due to DTIs or FXa inhibitors deserve further study to determine the most appropriate monitoring tests indicating reversal of coagulopathy, to evaluate any association with hemostasis and improved clinical outcomes, and to identify adverse drug events.</p>
