<abstract>
<p>The current study was designed to help examine attitudes toward private lesson teaching of a cross section of wind and percussion instrument instructors (<italic>N =</italic> 72) who represent teachers with the potential to influence present and future instrumental music education students. The subject pool was drawn from the membership of the National Association of College Wind and Percussion Instructors (NACWPI). Results were similar in many ways to responses in previous studies involving music faculty and music students. These respondents indicated that they liked teaching, liked the challenges of teaching musicians, indicated that teaching served to help their personal performing, and that good teaching technique was not obvious and needed to be taught. They also enjoyed talking about pedagogical issues with students, periodically shared pedagogical information as part of students’ lessons, but were not committed to recommending that students take a pedagogy class. Engaging the membership of organizations such as NACWPI will be necessary if the music teacher education profession is to find ways to include the pedagogy of individual music lesson teaching for musicians interested in becoming teachers.</p>

<body>
<p>The two primary areas of focus for the majority of music teacher education programs has traditionally been to prepare future teachers to work in general music classrooms and/or band, choir, and orchestra performance programs in K–12 public schools. The study of pedagogy in traditional music education degrees is often limited, because of various curricular and economic limitations, to educating teachers primarily about working with students in these large groups. The result of this focus has been a good deal of success in teaching groups of students to play music at a relatively high level in middle and high school performance ensembles. It is not unusual for these teachers of middle and high school performing groups to encourage their young instrumentalists and singers to study with a private teacher in order to improve their individual skills as musicians. These same teachers often work outside the regular school day doing this kind of teaching to supplement income and provide a service to their community. As a result they are teaching in private homes, churches, community centers, music stores, and public schools (after the regular school day has finished for children), engaging in a teaching model in which the vast majority have personal experience but almost no formal training.</p>
<p>Young musicians hoping to become music teachers are already closely connected to private lesson teaching in a variety of ways. In a recent study, high school students (<italic>N</italic> = 228), auditioning at college/university music schools with the express intent of majoring in music education, were surveyed to determine what people and experiences may have had an impact on their educational and career decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1057083711411715">Rickels et al., 2010</xref>). When asked specifically to identify people who had influenced their decision to go to college and major in music education 66% listed a private lesson teacher. When asked about the types of experiences they had prior to applying for college, 43% reported that they themselves had already taught private music lessons to other students. In response to the question “What do you anticipate that you will teach after graduation?” 54% listed “Private lesson teacher” as one of the possibilities. In light of these data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1057083711411715">Rickels et al. (2010)</xref> suggest “. . . it may be that it is time to broaden the concept of music teacher education to include aspects of private lesson teaching” (p. 303).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1057083711411715">Robinson (2010)</xref> explored various issues surrounding the experiences of instrumental music education majors who later chose to teach in elementary general music settings. Participants commonly cited teaching private lessons on their instrument as a way to stay in touch with their personal musicianship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057083711411715">Fredrickson (2007a)</xref> suggests that this is true of many who major in music during college, not just those who study to become certified school music teachers. Accepting the first “Senior Researcher” award given by MENC, Clifford <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057083711411715">Madsen (1988)</xref> identified in his acceptance address some basic areas “. . . that need to be analyzed and developed in much greater detail before we can expect research to have the influence it deserves” (p. 134). The first area of pedagogical focus on his list was “. . . investigating attitudes toward all issues relating to applied music study . . .” (p. 134). Since that time some research on this topic has suggested that even though all college educated musicians have taken private music lessons for many years very few have had more than an occasional isolated learning experience that focuses on the pedagogy of teaching students in an individual applied music setting, and in truth only a small segment of that population has had any instruction with that intent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057083711411715">Fredrickson, 2007a</xref>).</p>
<p>College-level music performance education is traditionally a combination of individual (lesson) and group (ensemble) music experiences. Is vicarious learning, and the assumption of transfer from other areas, the best way to develop effective teachers for the individual applied music lesson setting? Is the best way to learn to teach music lessons simply taking music lessons? One study examined experiences of music performance students (<italic>N</italic> = 12) recorded in journals kept while teaching regular private lessons to public school students as an assignment for a pedagogy class at their university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1057083711411715">Fredrickson, 2007b</xref>). Their written comments were read and categorized by the researcher and experienced university private lesson teachers who identified consistent “. . . teacher concerns about student motivation and practice, and a relatively low connection between teacher perceptions of the best and worst aspects of their teaching with the best and worst aspects of student learning” (p. 72). These students, more than half of whom were working on a doctorate in music performance, had been in countless private music lessons over many years and still experienced personal frustrations related to teaching and problems related to rudimentary cause-and-effect teaching interactions with their students.</p>
<p>How do experienced musicians regularly teaching private applied music lessons feel about some of the issues surrounding these questions? Private instrumental lesson teachers (<italic>N</italic> = 101) in a large metropolitan area, more than half of whom indicated that private lesson teaching was their primary source of employment, responded to questions about their beliefs related to teaching and preparation to teach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1057083711411715">Villarreal, 2010</xref>). These teachers said they enjoyed seeing students develop into better musicians, working out ways to help students understand a particular point, and working to improve their own teaching. But more than 65% felt that they would have benefited from more direction on private lesson teaching in their undergraduate or graduate program. Another sample of studio music teachers (<italic>N</italic> = 32), teaching in two higher education institutions, were questioned about their attitudes toward their own teaching and the possibility of the students in their studios teaching private lessons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057083711411715">Fredrickson, Gavin, &amp; Moore, 2010</xref>). This group indicated that they did not necessarily teach as their best teacher taught them, good teaching technique was not obvious and needed to be taught, and that good performers were not necessarily always good teachers. They also reported that they enjoyed talking about teaching with their students. It has been suggested that music teacher education faculty might collaborate with the performance faculty teaching applied music in their institutions to find ways to infuse the pedagogy of private music study into existing music degree program experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057083711411715">Fredrickson, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1057083711411715">Rickels et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study was modeled on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057083711411715">Mills (2004)</xref> and designed to examine attitudes toward private lesson instruction among selected college/university applied studio instructors teaching prospective band music education students. In the data collected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1057083711411715">Rickels et al. (2010)</xref>, the majority of aspiring instrumental music education students reported being influenced by their band director, had done some teaching in that setting as students, and planned to teach in that setting on completion of a music education degree. Bands may be considered the most common of public school instrumental music ensembles currently found in the vast majority of middle and high schools. The National Association of College Wind and Percussion Instructors (NACWPI) was chosen as a representative organization for the subject cohort. On the association website NACWPI is described as “a forum for communication within the profession of applied music on the college campus.” The first of the six purposes of the organization is to encourage and develop “. . . more effective teaching of wind and percussion instruments on the college level” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057083711411715">NACPWI, n.d.</xref>). NACWPI maintains close ties to MENC—The National Association for Music Education. In even numbered calendar years, NACWPI’s national meeting is held in conjunction with the national meeting of MENC. In addition, the association aims to coordinate “. . . the activities of the membership with other groups having common interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057083711411715">NACPWI, n.d.</xref>). These groups include, but are not limited to, the National Flute Association, International Clarinet Association, North American Saxophone Alliance, International Double Reed Society, International Trumpet Guild, International Horn Society, International Trombone Association, International Tuba Euphonium Association, and the Percussive Arts Society.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The data collection instrument used in the current study was pilot-tested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057083711411715">Fredrickson et al. (2010)</xref> for use with college/university applied music faculty. No problems were found as a result of the pilot study and the instrument was used in the same form for the present study. The questionnaire included 28 statements to which the participants were asked to respond, using a 7-point Likert-type scale, by indicating their level of agreement or disagreement with the statements. Response choices ranged along the scale from <italic>strongly agree</italic> (1) through <italic>no opinion</italic> (4) to <italic>strongly disagree</italic> (7). The 28 statements were grouped into 6 subgroups, categorized as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1057083711411715" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>students’ roles as teachers</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>teaching roles of the “best” students</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the enjoyment of applied teaching</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the relationships between teaching and performing</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the role of motivation in applied teaching</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>curricular and pedagogical issues</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Following the initial 28 statements, demographic questions related to number of years teaching, current university teaching assignment, and degrees held by respondents were asked.</p>
<p>The survey instrument, which appears in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1057083711411715">Figure 1</xref>, was distributed to participants electronically using an email containing the link to the appropriate web page containing the survey. It was decided that the survey would remain open for a period of 30 days. A reminder e-mail would be sent to the list if receipt of responses stopped for a period of 7 days during the 30-day collection period.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>At the time of the study, the NACWPI membership e-mail list contained 195 addresses and the request for participation went to all addresses on the list. Responses were recorded for a period of 30 days with one e-mail reminder sent after 25 days. Responses received (<italic>N</italic> = 72) represent a return rate of 37% of the sample population. Demographic information for the sample appears in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1057083711411715">Table 1</xref>. Means and standard deviations for the numerical responses to the primary 28 statements appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1057083711411715">Table 2</xref>. These results are delineated into the six subgroups identified previously. To generalize the 28 statement responses, the Likert-type scale responses will often be condensed by combining the ratings of 1, 2, and 3 to represent agreement, the rating of 4 will represent no opinion, and ratings of 5, 6, and 7 will combine to represent disagreement.</p>

<p>Examination of the demographic information appearing in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1057083711411715">Table 1</xref> reveals that the teaching experience level of the participants varied widely from 1 to 69 years, with an average of 17.57 years. The number of instruments taught by individual respondents in an applied setting varied, ranging from one instrument to four instruments, and included 11 flute teachers, 13 clarinet teachers, 4 oboe teachers, 1 bassoon teacher, 5 saxophone teachers, 4 teachers of both clarinet and saxophone, 4 teachers of three or more woodwind instruments, 4 trumpet teachers, 1 teacher of trumpet and euphonium, 5 horn teachers, 1 trombone teacher, 3 teachers of both trombone and euphonium, 3 teachers of euphonium and tuba, 3 teachers of trombone, euphonium, and tuba, 1 teacher of more than three brass instruments, and 9 percussion teachers.</p>
<p>Many respondents reported having assignments outside private studio teaching. Teaching assignments for this population included a variety of tasks in addition to private lesson teaching. Overall, 25% reported teaching a music theory or history course for music majors, 24% reported teaching music appreciation for nonmusic majors, and 22% teach a music education methods class. A total of 17% reported conducting a large ensemble and 28% reported having assigned administrative duties. Reported activities often more closely related to the private studio included 43% teaching a pedagogy class for performance majors, 31% teaching an instrument techniques class for music education majors, and 68% coach small ensembles.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that 46% of the teachers in this study reported having received a bachelor’s degree in music education. Another 8% had completed a double major in education and performance, which means that more than half (39) had participated extensively in undergraduate music teacher education coursework. All respondents held master’s degrees and 63 (88%) held doctorates. Among the 63 respondents holding doctorates, 55 held doctorates in performance and 6 held doctorates in music education. There were also doctorates in music history (1) and in music theory (1).</p>

<title>Students’ Roles as Teachers</title>
<p>In total, 75% of participants reported that they agreed that their students would do some private lesson teaching while in college, but only 17% agreed strongly. Among the 25% of participants who disagreed that their students would do some private lesson teaching while in college, only 6% strongly disagreed. Almost all (99%) responded that they expected their students to do some private lesson teaching following graduation, with 47% agreeing strongly. The other 1% had “no opinion” on the matter. A total of 61% agreed that income would be the primary reason their students would teach, whereas 22% disagreed with this statement and 17% had no opinion. In addressing the idea of their students teaching beginners, 63% agreed that their students would enjoy teaching beginners, whereas 25% had no opinion on the statement and 12% disagreed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1057083711411715">
<title>Teaching Roles of the “Best” Students</title>
<p>These teachers consistently agreed that their best students would teach in the future. A total of 75% agreed that their best students would like to teach on the college level, whereas 74% agreed that their best students desired a performance career, but realized they will need to teach for income purposes. Though these results indicated a belief that students will eventually teach, 72% disagreed with the idea that their best students want to engage in a teaching career prior to engaging in a full-time performance career, whereas only 15% registered any level of agreement with the statement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1057083711411715">
<title>Enjoyment of Applied Teaching</title>
<p>Respondents were very positive concerning their personal enjoyment of applied music lesson teaching. All the respondents agreed that they enjoyed seeing students develop into better musicians, with 96% agreeing strongly. All agreed that they enjoyed helping students better understand a particular point, with 75% agreeing strongly. In total, 99% agreed that they enjoyed working to improve their students’ teaching skills, with 1% having no opinion. Similarly, 96% agreed that they enjoyed talking about pedagogy with private students, with only 1% disagreeing with that statement in any way.</p>
<p>Private lesson teachers’ opinions concerning the types of students they enjoyed teaching were much more varied. In all, 49% of respondents agreed that teaching students focused on a performance career is something they particularly liked, whereas 28% disagreed with this statement and 23% had no opinion. Responses focused on the teaching of beginners also varied. Almost half of the respondents (49%) agreed that they enjoyed teaching beginners, 39% disagreed with this statement and 12% had no opinion. It was consistent then that 56% agreed that they enjoyed teaching students who find music easy, whereas 25% disagreed and 19% had no opinion.</p>

<sec id="section7-1057083711411715">
<title>Relationships Between Teaching and Performing</title>
<p>Respondents’ attitudes with regard to the relationship between teaching and performing were overwhelmingly homogeneous. A great majority (90%) of respondents disagreed with the statement that a good performer will always be a good teacher, whereas 6% agreed and 4% had no opinion. There is an interesting connection between the skills of performing and teaching as highlighted by the fact that 93% of respondents agreed that teaching private lessons helps them in their own performing, whereas only 3% disagreed with that statement. Also important to note are the 84% of respondents who agreed with the statement that they often talk to their students about how teaching plays a role in helping to improve their own playing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1057083711411715">
<title>The Role of Motivation in Applied Teaching</title>
<p>A substantial number of these teachers (68%) agreed that if a student is not practicing it is their job, as the applied teacher, to motivate that student. A total of 47% agreed that when a student gives up, they “worry that their teaching was not good enough,” whereas 43% disagreed with this statement and 10% had no opinion. When prompted to comment on the models they draw on as teachers, 36% agreed that they teach their students in exactly the same way their best teacher taught them, with 61% disagreeing with this statement. Respondents disagreed with the idea that “good teaching technique is obvious and does not require training” (94%). In estimating how society values private music teaching, only 22% agreed that they think it is valued by society, whereas 68% disagreed and 10% had no opinion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1057083711411715">
<title>Curricular and Pedagogical Issues</title>
<p>Opinions expressed on topics of pedagogy and curricula were varied. Overall, 74% agreed that their studio curriculum was completely individualized and 68% agreed that they had a specific pedagogical framework that guided their teaching with every student. A total of 43% of these teachers agreed that their curriculum is differentiated by major (performance, education, etc.) within their studio, whereas 51% disagreed with this statement and 6% had no opinion. When responding to statements about where their students might get knowledge of pedagogical practice 50% agreed that if a student wants to know about teaching they are encouraged to take a pedagogy class, whereas 24% disagreed and 26% had no opinion. Slightly more than three quarters of respondents (78%) agreed that they often use portions of a student’s lesson time to teach pedagogical information.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Respondents in the present study (<italic>N</italic> = 72) consisted of members of the NACWPI. Data indicated that this cross section of university woodwind, brass, and percussion faculty liked teaching, liked the challenges of teaching musicians, and indicated that teaching served to enhance their personal performance skills. Respondents also enjoyed talking about pedagogical issues with students, periodically shared pedagogical information as part of students’ lessons, and enjoyed working to improve their own students’ teaching. This group disagreed strongly that a good performer would necessarily be a good teacher, felt that good teaching technique was not obvious and needed to be taught, but were not strongly committed to the idea of recommending that students take a pedagogy class.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057083711411715">Fredrickson et al. (2010)</xref> solicited responses to the same statements from a smaller, more homogeneous group of applied music faculty. In that study all participants held full-time, tenure-track appointments teaching primarily applied music in a large music school with highly selective audition criteria. The current population was much more broadly based in terms of appointment (78% were full-time, tenure-track), assignment (many listed other substantive course assignments as regular parts of their load, as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1057083711411715">Table 1</xref>), and it is likely that the size and scope of their home music departments varied a good deal more. The current population was also drawn from wind and percussion instructors, so unlike the previous study did not include string, voice, or keyboard faculty. With this in mind it was interesting that the average responses to statements were very similar in both directionality and level of agreement when comparing the current population with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057083711411715">Fredrickson et al. (2010)</xref>.</p>
<p>There were some notable differences between these respondents and those surveyed in other studies that may be related to variations within the current population. These college-level private lesson teachers were less likely to see their own students as being highly performance oriented and saw them as having more interest in teaching. Faculty in the present study thought their students would show more interest in teaching beginners and students with less ability. If the current faculty included teachers in music schools and departments with larger populations of music education majors, and smaller groups of performance students, that may have had an impact on these perceptions. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057083711411715">Fredrickson (2007a)</xref>, subgroups of students majoring in music education evidenced parallel differences when compared with their performance-major peers. Future research might focus on variables related to instruments-specific techniques courses currently required of many music education students, These variables might include the assignment of instructors (music education faculty, applied faculty, or other), the pedagogical focus of the class (heterogeneous group, homogeneous group, or individual lesson style content), and the size of the individual music department (including enrollment by major). Similar research into the content and focus of classes specifically listed as “pedagogy” classes required of performance majors might also prove interesting.</p>
<p>For band directors in public school settings, one way to improve the quality of group performance is to recommend that their ensemble members take private lessons to improve their technique and musicianship. It would stand to reason that these directors have a vested interest in finding good-quality private lesson teachers for their students within their community. It is not uncommon for those directors to do some of that teaching themselves outside the normal school day. Respondents in the present study agree with previously surveyed populations of music students and teachers that it is necessary to learn about teaching and that simply being a good performer does not guarantee teaching competence. These college faculty members enjoy teaching, talking about teaching with their students, yet as a group they do not seem to strongly recommend that students take a traditional pedagogy class. It could be that a more broadly based approach is necessary. Music education faculty might find ways to give more music students access to broad-based pedagogical knowledge useful to all teachers. Applied music faculty could infuse systematic discussions of instrument-specific pedagogy into regular lessons over the course of a 4-year undergraduate degree. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1057083711411715">Schmidt (2010)</xref> recently wrote about the importance of combining knowledge with supervised practice in the education of teachers. This may be the most important aspect of the education of future private lesson teachers to consider. Music education and applied lesson faculty might need to work cooperatively to provide opportunities for college music majors to teach lessons augmented by individualized systematic mentoring from applied teachers within the studios. If this or other solutions can be explored, a more uniform approach to the education of musicians to teach in applied lesson settings could be developed.</p>
<p>Possibly some of the most difficult issues faced when attempting to make changes in established curricula are economic and personnel related. Adding more classes that address the teaching of music in private lesson settings is unlikely in the vast majority of music schools and departments. In a <italic>Journal of Music Teacher Education</italic> editor’s commentary, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057083711411715">Fredrickson (2007c)</xref> wrote that for performance faculty, music major “. . . private lessons are the perfect place to talk about the pedagogy of teaching an instrument to all their students” (p. 8). Data from the present study indicate that, within this national sample of college wind and percussion instructors, 78% are already doing this to some extent. To make this natural interaction more focused and systematic, professional organizations such as the Society for Music Teacher Education, the National Association of Schools of Music, the College Music Society, and other groups such as NACWPI that have a natural interest in the process will need to engage in conversations that lead to raising awareness and creating models for this type of teacher education activity. This can allow individual music schools and departments to then find the solutions that work best in their local environment.</p>
