<abstract>
<p>Married couples consisting of female breadwinners and male primary caretakers are increasing in prevalence and visibility. However, little is known about the experiences of these families, particularly about salient challenges and dynamics related to this work–family arrangement. Through inductive qualitative analysis, the current study investigated the identity and adjustment experiences of this subset of working mothers. Fifty-one women responded to open-ended questions about their work and family experiences. The results highlighted psychological, vocational, and sociocultural phenomena related to this particular work–family arrangement including reasons guiding career and family decisions, positive and negative adjustment experiences, and perceptions of stigma. Relevant clinical and workplace policy implications also are provided.</p>

<body>
<p>In recent years, there have been considerable shifts in the distribution of breadwinning and caretaking roles in married couples. The number of stay-at-home fathers in the United States tripled from 49,000 in 1996 to 158,000 in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894845311401744">U.S. Census Bureau, 2009</xref>), with an accompanying number of wives shifting into the primary “breadwinning” role. Concurrently, many women are reporting high motivation to incorporate work and family roles (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894845311401744">Perrone, Wright, &amp; Jackson, 2009</xref>). Existing research has addressed many of the unique challenges and considerations of men who have assumed the primary care-taking role (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894845311401744">Doucet &amp; Merla, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894845311401744">Rochlen, McKelley, Suizzo, &amp; Scaringi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894845311401744">Rochlen, Suizzo, McKelley, &amp; Scaringi, 2008</xref>). However, few researchers have studied the women partners who also are engaged in nontraditional roles as primary earners in their families.</p>
<p>One study found that despite the difficulties in being the sole breadwinner married to a stay-at-home father, women derived a number of benefits in work and family domains. In particular, women noted viewing themselves as more confident and assertive and improving their career options as common benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894845311401744">Grbich, 1994</xref>). One strength of this study was the longitudinal design; however, a notable limitation was the sole inclusion of families who had a “recent” change into this role. The results highlighted Australian women’s return to work in the late 1980s, experiences with home tasks, perceived responses from other people, and changes in their views of self. Given the recent increase of this population in the United States, changing social mores, and the limited attention dedicated to this growing segment of the population, the purpose of this study was to examine aspects of identity and adjustment among working women who are married to stay-at-home fathers. Specifically, we sought to extend existing research on women’s career development and advance knowledge regarding how this work–family arrangement influences women’s careers, their intimate relationships, and their family dynamics.</p>
<sec id="section1-0894845311401744">
<title>Sociocultural Context</title>
<p>The customary lines between traditional gender roles have become arguably less rigid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894845311401744">Perrone et al., 2009</xref>). Historically, work was seen as more central to the lives of men when compared to women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894845311401744">Cinamon &amp; Rich, 2002</xref>); however, among families where women are the primary breadwinners and father stay at home with children, some gender roles appear to be less rigid. While, men tend to work more hours than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894845311401744">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894845311401744">Cinamon &amp; Rich, 2002</xref>), most working women and men in the United States combine both work and family roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894845311401744">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010</xref>). Although men’s traditional role of breadwinner has conferred power and privilege in marital relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894845311401744">Tichenor, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894845311401744">2005</xref>), gender dynamics within families may be altered, as women gain financial freedom and professional status. Notably, some have argued that men’s dominance in the home has persisted despite women’s increased presence in the labor market (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894845311401744">Tichenor, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894845311401744">2005</xref>). Such research in the career development literature has indicated the slow shifting of social mores and sociocultural contexts for women’s roles at home and at work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0894845311401744">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Guiding the current study were two theoretical frameworks with applications to the experiences of women and men occupying nontraditional gender roles. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894845311401744">Barnett and Hyde’s (2001)</xref> “Expansionist Theory” on women, men, family, and work influenced the formation and development of research questions on vocational and psychological experiences. Overall, the theory suggested that multiple roles are generally beneficial for relationship health, mental health, and physical health; moreover, this theory outlined processes that explain how, why, when, and for whom multiple roles can be beneficial. Some processes and constructs reviewed included buffering (e.g., the negative effects of one role buffered by the positive effects of another role), financial effects (e.g., more income predictive of less distress), social support mechanisms (e.g., social support may be enhanced by engaging in multiple roles), and gender-role ideology (e.g., attitudes toward gender roles may influence the extent to which multiple roles are beneficial). This theory informed the development of open-ended questions assessing the nature of multiple roles and associated social supports. Specifically, the questions were posed in an open-ended manner, which allowed women to explain in multiple ways how their work and family roles were beneficial or detrimental.</p>
<p>Second, theory and research related to stigma experiences and perceptions of individuals who occupy nontraditional gender roles also informed the development of this study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894845311401744">Brescoll and Uhlmann (2005)</xref> described how psychological theories and empirical studies have underscored the idea that people respond negatively toward women and men who violate traditional gender norms. Additionally, research suggested that stay-at-home fathers may experience less social support than their employed counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894845311401744">Rochlen, McKelley, &amp; Whittaker, 2010</xref>). A qualitative study of stay-at-home fathers indicated that some fathers experience stigma responses from others, some of which are inflicted by mothers on playgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894845311401744">Rochlen, Suizzo, et al., 2008</xref>). Based on this reasoning, we sought to explore the potential stigma experiences related to nontraditional gender norms, which affect working women with stay-at-home fathers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0894845311401744">
<title>Current Study</title>
<p>Given the paucity of research on this population, the goals of this qualitative study were exploratory in nature and based on tenets of inductive qualitative analysis including representational theme analysis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894845311401744">Roberts, 2001</xref>). Toward this end, the study was executed through a series of open-ended questions that would enable us to hear the voices of women who were pioneers in forging nontraditional roles in heterosexual families.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Eighty-two individuals accessed the online survey. Twenty-eight visits to the site resulted in missing or incomplete data, leaving 54 women who completed the entire survey. The responses of two participants were not included (i.e., participants answering “I don’t know” to every question). Another participant married to a woman was eliminated because the current study included working women with stay-at-home male partners. The final sample included 51 women who were White, highly educated, co-parenting children with a man, in their late 30s (<italic>M</italic> = 37.24, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.87), and financially resourced (47% of sample reported making over 100,000/year). The most popular referral sources were parenting forums (<italic>n</italic> = 14), and “your partner” (<italic>n</italic> = 13). Other women learned of the study through a friend (<italic>n</italic> = 4), websites for working women (<italic>n</italic> = 3), parenting websites (<italic>n</italic> = 3), and other (<italic>n</italic> = 7). The sample was geographically diverse, with participants from the Mideast (<italic>n</italic> = 13), Southeast (<italic>n</italic> = 13), Great Lakes (<italic>n</italic> = 8), Far West (<italic>n</italic> = 5), New England (<italic>n</italic> = 3), Southwest (<italic>n</italic> = 3), and Plains (<italic>n</italic> = 2). Most participants were from suburban (<italic>n</italic> = 25) or urban (<italic>n</italic> = 19) areas, with only four women reporting that they lived in a rural environment. With the exception of four women, all reported holding a Bachelor’s degree or higher levels of education. The majority of participants were married (<italic>N</italic> = 49), with one participant reporting that she was married but separated and two participants reporting living with their partner. Most families had two or fewer children under age 18 living at home (<italic>M</italic> = 1.81, <italic>SD</italic> = .74).</p>

<title>Measures</title>

<title>Open-ended questions</title>
<p>Based on a review of the literature related to Expansionist Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894845311401744">Barnett &amp; Hyde, 2001</xref>) and stigma (Brescoll &amp; Uhlmann, 2005), initial questions were developed about adjustment, positive and negative aspects of the work/family arrangement, and stigma experiences. Four women participated in pilot phone interviews to determine if there were additional concerns or considerations that should be included in the written interview protocol. Based on the pilot data, additional interview questions were developed to examine psychological adjustment, positive and negative aspects of the decision to work outside the home and have their partner take on the primary caretaker role, and reactions of others to this work–family arrangement. Among the three primary investigators, questions were discussed at length and refined until the research team members reached consensus on nine open-ended questions.</p>
<p>Our first question assessed reasons guiding the decision to occupy the role of a working woman with a stay-at-home father. Our second and third questions assessed the positive and negative aspects of the work–family arrangement, with a focus on the specific areas of positive adjustment and dysfunction in these two roles. The fourth and fifth questions addressed how the work–family arrangement affected women’s relationships with their partners and their children. The sixth question addressed how women’s career had been influenced by the work–family arrangement, while the seventh question asked about potential changes at work that might improve their satisfaction. Finally, women responded to two questions related to their perceptions of the cultural context and stigma related to the work family arrangement. The two questions related to experiences with parents and partners were omitted in the analysis section due to poor coder agreement and lack of discreet categories (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0894845311401744">Table 1</xref>
 for the specific seven questions).</p>

<title>Demographic questionnaire</title>
<p>Additional questions were developed to assess age, race/ethnicity, income, education level, geographic location, number of years with partner, number of children in household, age of transition to being a working mother with a stay-at-home partner, and method of referral to study.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0894845311401744">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were recruited through online groups (e.g., “yahoo” parenting groups), parenting websites (e.g., websites offering support and advice for working mothers with stay at-home fathers), and parenting listservs with a focus on working women and/or stay-at-home fathers (e.g., various “yahoo” parenting listservs). These websites and online forums were chosen because they specifically targeted working women or their spouses.</p>
<p>Advertisements were distributed via e-mail or website post, and individuals (e.g., stay-at-home fathers) were encouraged to forward the advertisement about the study to acquaintances or spouses. Participants were asked to read and electronically sign an informed consent form, respond to open-ended questions about their work and family experiences, and complete a demographic questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0894845311401744">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The current study implemented a qualitative approach in which participants answered a series of open-ended questions. In the first phase of data analysis, members of the research team eliminated responses that clearly did not address any aspect of the question (e.g., responded to another question, tangential information, or incoherent sentences). Next, the research team examined the data set and agreed that responses to each of the nine questions clearly represented different domains. Thus, responses were divided by question by a research assistant and reviewed by the first author to facilitate coding into domains. One member of the research team acted as the auditor on the project and reviewed and commented on the coding process.</p>
<p>In forming domains, the researchers reviewed the themes that emerged from participants' written responses. This analytic strategy was consistent with representational theme analysis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894845311401744">Roberts, 2001</xref>). Since qualitative and discovery-oriented research frequently used iterative approaches (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894845311401744">Hill et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894845311401744">Hoyt &amp; Bhati, 2007</xref>), the two coders revisited the domains until consensus was reached after verbal discussions. This type of inductive approach allowed for themes to emerge from the data and has been used widely in qualitative research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894845311401744">Creswell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894845311401744">Hill et al., 2005</xref>). During the analysis phase, we were cognizant of the roles of trustworthiness, credibility, and social validity in the analysis and interpretation of qualitative data (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894845311401744">Morrow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894845311401744">Yeh &amp; Inman, 2007</xref>). Thus, we took measures (e.g., openly discussing biases during the process) to ensure that we examined our reactions to the data and refined the domains to ensure the appropriateness of assignment of responses.</p>

<title>Researchers</title>
<p>The research team consisted of two White women and one White man, one of whom was a doctoral student and two professors in counseling psychology. The research team discussed their thoughts, values, and expectations throughout the research process. We expected that women would present significant strengths and challenges in work and family domains.</p>

<sec id="section14-0894845311401744">
<title>Preliminary Coding</title>
<p>A list of 33 domains across all of the questions was generated independently by two members of the research team for the first 30 respondents. Twenty-four participants' responses were withheld for a stability check and for subsequent coding. Two coders discussed these domains and arrived at a consensus for all questions.</p>
<p>Two members of the research team independently reviewed the first 1/3 of responses (<italic>N</italic> = 17 participants). For each of the nine questions, we assigned the responses into a list of domains and met via conference calls to discuss the coding process across the first 1/3 of participants. We created minor revisions among the domains. For example, a domain “Stereotypes/Gender norms” was added to the question about others' reactions to work–family arrangement. We clarified other domains and provided examples and elaboration with the intent of improving consensus for subsequent coding. The auditor reviewed the list of domains and suggested minor clarifications. After reviewing feedback from the auditor, the two members of the research team agreed on the coding for the first 17 responses.</p>

<sec id="section15-0894845311401744">
<title>Subsequent Coding Into Themes</title>
<p>After agreeing on the coding for the first 17 responses, two members of the research team independently reviewed the remaining data and assigned responses across the 9 questions to themes. Initially, there was less than 90% agreement between the coders. Hence, we reexamined the responses and revised the themes again. Revisions were made to themes based on discussions and auditor feedback. This iterative process of reviewing the data until consensus is reached was consistent with tenets of qualitative research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894845311401744">Hill et al., 2005</xref>). The first author reviewed the responses between the two coders among the remaining 37 responses across 9 questions. After revisions, the responses were coded into themes again, resulting in greater than 90% agreement for all questions except one (impact on partner/relationship). Based on consistently poor agreement regarding the coding of the data into themes, the data associated with this question were eliminated. During the final iteration of the consensus process, the team also discarded the question regarding the relationship with one’s children due to poor interrater agreement.</p>

<sec id="section17-0894845311401744">
<title>Reasons Guiding the Work–Family Arrangement Decision</title>
<p>Women provided a range of reasons regarding the decision to enter the work–family arrangement. The majority, however, reflected economic reasons (<italic>n</italic> = 40; e.g., “I have more earning power”). A second common response endorsed by 15 women referenced partner fit (e.g., one partner is better suited for role). For instance, one participant noted, “He naturally has the personality better suited to care for our child. He is easily able to spend 3–4 hours at the playground interacting with her, making the playtime completely enjoyable for both of them.” Relatedly, some commented on their own struggles with parenting. One woman wrote, “I am too type A to stay home with kids. I could not envision myself doing it; even during my maternity I was going stir-crazy. My husband handles unstructured time without adult interaction much better than I.”</p>
<p>A third commonly endorsed reason was values-based, particularly in reference to the importance of having one at-home parent (<italic>n</italic> = 11). This perception was occasionally accompanied by neutral to negative attitudes toward day care. One participant responded, “My husband and I felt that it was a first priority to have a parent at home with our children,” while another woman wrote, “I would much rather my husband take care of my kids than some stranger.” A number of women (<italic>n</italic> = 9) cited work opportunities and career salience as guiding factors in their decision. A participant commented, “Primarily the reason was guided by the fact that I am ambitious and enjoy a satisfying career while he always hated working and office politics.” Fewer participants (<italic>n</italic> = 7) mentioned disability (e.g., “Husband has since developed physical health problems, and had long-standing mental health problems diagnosed”), and other conditions related to husbands' career experiences (e.g., “He was also burned out on working full time in his chosen profession so it made sense for him to be the one to stay at home”) as important factors.</p>

<sec id="section18-0894845311401744">
<title>Advantage of the Work–Family Relationship</title>
<p>Regarding perceived advantages of the work–family relationship, three themes were identified. The first, endorsed by 37 women, pertained to how the decision supported and reinforced central parenting-related values. For example, participants noted a strong preference of one parent raising the child. A sample response included, “A parent is raising the kids—not a paid caregiver. My husband is very attentive to my children’s needs.” Another participant described the overall well-being of their child, “My children are happy, healthy and secure. My husband is a very involved, tuned in dad.”</p>
<p>An additional type of values-related response reflected the importance of raising children without gender-related stereotypes. One participant indicated their decisions allowed for promotion of a more egalitarian and feminist lifestyle:<disp-quote>
<p>The arrangement expresses our feminism and our high value of child rearing and caring for a home. My parents didn’t think that a woman would ever be responsible for less than half of the housework. I’m young enough that I still enjoy proving them wrong.</p>
</disp-quote>The second broad theme reflected the convenience of the arrangement, in allowing for more family time, and an improved home environment (<italic>n</italic> = 24). Examples included “I like not having to schlep the kids and all their stuff to and from day care,” and “We don’t have to rush all of the house type chores into two days of the weekend. We can spend weekends as family time.”</p>
<p>The last theme addressed career-related opportunities, in particular flexibility and freedom (<italic>n</italic> = 16), for example, “I have more freedom to work longer and am freed up from concerns when my kids get sick or need someone there for them.” Furthermore, responses in this theme often reflected increased opportunities for promotion, exiting work opportunities, and work flexibility. For instance, one participant responded, “Flexibility to focus on going above and beyond in my professional life to be more successful.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0894845311401744">
<title>Disadvantages of the Work–Family Relationship</title>
<p>Eight themes emerged relating to disadvantages of the work–family arrangement. The first and most common reflected broad reports of individual stress or negative emotions (<italic>n</italic> = 22). Many emphasized isolation and loneliness as typified by one mother who wrote, “I find it isolating. I have no peer group. All the stay-at-home moms in the neighborhood have little in common with me. That part is hard.” Other negative responses reflected general frustration pertaining to having a less influential voice or role at home. One mother wrote, “I feel my voice as a parent holds less weight than my husband’s. Most of the time these emotions are figments of my own imagination, but they can still hurt.”</p>
<p>A second theme reflected more specific concerns indicating frustrations and disappointments with either the cleanliness of the home or other home care tasks. The stress surrounding this issue was often associated with a giving up of control of the home. One woman described this frustration in her response, “The house does not stay as clean as I feel it should. This is a common complaint with working women with stay-at-home fathers. Guys just do things differently. My husband does a wonderful job with the children… so the house suffers… this too will pass.” Another woman expressed frustrations that she was still responsible for a considerable amount of the home care tasks: “My husband also doesn’t really take care of the house like a traditional stay-at-home mom would. So I often feel like I have to spend my time at home cleaning instead of paying attention to our son. Honestly, that makes me a little bitter.”</p>
<p>The third theme represented negative experiences related to missing children’s milestones (<italic>n</italic> = 17). Examples included, “feeling left out of certain milestones and key events” and “missing kids.” Other representative responses indicated women’s inclination to revert back to more traditional roles. Examples included, “I would like to be the one at home” and “I miss them during the day and have built up resentment for having to leave them all day and then have to come home and not have quality time with them because of getting dinner ready, cleaning up, baths, etc.”</p>
<p>The fourth theme was characterized by an explicit description of the financial burden associated with having one income (<italic>n</italic> = 13). One participant noted, “There is a lot of pressure being the sole breadwinner. If things are bad at work and I feel like there’s a possibility I might lose my job, then I get really stressed.”</p>
<p>A fifth theme involved specific comments about relationship stress (<italic>n</italic> = 7). This included discussions surrounding parenting roles, who had it “harder” and general marital discord. In one woman’s response, the fighting seemed to be related to their nontraditional roles, “We often fight because we have nontraditional roles.” Other responses reflected negative sentiment toward their partner: “Feel jealous of husband.”</p>
<p>A sixth theme indicated that some participants had experienced negative reactions related to others' responses, most notably workforce and community-based stigma (<italic>n</italic> = 7). One woman noted, “I would say that the only real con is that stay-at-home dads are not considered socially acceptable.” Another participant reflected the negative reactions she experienced among her family in her response, “My family, particularly my parents and older siblings, do not understand our arrangement and have criticized it several times.” For other women, the negative responses seemed to come from coworkers as reflected in the following response, “The comments that I get from people who don’t understand the situation at work. They are very judgmental and feel that it just isn’t right.”</p>
<p>The last two themes represented concerns about husbands' reentry into the workforce (<italic>n</italic> = 2) or the children being excluded or suffering in some way (<italic>n</italic> = 2). For example, one participant commented, “I fear my husband will have a very hard time getting back into the workforce when he chooses to based on the fact that being a stay-at-home dad is not accepted by everyone.” Related to children’s suffering, another participant commented, “The kids do not get as much interaction away from school with some friends because their mothers do not socialize outside of school with my husband.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0894845311401744">
<title>Impact on Career</title>
<p>Four themes emerged regarding how the work–family arrangement influenced the women’s careers. Notably, the results in this section were quite favorable related to women’s career development, with a total of 26 positive responses. Work place flexibility responses were common. One mother wrote, “I can travel without any arrangements being needed. I can stay late without any arrangements. I never feel guilty about leaving the kid(s) with a care provider, because it is their father.” In talking about the impact of this flexibility, she added, “There is no doubt my career has moved faster than it would have without a stay-at-home parent.”</p>
<p>A total of eight participants expressed various negative career-related sentiments. A few of these responses seemed to note that they could benefit from spending more time at work, but feel pressure and guilt about returning home. One mother noted, “I would like to be more involved with work activities after hours, but I skip most often so I can get home and relieve my husband. I am very aware, when I do work late, that he is waiting at home for me impatiently.” Other women noted that the negative impact at work connected with her breadwinner status. This was seen in representative responses including, “I’ve had to be more concerned about how much money I make and maintaining my job security” and “It’s made me feel quite anxious about being the sole source of support.” Finally, a total of nine participants noted no impact on work as typified by one woman who wrote, “It hasn’t made a difference.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0894845311401744">
<title>Suggested Work Changes</title>
<p>Participants articulated a number of changes at work, which might facilitate the work–family arrangement. Many women expressed desire for greater flexibility/less work (<italic>n</italic> = 21). One participant commented, “I would enjoy more time with my family either through part-time work or flex work options.” Fifteen participants mentioned additional suggestions that varied considerably including less travel, better health insurance, a shorter commute, less stress, and dedicated areas for nursing infants. A total of 11 participants said that there were no clear suggestions for their employers, while 5 women cited increased pay.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0894845311401744">
<title>Others' Reactions</title>
<p>Participants articulated five different themes related to others' reactions to their work–family arrangement. The majority of the responses (<italic>n</italic> = 28) noted that others' reaction to their work–family arrangement was generally positive and affirming. This is reflected in such short responses as, “Most people think it’s great,” “Very supportive—work, family, nod friends,” and “Accepting, intrigued for the most part.” Within this generally supportive theme, a few participants connected curiosity in others responses with the support as reflected by one participant who said, “Wow, that’s great—how does he like it?”</p>
<p>A second common theme described by 20 of the participants was misunderstanding or judgment. The misunderstanding from others was communicated in one woman’s response who wrote, “My parents don’t approve or understand. They worry there is too much financial pressure on me and feel it is not fair.” This response also included perceptions of the father “<italic>having it easy</italic>” in their role of stay-at-home fathers. One participant expanded on this reaction by noting “the usual comments I get are ‘Wow, where do you sign up for that?’ by other men. Participants also articulated negative reactions from other women. For instance, “My husband has it tougher on his end. He doesn’t take our daughter to any play groups because he felt like the moms were unfriendly; they didn’t really want him in their mom group.” Another women responded, “Others think it is strange or think my husband must be ‘lazy’ or not quite so ‘manly’ or something.”</p>
<p>Another common theme was jealous or envious responses, reflected by 13 participants. One woman briefly noted, “With jealousy (particularly from other women): Wow, I wish I had someone who cooked dinner for me very night,” whereas another responded, “Most women think the world of my husband because they admit that their husband isn’t man enough to do what he does.” Finally, another woman specifically noted other men’s reactions in her comment, “Men think it is cool and say they are jealous and want to be the at-home dad.”</p>
<p>Our fourth theme represented in 11 participants' responses involved reactions characterized by curiosity, surprise, or shock. Representative responses include, “Many people are still surprised at our arrangement” and “Wow, really he is a stay-at-home dad—how is that?” Other responses indicated a curiosity at how the couple made the decision as reflected by one woman’s response, “Surprised and interested in how and why we decided to do it.”</p>
<p>A final theme pertained to reactions with a specific mention of gender-based stereotypes relevant to gender roles (<italic>n</italic> = 8). Examples included, “We’ve had a few older relatives who were unhappy to see a mother ‘choose’ to work rather than be with her children.” Another responded, “Others have questioned whether a man can do the ‘at-home provider’ role successfully.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0894845311401744">
<title>Stigma Descriptions</title>
<p>Four different themes emerged from participants' descriptions of stigma from others related to the work–family arrangement. Seventeen women reported stigma being directed toward their husbands including perceptions of something being wrong with their spouses. One woman noted, “My husband must be a free loader and can’t be as good as a woman to be the stay-at-home parent.” Another respondent commented, “People always assume that dad must have failed at something to end up in this position. They can’t believe a man would simply put his family first as most moms do.” Notably, 17 women noted either no stigma response or other responses that could not clearly be identified as reflecting stigma.</p>
<p>Nine women described stigma directed at them, as working women. Women reported experiencing stigma from other women, “The only stigma I have felt is from stay-at-home moms in the neighborhood or at school. Occasionally there’s a snarky comment about the fact that I can’t do certain things during the day with the kids because I’m at work.” Other reactions seemed to pertain to a lack of involvement in the homecare responsibilities. One vivid example of this was shared by one woman:<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve been told that it’s clear that my house “lacks a woman’s touch” and that my children’s appearances show that their mother is not getting them ready in the morning. I’ve also been snubbed by the mothers of children in my kids' classes in social settings.</p>
</disp-quote>Finally, two women reported experiencing institutional stigma. One participant commented, “Even though I am the main breadwinner, important documents or correspondence (i.e., home mortgage, bank loans, car loans) either are in HIS name or come addressed to him.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study illuminated the psychological and vocational experiences of full-time working women whose partners stay at home as primary child caregivers. The results describe the complex reasons guiding the decision-making process related to the work–family arrangement and subsequent adjustment concerns in personal and vocational domains.</p>
<p>Identifying the reasons guiding women’s decision to assume the role of primary breadwinner advances existing knowledge regarding why families have transitioned to nontraditional gender roles. Specifically, more than 80% of the women cited economic reasons as a primary reason guiding the decision for the work–family arrangement. Many of the same women who expressed financial concerns related to the work–family arrangement also commented that they derive a sense of joy and personal satisfaction from their work. A number of working women with at-home fathers endorsed the belief that their partner was better suited to undertake domestic obligations. This finding was consistent with research on stay-at-home fathers, many of whom have cited having achieved financial and professional success, and subsequently seeking fulfillment in areas outside of work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894845311401744">Doucet &amp; Merla, 2007</xref>). This finding also is consistent with Expansionist Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894845311401744">Barnett &amp; Hyde, 2001</xref>), and predictions that multiple roles are generally beneficial.</p>
<p>When asked about the positive and negative aspects of their work–family arrangement, participants expressed a wide range of reactions that were consistent with theory predicting that mothers fall along a dynamic continuum of feeling empowered, and experiencing a burden of responsibility related to their mothering role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894845311401744">Oberman &amp; Josselson, 1996</xref>). As predicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894845311401744">Barnett and Hyde’s (2001)</xref> Expansionist Theory, these findings highlighted some of the circumstances under which multiple roles were beneficial.</p>
<p>Specifically, many women commented that they have been able to thrive at work because of their partner’s role as a caregiver. These women appeared to derive psychological (e.g., diminished anxiety and guilt about work–family conflict) and vocational (e.g., career development opportunities) benefits from their partner’s involvement in domestic labor (e.g., cooking, cleaning, and child care). Such experiences appear to indicate enhancement in both work and family domains as a result of the work–family arrangement, a finding consistent with work–family enrichment theory (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894845311401744">Greenhaus &amp; Powell, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, a number of responses conveyed feelings of empowerment related to exposing their children to nontraditional and egalitarian gender role models. These findings can be interpreted in the context of research on formative experiences related to career development among children and adolescents. For example, the career development of children and adolescents appears to be shaped by early family experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894845311401744">Whiston &amp; Keller, 2004</xref>). In particular, children of employed mothers seem likely to consider nontraditional occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894845311401744">Whiston &amp; Keller, 2004</xref>). This finding has been corroborated by qualitative research that has linked nontraditional role models with career development among notable Latinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894845311401744">Gomez et al., 2001</xref>). Many of the women in the current study appeared to have a sense of pride in their ability to transmit their progressive and egalitarian values and beliefs, along with their firsthand knowledge about women’s occupational options, to their children. These findings also seem consistent with Expansionist Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894845311401744">Barnett &amp; Hyde, 2001</xref>), as nontraditional women occupying multiple roles may derive benefits when they feel a sense of empowerment.</p>
<p>The women in this study also described a host of negative reactions to their experiences in managing multiple roles at work and home. Although multiple roles associated with the work–family arrangement may be beneficial for women by promoting healthy psychological functioning, Expansionist Theory suggested that there may be “upper limits” when demands become excessive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894845311401744">Barnett &amp; Hyde, 2001</xref>). The findings reflected the bind that women oftentimes face in having to choose between excelling at work and being a full-time mother (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894845311401744">Crittenden, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894845311401744">Schultheiss, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894845311401744">Shapiro, Ingols, &amp; Blake-Beard, 2008</xref>). Moreover, perceived stress related to the burden of being the sole breadwinner in the family was cited by a number of women as an injurious source of psychological stress related to the work–family arrangement. This was consistent with a recent longitudinal study of working mothers, which implicated maternal work stress, negative family-to-work spillover in depressive symptoms among employed mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894845311401744">Goodman &amp; Crouter, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with Expansionist Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894845311401744">Barnett &amp; Hyde, 2001</xref>), a number of participants reported benefiting at work; however, it is possible that role strain, role overload, and multiple role stress may diminish the enriching effects of being a wife, mother, and employee. For many women, negative reactions related to being the sole breadwinner were consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894845311401744">Tichenor’s (2005)</xref> findings that women’s financial power may become a liability rather than an asset in a relationship. Some women appeared to feel distress related to their sense of obligation to preserve their self- identity as being a “good mother” and a “good wife.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, the findings illuminated how stigma operates among working mothers in relationships with at-home dads. The existing literature on stay-at-home dads has described stigma as communicating negative social gaze, social scrutiny, misunderstanding, and ignorance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894845311401744">Doucet, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894845311401744">Rochlen et al., 2010</xref>). The finding that women experienced stigma related to their work–family arrangement was consistent with research and theory related to gender and household labor, which suggested that domestic duties are still considered “women’s work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894845311401744">Poortman &amp; Van Der Lippe, 2009</xref>). Recent findings on attitudes toward household labor have suggested that in general, women hold more favorable views toward household work than men (e.g., cooking, cleaning, and child care) and feel more responsible for these tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894845311401744">Poortman &amp; Van Der Lippe, 2009</xref>). Similarly, some women in this study felt obligated to engage in domestic tasks in addition to their job-related responsibilities. While many women described active engagement in domestic responsibilities and home care tasks, they perceived stigma related to their role in the work–family arrangement. A number of women articulated sentiments of isolation and stigma coupled with internal distress that their partners lacked adequate social support in the community. These findings were consistent with research on the lack of social support experienced by stay-at-home fathers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894845311401744">Rochlen et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, some women elaborated on feeling unsupported, misunderstood, and judged by others, an experience that was based on their perception that mothers who are breadwinners are labeled as being exceedingly career-driven and consequently neglectful of “motherly duties” and domestic responsibilities. Such stigma perceptions described by mothers were consistent with research which suggested that motherhood may be perceived as a disadvantage in the workplace, in that mothers are perceived as less competent, less committed to work but are nevertheless held to higher standards than other applicants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894845311401744">Correll, Benard, &amp; Paik, 2007</xref>). For instance, mothers have been penalized financially for their parental status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894845311401744">Glass, 2004</xref>). One explanation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894845311401744">Correll and colleagues (2007)</xref> proposed was that fatherhood, as opposed to motherhood, is viewed as compatible with being a “good worker.”</p>
<p>Although the results suggested that stigma among working mothers was common, a sizable portion of the sample denied personal stigma experiences. One possible reason may be linked to evolving gender ideologies in the United States toward egalitarianism in the workplace (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894845311401744">Zuo &amp; Tang, 2000</xref>). This type of egalitarian explanation was supported by the women in the sample who commented that they did not experience stigma, and in addition, they believed that their career benefited as a consequence of their work–family arrangement. Another potential reason for the lack of perceived discrimination might be accounted for by cognitive dissonance theory. For instance, consciously identifying stigma experiences (e.g., others discriminate against me based on my work–family arrangement and think I am a bad mother) is dissonant with beliefs associated with working mothers' positive self-concept (e.g., I am a good mother and employee). The discomfort associated with these conflicting ideas could be reduced by the overt denial of stigma experiences. By rationalizing that stigma does not exist, participants may be avoiding contending with their decision to elect a work–family arrangement that requires substantial effort and investment of personal resources. Alternatively, women who have partners who stay at home and care for the children may be afforded some of the benefits in the workplace that men who have secondary responsibility for their children have received as they may be perceived as more serious about work than women who share (or have primary) responsibility for their children.</p>
<sec id="section25-0894845311401744">
<title>Implications for Workplace Policy and Clinical Practice</title>
<p>The findings suggested that policy aimed at facilitating the work–family interface for working women may need to be multifaceted. Participants provided ideas for various changes in workplace policy, including work flexibility (hours, schedule, and location), increased vacation time, and working fewer hours. Specific suggestions included telecommuting, provision of technical infrastructure to support working from home working from home, less travel, longer maternity leaves, day care at work, shorter commutes, shorter work weeks, and more time off.</p>
<p>Additionally, the results highlighted important areas of assessment, exploration, and intervention for career counselors and mental health practitioners. Career counselors should be aware of the psychological consequences of role strain and stigma experienced by many female breadwinners. Mental health practitioners might consider exploring affect including potential negative (e.g., feelings of guilt, shame, jealousy, or resentment related to the work–family arrangement), and positive (e.g., joy, pride, ambition, and self-efficacy related to occupying multiple roles) reactions to the work–family arrangement. Practitioners also might consider implementing assertiveness training to empower working women to communicate their needs to their employers (e.g., flextime), and their spouses (e.g., domestic responsibilities). Perhaps most notably, assertiveness training might facilitate direct confrontation and challenging of stigma-based responses described by many women in the sample.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>There are a number of limitations associated with this study. This sample was highly educated and White, and represents only one subset of working women whose partners stay at home with their children. Although a geographically diverse sample was obtained, the participants may be more connected to online or community-based supports for breadwinning women than women with less education or fewer financial resources. Also, a subset of women who work full-time may not have had time to participate in research as they may be overwhelmed by work and family responsibilities.</p>
<p>This study is among the first to investigate work and family experiences in women with stay at home fathers, future research should engage in theory development and testing by utilizing mixed method approaches (i.e., both qualitative and quantitative methods). Using existing measures of work and family functioning coupled with the development of new measures (e.g., perception of support from partner related to work–family role) can propel this line of research forward. Potentially fruitful areas of research include exploration of the effects of stigma on women’s mental health and vocational functioning, along with the development and implementation of interventions that can enhance positive work and family experiences and minimize distress.</p>
<p>To conclude, our research found that, overall, women whose husbands are stay-at-home fathers reported positive work and family outcomes. Most women chose this arrangement for economic reasons and consistency with beliefs and values regarding the importance of parents being the primary caregivers of children. The careers of these women have been impacted favorably, and although there were reports of stress and negative responses from others, most people were generally supportive and positive regarding this nontraditional arrangement. Future research should continue to examine alternative work–family roles to advance understanding of how women and men transform their workplaces, homes, and communities.</p>
