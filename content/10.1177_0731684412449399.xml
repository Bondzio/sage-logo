<abstract>
<p>In this article, the effect of alkali treatment (with 5 wt. % sodium hydroxide solution for 30 min) on the compressive, in-plane shear, impact properties and vibration characteristics of flax- and linen-fabric reinforced epoxy composites was investigated. Test results show that alkali treatment enhanced the compressive strength and compressive modulus, in-plane shear strength and shear modulus, and specific impact strength of both flax- and linen-epoxy composites. However, after the treatment, the impact strength and damping ratio of the flax and linen composites decreased. The reduction in impact strength and damping ratio is believed to be attributed to the improved fibre/matrix interfacial adhesion, as analysed by scanning electron microscope.</p>

<p>There has been a growing interest in the use of bio-fibres to replace manmade carbon/glass fibres as reinforcement in polymer composites for engineering application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412449399">1</xref></sup> The advantages of bio-fibres are they are cost-effective, have low energy consumption, biodegradability, low density with high specific strength and stiffness and are readily available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412449399">2</xref></sup> In the recent years, research on nano-composites shows that bio-composites have the potential as the next generation of structural materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412449399">3</xref></sup> Currently, bio-composites are mainly applied in the automotive industry. There was approximately 43,000 tonnes of bio-fibres utilized as reinforcement materials of composites in the European Union (EU) in 2003.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412449399">4</xref></sup> This amount increased to around 315,000 tonnes in 2010, which accounted for 13% of the total reinforcement materials (glass, carbon and natural fibres) in fibre-reinforced composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412449399">5</xref></sup> The explosive consumption in bio-composites is an indication of their wider application in the future.</p>
<p>Among the bio-fibres, flax is a promising candidate to replace glass fibre. The tensile strength of flax fibres were reported up to 1500 MPa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412449399">6</xref></sup> Physical/mechanical properties of some bio-fibres and manmade fibres are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412449399">Table 1</xref>. Romhány et al. investigated the tensile fracture and failure behaviour of technical flax fibres. They found that the failure mechanism of flax fibre is a complex sequence consisting of axial splitting of the technical fibre along its elementary constituents, radial cracking of the elementary fibres and multiple fracture of the elementary fibres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412449399">7</xref></sup> Bos et al. concluded that the flax fibre had a complex structure, which consisted of cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectin, lignin and other components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412449399">8</xref></sup>

<p>Flax fibres as composite reinforcement are not considered only in the form of monofilament configuration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412449399">9</xref></sup> Polymer matrix, reinforced by woven flax fabric, is the form of composites used commonly in structural applications such as boats. It is reported that a 50% (by volume) flax fibre racing boat had completed the France-to-Brazil Transat race in 15th place.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412449399">10</xref></sup> The success in fabrication of the boat is attributed to the fact that the woven flax fabric allows the control of fibre orientation and quality control, good reproducibility and high productivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412449399">11</xref></sup> Assarar et al. confirmed that the tensile stress and strain at failure of flax fabric reinforced polymer composites were 300 MPa and 1.8%, respectively – putting them close to glass fibre reinforced polymer composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684412449399">12</xref></sup> Liu and Hughes studied the toughness of flax fabric reinforced epoxy composites and concluded that the fibre volume fraction dominates the toughness, rather than the microstructural arrangement of the fibre.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412449399">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bio-composites have been applied in automotive and boat engineering. However, based on the best knowledge of the author, to date rarely study on bio-composites in civil engineering has been reported. In fact, conventional construction materials such as concrete and steel reinforcement have some significant effects on the environment. In the United Kingdom (UK), construction process and building use not only consume the most energy of all sectors and create the most CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, they also create the most waste, use most non-energy-related resources and are responsible for the most pollution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412449399">14</xref></sup> To reduce these negative environmental effects of conventional construction materials, bio-composites as potential construction material are being investigated.</p>
<p>This article, as a part of on-going research to study the feasibility of bio-composites as construction material, investigated the vibration characteristics (damping ratio and natural frequency) and the mechanical properties (with respect to compressive strength, compressive modulus, in-plane shear stress and shear modulus, and the impact strength and specific impact strength) of flax and linen fabric reinforced epoxy composites. In addition, the effect of alkali treatment (with 5 wt. % sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution for 30 min) on the mechanical properties and the vibration characteristics of the composites were evaluated.</p>

<p>Commercial woven flax and linen fabrics were used because of their wide availability. Flax fabric with areal weight of 550 g/m<sup>2</sup> was obtained from Libeco, Belgium. Linen fabric with areal weight of 350 g/m<sup>2</sup> was obtained from Hemptech, New Zealand. Both flax and linen are plain weave fabrics. Flax fabric has count of 7.4 threads/cm in warp and 7.4 threads/cm in the weft direction. Linen fabric has count of 10 threads/cm in warp and 10 threads/cm in the weft direction. The epoxy used is the SP High Modulus Prime 20LV epoxy system. The fabric structures and details for the resin system could be found in previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412449399">15</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0731684412449399"><title>Alkali treatment</title>
<p>Initially, flax and linen fabrics were cut into a size of 400 × 300 mm<sup>2</sup>. For alkali-treated specimens, flax and linen fabrics were washed three times with fresh water to remove contaminants and then dried at room temperature for 48 h. The dried fabrics were then immersed in 5 wt. % NaOH solution (20°C) for 30 min, followed by washing 10 times with fresh water and subsequently three times with distilled water, to remove the remaining NaOH solution. Finally, these fabrics were dried at 80°C in an oven for 24 h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0731684412449399"><title>Composite fabrication</title>
<p>All the composites were manufactured by vacuum bagging technique. It consists of an initial hand lay-up of a fibre preform and then impregnation of the preform with resin in a flexible bag in which negative pressure is generated by a vacuum pump. Next, the composites were cured at room temperature for 24 h and placed into the Elecfurn oven for curing at 65°C for 7 h.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0731684412449399"><title>Fibre volume fraction</title>
<p>Density of the mixed epoxy given by the supplier was 1.08 g/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412449399">3</xref></sup>.

<sec id="sec7-0731684412449399"><title>Vibration test of composites</title>
<p>As a construction material, the damping of the material is an important parameter related to the study of vibration of a structure. Damping of a composite can be defined as the decay of the composite in vibrations. It is interpreted as the dissipation of the vibration energy. Damping plays an important role in controlling the structure from excessive vibrations due to dynamic loadings. Therefore, understanding the vibration characteristic of FRP composite material, like damping, has industrial significance. Damping ratio – a dimensionless measure of damping – is a property of the composite that also depends on its mass and stiffness. Vibration test was conducted by using an accelerometer to detect the dynamic characteristics of the composite plates. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412449399">Figure 1</xref> gives a schematic view of the vibration test system. Three specimens with a size of 250 × 25 × 5 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412449399">3</xref></sup> (length × wide × thickness) for each composite was clamped in the form of cantilever beams with 225 mm effective length span; the accelerometer was attached on the free-end side of each cantilever laminiate, and then stimulated the free vibration. The vibration acceleration time histories were recorded by the data acquisition software with a computer. The logarithmic decrement is used for calculating the damping ratio <italic>ξ</italic> of cantilever laminates from the recorded acceleration time histories based on the following equation:

The average damping ratio and average natural frequency of all the composites are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684412449399">Table 3</xref>. It shows that both flax and linen fabric reinforced polymer composites exhibit a similar pattern in damping ratio, namely, the damping ratio of the untreated composite is larger than the alkali-treated one. Alkali treatment has a negative effect on damping ratio of both flax and linen composites; the decrease in damping ratio of flax- and linen-epoxy composite is 7.4% and 9.3%, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684412449399">Table 3</xref>). For all the considered composites, the untreated flax-epoxy composite has the largest damping ratio of 1.48 %. With respect to natural frequency, it is observed that both flax and linen composites possess a smaller natural frequency than the corresponding treated one. Compared with the untreated composite, the increase in natural frequency of the treated composite is believed to be attributed to the fact that the alkali treatment reduced the mass (a lower density in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684412449399">Table 2</xref>) and increased the stiffness of the composite.

<p>Damping defines the energy dissipation capability of a material. The damping of fabric reinforced polymer composite is believed attributed to the presence of air voids (e.g. the inherent lumens of the fibres), the viscoelastic characteristics of epoxy matrix and/or the fibre materials and the interphase between the matrix and the fibre. Interphase is defined as the region adjacent to fibre surface all along the fibre length.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412449399">22</xref></sup> Interphase possesses a considerable thickness and its properties are different from those of embedded fibres and matrix. It is true that the mechanical properties (e.g. tensile and flexural properties) of fabric fibre reinforced polymer composites are highly dependent on the matrix/fibre interphase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412449399">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fibre/matrix interphases also affect the damping of the composites. The decrease in damping ratio of the treated composites may be attributed to the fact that alkali treatment leads to better fibre/matrix interfaces. For untreated composites, there are more voids or gaps at the fibre/matrix interfaces. In the vibration, more energy has been dissipated due to the internal friction between the fibres and the matrices where more fibre/matrix interfaces are involved, and thereby leads to a larger damping ratio of the composites. After alkali treatment, the fibre/matrix interfacial adhesion was improved. Consequently, the gaps at the fibre/matrix interfaces were narrowed and resulted in less energy dissipation in the vibration. SEM micrographs of the untreated and treated flax composites are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412449399">Figure 3</xref>. For the untreated composite, there are noticeable gaps between the adjacent fibres and the matrices; this indicates a poor fibre/matrix interfacial adhesion. These noticeable gaps are responsible for dissipating energy by fibre/matrix friction during the vibration. The insignificant gaps between the fibre and the matrix indicate the improved interfacial adhesion, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412449399">Figure 3</xref>(b).</p>

<sec id="sec14-0731684412449399"><title>Compressive properties of composites</title>
<p>A comparison of compressive strength and compressive modulus between pure epoxy and the composites is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412449399">Figure 4</xref>. The ultimate compressive strengths of all the untreated and alkali-treated composites are highly dependent on the strength of the epoxy matrix, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412449399">Figure 4</xref>(a). The compressive strength of untreated flax- and linen-epoxy composite is 90.32 MPa and 78.64 MPa, respectively, compared with the pure epoxy (68 MPa). For compressive modulus, it can be seen that the stiffness of all untreated/treated composites mainly depends on the fibres, as the compressive modulus of the epoxy is 1.13 GPa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412449399">Figure 4</xref>(b)). Compared with the untreated composites, both alkali-treated flax and linen composites have an increase in compressive strength and compressive modulus; the increase in strength is 3.0% and 4.6%, respectively. The increase in modulus is 7.8% and 4.8%, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684412449399">Table 3</xref>). The enhancement in compressive properties of flax- and linen-epoxy composites by alkali treatment is possibly due to the improved fibre/matrix interfacial adhesion, since alkali treatment removes the hydrophilic nature of the cellulose fibre and thus improves the interfacial bonding.
<fig id="fig4-0731684412449399" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Compressive strength and compressive modulus of all the composites.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412449399-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The compressive stress–strain curves of all the composites are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412449399">Figure 5</xref>. It can be seen that the behaviour of all the untreated/alkali-treated flax and linen fabric reinforced epoxy composites under compressive loading is non-linear. Three regions could be defined approximately. In the first region, all the specimens show a linear relationship between the stress and strain. In the second region, the curves exhibit a non-linear pattern before approaching the ultimate stress. The third post-peak curves go down with a continuous increase in strains; this reveals a ductile behaviour. The predominated failure mechanism observed in the compression test was fibre micro-buckling. It should be noted here that the strains at break of all the untreated/alkali-treated flax and linen composites are more than 8%.
<fig id="fig5-0731684412449399" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Compressive stress–strain curve of all the composites.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412449399-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0731684412449399"><title>In-plane shear properties of composites</title>
<p>The in-plane shear stress–strain behaviour for both untreated and alkali-treated flax- and linen-epoxy composites is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412449399">Figure 6</xref>. The average shear strength and average shear modulus of all the composites are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684412449399">Table 3</xref>. The flax/epoxy composite has a larger shear strength and shear modulus than the linen-epoxy composite. The shear strength and modulus of untreated flax- and linen-epoxy composites is 38.0 MPa and 2.07 GPa, and 34.06 MPa and 1.84 GPa, respectively.
<fig id="fig6-0731684412449399" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Shear stress–strain behaviour of flax- and linen-epoxy composites.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412449399-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>After alkali treatment, the shear strength and shear modulus of both flax- and linen-epoxy composites increased. Compared to the untreated composite, the treated flax and linen composite experienced 8.2% and 4.7% increase in strength and 4.2% and 4.9% increase in shear modulus, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684412449399">Table 3</xref>). The alkali treatment removes the impurities and waxy substances from the fibre surface and creates a rougher topography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412449399">Figure 3</xref>) which facilitates the mechanical interlocking. In addition, the purified fibre surface further enhances the chemical bonding between the fibre and epoxy matrix because a purified fibre surface enables more hydrogen bonds to be formed between the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose at one side and the epoxy groups at the other side. As a consequence of the treatment, the fibre/matrix interfacial bonding quality is improved and leads to better in-plane shear properties of the composites.</p>
<p>The stress–strain curves can be divided approximately into two zones. The first zone up to 0.3% strain has a purely elastic behaviour, allowing measurement of the modulus. The second zone is a non-linear zone until leading to the maximum shear stress. All the specimens were failed because of matrix cracking and fibre breakage.</p>

<sec id="sec16-0731684412449399"><title>Impact properties of composites</title>
<p>Impact strength of a material is defined as its ability to resist the fracture under stress applied at high speed. The impact behaviour of a composite is significantly influenced by the interfacial bond strength, the matrix and fibre properties. The damage process caused by impact load energy is dissipated by fibre/matrix debonding, matrix fracture and fibre pull-out and fibre fracture, as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412449399">Figure 7</xref>. It is observed that the impact strength of the untreated flax composite (36.53 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>) is larger than the untreated linen composite (30.62 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>), as given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684412449399">Table 3</xref>. The difference in impact strength of flax- and linen-epoxy composites is attributable to the different areal weights of the fabrics.
<fig id="fig7-0731684412449399" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>SEM micrograph of failure modes of flax fabric reinforced epoxy composites. SEM: scanning electron microscopy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412449399-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The alkali treatment reduced the impact strength of the composites. The reduction is 7.3 % of flax composite and 6.4 % of linen composite, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684412449399">Table 3</xref>). The decrease in impact strength may be interpreted by assuming that a better fibre/matrix adhesion results in shorter average pull-out lengths of the fibres, as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412449399">Figure 8</xref>. It is clear that the average fibre pull-out lengths of the untreated flax composite is longer than the alkali-treated flax one.
<fig id="fig8-0731684412449399" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>SEM micrographs of impact specimens: (a) Untreated flax, and (b) alkali-treated flax composites. SEM, scanning electron microscopy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412449399-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Specific impact strength is defined as the ratio of average impact strength divided by the density of the composite. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684412449399">Table 3</xref> indicates that the alkali treatment increased the specific impact strength of the flax and linen composites. This is because alkali treatment has a significant reduction in the density of the composites, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684412449399">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Flax and linen fabric reinforced epoxy composites have been fabricated using the vacuum bagging technique. The influence of alkali treatment on the vibration characteristics, the surface morphologies and mechanical properties of the composites were studied. The investigation reveals:

<p>This study is part of a research program investigating the feasibility of bio-composites as building materials. Next, flax fabric reinforced epoxy composite in the form of hollow tube as concrete confinement (i.e. flax FRP tube confined concrete) will be investigated. The hollow flax FRP tube will act as the permanent formwork for the concrete core and also is expected to increase compressive strength and ductility of the concrete as the confinement.</p>
