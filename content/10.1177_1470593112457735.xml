<p>Organizational strategies determine with which other businesses a firm will interact. However, organizational strategies are in part implemented through the interactions of the two businesses’ boundary-spanning personnel. This paper uses Fiske’s Relational Models Theory (Fiske, 1992, 2004) to develop an analysis of the interplay between the macro- and micro-level dimensions of business-to-business interactions. The analysis provides insights into the nature of an exchange that evolves through the macro- and micro-interactions which occur in organizational exchanges as they change over time.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The strategic decision, which a business makes to commence an exchange with another organization, has been subject to a great deal of research in management. Yet much of this research has been concerned with ‘macro’ issues, such as which market to enter and, within these markets, which segments to target. Indeed, in cases where the customer industry is highly concentrated the strategic decision may determine not just which segments to target, but with which individual customer organizations to deal. However, those organizational strategies that impact upon a firm’s customers are implemented through ‘micro activities that make up strategy and strategizing in practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470593112457735">Johnson et al., 2003</xref>: 3) and particularly the interpersonal interactions of the two businesses’ boundary-spanning personnel. Thus the overall atmosphere within which a business-to-business exchange is conducted is not determined by macro factors alone but is also strongly influenced by the micro-personal interactions of boundary spanners. The term ‘atmosphere’ in this paper refers to ‘the hybrid culture that develops between the buying and selling firms and reflects elements of both firms’ cultures but is different from either firm’s culture’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470593112457735">1</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1470593112457735">Wilson, 1995</xref>: 337). </p>
<p>Attention has been increasingly drawn to the need for the micro-level activities of managers to be studied and incorporated in research into strategy formulation and implementation. For example Ingram and Roberts commented that: ‘analyses to date have stopped short of incorporating many types of informal, interpersonal relationships that also facilitate the economic interactions of organizations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470593112457735">2000</xref>: 386). This view was reflected in a special issue of the <italic>Journal of Management Studies</italic> on ‘Micro Strategy and Strategizing: Towards an Activity Based View’, in which the editors argued ‘for a shift in the strategy debate towards a micro perspective on strategy and strategizing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470593112457735">Johnson et al., 2003</xref>: 3). The editorial went on to emphasize the need for greater understanding of ‘the detailed processes and practices which constitute the day-to-day activities of organizational life <italic>and</italic> which relate to strategic outcomes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470593112457735">Johnson et al., 2003</xref>: 3, emphasis in original). Others have commented on the need for managers’ activities to be understood within specific contexts with, for example, Hopkinson noting that: ‘the self is positioned and defined by its social relations, such as those of dominance or competition, to specific other groups categorized as, for example, friends or foes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470593112457735">2003</xref>: 1946).</p>
<p>More recently Ellis and Ybema expressed the view that ‘the literature on IORs [inter-organizational relations] – and market-based IORs in particular – is sparse on the ways in which the individual actors involved in interactions make sense of the relation, of themselves and of others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470593112457735">2011</xref>: 283); and then went on to quote approvingly the judgment of Marchington and Vincent that the literature on IORs offers ‘virtually no discussion of the processes that characterize interpersonal relations within and between organizations’ (2004: 1030). The work of these and other researchers provides insights into managers’ social relations as they have developed up to a point in time but for some purposes there is need to introduce an understanding of how changes occur over time. This will be a focus of this paper.</p>
<p>A number of studies have tried to investigate the assumption that: ‘individuals at lower levels in the hierarchy merely implement strategies without deviation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470593112457735">Marchington and Vincent, 2004</xref>: 1030). For example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470593112457735">Humphrey and Ashforth (2000</xref>) attempted to separate out the macro-level strategies that set the context for the micro-level interactions between buyer and suppliers. Yet studies such as these have not succeeded in integrating the macro and micro but have treated them as separate components. The challenge therefore is to provide an analysis of interactions which provides insights into the way in which a strategy is interpreted and implemented at a micro-level and the manner in which this interpretation in turn impacts on the strategy. This paper argues that Fiske’s Relational Models Theory provides such an analysis.</p>
<p>The paper first outlines Fiske’s theory in the context of business-to-business exchanges and extends this with an analysis of the particular opportunities and risks associated with each of the models. It is argued that these inherent risks and opportunities are major contributors to the nature of interactions between organizations. The relationship between Fiske’s models and the concept of model dominance is then discussed and related to the exchange’s atmosphere. Finally, by introducing Fiske and Tetlock’s (1997) concept of ‘taboo trade-offs’, the paper considers the interactions between the behaviour of boundary-spanning employees and the implementation of strategy. Finally the implications of Fiske’s theory for our understanding of business-to-business exchanges are considered.</p>

<title>Fiske’s Relational Models Theory</title>
<p>Fiske’s Relational Models Theory (1991) was developed after an extensive review of the research on relationships in the field and was based on ‘massive amounts of data from all the social sciences to buttress his argument’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470593112457735">Turner, 1992</xref>: 125). Fiske originally and in later developments (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470593112457735">Fiske, 2004</xref>) of his theory drew on: sociology (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470593112457735">Blau, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470593112457735">Buber, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470593112457735">Durkheim, 1966 [1897]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470593112457735">Tonnies, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1470593112457735">Weber, 1975 [1916]</xref>); social anthropology (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470593112457735">Polanyi, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470593112457735">Polanyi et al., 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470593112457735">Udy, 1959</xref>); experimental psychology (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470593112457735">Tetlock et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1470593112457735">Wish et al., 1976</xref>); organizational psychology (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470593112457735">Earley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470593112457735">Vodosek, 2009</xref>); and social psychology (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470593112457735">Clark and Mills, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470593112457735">Krech and Crutchfield, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470593112457735">Leary, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470593112457735">Piaget, 1973</xref>). </p>
<p>Fiske’s theory, which has been extensively tested and validated in both ethnographic and experimental research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470593112457735">Haslam, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470593112457735">Haslam and Fiske, 1999</xref>), is well recognized in the social sciences and accepted as a valuable interpretation of social interactions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470593112457735">Berscheid, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470593112457735">Bond and Smith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470593112457735">Rusbult and van Lange, 2003</xref>). The theory proposes that all social relationships are constructed according to just four elemental models as ‘people relate to each other in just four ways’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470593112457735">Fiske, 2004</xref>: 3), and that they depict the essence of social interactions in bilateral exchange relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470593112457735">Fiske, 1992</xref>). It assumes that people are inherently sociable and that consequently ‘the relational models are not merely cognitive capacities: they are intrinsically motivating’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470593112457735">Fiske, 2004</xref>: 9). As a theory it offers an account of the fundamental forms of social relations and claims that the four models provide the scripts or schemata that allow individuals to relate to the behaviour of others. </p>
<p>The four models of human relationships are: market pricing (MP); authority ranking (AR); equality matching (EM); and communal sharing (CS).</p>
<sec id="section3-1470593112457735">
<title>Market pricing model</title>
<p>The MP model organizes interactions with reference to rational calculations of value in terms of ratios, rates, interests, or proportional costs and returns. Where this is the case, then it becomes possible to combine quantities and values of diverse entities – oranges can be exchanged for apples! Money is often, but not always, the medium of exchange and exchanges determined by barter come under the head of MP. Within an MP relationship ‘people typically value other people’s actions, services and products according to the rates at which they can be exchanged for other commodities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470593112457735">Fiske, 1991</xref>: 16). In business-to-business exchanges, where there are MP relationships, it is assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470593112457735">Roberts, 2004</xref>: 20) that for both parties the overriding driver is to maximize individual value creation by adopting a competitive rather than a collaborative posture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470593112457735">Tong et al., 2008</xref>: 182).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1470593112457735">
<title>Authority ranking model</title>
<p>Where sociality is based on hierarchal relations, the AR model comes into play. AR is any relation between parties in which a person is higher, better or more powerful than another. As Leach commented: ‘This idea (i.e. hierarchy) certainly comes fairly close to being a human universal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470593112457735">1972</xref>: 335), but hierarchies may be established on the basis of many criteria such as: age; length of service; family background; physical size; wealth; achievement; etc. Even within the same group of people, different criteria will be applicable according to the specific circumstances, and the criteria accepted will vary at different times. For example in the case of an industrial accident, a senior manager’s instructions may be legitimately countermanded by a more junior manager acting in their role of health and safety officer. In a business-to-business context, where power asymmetries are apparent, AR relations can develop, for example, between a powerful customer and their supplier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470593112457735">Johnsen and Ford, 2008</xref>), or in business exchanges between a firm and one of its subsidiaries. It is important also to note that AR includes mutual obligations such as ‘the pastoral responsibility due from superior to subordinate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470593112457735">Roccas and McCauley, 2004</xref>: 270).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1470593112457735">
<title>Equality matching model</title>
<p>Under the EM model, on the basis of specified criteria, relationships demonstrably produce an even balance. Examples where this model can be observed include: babysitting circles; rotating chairs of meetings; balanced in-kind favours such as invitations to dinner; and so on, with the criteria that determine whether an even balance has been achieved being many and various. In an EM business-to-business exchange relationship a salesman might ‘trade’ a late delivery of an order with a buyer on the basis of the buyer’s previous request for early delivery of some orders. Often the even balance is achieved through the application of a previously agreed procedure when the result will be accepted even if, according to other criteria, it is perceived to result in unfairness. For example it is accepted that the team which wins the toss at the beginning of a football match chooses at which end to start playing, even though this might condemn the opposing side to play looking into the sun for the first half of the match. An additional important feature of operating under this model is time. Thus, over what period is it acceptable to continue to accept babysitting by other members of the circle before paying off babysitting obligations by babysitting for others? It is important to differentiate between accepting help and a transaction that entails reciprocity but not gratitude – such as receiving a service from others – because accepting help would come under the CS model (see below).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1470593112457735">
<title>Communal sharing model</title>
<p>The CS model divides people into separate equivalence classes, ‘permitting differentiation or contrast, but no numerical comparisons’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470593112457735">Fiske and Tetlock, 1997</xref>: 258). It operates where a group of people have something (frequently not a material ‘thing’) in common which makes the members of the group in some sense socially equivalent and also acts to distinguish members from non-members. Such a situation often leads to positive feelings and mutual altruism between the members of a group and values develop that ‘express concern for others with which one is in frequent social contact’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470593112457735">Roccas and McCauley, 2004</xref>: 272). Individuals will have CS relationships with people in many groups, some of which will be perceived as more important to them than others. In business exchanges where there are CS relationships, it is assumed that behaviours across departmental and firm boundaries will be positively influenced because of the existence of common values and motives with an emphasis on congruent and shared goals, collaboration and compromize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1470593112457735">Wilson, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The core of Fiske’s theory is that ‘people use the same set of four implicit cognitive schemas to organize all the diverse domains of sociality most of the time’ (2004: 7). Relational theory recognizes that these four models can guide behaviour or be used to evaluate a situation only with the use of ‘implementation rules that specify when they apply, to what and to whom, and how’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470593112457735">Fiske and Tetlock, 1997</xref>: 259). In the case of the simplest interactions just one of these four models may be used but different models may simultaneously apply to aspects of an interaction and typically ‘the various aspects of interactions among a dyad or group are governed by more than one relational model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470593112457735">Fiske, 2004</xref>: 9).</p>
<p>The value of Fiske’s model is that it shows that different sets of behaviours are associated with each of the four types of relationship. For example in an MP relationship self-centred and competitive actions will be accepted as the norm, whereas such behaviour would be contrary to the very essence of an EM relationship. So if an exchange is conducted as an MP relationship, then behaviours will be observed which are different from any of the other three relational models that are applied. </p>
<p>This paper uses Fiske’s theory in the context of business-to-business exchanges; but great care has to be taken to ensure that it is not assumed that because two firms enter into an exchange they have entered into ‘a relationship’. Such an assumption is easy to make because of Fiske’s own extensive use of the word ‘relationship’ and because academic marketing’s discussions of ‘relationships’ has been ‘biased towards the discussion of positive aspects of relationships whilst neglecting negative and power-laden relational traits and processes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470593112457735">Kasabov, 2007</xref>: 95), thus ignoring the fact that not all firms see ‘relationships’ as desirable and therefore ‘relationships’ are sometimes deliberately not developed. </p>
<p>We take the position that exchanges are guided by one or more of the relational models and that there are associated with each of these models positive attributes, in the form of opportunities, but also risks. Moreover, it is not assumed that any of the process models (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470593112457735">Dwyer et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1470593112457735">Wilson, 1995</xref>) that have been developed are necessarily applicable to the issues discussed in this paper. The paper’s position is that an exchange will not necessarily become ‘a relationship’ but might remain no more than a sequence of discrete exchanges reflecting the ‘wigwag movements of strengthening and weakening forces, may be even intermittent disconnections, impacting the dynamics of quality of relationships’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470593112457735">Hedaa, 1993</xref>: 191). Indeed the exchange or the series of exchanges between two firms might fall anywhere on a spectrum ranging from ‘discrete’ to ‘relational’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470593112457735">Macneil, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>The following section, by analysing the opportunities and risks associated with each of the four models, draws out the types of behaviours that can be expected to be associated with them and thus the atmosphere of any exchange conducted under these models.</p>

<title>The opportunities and risks associated with each relational model</title>
<p>Depending upon which of the four models applies to an interaction, because relationships vary in terms of type and intensity, individuals involved in the interaction will be confronted by different levels of commitment and interdependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470593112457735">Sheppard and Sherman, 1998</xref>: 423), ‘[C]ommitment’ being the degree to which an exchange partner believes the relationship ‘is so important as to warrant maximum efforts at maintaining it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470593112457735">Morgan and Hunt, 1994</xref>: 23); ‘[I]nterdependence’ being an indicator of the extent to which ‘the completion of one’s own consequential activities depend upon the prior actions or ongoing cooperation of another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470593112457735">Sitkin and Roth, 2006</xref>: 298). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470593112457735">Sheppard and Sherman (1998</xref>) ‘interdependence’ will be characterized as ‘shallow’ or ‘deep’ and, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470593112457735">Cook and Emerson (1978</xref>), ‘commitment’ will be characterized as ‘low’ or ‘high’.</p>
<p>The dichotomies ‘shallow or deep’ and ‘low or high’ are being used as presentational conveniences because in practice both commitment and interdependence are spectrums running from low to high and shallow to deep respectively. Nevertheless, Fiske’s four types of relationship can be positioned as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470593112457735">Figure 1</xref>. There are risks and opportunities associated with each type of relationship and these arise as a consequence of the degree of commitment and interdependence found in each relational type. These risks and opportunities are discussed below.</p>

<p>While in terms of interdependence an MP relationship may be either shallow or deep, with regard to commitment it is low. Indeed the MP relationship is one in which exchanges are most frequently discrete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470593112457735">Macneil, 1983</xref>). In an MP relationship substantial possibilities for cheating exist as is indicated by Coase’s comment that: ‘They (i.e. markets) also require the establishment of legal rules governing the rights and duties of those carrying out transactions in these facilities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470593112457735">1988</xref>: 10) and this is emphasized by the rigorous assumptions on which economists’ market models are based.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470593112457735">2</xref>
</sup> In markets where complex transactions occur, the opportunities for cheating multiply, especially as information asymmetries are endemic in such markets. Also within an MP relationship, because the supplier’s behaviour is primarily determined by price, its commitment to the customer is low and there is therefore a risk of unreliable and opportunistic behaviour. For example in a time of shortage a supplier might simply sell to the highest bidder – ignoring other aspects of its relationship with a customer. However, MP relationships provide the opportunity for any object or service to have a monetary value placed on it. For example Lloyds of London boasts that it can insure anything – that is, it can price any risk. </p>
<p>Thus in an MP relationship one party depends upon the other for the provision of a product but, other than payment, there is no expectation of any kind of reciprocation. The absolute essence of an MP relationship is a calculated exchange of a product for payment – nothing else – and there is minimal commitment to the other party. In this type of exchange the risks seem to exceed the opportunities and the argument for working within the MP model is that the pricing mechanism is, in the specific context, efficient.</p>

<sec id="section9-1470593112457735">
<title>Authority ranking</title>
<p>Deep interdependence exists in an AR relationship because authority is usually only asserted where the response sought is important to the dominant party. However, commitment is low because the subservient party only responds to the dominant party’s requirements because of its authority. In an AR relationship the risks for the subservient party arise from ‘fate control’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470593112457735">Kelley and Thibaut, 1978</xref>) which exists where one party can unilaterally determine another’s behaviour with regard to particular actions. Thus, within contractual limits, a firm can control aspects of its sub-contractor’s activities. One opportunity for a subservient party which is associated with the AR model is the possibility of passing responsibility to a superior by seeking their instructions. There is also the opportunity for a superior, by vesting them with the required authority, to allow another party to act beyond their remit.</p>
<p>Where the AR model is applicable the balance of these opportunities and risks suggests that the subservient party needs to be willing to believe that the party exercising authority will not behave unreasonably. Because the nature of the AR situation is deep interdependence but with low commitment, there is also a need for the party with authority to believe that the subservient party will not exceed its delegated authority. Both parties therefore need to accept that structures have been put in place that limit the superior’s ability to disadvantage the subordinate and that also give the subordinate confidence when taking actions on behalf of their superior, that they will receive their superior’s support. </p>

<sec id="section10-1470593112457735">
<title>Equality matching</title>
<p>The EM relationship involves high commitment because the ‘swings and roundabouts’ approach between members of the relationship is typically extended through time. Yet in terms of interdependence EM can be either shallow or deep. For example many social interactions of relatively minor importance to the participants, such as taking turns to buy drinks on a social occasion, are based on EM relationships. However, EM relationships may be deeply interdependent, such as the acceptance by group members that they will in turn each undertake an onerous duty for which the group is responsible. EM relationships’ biggest risk is poor coordination. One form of this is time coordination – that is, over what period of time do the EM principles operate? A second form relates to the ‘rate of exchange’ which is often loosely defined and not quantified (otherwise the relationship becomes an MP one). Where there is no explicit measure of ‘equality’ there is a risk that members will exploit the lack of precision or feel they are being exploited by it. A third coordination problem arises when the ‘rate of exchange’ needs changing. The flexibility with regard to both the time period over which a balance can be achieved and what is being balanced against what thus provides participants with the opportunity to delay their reciprocal behaviour and also change the items they offer as recompense for their actions.</p>
<p>An EM relationship can only exist where turn-taking, reciprocity and balance over time is the norm and where the parties believe in each others’ good faith, good intentions, and integrity. It thus relies upon the acceptance by one party of the other’s reputation for fair dealing and also for being concerned about a partner’s welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457735">Tuusjärvi and Blois, 2004</xref>). Furthermore it must seem reasonable to expect these beliefs to be pertinent to future behaviour.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1470593112457735">
<title>Communal sharing</title>
<p>CS relationships are high in terms of commitment, as members of a communal group typically demonstrate mutual altruism to each other. CS is also deep in terms of interdependence, as the cohesiveness of a communal group is dependent on its members caring for each other. Membership of a CS relationship typically involves the acceptance of some forms of behaviour which may relate to apparently quite trivial matters such as dress codes through to substantive issues such as ethical standards. However, gaining a full understanding of the group’s norms may take time and there is therefore a risk, where new circumstances arise, that some members interpret the situation in a manner contrary to the group’s accepted way of doing things. Some such misinterpretations have insignificant effects but others can lead to the group reappraising the underpinning of the misinterpreted norms. A second type of risk is that of presumptive behaviour, for ‘It is when unexpected circumstances arise that discretionary acts may be most valued, and yet it is exactly in these circumstances that there is the greatest probability that they are incorrect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470593112457735">Blois, 1999</xref>: 205). Within the CS model there is the opportunity, indeed the expectation, that those in the relationship will demonstrate support and altruistic behaviour towards each other over a range of activities. Indeed one test of the existence of a CS relationship is whether or not members are offered support when an unforeseen unpleasant event occurs to one of them. Such behaviour is receiving increased attention (e.g. Mainela<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470593112457735">, 2007</xref>) in the context of business-to-business relationships.</p>
<p>In CS relationships there is extensive communication between the parties over a wide range of topics. Even so there is the possibility that others will make incorrect interpretations and/or act presumptively but this is balanced by a sense of mutual altruism and ‘expectations of benign action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470593112457735">Govier, 1994</xref>: 238). Indeed the values associated with a CS relationship emphasize honesty, helpfulness and kindness – values which stand in stark contrast to those found in an MP relationship. </p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470593112457735">Table I</xref> summarizes the above discussion but also stresses that any of the four relational models may, to a limited extent, be subject to a type of risk predominately associated with one or more of the other three models. For example unreliability and/or cheating are not unknown within CS situations but, because such behaviour runs counter to this type of relationship’s fundamental norms, it will be relatively uncommon.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470593112457735">3</xref>
</sup> As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470593112457735">Table I</xref> indicates, the risks involved with each type of relationship are additive with MP, the shallowest relationship type in terms of commitment and interdependency, being associated with only two categories of risk but with potentially all the categories of risk being found in CS, the deepest relationship type. However, because more than one relational model at a time can be present in any business interaction, a complex mixture of risks and opportunities may operate, and the way in which these play out will determine the atmosphere of the exchange.</p>

<title>The dominant relational model and the nature of the atmosphere</title>
<p>The four relational models may simultaneously apply to different aspects of an interaction. Indeed Fiske commented that: ‘People commonly use a combination of models … Generally, people string the models together and nest them hierarchically in various phases of an interaction or in distinct activities of an organization’ (1992: 711). Yet unfortunately, as Haslam has pointed out, ‘the general area of relations among relations – how relationships governed by particular models combine, interlock, or conflict with one another – has yet to attract adequate theoretical or empirical attention’ (2004: 53). It is however argued here that at a particular point in time one relational form may be dominant and thus determines the context within which the other models <italic>have</italic>, at that time, to operate. This is a similar view to that of Sheppard and Sherman who commented that: ‘In many relationships a predominant relational form exists that serves as a background – or motif – for all the others’ (1998: 433). Moreover, in an exchange, as circumstances change, the emphasis given to each of the relational models may vary over time and so the model which is dominant may change. </p>
<p>In a business-to-business exchange the relational model which is dominant at a particular point in time will be dependent upon the extent to which the interaction between the organizations has progressed. At some points in the exchange AR, EM and CS models’ roles may be dominated by the MP model. Yet over time the success of an exchange may become more dependent on the day-to-day interactions of boundary-spanning agents rather than on the actions of senior managers. Indeed, as the boundary spanners get to know of each other, contractual formality will progressively be displaced by ‘informal understandings and commitments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470593112457735">Ring and van de Ven, 1994</xref>: 103). These ‘backstage interpersonal dynamics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470593112457735">Ring and van de Ven, 2000</xref>: 179) grow in importance as ‘Qua persona behavior substitutes for role behavior as personal relationships build and psychological contracts deepen’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470593112457735">Ring and van de Ven, 1994</xref>: 103). Indeed, as the boundary spanners come to know each other better, the CS model will gain in importance and may, but not necessarily will, become the overriding feature of their interactions. </p>
<p>For example consider a situation where in a new business interaction the purchasing manager and the salesperson find that they already know each other in another context – say they are members of the same golf club. Their willingness to apply any of the norms of a CS relationship to their business interaction will initially be constrained by their consciousness that this new interaction is a business one and as such is primarily an MP relationship. However, over time the CS relationship will possibly gain in importance and may even become dominant. This may impact on the success of the exchange in various ways, for it must not be assumed that <italic>qua persona</italic> factors are always positive – getting to know a person better can lead to less, rather than more, liking!</p>
<p>As the relational model that is dominant changes then the risks and opportunities that the parties face will alter and so too will the expectations of the participants as to what are acceptable forms of behaviour. Indeed a different atmosphere will exist in an exchange where, say, the MP relational model is the major influence as compared to an exchange where, say, the EM relational model is dominant. The atmosphere of MP being one in which personal relationships count for little, with Roccas and McCauley commenting that ‘Relations based on market pricing are incompatible with expressing concern for others’ (2004: 273); whereas, in EM the parties’ knowledge of and trust in each other will be major influences.</p>
<p>It is not being claimed that the movement between any of the four relational models is predetermined or unidirectional. Indeed, given that the evolution of a business-to-business exchange does not inexorably follow a particular path, the relative importance of one relational model rather than another may be changed as a result of decisions made by or imposed on either party. For example even where, say, an EM relationship has become dominant, new events may cause a move to, say, an MP emphasis. The event might be a macro issue, such as one party’s response to an economic downturn in their business, or a micro issue, such as the replacement of one of the boundary spanners by somebody with a different business style. However, if a strong EM relationship has been developed it is likely that the move towards the application of the MP model in its entirety will not be immediate. The reason for this is that the switch to MP will require the replacement of those systems that are applicable to EM rather than to MP exchanges and even with informal systems this may take time. However, even where such systems can be changed quickly, there will remain the need to change the boundary spanners’ behaviour from one where give and take over time is expected to one where exchanges are carefully measured and assessed. It seems inevitable that for some period of time remnants of the EM mode of working will remain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470593112457735">Humphrey and Ashforth, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Because a firm will only enter into an exchange when it has calculated that this will provide a more economical way of transacting than the cheapest alternative of which it is aware, at the start of a new business-to-business exchange the interactions would be expected to be dominated by the MP model<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470593112457735">4</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470593112457735">Figure 2</xref>). In such circumstances the ruthless application of pricing rules is only limited to the extent that those implementing decisions are isolated from any social bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470593112457735">Baxter and Woodside, 2010</xref>). Then, as time passes, the influence of one or more of the other three relational models might grow and the MP model’s dominance will decrease in relative terms. Indeed, as Anderson and Jap commented: </p>
<fig id="fig2-1470593112457735" position="float">
<label>Figure 2.</label>

<p>The start of an exchange with the market pricing relational model dominant</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1470593112457735-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<disp-quote>
<p>At the start of the relationship, these goals (i.e. why the relationship was formed in the first place) are critical for establishing expectations, clarifying roles and communicating intentions. When all is well, these goals seem to fade into the background as business is carried out. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470593112457735">2005</xref>: 80) </p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thus, if a CS element develops between the boundary-spanning employees, this would lead to a changed atmosphere as the dominance of the MP model is weakened by the growth of CS factors. </p>
<p>Indeed, over time the recognition that the relationship is fundamentally based on an MP model may become much less explicit. For example where the purpose of the exchange is the creation of a joint project – perhaps a piece of joint research; a sponsorship; an infrastructure undertaking; etc. – then, if the commitment of both organizations’ boundary-spanning employees to the project becomes strong, a CS element may develop. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470593112457735">Ryan and Blois (2010)</xref>, in a case-based study, found that the commitment of personnel from both a sponsoring organization and the recipient cultural organization over time became greater to the sponsored activity than to their individual employers. If the CS element does grow then the exchange’s atmosphere will change and the role of MP will become less dominant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470593112457735">Figure 3</xref>). Indeed, because it is normal for boundary-spanning employees to develop <italic>qua persona</italic> relationships, in what might have started as an MP relationship, CS aspects are likely to develop and at least influence the context within which much micro activity occurs. In such circumstances the atmosphere at the start of the exchange will differ from that which comes into existence as time passes. </p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1470593112457735-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In other circumstances AR or EM relational models might become dominant and this would lead to yet other types of atmosphere developing. For example at the start of a joint venture an EM model might be dominant but, over time, the two parties might agree that the efficient way forward is for one of them to take control of all or part of the activity. If this occurred then the AR model would become of greater influence. </p>

<title>Resistance to change</title>
<p>The degree of enthusiasm with which boundary spanners respond to a change in the dominant relational model can range from positive to hostile. Certainly it cannot be assumed that the personnel involved will welcome the new situation and changes in the dominant model can present substantial challenges for some of the boundary spanners. </p>
<p>Recent developments in the UK charities sector illustrate this. A substantial part of many charities’ income has in the past come from central and local government grants. Many of these grants have been regularly renewed (subject only to the charity showing that it has achieved some targets) and the charities’ relationship with their funders has been a mixture of AR and CS. Since 2008 many funders have decided that grants will no longer be made and that the charities will in future have to tender for work. This tendering process, with profit-making organizations as well as charities now being encouraged to tender, is run on strictly commercial lines with pre-qualification stages to be passed before an organization is allowed to enter the tendering process. This new procedure is almost purely MP with, in some cases, no qualitative information being allowed in the tender document and the successful tender is chosen through the application of a computer algorithm. For some charity employees the changes to their personal modes of operation which are implicit in this new system of governance has presented a fundamental challenge to their basic value systems. Indeed their relationships with their charity’s clients and also their charity’s funders have been changed by this new system. For many of these employees such changes confront them with ‘taboo trade-offs’.</p>
<p>A taboo trade-off is ‘any explicit mental comparison or social transaction that violates deeply-held normative intuitions about the integrity, even the sanctity of certain forms of relationship and of the moral–political values that derive from those relationships’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470593112457735">Fiske and Tetlock, 1997</xref>: 256). Certain categories of trade-off seem especially difficult and disturbing to make.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470593112457735">5</xref>
</sup> These, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470593112457735">Fiske and Tetlock (1997</xref>) argue, are those that confront the individual with the necessity of moving across the boundaries of two relational models. For example ‘it is difficult to weigh Communal Sharing against, say, Market Pricing: the disparate qualities of the motives make them impossible to compare directly or consistently’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470593112457735">Fiske and Tetlock, 1997</xref>: 277).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470593112457735">Ryan and Blois (2010)</xref> showed, the difficulties which occur if a taboo trade-off arises will be exacerbated if not all of the boundary spanners feel that the changes involve a taboo trade-off. For example it might be that the boundary spanners from the buying organization perceive no problems in accepting a change in the dominant model, while for those in the selling organization the change presents them with a ‘taboo trade-off’. However, it could be that only some of the boundary spanners in either of the organizations accept the need for change with the remainder seeing the change as imposing a ‘taboo trade-off’ on them. In either case there may be a period of confusion while the boundary spanners, as a group, re-establish a coherent form of interaction and a new ‘hybrid culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1470593112457735">Wilson, 1995</xref>: 337) evolves. While not all changes in the dominant relational model create difficulties for boundary spanners – indeed some may be welcomed – management should carefully consider the possible impact of such changes. </p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Johnson et al. argue that </p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It is time to shift the strategy research agenda towards the micro; to start not from organizations as wholes – corporations, business units and so on – but from the activities of individuals, groups and networks of people upon which key processes and practices depend.

</disp-quote>
<p>They suggest that there are a variety of theoretical approaches (such as structuration theory, institutional theory, complexity theory, evolutionary economics, social psychology and cognition) all of which offer useful frameworks for further work; but they claim that there remains a need for additional theoretical understanding. A particular issue is the need for the analyses to offer insights about the macro/micro interaction and how this interaction proceeds over time.</p>
<p>Fiske’s theory, while not dynamic, does enable an analysis through time to be undertaken and provides an understanding of the norms within which managers will operate at a point in time. Fiske’s theory recognizes that: the four models can operate simultaneously; the models do not necessarily have equal influence; their relative importance may change; in particular the dominant model may change. As this paper has argued, where the dominant model changes then the risks and opportunities faced by the boundary spanners will alter and consequently so will the atmosphere of the exchange.</p>
<p>Fiske’s theory also indicates that, where a relational model becomes internalized, people may face difficulties in changing to work within another model. The factors which may provoke the need to change may be quite minor – for example a slight tightening of one firm’s budget – or major, such as one party implementing a change in its strategy. The change might also be rapidly imposed or it might be planned and implemented over an extended period of time. </p>
<p>The dominant model will initially be a reflection of the strategic nature of the exchange but, if other relational models gain in importance, then the original dominant model’s influence will be reduced and one of the other models might become dominant. If this happens, then, while the strategic intent of the exchange may explicitly remain unchanged, in practice its application will be at least nuanced by the way the boundary spanners respond to operating within the context of a different predominant relational model. </p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This paper has proposed the use of Fiske's Relational Models Theory as an approach to the study of business-to-business exchanges. Rather than differentiating between an exchange's atmosphere either on the basis of a relationship structure (i.e. strategic alliance, joint venture, etc.) or by the type of buying situation, Fiske’s theory makes it possible to consider the more abstract conceptualization of relationship type as falling within MP, AR, EM and CS relational models. As has been discussed, there are inherent risks and opportunities associated with each of these four models and these determine the nature of a business-to-business exchange’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>The use of Fiske’s Relational Model Theory also provides insights into the interaction between the strategic decisions that a business makes as to which relationship to develop together with the form which such a relationship should take and the behaviour of the employees who have to implement these decisions. This interaction changes over time as the balance between the relational models alters and may in some cases vary so much that, whatever the business’s original strategic intent, a quite different form of business-to-business exchange comes into existence.</p>
