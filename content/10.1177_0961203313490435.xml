<abstract>
<p>Severe retinal vascular occlusions resulting in blindness is a rare occurrence in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Herein, we report a case of a 33-year-old female who developed combined central retinal artery occlusion, retinal vein occlusion, and choroidopathy and rapidly became completely blind in both eyes within a week. The electroretinogram revealed a severely attenuated a-wave and b-wave, indicating a profound dysfunction of both choroidal and retinal circulation, respectively. The current case demonstrates objectively the functional impact of severe choroidopathy in SLE for the first time. Patients with unilateral blindness due to combined retinal/choroidal vascular obstructions should be monitored carefully to ensure adequate anticoagulant therapy in an attempt to guard the vision in the fellow eye.</p>

<p>An extremely severe form of ocular complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is combined central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), which often results in severe reduction of vision in the affected eye. Only a few cases have been reported in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313490435">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313490435"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313490435"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313490435"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313490435">5</xref></sup> among which only one case is of bilateral pathology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313490435">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>This report describes a case of bilateral combined CRAO and retinal vein occlusion (RVO) in a young woman with SLE, which was further complicated by severe choroidopathy. As a result, the patient completely lost light perception in both eyes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203313490435" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>A 33-year-old female was referred to our clinic for bilateral complete blindness. The patient had been first seen by rheumatologists for general fatigue, systemic oedema, discoid rashes and oral ulcers three months prior. Clinical work-up was conducted to ascertain the cause. She was diagnosed as having SLE accompanied by antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and nephritis, based on positive antinuclear antibodies (1:640), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies (&gt;1:300), anticardiolipin antibodies (22 U/ml (normal &lt;10)), reduced serum complement (&lt;12.0 (normal = 25–48)), pancytopenia, proteinuria (3 + ), and skin and renal biopsy.</p>
<p>One week prior, the patient had experienced a sudden loss of vision in her left eye. The patient was examined by a local ophthalmologist who diagnosed her condition as left CRAO and bilateral retinal vasculitis. At that time, her visual acuity was 20/20 in the right and counting fingers in the left eye. Treatment for her condition was initiated by intravenous administration of methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone. However, three days later, the patient developed profound visual loss in her right eye, which was not reported immediately to the ophthalmologist. By the time she was seen by the ophthalmologist two days later, she had already lost light perception in both eyes. The local ophthalmologist who diagnosed the condition as complete blindness attributable to bilateral CRAO and retinal vasculitis referred the patient to our department on the same day.</p>
<p>Upon examination, the alert and oriented patient had mydriatic pupils completely unresponsive to light. No light perception was detected in either eye. Both fundi revealed mildly swollen and pale retina, mildly engorged tortuous retinal veins, and multifocal vasculitis. Superficial retinal haemorrhages, sometimes distributed in a wedge-shape, were present in all four quadrants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203313490435">Figure 1</xref>), consistent with widespread RVO. The optic disc was also mildly swollen. The fovea appeared dark and differed from the reddish hue of a cherry red spot typical for CRAO in both eyes. Fluorescein angiogram (FA) disclosed substantial delay in filling of choroidal and retinal vasculatures, both circulations filling nearly simultaneously at 27 s after dye injection (normal &lt;11 s). The choroidal circulation was assessed further with a dark-adapted bright single-flash electroretinogram (ERG) that extracted maximal retinal response. Repeated ERG showed a barely recognizable a-wave and a severely reduced b-wave in both eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203313490435">Figure 2</xref>). Based on these results, the patient was diagnosed as having bilateral loss of light perception caused by CRAO and RVO and severe choroidopathy in both eyes.

</fig></p>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging taken on the same day was consistent with the diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis. At this point, the patient was hospitalized for additional work-up and treatment, which were conducted by a team of rheumatologists, internists, neurologists and us. Intravenous heparin and methylprednisolone were administered immediately.</p>
<p>Periodic ocular examination showed no sign of improvement. The patient never regained light perception. Two weeks after the initial visit, clear signs of retinal degeneration and resolution of retinal oedema were observed. One month after the initial visit, retinal neovascularization appeared and intraocular pressure decreased to 4 mmHg bilaterally. Four months after the initial visit, proliferative vitreo-retinopathy with vitreous haemorrhage was also observed in both eyes.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0961203313490435" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Only one case of bilateral combined CRAO and CRVO in SLE has been reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313490435">5</xref></sup> which showed complete blindness in one eye but residual light perception in the other. Our case is the first reported in which a profound defect in choroidal circulation was documented together with combined CRAO and RVO that left the patient with no light perception in both eyes. The defective choroidal circulation was clarified by severely delayed choroidal filling with FA, and more important, a nearly extinguished a-wave in ERG. Because photoreceptors are nourished mostly by the choroidal circulation, not by the retinal circulation, and because their function is represented by the a-wave, the results are consistent with the absence of nutritional support of photoreceptors from the choroid. Meanwhile, the a-wave is usually well preserved in CRAO or CRVO despite the presence of severe inner retinal dysfunction evident by an attenuated b-wave.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313490435">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313490435">7</xref></sup> This is different from the current case in which both the a-wave and the b-wave were severely reduced. Notably, residual retinal function was reproducibly demonstrated by the presence of the b-wave, despite the patient being completely blind. This suggests that a severe dysfunction of retinal ganglion cells that has a modest effect on ERG is also present, likely due to ischemic optic neuropathy perhaps caused by the choroidopathy. The responsible anatomic site for the defective choroidal circulation remains unclear. However, the severe delay of choroidal filling in FA and widespread photoreceptor dysfunction indicated by ERG imply that vascular occlusion might have occurred upstream of the ocular entry of the choroidal vasculatures, perhaps at the level of the posterior ciliary arteries or the ophthalmic artery.</p>
<p>In our case, the superficial haemorrhages were not as extensive as those of typical CRVO and venous dilatation and tortuosity were not readily apparent in all major retinal veins. Nevertheless, the presence of wedge-shaped haemorrhages of various sizes in all four quadrants in both eyes indicative of widespread venous obstruction is consistent with the diagnosis of CRVO. This atypical CRVO phenotype might be attributed to the characteristics of severe occlusion of retinal and choroidal arteries: If there is little arterial input, then there is little to bleed from the veins. Another possible explanation is that the lack of severe optic disc swelling probably attributable to the defective retinal/choroidal circulation might have caused less complete venous obstruction and thus less venous haemorrhage.</p>
<p>Our case should alert ophthalmologists and rheumatologists that combined CRAO and RVO in SLE may indeed develop in a rather short period of time in both eyes, which is a potential cause of visual morbidity.</p>
