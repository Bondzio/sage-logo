<abstract>
<p>Polyacrylonitrile-based carbon fibers were electrochemically oxidized under a wide variety of current densities, and then surface changes in the morphological structures and the chemical compositions were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Finally, the effects of carbon fiber surface chemistry on the interfacial properties of carbon fiber reinforced composites were researched. The results showed that surface contaminants generated during the production process were removed and the relative contents of oxygen and nitrogen elements increased by 322% and 432%, respectively, after the electrochemical oxidation. Increases in the O/C and N/C ratios resulted in the increase in the interlaminar shear strength values of composites. However, much higher O/C and N/C ratios led to decline in the interlaminar shear strength values. Carboxyl groups were responsible for strong interactions between carbon fiber surfaces and the epoxy resin. When the current densities were more than 5 A/m<sup>2</sup>, the interfacial bonding between carbon fibers and the epoxy resin became weak and the interlaminar shear strength values also decreased.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684412468369" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based carbon fibers have been extensively used as the reinforcements in both thermoset and thermoplastic matrix composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412468369">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412468369">4</xref></sup> The properties of carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are not only determined by the composition and arrangement of their constituents, but the interfacial regions between the carbon fibers and the matrix are also of tremendous importance to the ultimate properties of CFRPs. That is because the interfacial regions play an important role in transferring external stress to the reinforcing fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412468369">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412468369">10</xref></sup> As an important constitution of the interfacial regions, carbon fiber surfaces, therefore, have a great effect on the properties of CFRPs.</p>
<p>In the production of PAN-based carbon fibers, carbonization usually occurs under a nitrogen atmosphere in a temperature range from 700°C to 1500°C. The polar elements such as oxygen and nitrogen will be eliminated from carbon fiber surface under such high temperatures. Lack of chemical functionality on the fiber surface results in a poor wetting of carbon fiber surface by the polymer matrices and finally leads to lower interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) values. In order to optimize the interfacial properties of CFRPs, carbon fiber surface treatment becomes a necessary step in the manufacture of composite materials. Typical surface treatments consist of liquid phase oxidation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412468369">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412468369">13</xref></sup> electrochemical oxidation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412468369">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412468369">16</xref></sup> plasma treatment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412468369">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684412468369">19</xref></sup> electrodeposition,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412468369">20</xref></sup> etc. Electrochemical oxidation has proved to be the most useful for commercial applications because this process can be readily controlled. Meanwhile, the treating process is mild and hardly damages the properties of carbon fibers.</p>
<p>In this article, PAN-based carbon fibers were electrochemically oxidized under a wide variety of current densities from 0 to 20 A/m<sup>2</sup>. The purpose of this study was to establish a relationship between the ILSS values of CFRPs and the surface chemical compositions including O/C and N/C atomic ratios and the relative contents of oxygen-containing functional groups.</p>

<p>PAN-based carbon fibers used in this study were manufactured in our laboratory according to a continuous process composed of pre-oxidation (180–300°C), carbonization (800–2000°C) and the electrochemical oxidation. There were 6000 monofilaments in per tow and the diameter of each monofilament was around 7.0 µm. NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> was chosen as the electrolyte and it was supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co (Shanghai, China). WSR6101 (E-44) model epoxy resin were supplied by Wuxi Resin Factory of Bluestar New Chemical Materials Co.

<p>PAN-based carbon fibers were electrochemically oxidized in a laboratory setup which was composed of surface treatment bath, washing bath, and drying oven. The NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> concentration was 7.5 wt% and the length of surface treatment bath was 1.5 m. The treatment conditions varied with the elevation of current densities from 0 to 20 A/m<sup>2</sup> and the specimens were correspondingly named untreated (0 A/m<sup>2</sup>), CFO-1 (1 A/m<sup>2</sup>), CFO-5 (5 A/m<sup>2</sup>), CFO-12 (12 A/m<sup>2</sup>), and CFO-20 (20 A/m<sup>2</sup>).

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412468369">Figure 1</xref> shows the SEM images of untreated and oxidized carbon fiber surfaces. There were many longitudinal grooves on the surfaces of both untreated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412468369">Figure 1(a)</xref>) and oxidized carbon fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412468369">Figure 1(b) to (e)</xref>). The longitudinal grooves were considered to inherit from PAN-precursors. An obvious difference between untreated and oxidized fiber surfaces was the abundance of granules observed on untreated carbon fiber surfaces, which likely resulted from the contamination during the production process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412468369">22</xref></sup> The oxidized fibers, however, had much cleaner surfaces which indicated that the electrochemical oxidation cleaned the fiber surfaces.

</fig></p>
<p>From a comparison of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412468369">Figure 1(b) to (e)</xref>, it could be found that no obvious changes happened to the longitudinal grooves as the electrochemical oxidation progressed. This result was inconsistent with many published papers in which the striations became more pronounced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412468369">1</xref></sup> and the grooves got much deeper and wider after the oxidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412468369">14</xref></sup> In the process of electrochemical oxidation, the chemical etching on the concave portion of the longitudinal grooves made the groove depth increase, and the chemical etching on the convex portion decreased the groove depth and smoothed the grooves. As a matter of fact, the chemical etching happened to the convex portion was much more violent than that of the concave portion because of their large area and enrichment of the charges. Owing to the differences in the oxidative intensities, no obvious changes happened to the longitudinal grooves although there were continual increases in the current densities.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0731684412468369"><title>Analysis of surface chemical compositions</title>
<p>The calculated percentages of surface chemical elements before and after the electrochemical oxidation are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412468369">Table 1</xref>. As can be seen, carbon fiber surfaces were mainly made up of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. In addition, a spot of silicon and sodium elements were also found on carbon fiber surface. On untreated carbon fiber surfaces, carbon was the most abundant element and its percentage was as high as 94.98%. The relative contents of oxygen and nitrogen were 3.10% and 1.12%, respectively. The comparatively low percentages of polar elements indicated that untreated fiber surfaces were highly inert. However, the relative contents of oxygen and nitrogen gradually increased as the electrochemical oxidation progressed, especially when the current densities increased to 20 A/m<sup>2</sup>, the relative contents of oxygen and nitrogen increased by 322% and 432%, respectively.

<p>The functional groups of epoxy resin consist of epoxy and hydroxyl groups. On carbon fiber surfaces, there are three kinds of oxygen-containing functional groups (hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl groups) in which the −C = O groups are basic and the −COOH groups are acidic. As for R–OH groups, the −OH group can be acidic when the R is a phenyl group or basic as R is an aliphatic group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684412468369">23</xref></sup> Consequently, not all of oxygen-containing functional groups react with the epoxy resin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684412468369">24</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412468369">Figure 5</xref> illustrates possible chemical reactions between carbon fiber surfaces and the epoxy groups/curing agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684412468369">25</xref></sup> Ass can be seen, the basic groups including −C = O and basic −OH groups on carbon fiber surfaces only react with amine groups and the acidic groups can react with amine groups and epoxy groups. Besides the reactions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412468369">Figure 5</xref>, the hydroxyl groups of epoxy resin can also react with the −COOH groups on carbon fiber surfaces.

Although there was a continued increase in the percentages of −COOH groups, the ILSS values decreased slightly when the current densities increased to 12 A/m<sup>2</sup>. The possible reason was that there were more −COOH groups on carbon fiber surface than the functional groups of the epoxy resin when the current density was at 12 A/m<sup>2</sup>, which indicated that the chemical reaction in the interfacial regions had probably completed. However, a large extent of decrease in the percentage of the −COOH groups finally led to the decline in the ILSS values as the current densities kept increasing to 20 A/m<sup>2</sup>.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412468369">Figure 7</xref> shows the SEM images of CFRPs after interlaminar shear breakage. The interfacial bonding between untreated carbon fibers and the epoxy resin was comparatively weak, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412468369">Figure 7(a)</xref>, and the matrices debonded from carbon fiber surfaces after the foreign breakage. After the electrochemical oxidation, the interfacial bonding between the carbon fibers and the epoxy resin increased as a result of the increase in carbon fiber surface activity. When the current densities increased to 5 A/m<sup>2</sup>, the carbon fibers in CFRPs had close junctions with each other through the matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412468369">Figure 7(c)</xref>). However, the interfacial regions broken up when the current densities took further increases to 12 and 20 A/m<sup>2</sup>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412468369">Figure 7(d) and (e)</xref>, which was consistent with the decrease in ILSS values. It was thus concluded that much higher current densities in the electrochemical oxidation damaged the interfacial bonding.

<p>Carbon fibers were electrochemically oxidized under a wide variety of current densities in order to change the inert fiber surfaces to be active. No significant changes happened to surface longitudinal grooves after the electrochemical oxidation. The chemical compositions of carbon fiber surfaces, however, changed in a large extent. There were significant increases in the percentages of oxygen and nitrogen elements with the elevation of current densities, and the total relative content of oxygen-containing functional groups also increased obviously. When the current densities were less than 5 A/m<sup>2</sup>, improvements in (O + N)/C atomic ratios resulted in the increase in the ILSS values. However, much higher (O + N)/C atomic ratios led to the decrease in the ILSS values. Carboxyl groups were responsible for the strong interaction between carbon fibers and the epoxy resin in CFRPs. The interfacial bonding between carbon fibers and the epoxy resin became weak when the current densities were more than 5 A/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
