<abstract>
<p>Critical Discourse Analysis of 206 South Korean peer-reviewed academic journal publications and interviews with managers and volunteers of ecotourism sites extracted from these articles indicate the existence of a distinct, endogenously informed South Korean construct of ecotourism. With regard to the three core criteria of ecotourism, “nature-based” attractions reflect a unity of human and physical environment, profoundly influenced by Confucian, Zen Buddhist, and Taoist philosophy where everything in the universe is one interrelated entity. Secondly, the “education” construct reflects the Confucian concept of self-cultivation for worldly development. Finally, “sustainability” is the Confucian idea of creative transformation for harmony. The South Korean construct of nature is the underlying central principle for all three criteria, leading to important theoretical and managerial implications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ecotourism, introduced into the English-language literature by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0047287512467703">Romeril (1985)</xref>, situates as a rapidly growing leisure tourism sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0047287512467703">Weaver 2008</xref>). Through 20 years of articulation as a mainly “Western” construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0047287512467703">Weaver and Lawton 2007</xref>), ecotourism is now accepted as exhibiting three core characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287512467703">Blamey 2001</xref>). First, attractions are primarily <italic>nature-based</italic>, focusing normally on relatively undisturbed ecosystems and the noncaptive endemic or native <italic>charismatic megafauna</italic> (e.g., giant panda, koalas, whooping cranes) that inhabit these ecosystems. In some locations, <italic>charismatic megaflora</italic> (e.g., redwood trees) and <italic>megaliths</italic> (e.g., volcanoes, cliffs) are featured. No “natural” areas are entirely unaffected by human interference, so affiliated cultural attractions are widely acknowledged as being a complementary albeit secondary aspect of ecotourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0047287512467703">Weaver 2008</xref>). Second, ecotourist motivations are broadly <italic>learning-based</italic> along a continuum that ranges from formal educational interactions to informal personal aesthetic or spiritual appreciation. On-site interpretation is provided through diverse forms of mediation, potentially including visitor centers, tour guides, permanent signage, and personal nonelectronic or electronic guidebooks.</p>
<p>Third, ecotourism is singular in its formal pretensions of being <italic>sustainability-based</italic>. In practical terms, this should entail adherence to planning and management protocols that strive to minimize associated environmental, sociocultural, and economic costs while maximizing associated benefits. Increasingly, this adherence is manifested in affiliations with ecolabels that confer certification based on selected indicators verified by neutral third parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287512467703">Buckley 2002</xref>). The sustainability and learning criteria together differentiate ecotourism as a distinct form of “nature-based tourism,” which is a generic term referring to any tourism that relies on natural attractions, including beach resorts, spas, and aquaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287512467703">Fennell 2003</xref>). Unlike these latter nature-based activities, ecotourism is mostly pursued within protected area settings that maintain various levels of ecological integrity through legislation and regulations that accommodate complementary (i.e., nondetrimental) forms of recreation and education. Typically, small site-hardened spaces are provided to accommodate “soft” ecotourists who seek a more superficial, mediated, and diversionary experience with nature, whereas large semi-wilderness spaces elsewhere in the protected area are the domain of more biocentric and specialized “hard” ecotourists seeking deeper, more personal, and more prolonged encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0047287512467703">Weaver and Lawton 2007</xref>). While hard ecotourism as such constitutes a minute niche product, soft ecotourism may account for as much as 20% of global tourism activity according to the UNWTO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0047287512467703">Wight 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Though incubated and articulated in the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287512467703">Cater 2006</xref>), the three core criteria have been widely adopted in East Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287512467703">Choi 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0047287512467703">Yun and Sung 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0047287512467703">Yun and Kim 2008</xref>). It is only recently, however, that the deeper endogenous East Asian contours of ecotourism have been investigated despite indications of sector immensity. Assuming that protected area visitation indicates ecotourism magnitude, it is noted that the 60 million annual visitors to U.S. national parks is exceeded fivefold by visitors (almost all domestic) to Japanese national parks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0047287512467703">Weaver 2002</xref>). Similarly, many of the 878 million domestic tourist person-trips in China during 2002 focused on interactions with nature-based attractions within protected areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0047287512467703">Wu and Cai 2006</xref>). Elsewhere, more than 42.5 million visits were made to Korean national parks in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512467703">KNSO 2011</xref>), while Taiwan’s national parks recorded more than 11 million visits in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287512467703">Hwang, Lee, and Chen 2005</xref>). The increasingly important Chinese outbound market to Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0047287512467703">Sparks and Pan 2009</xref>) values exposure to nature, with 70% expecting to experience Australian natural landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0047287512467703">Tourism Australia 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>While East Asian ecotourism thus appears to be growing in tandem with this region’s emerging ascendancy in domestic, inbound, and outbound tourism, the English-language literature on the subject remains sparse. Moreover, many such studies wholly accept Western assumptions about market segmentation, satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287512467703">Lee et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0047287512467703">Tao, Eagles, and Smith 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0047287512467703">Woods and Moscardo 1998</xref>), and impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0047287512467703">Stone and Wall 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0047287512467703">Tao, Eagles, and Smith (2004)</xref> reveal adherence to core criteria among Taiwanese protected area visitors self-identifying as “ecotourists,” though a youthful age structure suggests this to be an emergent niche among a Westernized population segment. A study of Taiwanese and Australian ecotourists found that “increase (of) knowledge” was a relatively more important motivation of the former, while novelty and outstanding scenery were more important for the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0047287512467703">Woods and Moscardo 1998</xref>). Only a few studies have considered the possibilities of ecotourism with East Asian characteristics arising from the region’s unique religious and philosophical heritage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0047287512467703">Weaver (2002)</xref> speculates on a distinctive “blossom and waterfall” model, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287512467703">Buckley et al. (2008)</xref> identify a Chinese model where human health is emphasized but there are no limitations on development scale. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0047287512467703">Wen and Ximing (2008)</xref>, humans and nature are conceptualized as a unity in Chinese ecotourism because of ancient cultural values, while the Western model views humans and nature as separate entities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287512467703">Choo and Jamal (2009)</xref> propose eco-organic farm tourism as a new form of Korean ecotourism that fulfils Western criteria such as sustainable practices involving eco-cultural relationships. The high status of insects as ecotourism attractions in Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287512467703">Choi et al. 2009</xref>) and of dragonflies throughout the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047287512467703">Lemelin 2007</xref>) attest to nature-based attraction parameters not necessarily focused on megafauna.</p>
<p>Despite the evidence for distinctly East Asian dimensions of ecotourism, no studies systematically consider the contours of these dimensions or their underlying endogenous cultural meanings. Yet, this remains an important task given the dangers inherent in assuming that an innovation is adopted more or less in its original form—if East Asian ecotourism, accordingly, is assumed to be equivalent to Western ecotourism, it is more likely that the planning, management, and marketing decisions made will be inappropriate. Tourism, in an era of accelerated globalization, stimulates intercultural exposure and cross-fertilization of ideas. Hybrid innovations, in this context, are becoming more normative than exceptional but remain inadequately understood despite their demonstrations of greater adaptability to local and regional circumstances. Cross-cultural dimensions have long been recognized, but mainly with regard to such phenomena as the differential influence of culture on tourist behavior and satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287512467703">Klaus 2000</xref>), the demonstration effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287512467703">Mathieson and Wall 2006</xref>), the role of perceived cultural differences in fostering uncertainty avoidance among tourists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0047287512467703">Litvin, Crotts, and Hefner 2004</xref>), and the motivation of cross-cultural understanding among volunteer tourists and other “alternative tourists” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0047287512467703">Raymond and Hall 2008</xref>). The very meanings of travel, tourism, and visitors have different conceptualizations even within relatively small populations, thereby highlighting the need to understand cultural context and values in all behavior-related tourism research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287512467703">Berno and Butler 1996</xref>). Cultural hybridization as such is evident primarily in the commodification literature, which emphasizes how local cultural attractions incorporate external influences to meet the demands of tourist markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0047287512467703">Smith 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>This article therefore contributes to the literature by examining how the Western concept of ecotourism and its three core characteristics are reconstructed or reconceived within an East Asian context informed by the key traditional tenets of Confucianism, Zen Buddhism, and Taoism. The theoretical and managerial implications of such hybridized reconstructions are also considered. The focus on South Korea recognizes that East Asia is not a homogeneous cultural arena, making it necessary therefore to focus on a single relatively uniform subcontext as a prelude to articulating the parameters of a broader regional model. It further innovates by systematically analyzing the relevant Korean-language academic literature as a main source of data. Introducing this literature to English-speaking academics is in itself a bridging act that facilitates a mutual broadening of horizons. Finally, it interrogates the contours of a hybridized Western/Eastern ecotourism at a time when East Asian countries such as China and Japan are beginning to articulate national ecotourism policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0047287512467703">Wang et al. 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) was used to identify the complex relationships between dominant power or philosophy and the discourses of societies expressed in languages and texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0047287512467703">Van Dijk 2003</xref>). Considering the study objective to identify dominant endogenous cultural influences behind the Korean interpretation of ecotourism, CDA offers an appropriate tool that recognizes social cognition, that is, socially shared representations of societal arrangements and mental representations such as interpretation, thinking, and arguing, which subsequently construct how individuals understand themselves and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0047287512467703">Van Dijk 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287512467703">Koller 2005</xref>). The traditional Korean cultural philosophies that constitute the social cognition in this research were accessed and scoped through influential secondary sources that describe and interpret basic principles. Informed accordingly, the lead author searched for these influences in the collected data. The basic principles are introduced in the Results section so that they are proximate to the ecotourism themes or subthemes that they inform, and also because this allows us to investigate only those principles which are deemed relevant to the ecotourism results.</p>
<p>The main data source consists of South Korean refereed journal publications authored by South Korean academics. The very nature of current academic research in tourism situates English-language publications as essential elements of academic inquiry in South Korea, and consequently most of these Korean sources cite such publications. This provides further evidence of the hybridized nature of ecotourism investigations in South Korea, and as such is not inherently problematic with regard to devaluing or marginalizing regional cultural influences. The same applies to the likelihood that many of the authors achieved their higher educational credentials in Western universities. Acknowledging this hybrid status quo, the current study focused on distilling Korean endogenous values from the selected publications, emphasizing their social conceptualization of the nature-based, learning-based, and sustainability-based parameters of ecotourism. In addition, interviews and participant observations were conducted to augment the text analysis by providing perspectives from selected South Korean ecotourism venues revealed in those texts.</p>
<sec id="section3-0047287512467703">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>In the first data collection stage, Korean-language academic journal articles on ecotourism were identified and collected through the Korean Education and Research Information Service (KERIS) of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology. The Research Information Sharing Service (RISS) of KERIS accesses peer-reviewed academic literature from all Korean universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0047287512467703">RISS 2011</xref>) in tourism studies and any relevant disciplines. These groups are mostly university-affiliated while others are housed within specific government departments. Initial searching of the term생태관광or “ecology tourism” and 에코 투어리즘, the phonetic adaptation of the English term “ecotourism,” yielded 466 journal articles published from 1992 to 2010. Titles and abstracts were examined and those using these terms marginally, based on the first author’s academic value judgment, and those lacking the terms생태관광or 에코 투어리즘 in their titles or keywords were omitted. Accordingly, 206 journal articles, most (169) published after 1999, were retained for analysis because they had relevance to at least one core criterion of ecotourism.</p>
<p>The second stage involved semi-structured interviews with managers and volunteers at four South Korean ecotourism attractions as well as participant observation of visitors and scenery. The selected sites were identified from the article database, 32 of which studied or mentioned specific South Korean ecotourism places. One relatively remote protected area and three near metropolitan Seoul were selected because of their relatively frequent citations in these articles, and also their popularity (annual visitation ranging from 300,000 to 1.5 million). Arrangements were made to visit the target sites and approval was secured to interview a random selection of willing managers and volunteers at all four sites. The four interviewed site managers were all government employees focused mainly on daily administrative and operational affairs. The five on-site volunteers, in contrast, came into contact with large numbers of visitors on a regular basis and therefore were more likely to have experience-based opinions about the ecotourism products they mediate as well as the activities and perceived attitudes of visitors. By accessing both perspectives, it was possible to obtain a more comprehensive supply-side understanding of Korean ecotourism to complement the text analysis. All interviews were tape-recorded and lasted 1 to 1.5 hours each with a focus on the perceived activities and attitudes of visitors, including their understanding of “nature,” the meaning of being in nature, visit motivations, on-site activities, visitor characteristics and changes, and levels of environmental awareness.</p>
<p>Most visitors to these venues were participating in various types of preorganized and mostly educational activities. The managers of the attractions therefore advised that the research team should not interview the visitors during their time on site as this would interfere with their planned experiences. On this advice, the visitors were not formally interviewed. Given this context, participant observation of visitors was essential, being a method widely employed by anthropologists to reveal meaning from certain activities or ways of life of the observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287512467703">Palmer 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0047287512467703">2005</xref>). Our aim here was to identify manifestations of dominant endogenous cultural influences by observing visitor interactions with the site, their activities, interactions among visitors, and interactions between visitors and volunteers. Observations were recorded through photos and notes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0047287512467703">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The 206 articles were systematically sorted to facilitate manual coding of extracted sentences and phrases that reflect endogenous influences. Relevant phrases and sentences were recorded by article number, page, paragraph, and line. Relevant sections were directly copied and pasted from the collected PDF articles when possible. Interview transcripts were coded using different notes on the transcriptions to record the reflected endogenous cultural values. Computer software that may have facilitated sorting and storing data, such as NVivo, was incompatible because 202 of the 206 articles were available only as PDF files that cannot be coded within the software system. Subsequently, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software was used to convert the image files into text-based files in an attempt to enable coding within the qualitative data analysis software. However, with the use of currently available OCR, the converted files required manual cleaning of the converted texts, requiring perhaps an equal if not greater deal of time than manual coding. Manual coding and analysis were therefore conducted for this study.</p>
<p>The analytic procedure related the semiotics of the texts and conversations with the target endogenous philosophies. In particular, semantics of texts and conversations identified particular expressions and the use of words that portrayed the embedded social cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0047287512467703">Van Dijk 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287512467703">Koller 2005</xref>). The analysis, thus, focused on the social meaning and structure of the lexicon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287512467703">Chilton and Schaffner 1997</xref>). Constant comparison and verification, the core of qualitative research technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287512467703">Boeije 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287512467703">Glaser and Strauss 1967</xref>), was used, resulting in systematic categorization of the findings against the major philosophical principles identified in the literature on the East Asian cultural philosophies, very few explicit references to which were made in the ecotourism publications. No single element of the articles was omitted from the analysis in searching for the endogenous influences.</p>
<p>All text data, including interview transcripts, were initially analyzed by the first author, who is a bilingual Korean/English tourism researcher. Relevant sections of text data from the initial analysis were translated into English for continuing analysis among all coauthors. Ultimately, 140 articles (68%) proved relevant to the construct of nature, 144 (70%) to education, and 143 (69%) to sustainability. Attendant themes and their frequencies are depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287512467703">Table 1</xref>. Additional field notes and photos were used as referential sources, often confirming what was captured in the publications and interview data sets. Observed actions and interactions of the visitors, recorded in field notes and photos, were searched and located to provide a richer context for the journal articles and interview transcript data sets. In concert with the desire to identify the ecotourism experience from the visitor perspective, the participant observation of visitors involved no probing or intentional questions/actions that might have altered their unself-conscious interactions. The gathered data from field notes and photos, therefore, were treated as representations of the visitors’ view toward ecotourism and used as a signifier of a meaning in the analysis.</p>

<p>The meaning of nature in Korean ecotourism focuses on the unity of the human and physical environment, as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0047287512467703">Wen and Ximing (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0047287512467703">Sofield and Li (2007)</xref>. The tendency to regard all elements of the universe as one entity is a core tenet of East Asian philosophies. In particular, the Zen Buddhist “relational dimension” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287512467703">James 2003</xref>, p. 145) perceives that all elements in the universe are related beings, eventually becoming one identical unity. This principle is rooted in the “emptiness” teaching that holds all properties to be interrelated and interdependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287512467703">Graef 1990</xref>). Illustrating this is a wooden chair that evokes the presence of a tree, which demonstrates the presence of a forest, which further proves the presence of the sun. The wooden chair also proves the existence of a carpenter. Similarly, the presence of apple blossoms reveals the presence of the apple and eventually the universe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0047287512467703">Thich 1988</xref>, p. 153).</p>
<p>Confucian and Zen Buddhist philosophy share this organic view of the universe where “[everything] belong[s] to one organic whole” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0047287512467703">Mote 1971</xref>, p. 19). Specifically, Confucianism recognizes the three main universe elements of heaven, earth, and humankind. In this triadic relationship, the human is perceived as the child of father heaven and mother earth. Sharing the same father and mother, all humans are regarded as brothers and sisters with all things becoming companions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0047287512467703">Tu 1985</xref>, p. 157). Importantly, Taoism influenced the development of Confucianism and Zen Buddhism in East Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0047287512467703">Stepaniants 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287512467703">Hartz 1993</xref>), holding that all things are created from “nothingness” and seeing the universe as “oneness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0047287512467703">Sabelli 1998</xref>, p. 432). What appears unique in Taoism is the pervasive cosmic interaction of “negative” yin and “positive” yang, which share a unified <italic>chi</italic> or energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0047287512467703">Saso 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0047287512467703">Shin 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Reflecting the three endogenous philosophies, culture and history were accepted as ecotourism resources in their own right in 133 of the 140 publications analyzed for this criterion. One subtheme—the explicit expression of the unity and interdependence of human and physical environments—emerged in 47 articles. Affiliated sentiments were frequently expressed: “humans live within natural environment . . . without the benefits from the natural environments, we are unable to live” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512467703">Lee 1993</xref>, p. 43); “heaven, earth and human as a harmonious one entity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287512467703">Kim 1997</xref>, p. 140); “the interdependent and collective relationship between sentient beings (all living things including human) and environment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287512467703">Kim, Lee, and Kim 2003</xref>, p. 62). Reciprocity was prevalent in the interdependent relationship between human and physical environments. For example, certain names of forests reflected the interdependent relationship: preventing-wind forest (for villagers’ well-being) (방품림), securing-coastline forest (for the safety of fishers) (어부림), shrine forest (for villagers’ well-being) (성황림) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287512467703">Hong and Kim 2007</xref>, p. 447), and temple-guarding forest (for the well-being of Buddhist monks and Buddhists) (사찰림) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512467703">Lee 1993</xref>, p. 62) and these were all recommended as unique <italic>ecotourism</italic> resources. This interdependent relationship between human and physical environments was also captured in the interviews, as volunteers stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>Human and nature [are] one . . . coming close to nature, I can feel that even small things or plants are just like human, they have their own characters in their lives. I feel we all become one like that and live together. (volunteer, female, mid-50s)</p>
<p>When I come close to nature, because nature embraces me, I feel like an emperor. (volunteer, male, mid-60s)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The first extract shows the interviewees’ underlying philosophy that everything in nature, even small things or plants, deserve respect and possess their own individual characteristics, forming one (하나) inseparable entity <italic>together</italic> (함께) with humans. Also, as <italic>nature embraces me</italic> (자연이 날 포옹해 주니까), the existential feeling of the volunteer was elevated.</p>
<p>While reciprocity between human and physical environments was prevalent in the identified theme, some articles (26 of the 47 in this subtheme) recommended specific physical environments as valuable ecotourism resources because of the critical way they shape human life. Recommending a tidal flat area and a remote island, the following descriptions of these physical environments show the ways in which people’s working hours and lifestyle are shaped by the physical environment:
<disp-quote>
<p>Lifestyle and work of the people who live around Kanghwa Tidal Flats, are intimately related to the rhythm of the tidal flat. People can work about 3 hours a day in the tidal flats between tides. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287512467703">Ahn 1998</xref>, p. 262)</p>
<p>Natural environment has become the root of human life on the island . . . the background of human settlement . . . the human ecology is inherent on the island. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287512467703">Kim, Lee, and Kim 2003</xref>, p. 60)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The descriptive phrase <italic>rhythm of the tidal flat</italic> makes the tidal flat a living entity, having an “intimate” relationship with its residents. These words used in this context accentuate the traditional cultural view on the interdependent relationship between human life and physical environments. In the second quote, the natural environment was described as <italic>the root of human life</italic>, giving life to the residents. Without this <italic>root</italic> (the physical environment), human life would not have been possible on the island. An on-site volunteer conferred the same sentiment when discussing the motivation for her willingness to volunteer on the site. She said the passion for doing the right thing for nature is her motivation because this means doing the right thing to ourselves:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s the passion . . . because human and nature are just the same. (volunteer, female, mid-30s)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Reciprocally, aspects of human life that have shaped physical environments are emphasized in 21 of the 47 articles. For example, several regarded the De-Militarized Zone (DMZ), designated as a nonmilitary space in the Korean War ceasefire agreement of 1953, as a prominent ecotourism resource. Off-limits for almost 60 years, it has become a unique natural treasure where native flora and fauna have flourished untouched by humans, prompting its designation as one of the nation’s top 10 ecotourism destinations by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, albeit more in potential than practice because of persisting geopolitical uncertainties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287512467703">Huh 2011</xref>). While formally designated 2 km on North and South along the 38th line parallel division, areas of up to 25 km on both sides constitute a practical domain of the DMZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287512467703">DMZ 2004</xref>). The phrases and expressions that related the DMZ to human history were frequent even though, paradoxically, the physical human presence is minimal:
<disp-quote>
<p>What has become of an immensely unique place with its abundant natural beings, DMZ is an aspect of our historic culture with many of its parts riddled with poignant memories of ours. . . . This is “our modern heritage.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287512467703">Kim 1998</xref>, p. 592)</p>
<p>DMZ is the area for unique flora and is a habitat for unusual fauna recognized by the international world. This is the only remaining heritage of the Cold War and evidence to the tragedy of the North and South division of our nation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287512467703">Lee 2005</xref>, p. 247)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, physical environments such as mountains, rivers, trees, or natural caves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287512467703">Chung and Jeon 1999</xref>) were made especially meaningful because of human influences. Unique trees or wild mushrooms were often designated as natural monuments for ecotourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0047287512467703">Park 1998</xref>) because they were believed to reflect certain human history. An ancient willow tree thought to have survived from the Shilla period (57 <sc>bc</sc> to <sc>ad</sc> 935) and an old pine tree that survived the Korean War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0047287512467703">Noh 1998</xref>) were both regarded as good ecotourism resources <italic>because</italic> they have seen and experienced human history.</p>
<p>The Korean meaning of nature in ecotourism therefore situates as a different construct from the West, being profoundly influenced by Confucian, Zen Buddhist, and Taoist philosophies, and can be conceptualized as an interdependent unity of human and physical environments. In this inseparable unity, human life is shaped by, and shapes, physical environments.</p>

<title>Education: Self-Cultivation for Worldly Development</title>
<p>From the 144 coded articles dealing with this criterion, the meaning of education can be distilled as self-cultivation for worldly development, involving a hybrid of Confucian and Zen Buddhist ideas. Identified in 27 of the 144 articles was the perception that raising environmental awareness among Korean as well as domestic visitors is important for the country’s ecotourism development. Indeed, expressions such as “tourists and residents’ environmental awareness development is essential" (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0047287512467703">Park and Kim 2001</xref>, p. 111); “visitors need education for environmental awareness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287512467703">Kim and Cho 1998</xref>, p. 162); “those who have the [right] attitude, should be offered with mud flat ecotourism products that can give an education through adventure or fun” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287512467703">Oh, Lee, and Lee 2009</xref>, p. 122); “to develop ecotourism, visitors’ attitudes and awareness to environment need changing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287512467703">Cho, Kim, and Kim 2004</xref>, p. 1) exemplify the need to develop ecotourism “correctly.”</p>
<p>Crucially, it is the conservationist ethics of the <italic>West</italic> that provide the correct path, and interviewees said that there is <italic>not even a proper market</italic> (manager, male, mid-40s; manager, male, mid-50s; on-site volunteer, female, early 30s) in Korea for ecotourism, wondering why the first author would come to Korea for ecotourism research. All interviewed managers and volunteers agreed that Korean visitors to their sites are not as sophisticated as Western visitors and need to have more developed attitudes that follow Western conservationist ethics. From their viewpoint, a researcher from Australia can hardly learn anything novel from the Korean experience. The high value placed on perceived Western ideals is further evidenced in the 77 (of 144) articles that used English-language references in their arguments for conservationist ethics, often to contextualize the concept of ecotourism. For example:
<disp-quote>
<p>WTO declared 2002 as the year of ecotourism . . . since the advent of the term ecotourism, Douglas et al. (2001) defined the concept with 4E (environmentally based, ecologically sound, educative and ethical). . . . According to the definitions above, ecotourism can be said to promote social activism such as protection of local culture and empowerment of local society. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287512467703">Jung 2006</xref>, p. 59)</p>
<p>In order to minimize negative impacts from tourism, a new paradigm has been called for (Pizam, 1978; Thomason, Crompton and Kamp, 1979; Broughham and Butler, 1981; Pizam and Millman, 1986; Martin and Uysal, 1990; Ross, 1992), consequently giving rise to a sustainable development paradigm which requires a wise use of resources in tourism . . . in order to conserve a wetland, the term “ecotourism” was first used by Ceballos-Lascurain, an environmental conservationist and a politician. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0047287512467703">Park 2000</xref>, pp. 68-69)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The desire for development reflects Confucian education ethics of worldly self-cultivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0047287512467703">Yi 1985</xref>), because the ideal cultivated character—a “noble man” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287512467703">Goldman 1995</xref>) or a “gentleman” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0047287512467703">Wong and Loy 2001</xref>)—can govern the nation effectively with authority and knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287512467703">Haynes 2009</xref>). Therefore, the Confucian view of education is for worldly connection and development that can lead to political power and success; pursuing Western conservationist ethics represents the aspiration for worldly connection to the political and economic powers of the contemporary world. Although 26 of 144 articles referenced Asian exemplars, these were countries, like Japan, which have already successfully adopted and implemented Western values and strategies for ecotourism. Japan’s parliament acted to promote ecotourism in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287512467703">Hong and Kim 2007</xref>), and its successful adoption and implementation of the Western ecotourism philosophy into their Asian society was used to illustrate how Japan successfully pursued the developed way and thus should be emulated by Koreans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287512467703">Ko 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0047287512467703">Park 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The aspiration to learn for development was apparent at the individual level through participant observation. Visitors in school or family units were keen to learn something more to help them advance in their school work, and eventually in competitive East Asian society. When something deemed worthwhile to learn was introduced by the volunteers, the visitors would dutifully queue to take photos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0047287512467703">Figure 1</xref>) and parents would often tell their children to get close to the “teacher” (volunteer) to learn more. The use of the word “teacher” (선생님) manifests the “right way” of learning to achieve development. Although it is customary in contemporary Korean language use to append “teacher” after a title as a sign of respect, the use of the word by the visitors was more than just that—the visitors were eager to learn something more about nature, firmly believing that the learning would help them advance socially. Further, volunteers often said that visitors seemed to value their ecotourism experience more if they had to compete against other people to obtain the experience, even if only through some simple online reservation system. The following comments overheard from a volunteer and a visitor illustrate the importance of the learning dimension:
<disp-quote>
<p>Ecotourism experience is not simply done because other people do, it is all for the purpose of learning more. . . . It’s a good education. (manager, male, mid-40s)</p>
<p>(<italic>Speaking to her little daughter about 3 years old</italic>) This is all learning, good education . . . don’t need to spend a lot of money for education. (visitor, female, mid-30s)</p>

</fig>
<p>With the established “right way” to follow, the Zen Buddhist principle that views small and nonsentient beings as integral parts of nature was often taken up to convey the developed world’s conservationist ethics (77 from 144 coded articles). In Zen Buddhist philosophy, the realm of nature extends to nonanimal species and seemingly nonsentient beings such as mountains, rivers, or even pebbles on the beach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287512467703">James 2004</xref>). The inclusion of these nonsentient beings within the realm of nature, or things that can reach enlightened Buddhahood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512467703">LaFleur 1989</xref>), is a uniquely Zen Buddhist trait not found in the Indian tradition of Buddhism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287512467703">Lafleur 2000</xref>). For example, one article emphasized the role of red pine mushrooms in realizing the goal of ecotourism, which is “to provide educational tourism, generate environmental conservation, and generate residents’ economic benefits” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287512467703">Jeong, Roh, and Lee 2007</xref>, p. 106). Similarly, “micro-organisms in wetland, insects, freshwater fish, orchids and caves” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287512467703">Oh 2004</xref>, p. 160) were all recommended as ecotourism resources. Small and nonsentient entities were also prevalent and explicit in interviews and participant observations, as one volunteer explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>Through insects and plants, we need to show the importance of nature to the visitors . . . the conservation of environment. (on-site volunteer, female, mid-40s)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other interviewees mentioned phytoncide, an antimicrobial organism generated by plants, as having purported health benefits for humans. According to one informant, the information on phytoncide is well known among Koreans interested in nature-based leisure activities. The specific scientific term was used often by managers and volunteers, as evidenced in the following typical comment about its purported health benefits:
<disp-quote>
<p>[We] need nature . . . there is plenty of evidence nature is good to improve health . . . the deeper forest you walk into, the more phytoncid [you] obtain to de-stress. (volunteer, female, early to mid-50s)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Volunteers were often observed exposing visitors to “micro-flora” and “micro-fauna” such as small leaves, water insects, various fungi, galls on dead leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0047287512467703">Figure 2</xref>). Other encountered written interpretation included books dedicated to galls, bee hives, and dragonflies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0047287512467703">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>These findings reflect South Korean ecotourism’s attention to micro elements of the environment and support the suggestion by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0047287512467703">Weaver (2002)</xref> that Japan, Korea, and China constitute a “blossom and waterfall” ecotourism region. The findings also corroborate the view that East Asian countries such as China, Japan, and Korea give context-oriented attention in their aesthetic preference that emphasizes the broad background. Comparatively, the West displays an object-oriented attention in their aesthetic preference, emphasizing major objects (i.e., the aforementioned charismatic mega fauna) over broad background or small details (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287512467703">Masuda et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, the distilled essence of education in South Korean ecotourism is Confucian self-cultivation that seeks learning opportunities of developed world’s environmental conservationist ethics. This support for the conservationist ethics reflects the Zen Buddhist perception of small or nonsentient beings as nature.</p>

<title>Sustainability: Creative Transformation for Harmony</title>
<p>The South Korean ecotourism construct of sustainability, as distilled from 143 relevant articles, focuses on the core Confucian tenet of “creative transformation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0047287512467703">Tu 1985</xref>, p. 75; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0047287512467703">Tucker 1991</xref>, p. 64) and also reflects the deeply underlying Taoist view that the universe is “the fusion and intermingling of vital forces . . . mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, animals and human beings,” which exist in “Great Harmony or the Tao” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0047287512467703">Tu 1985</xref>, p. 41). This derives from the above-mentioned Eastern worldview that all elements interact as a single unity. Accordingly, creative transformation relates to cultivating complementary human and physical environments in tandem, as it “evokes and establishes resonances between the human and the natural worlds” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0047287512467703">Tucker 1998</xref>, p. 19). Fundamentally, cultivating physical environments and cultivating oneself as a human are “analogous means of creating harmonious worlds” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0047287512467703">Tucker 1998</xref>, p. 20). Creative transformation, subsequently, can be defined as any changes occurring in or made to human and physical environments that have the effect of <italic>achieving harmony</italic>.</p>
<p>Most articles (133) regard ecotourism as a contemporary way of conserving nature by keeping harmony with the constantly changing human world. And, critically, this requires certain changes, as in the following examples: “well maintained and conserved, even plain nature can become ecotourism resource” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287512467703">Lim 1994</xref>, p. 266); “We should develop the seashore and many marine villages in the surrounding Jeonnam province as an ecotourism area . . . this is to conserve an ecologically healthy coast” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287512467703">Gwak, Kim, and Kim 2008</xref>, p. 227); “To conserve the threatened natural environments, [they] have to be used as ecotourism resources” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287512467703">Jeon 2008</xref>, p. 189). In the Korean concept of sustainability in ecotourism, “well conserved and nurtured nature [for ecotourism]” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0047287512467703">Yun and Sung 2004</xref>, p. 8) is the new form of conserving nature, because it is in harmony with the contemporary human world.</p>
<p>References to creative transformation in the articles were implicit, with one exception that did not, however, cite it as a Confucian referent. Published in 1997, an early stage of Korean ecotourism, this article used the term in relation to the direction or desired outcome of the country’s ecotourism development:
<disp-quote>
<p>“Creative transformation [means] keeping balanced harmony even with unavoidable changes.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287512467703">Kim 1997</xref>, p. 140)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While the use of the Confucian term here may be coincidental, it highlights an important aspect of South Korean notions of sustainability—a singular emphasis on a conservationist-like approach. This is demonstrated in the choice of the Korean words: 보전 for the English word “transformation” in the above publication. The original text combining both Korean and English presented 창의적 보전 (creative transformation). The first word 창의적 literally means “creative,” clearly matching the Korean to English translation. However, the second word <italic>translation</italic> does not literally match the Korean to English translation. Indeed, the literal meaning of the second word 보전 is “conservation,” not “transformation.” Reflected in this lexical choice is the social cognition that views conservation and transformation as closely related or even interchangeable concepts. The fact that the Korean word meaning “conservation” was used for the English word “transformation” further accentuates the Korean emphasis on the concept comparable to the well-accepted Western understanding of conservation as long-term resource <italic>utilization</italic> that does not exhaust the resource or significantly disrupt surrounding ecological systems—that is, human changes of physical environment occur but are in <italic>harmony</italic> with carrying capacities. Notably, there were no implicit or explicit references to the Western preservationist concept.</p>
<p>Of the 133 articles that viewed ecotourism as a new form of conserving nature while keeping harmony with the constantly changing human world, 99 advocated making changes to physical environments, while 64 advocated changes to culture to conserve those environments. Twenty-nine articles advocated changes to both, as in the following example:
<disp-quote>
<p>The unique dietary life of southern coast, housing structure and culture—without conserving and making them sophisticated in the eyes of modern people, it is difficult to achieve economic gains from tourism development. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287512467703">Kim and Jang 1998</xref>, p. 231)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above extract emphasized <italic>conserving and making them</italic> (cultural and physical ecotourism resources) <italic>sophisticated in the eyes of modern people</italic>. This reflects the underlying interdependent/unity philosophy—when part of the universe changes, to be in harmony, other parts should also change. Changes to the physical environment by humans that reflect temporal moments of human society, therefore, should be evaluated as human efforts to be in harmony with the universe in line with the Confucian “self-cultivation” notion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0047287512467703">Tucker 1991</xref>, p. 65). Tendencies to regard certain human changes on natural environments as harmonious changes rather than disturbing human exploitation of nature were reflected in the interviews, as stated by one of the managers:
<disp-quote>
<p>If visitors see nature in its own form in this ecology park, they would relate that to the times when Korea was very poor . . . as if the whole world has moved on but nature hasn’t. (Manager, female, mid-30s)</p>

<p>The fieldwork, unsurprisingly, revealed the ubiquity of historical as well as contemporary human artifacts within protected areas. For example, in the middle of a national park—a highly protected area—a national cemetery refurbished in the government’s initiative to maintain cultural and natural heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512467703">Han et al. 2010</xref>) features newly erected modern monuments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0047287512467703">Figure 4</xref>) and new interpretive signage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0047287512467703">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<p>This example highlights different aesthetic ideals in East Asian and Western society. Aesthetic ideals of nature in China, unlike in the West, make certain human changes to the physical environment culturally acceptable and even desirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287512467703">Buckley et al. 2008</xref>). The changes, from this perspective, integrate human cultural spirits as epitomized in an event for democracy in the country. The center towers, the highest and most prominent artifacts on the site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0047287512467703">Figure 4</xref>), signify the high spirits of the people who fought for the country’s democracy. For South Koreans, commemorative towers like these do not pose a negatively contrasting effect aesthetically; rather, they are viewed as the harmonious integration of the human spirit with the surrounding physical environment.</p>
<p>On the surface, this practice also appears to contradict the Western perspective where introducing new human elements in a strictly protected area is generally not acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0047287512467703">Sofield and Li 1998</xref>) beyond spatially restricted zones that accommodate visitor facilities. On a closer inspection, however, the Confucian creative transformation notion and Western conservation notion share a fundamental value. The Western conservation notion holds that physical environments do not remain static but grow, mature, and become regenerated over time in contexts of intragenerational and intergenerational stewardship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0047287512467703">WCED 1987</xref>). In creative transformation where everything in the universe is a single unity, all elements transform together along with other related elements in the universe. The primary reason for the transformation in the Confucian view is to be in harmony with all other elements of the universe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0047287512467703">Tu 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0047287512467703">Tucker 1998</xref>). Because all transformation seeks <italic>harmony</italic>, there has to be certain limits to change, as in Western conservation. Indeed, 68 of 143 articles presented arguments for conservation within the sustainability criterion with foreign (mostly English-language) references. The acceptable boundaries in East Asian creative transformation notion rest on <italic>seeking harmony</italic> among all elements of universe.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Westerners may feel flattered by the extent to which ecotourism has been embraced in South Korea, but should not be complacent in assuming that all of its “Western” dimensions have been accepted as is, given the frequency of English-language citations in the analyzed texts and the likely Western educational background of many authors. This study clearly shows that while all three core characteristics of ecotourism have been retained, each is conferred with distinctive endogenous flavors that collectively define a hybridized but uniquely South Korean model of ecotourism with distinctive theoretical and managerial ramifications. Essential theoretical ground for this model is the construct of nature as interdependent unity between human and physical environments, intertwined with and extending to the meaning of education and sustainability. At least three theoretical implications can be drawn from this position. First, the South Korean notion of ecotourism development is different from the West’s where hard and soft forms are respectively accommodated within—to use a U.S. example—National Parks and National Forests. South Korean ecotourism, where both culture and human constitute nature with equal importance, occurs in what appears at least superficially to be the soft form in all settings, including protected areas, though the DMZ may constitute a notable historically specific anomaly. Since all three core criteria of ecotourism appears to be satisfied in these settings, we believe that this is not merely generic nature-based tourism focused on superficial encounters with scenery.</p>
<p>The first implication extends to the acceptable limits to change in South Korea where harmony “establishes the resonances between the human and the natural worlds” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0047287512467703">Tucker 1998</xref>, p. 19), requiring any changes on culture or physical environments to be in line with the changing human world. Throughout the research, it was notable that intragenerational creative transformation in South Korea was focused on reaching harmony with the developed world by realizing the social and economic development of the country. In practice, this South Korean idea of “creative transformation” entails tolerance for a very high threshold (by Western standards) of “appropriate” landscape modification. This tendency was viewed in the Chinese form of ecotourism as having no effective limits on the scale of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287512467703">Buckley et al. 2008</xref>). This is similarly illustrated in Korea by the government-sponsored <italic>Saemangeum</italic> Development Mega-Project, a projected new urban center of 800,000 residents that involves the massive transformation of a coastal rural landscape but is being marketed as an <italic>ecotopia</italic> and an appropriate venue for <italic>ecotourism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0047287512467703">Weaver 2011</xref>). Seeing human-made artifacts that reflect the contemporary era of industrialized modernity and feeling favorable about it may be attributed to cultural aspirations to be in harmony with modern life. Consideration should also be given to the social and economic developmental trajectories of South Korea and other East Asian countries in their adoption of Western ideologies as well as their adherence to endogenous cultural philosophies.</p>
<p>The third theoretical implication is the diverse dimensions of ecotourism in South Korea that arise from the natural/cultural amalgam. One English-language publication positions South Korean organic farm tourism as a possible new form of ecotourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287512467703">Choo and Jamal 2009</xref>). Within the Korean database, articles referred to various forms of tourism as ecotourism, including temple stay and slow tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287512467703">Jin 2010</xref>), rural tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287512467703">Kim 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287512467703">Lee and Lee 2006</xref>), farm and fishing village tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287512467703">Byun 2000</xref>), and mountain eco-village or forest ecotourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0047287512467703">Park and Oh 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0047287512467703">Yun and Sung 2004</xref>). Because the boundaries between culture and physical environments are blurred, influenced by the East Asian cultural construct of nature, viewing human culture-related elements as ecotourism resources is not surprising.</p>
<p>The South Korean construct of nature in ecotourism also has an implication for the managers of nature-based protected areas wishing to attract inbound South Korean or other East Asian visitors. The managers may wish to more explicitly incorporate human associations with physical environments, such as the Stinson wreck rescue story in Australia’s Lamington National Park (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0047287512467703">O’Reilly 1990</xref>), when developing nature-based experiences for such visitors. South Korean visitors are also likely to seek small or even lifeless things in nature as interest foci informed by their cultural tendency. Nature-based attractions may, therefore, benefit from developing products that feature small flora and fauna such as unique wild orchids endemic to the area, small insects and arachnids, or even dead fungus-encrusted tree trunks with special meanings.</p>
<p>With regard to the educational construct, South Korean visitors are very conscious of development that is world-recognized and high status. Provision of nature-based tourism experiences that are certified by a world-recognized organization may therefore be an astute managerial decision. While this may appear similar to the adoption of ecolabels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0047287512467703">Sasidharan, Sirakaya, and Kerstetter 2002</xref>), the fundamental reason for world-recognized nature-based tourism experiences for South Korean visitors would be aspiration for worldly development, while tourism ecolabels for Western visitors are fundamentally a quality control mechanism for attesting to adequate environmental management. Managers of ecotourism attractions may also benefit from working with university or research institutions that specialize in ecotourism or nature-based tourism research. Adequately trained and qualified researchers in ecotourism as on-site guides to South Korean visitors, who value knowledge for social recognition and advancement, may enhance overall visitor satisfaction and foster repeat visitation as well as positive word-of-mouth marketing.</p>
<p>There are reciprocal implications for South Korean nature-based attraction managers who would like to attract Western visitors. During the research trip to South Korea for the present study, the first author had several informal off-site conversations with Western expatriates and visitors. They commented that there is no real ecotourism in South Korea because there is too much modification of the physical environment, and therefore they were not attracted to visit the country’s designated ecotourism attractions. Tourism managers, in their overseas marketing, may therefore need to consider that those sites which may fulfill Western expectations of an ecotourism experience are not necessarily those actually designated and marketed as such.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article identifies a South Korean model of ecotourism in which the three interrelated “Western” core criteria are assimilated but fundamentally (if implicitly) informed by the tenets of endogenous Confucian, Zen Buddhist, and Taoist philosophies. Nature is situated as the unity and interdependence of human and physical environments, while education is self-cultivation for worldly development that seeks to emulate “successful” Western conservationist ethics. Sustainability is creative transformation for harmony that applauds change in line with development and modernization. Ecotourism in South Korea, accordingly, is different from ecotourism in the West in being, ostensibly, a variant of the “soft” dimension. As such, consideration of the planning and managerial implications associated with distinctive aesthetic ideals, objectives, and acceptable limits of change to physical environments is required.</p>
<p>With regard to limitations, reliability of the results may be limited by the fact that initial translations and identifications of relevant text were the responsibility of just one author, a native Korean speaker. In addition, the current study may have delved into another level of analysis had there been compatibility between available software for text analysis and the Korean language. Interviews with the Korean academics, who wrote the studied research papers, site managers/volunteers, and visitors, would also provide a more comprehensive version of South Korean form of ecotourism. More generally, while the findings of the current paper present a South Korean perspective as informed by Taoism, Confucianism, and Zen Buddhism, the findings need to be further contexualized through research in adjacent East Asian countries contexts such as China and in Japan. As the cultural philosophies of East Asia have varying degrees of society-specific adaptation, issues such as political and economic developmental trajectories in individual countries need to be taken into consideration when seeking the contours of a broader regional ecotourism model. Further research, thus, may investigate the interplay between contemporary Chinese political experiences and traditional East Asian values as it affects nature-based tourism activities in and outside China.</p>
