<abstract>
<p>Poly(ethylene 2,6-naphthalate)- PEN is a thermoplastic polyester characterized by a high glass transition temperature (125°C), comparable to that of polyetheretherketone (143°C), but with a significantly lower melting temperature (265°C). Its physical and chemical properties are very promising for applications in transport industry and aeronautics. Nanocomposite matrices based on PEN and expanded graphite were developed to be used as matrix for foams. Expanded graphite was melt blended with the polymer by means of extrusion process and its effects on the foaming properties were investigated through solid state foaming process. Graphite nanoparticles increased the crystallization kinetics of the polymer, inducing the formation of small crystals but lowering the total amount of crystalline phase. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed a good dispersion of the nanofiller but some aggregates were still present, as also confirmed by graphite peak in the X-ray diffraction patterns of all nanocomposites. The elastic modulus of nanocomposites with amorphous matrix increased with respect to the neat amorphous PEN, while the modulus of crystallized nanocomposites decreased. Nanocomposite foams were successfully prepared, and an higher cell density was obtained when compared to the neat PEN. In the latter case, a strong increase in both yield and strain at break was measured. Furthermore, the elastic modulus and compressive yield stress of foamed PEN nanocomposites increased with the expanded graphite.</p>

<p>Poly(ethylene 2,6-naphthalate)- PEN is a high-performance thermoplastic polyester with rigid naphthalene rings and a flexible aliphatic diol unit, used as films in magnetic tapes and packaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X12449641">1</xref></sup> Compared with poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET), this polymer show superior thermal, mechanical, barrier, and chemical resistance properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X12449641">1</xref></sup> PEN has a glass transition temperature of 125°C and a continuous working temperatures between 125°C and 150°C, but its melting temperature is low (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 265°C) in respect with those of high-performance thermoplastic polymers such polyphenylesulphide (PPS, 295°C) and polyetheretherketone (PEEK, 345°C), giving advantage for the lower processing costs. These properties make PEN potentially useful, in particular in a wide range of applications as either solid matrix or foam, when a high continuous working temperature is needed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021955X12449641">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The use of nanoparticles as polymer reinforcement has been widely studied in literature because of their huge potential for providing novel performances with low filler content. Several functional properties, such as electrical conductivity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021955X12449641">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021955X12449641">4</xref></sup> surface smoothness, and gas barrier properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021955X12449641">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X12449641">6</xref></sup> can also be improved with the addition of nanoparticles. They also allow an increase of the <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> of polymers and/or a shift of their continuous working temperature towards higher values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021955X12449641">7</xref></sup> They have a stronger effect on the mechanical properties with respect to composites reinforced with micro-sized fillers at the same filler content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021955X12449641">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021955X12449641">9</xref></sup> In particular, an increase of the elastic modulus and of the yield strength are obtained, usually at the expenses of the strain at break that reduces with the increase of the filler content. The increase of chemical–physical properties as well as the structural behavior in nanocomposites is related to the wide interfacial area between the filler and polymer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021955X12449641">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021955X12449641">10</xref></sup> and is strongly dependent on the efficient dispersion of the nanoparticles. In fact, the homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles is very difficult to achieve because nanoparticles with a high surface energy tend to easily agglomerate. To break up agglomerates, studies have been carried out on different dispersion techniques, such as the in situ polymerization of monomers in the presence of nanoparticles,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X12449641">11</xref></sup> the sonication,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021955X12449641">12</xref></sup> or dispersion aided by microwaves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021955X12449641">13</xref></sup> These techniques are not very attractive for industry because of their low productivity, and the melt blending technique is widely preferred.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021955X12449641">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nanocomposites based on PEN matrix and different types of nanofillers were recently investigated. The addition of nanosilica induced an increase of the crystallization kinetics as reported in Reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021955X12449641">14</xref>.</p>
<p>Among nanofillers, graphite platelets exhibit very peculiar chemical–physical properties, such as an high thermal and electrical conductivity, and exceptional in-plane mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X12449641">15</xref></sup> Graphite is a layered material, consisting of a structure where carbon atoms are bound by covalent bonds to other carbons in the same plane, while Van der Waals interactions keep adjacent layers together.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021955X12449641">16</xref></sup> Different types of nanofillers based on graphite are available: graphite oxide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X12449641">15</xref></sup> expandable graphite,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021955X12449641">16</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021955X12449641">18</xref></sup> and expanded graphite (EG).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021955X12449641">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021955X12449641">20</xref></sup> The latter is prepared by using an inorganic oxidizing acid (i.e. sulfuric or nitric acid) to intercalate graphite planes and thermally treating the resulting product to expand of the platelets layers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021955X12449641">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021955X12449641">18</xref></sup> Thermoplastic nanocomposite reinforced with expanded graphite presented an increased solvent resistance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021955X12449641">21</xref></sup> better dimensional stability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X12449641">15</xref></sup> and nucleating effect in the foaming process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021955X12449641">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021955X12449641">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>As widely assessed in literature, the addition of nanofillers can also increase mechanical properties of the polymeric foams. The increase of the elastic modulus and the stress at break obtained in nanocomposite matrices although associated with the decrease of the strain at break could be exploited in foams.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021955X12449641">22</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021955X12449641">25</xref></sup> Few works are available on the mechanical testing of nanocomposite foams, but in all cases an increase of both elastic modulus and yield stress are reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021955X12449641">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021955X12449641">27</xref></sup> The extent of the improvements is not linearly dependent on the nanofiller content and an optimum is usually detected between 0.1 wt% and 1.0 wt% of filler content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021955X12449641">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021955X12449641">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, PEN-EG nanocomposites and their foams were prepared and the effect of the nanofiller on the mechanical properties was investigated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021955X12449641"><title>Experimental</title>
<p>PEN (Teonex TN8065S from Teijin, Japan) was used as semicrystalline polymer (<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> = 125°C, <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 265°C). Proprietary expanded graphite particles- EG (platelets mean width smaller than 65 µm, platelets thickness smaller than 1 µm) were supplied by GrafTech International (TG-741 and its availability exclusively from GrafTech International Holdings, Inc.). The nanoparticles were dispersed in the polymer using a Haake Rheocord (Thermo, Germany) PTW25P twin screw extruder at a screw speed of 40 rpm. PEN samples reinforced with 0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.5% by weight of EG were prepared. Foams were obtained using supercritical carbon dioxide as blowing agent and foamed through the solid state foaming technique.</p>
<p>An hydraulic press (model P300P, from Collin Gmbh, Germany) was used to prepare samples for the mechanical characterization.</p>
<p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis on nanofilled matrices and foams was performed on cryogenic fractured surfaces with Quanta 200 FEG from FEI (Eindhoven, The Netherlands). All sample surfaces were coated with gold layer before observations to render conductive the specimen surface. Graphite dispersion was also investigated through an x-ray diffraction (XRD) analyzer at room temperature by using a X-ray generator and a diffractometer, type PW1710 (Philips, The Netherlands). The X-ray beam was a nickel-filtered CuKα radiation of wavelength 1.54 Å operated with the voltage generator set to 40 kV and at a current of 20 mA. The diffraction intensity data were collected automatically at a scanning rate of 0.6°/min with 0.02°/s steps from 5° to 60°. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed by using an TECNAI G12 Spirit-Twin with a LaB6 source (FEI; Eindhoven, The Netherlands).</p>
<p>Flexural properties were performed at room temperature according to ASTM D790 standard with a SANS 4304 (China) dynamometer on samples prepared by means of an injection molding machine according to the ASTM D790 standard ‘B’ procedure (rectangular samples with 127 × 12.7 × 3.2 mm<sup>3</sup> length × width × thickness, respectively). Compression tests on foams were performed according to ASTM D1621 standard on 20 × 20 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup> (length × width × thick) by means of the same testing machine used for flexural tests.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0021955X12449641"><title>Matrix preparation and characterization</title>
<p>SEM investigations on PEN/EG nanocomposites showed good dispersion of graphite. Platelets were not evident even at high SEM magnifications. Graphite induced the formation of spherical macromolecular aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X12449641">Figure 1</xref>) of nanometric dimensions in the PEN matrix (average dimension 200 nm). Those aggregates developed probably around graphite platelets.

<p>XRD analysis was performed on nanocomposite samples with filler content higher than 0.1% by weight due to the low sensitivity of XRD apparatus at such low graphite amount. XRD patterns showed a clear peak at 26.7°, the same main peak of expanded graphite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X12449641">Figure 2</xref>). This is due to the presence of not exfoliated graphite clusters. In order to clarify this feature, TEM analysis was conducted on 0.1 wt% and 1.0 wt% samples. In 0.1 wt% samples a good dispersion of the graphite was obtained and graphite platelets presented thickness smaller than 100 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021955X12449641">Figure 3</xref>) while the 1.0 wt% samples showed graphite platelets with higher size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X12449641">Figure 4</xref>), in both thickness and width, and some clusters were detected confirming the results from XRD analysis. In nanocomposite samples some folded graphite platelets were also detected, in particular at higher filler contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X12449641">Figure 4</xref>(B)). This filler morphology could be responsible for the lower elastic moduli exhibited in flexural tests of crystallized solid nanocomposites with respect to that of the neat polymer and the different behavior measured on foams.

<p>Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis showed that the crystallization temperature, during cooling from the melt state, shifted toward higher temperatures in nanocomposite samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021955X12449641">Figure 5</xref>). The crystallinity degree obtained after the cooling step, evaluated from the second heating scan, was much higher in nanocomposite samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021955X12449641">Table 1</xref>) with respect to the neat polymer, demonstrating that EG acted as nucleating agents for crystals. In order to investigate the effect of EG on the maximum crystallinity degree of PEN-based matrices, isothermal crystallization tests were performed at the peak crystallization temperature: neat PEN showed the highest degree of crystallinity while nanocomposites showed lower values. The increase of graphite content resulted in a reduction of crystallinity degree after isothermal crystallization, such as also reported in Reference 30 for high-density polyethylene (HDPE)/EG and in Reference 31 for the PA6/EG nanocomposite systems.

<sec id="sec5-0021955X12449641"><title>Foaming process</title>
<p>Nanocomposites were foamed at different temperatures in order to evaluate the effect of the foaming temperature on the foam density and cell density. The sample morphology obtained with the solid state foaming process showed a homogeneous microcellular structure in all matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X12449641">Figure 6</xref>). Expanded samples containing 0.1% of expanded graphite presented the lowest apparent density at quite all foaming temperatures and the highest cell density. At high filler contents, the foam density increased with respect to the neat matrix. This behavior was addressed to the increased crystallization kinetics in nanocomposite matrices, which sustained the foam morphology stabilization during cell growth in foaming process (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021955X12449641">Table 2</xref>) but, at higher graphite content, also hindered an adequate cell growth by anticipating the cystallization that resulted also in an increase of crystallinity degree. The EG acted as an efficient nucleating agent for bubbles, increasing the number of nucleated cells of one or two order of magnitude, and at the same time lowering the cell diameters from around 20 µm (neat polymeric matrix) to less than 7 µm at 0.1 wt% of graphite content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X12449641">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021955X12449641">7</xref>). At higher filler loading, the cell density did not enhance, probably due to a worst exfoliation and dispersion of graphite platelets, and a further increase in the nanoparticle content in the matrix did not give more sites useful for nucleating bubbles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021955X12449641">14</xref></sup>

<p>Expanded graphite nanoparticles significantly affected the static mechanical behavior, tested at room temperature, of matrices and foams. Nanofilled matrices exhibited higher values of the flexural modulus in the amorphous state, as a result of the reinforcing effect of the nanofiller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021955X12449641">Figure 8</xref>). This behavior is in good agreement with the results reported in Reference 15. The flexural modulus of crystallized samples showed a different behavior. The flexural modulus of the neat PEN matrix was slightly higher than that of nanofilled samples. This could be addressed to (a) the reduction of total crystalline phase in graphite filled samples with respect to the neat polymer matrix and (b) to the weakening effect related to the formation of a weak interphase between crystalline domains, nanoparticles, and amorphous domains. As also reported in literature, the presence of expanded graphite platelets can lead to a different trend of the reinforcing effect in nanocomposites kept in the amorphous state (increasing stiffness as for PEN/EG nanocomposites in Reference 15) or in the crystallized state (decreasing stiffness as for PA6/EG nanocomposites in Reference 32, poly(<italic>p</italic>-phenylene sulfide) PPS/EG nanocomposites in Reference 33, and ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA)/EG nanocomposites in Reference 34). This behavior was addressed to either a lower degree of perfection of crystals or to the presence of interphases between amorphous and crystalline domains in nanocomposite samples. Further investigations should be carried out in order to better explain this non-monotonic reinforcing behavior.
<fig id="fig8-0021955X12449641" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Mechanical properties of unfilled and graphite based nanocomposite matrices: (a) flexural modulus, (b) flexural strength, and (c) flexural strain.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021955X12449641-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The overall reinforcing efficiency is thus reduced by EG but its presence resulted in a strong increase of both stress and strain at break in crystallized samples, consequently increasing the work to break (toughening effect). Amorphous samples did not break and flexural test was terminated at 5% strain, as indicated in the standard ASTM D790.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the effect of graphite content on the flexural modulus in the crystallized samples, the contribution of the crystalline phase to the elastic modulus was estimated, by assuming a linear reinforcing effect between the completely amorphous unfilled polymer and the crystallized neat PEN (23% of crystallinity). The equivalent flexural modulus of the neat polymer with the same amount of crystalline phase measured in the nanocomposite matrices was calculated from data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021955X12449641">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021955X12449641">Figure 9</xref>, the flexural modulus (normalized to the equivalent flexural modulus of neat PEN with the same crystallinity degree) at each graphite content is shown. As evident, graphite effectively reinforced the polymer in the amorphous state, but in crystalline samples the normalized modulus is lower than unity except for samples containing 1.0 wt% of EG. A clear relation between the graphite content and the flexural modulus trend is not evident, but at 0.1 wt% the flexural modulus raised of 5%, while the best performance was exhibited by the 2.5 wt% filled nanocomposite.

<p>The presence of EG into foamed samples resulted in a different trend of the structural behavior with respect to that exhibited by unfoamed matrices. In fact, both compressive modulus and compressive strength increased with the amount of filler. The compressive behavior of the foamed samples with apparent density of 0.46 ± 0.02 g/cm<sup>3</sup> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021955X12449641">Figure 10</xref>. No peak value is evident but at just 0.1 wt% of EG content an increase of quite 40% of both mechanical features was detected. Samples with 2.5 wt% of EG exhibited the lowest increase of both compressive modulus and strength probably due to the worst EG dispersion and to higher amount of nanofiller, more difficulty to be oriented in cell walls. The different elastic behavior of foamed samples with respect to solid matrices was probably due to the alignment of the graphite platelets in the cell walls during foaming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021955X12449641">Figure 11</xref>), that increased the interface between the polymer and the filler thus better exploiting the in-plane reinforcing effect of the graphite. During the cell growth, the polymeric matrix is elongated and, as a consequence, crystals as well as graphite platelets could align in cell walls, instead of being randomly oriented or folded. The reinforcing efficiency of graphite in cell walls and struts improved giving a sound increase of both cellular structure stiffness and compressive modulus. A confirmation of this hypothesis was recently reported in Reference 35, where unfoamed graphite reinforced samples exhibited, after stretching, an increase of the mechanical response with respect to unstretched ones.

<p>Nanocomposite matrices based on PEN and expanded graphite were prepared using a melt blending technique. XRD analysis showed that a complete graphite platelets exfoliation did not take place and some aggregates were still present, as also confirmed by TEM. Furthermore, folded graphite platelets were detected. Graphite nanoparticles increased the crystallization kinetics of the polymer, inducing the formation of small crystals but, with the increase of the filler content, lowering the total amount of crystalline phase. Nanocomposite matrices were successfully foamed and expanded graphite resulted to be an efficient nucleating agent for bubbles. Foams based on 0.1 wt% filled matrix exhibited lower apparent density at all temperatures with respect to neat polymers, also showing a higher cell density. Higher filler contents increased the cell density but also the foam density, due to the increased crystallization kinetics.</p>
<p>Nanocomposite matrices in the amorphous state showed improved flexural modulus with respect to the neat PEN but crystallized samples did not confirm this trend. Graphite particles induced a strong increase in both tensile strength and strain at break and consequently their addition resulted in toughening PEN matrix. Foams showed a different behavior, because at every graphite content both compressive modulus and strength were significantly improved. This was addressed to the alignment of both graphite platelets and PEN crystallite in cell walls of foams that exploited a stronger in-plane reinforcing effect.</p>
