<abstract>
<p>This article will examine the issue of the environmental devastation and cultural despoliation of the African continent, rooted in the destruction of the Earth conceptualized in medieval and postmedieval European industrial cultures that viewed the Earth as a commodity for extraction and exploitation. The subsequent industrially induced erasure of forests; decimation of the landscape; pollution of rivers, seaways, and water systems; vitiation of clean air; and the continued subjugation of women has produced a continent now in social, economic, and cultural decay in many respects. The article is concerned with addressing the crisis of environmental degradation, economic underdevelopment, and concomitant disempowerment of women. It painstakingly proposes Indigenous cultural and cosmological approaches in the 21st century as ways of addressing the crisis of environmental despoliation and gender oppression in Africa so that humans and all life on the continent are empowered to live in community and harmony with each other, and conjointly build sustainable socioeconomies that serve the needs of Africa’s people, particularly those who reside in impoverished contexts.</p>

<p>Power in the world is such that the negative work of killing yields faster results than the slow, endless work of healing. The healer who re-enters the world dreaming of glory and power and wealth must seek power among the powerful. He joins the manipulators. They will quickly enough urge him to use his knowledge, the good and the bad, as long as it yields them more power, the faster the better.</p>
<p>Men of power have one aim in life: to maintain themselves in power. Neither good nor evil is an end to them. Both are means. Evil to them is just another unavoidable means they use to maintain their power.</p>

<title>History of Indigenous Industry and Technology in Africa</title>
<p>Africa, as it is well known, is considered to be the continent where the world’s earliest civilizations evolved. It was only in the April 28, 1995, issue of <italic>Science News</italic>, that the authors of an article conceded that new evidence found in the Congo region of Africa suggests that the earliest iron and agricultural implement makers lived in Africa some 90,000 years ago, and not in Europe 14,000 years ago, as had been previously conjectured by historians and archaeologists.</p>
<p>Nubia and Egypt in the north and eastern parts of Africa were the places where the first organized forms of human culture, science, medicine, and society emerged about 8,000 years ago. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021934713489880">John Jackson (1970)</xref> contends that it was in Ethiopia or Southern Egypt that the origin of organized human civilization began and was characterized by literacy and industrial organization in its earliest forms, Ethiopians referring to the people of “burnt faces” from <italic>Ethios</italic> (Greek for burnt) and <italic>ops</italic> (Greek for face). In ancient times, Ethiopians were the peoples who lived in the Sudan, Egypt, Arabia, Palestine, Western Asia, and India, unlike the contemporary exclusively African association with Ethiopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021934713489880">Jackson, 1970</xref>).</p>
<p>It was in Central Africa over 90,000 years ago that the Iron Age was spawned. The Nok civilization existed in West Africa in the first millennium <sc>b.c.e.</sc>, and in Nigeria, for example, the ancient God of iron, Ogun, harks back to the earliest use of iron and practice of iron smelting there thousands of years ago. Even in Egypt, evidence of iron pieces was found at the top of pyramids. In perusing the contours of African history for millennia, one realizes that “classical civilizations” existed in antiquity and even inspired the formation of organized civilizations in neighboring Greece, for instance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021934713489880">W. E. B. Du Bois (1969)</xref> reminds us that it was Egypt that gave us “the arts of shaving, the use of wigs, the wearing of kilts and sandals, the invention of musical instruments, chairs, beds, cushions, and jewelry” (p. 101) and provided the earliest organization of politics and society—“of government, defense, religion, family, property, science, and art” (p. 103). Even in a highly technical discipline like mathematics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021934713489880">Carl Boyer and Uta Merzbach (1991)</xref> point out in <italic>A History of Mathematics</italic>, that Egyptians “were commendably accurate in counting and measuring” already in the fourth millennium <sc>b.c.e.</sc>, leading to the emergence of geometry as the floodwaters of the Nile needed measurement.</p>
<p>One should also consider the histories of Black peoples like the San of Southern Africa and the Indigenous peoples of Australia who trace their history to 60,000 years ago. Although not defined by literacy, their civilizations were characterized by rock art paintings that reflected vast natural knowledge and scientific know-how about plants, trees, insects, forests, the sea, the stars, and other natural phenomena. They were also organized on principles of law and morality with religious principle being primordial. Most importantly, these ancient Indigenous civilizations were circumspect in their harnessing of the resources of the Earth, and they engaged in social practices that prevented soil erosion and devastation, war, and famine, while stone and wood implements were used for industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021934713489880">Isaacs, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0021934713489880">Welch, 2007</xref>). For instance, recent findings acknowledge that the San of Southern Africa developed technologies like pitch to attach stone and bone blades to wooden shafts and used pig tasks for planning wood some 44,000 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021934713489880">Maugh, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The ancient Kingdom of Axum in modern day Ethiopia in the first millennium <sc>b.c.e.</sc> was a major intellectual and commercial center, trading with Persia, Greece, and India. The Maghreb civilization, around the city of Carthage, which survived between 1200 <sc>b.c.e.</sc> and 200 <sc>b.c.e.</sc>, was another. The Nok civilization that originated some 3,000 years ago had developed an iron smelting industry that forged tools in around 500 <sc>b.c.e.</sc> and was singularly world-renowned for its life-sized terracotta sculptures and sophisticated art work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021934713489880">Chesi, 2006</xref>). Ceramics found from the Nok civilization of Nigeria of the 1st century <sc>b.c.e.</sc> indicate that “the city of Kukia on the Niger, former capital of Songhay before Gao, was contemporaneous with the time of the pharaohs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021934713489880">Diop, 1978</xref>, p. 4). The kingdom of Ghana emerged around the 3rd century <sc>c.e.</sc> and lasted till the 13th century, and during the 8th century <sc>c.e.</sc>, extended all across West Africa to the Atlantic. The Kingdom of Mali was established between 1230 and 1235 <sc>c.e.</sc>, peaking in the 14th century. The Songhay kingdom was spawned around 1468 and was most consolidated in the latter part of the 16th century. The Monomotapa kingdom of 15th century Zimbabwe traces its origins to the 1st century <sc>c.e.</sc> So too, “the kingdoms of East Africa with trading cities on the coast prospered from the end of classical antiquity until the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries when they fell to the Portuguese,” where trade with India, China, and the Far East produced cultures of abundance with five-storey homes, markets, and industrial centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021934713489880">Diop, 1978</xref>, p. 4). In Azania (South Africa), an iron smelting civilization thrived in the 5th century <sc>c.e.</sc> as part of the great Sotho kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021934713489880">Ngubane, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>Africa’s industrial and technological cultures fostered group solidarity and stability and did not wreak havoc on Africa’s ecology and environment, culture, and social evolution as European colonialism did.</p>

<title>Roots of Ecological Devastation on the African Continent</title>
<p>The holocaust of chattel enslavement of Africans followed by colonialist conquest and occupation is what precipitated the ecological crisis in Africa, particularly through the introduction of deep mineral mining and extraction of vital resources along with erasure of forests, trees, and underbrush through military invasions and incursions into the hinterlands of Africa from coastal lines, particularly in West Africa and Southwestern Africa. The problem redounds to the early disposition that the medieval peoples, of what subsequently came to be known as Europe in the 19th century, had toward the Earth, first assuming wrongly that the Earth was the center of the Universe and then projecting incorrectly that the Sun was the center of the universe, and that the creatures of the Earth were inherently hostile to human beings. Kirkpatrick Sale notes that the peculiar historical fact about Europe’s ecological heritage was that it was consistently one of destruction of forests, soil erosion, pollution, and annihilation in the name of human improvement and progress while ignoring the essential interconnectedness of all natural life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021934713489880">Sale, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021934713489880">Sale (1991)</xref> elaborates,<disp-quote>
<p>As to the rest of what we know of Europe’s ecological heritage, it can be seen written cross the face of the land. With some significant exceptions, it is a record of deforestation, erosion, siltation, exhaustion, pollution, extermination, cruelty, destruction, and despoliation, all done either in the name of utility and improvement for the betterment of society or, as often, in ignorance of natural systems and the human connections to them. (pp. 81, 82)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021934713489880">Sale (1991)</xref> explains that medieval Europe’s antagonism toward its forests and natural ecology was transferred to the domain of animals and that “along with ferocity in the hunt for ‘sport’” (bull-fighting in Spain, bear-baiting in Scandinavia, cockfights, etc.) was the emphasis on flesh-eating. Hunting and fishing became predominant industries in Europe during that period resulting in the depletion of fishing in the Mediterranean in the 15th century. In England, fish species like barbell, bream, and flounder drastically decreased, and herring became a rare fish in the Baltics. It is precisely this emphasis on violent Earth relations that was transmitted to Africa during the colonial period, whether it was the mining for gold and diamonds in Southern Africa in the middle of the 19th century or the erasure of rubber trees in the Congo in the early part of the 20th during the reign of colonial Belgian Leopold II recounted in the book <italic>King Leopold’s Ghost</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021934713489880">Adam Hochschild (1998)</xref>, when over 10 million Africans were killed in the insane greed for profits from enslaved African labor in the rubber plantations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021934713489880">Chinweizu, 1974</xref>). The legacy of the principle of plundering the Earth for riches during colonialism’s peak is what was transferred to the subsequent capitalist enterprise that was and still is bent on maximizing profits within the shortest time possible. The Anglo American Company that sparked the intensive mining of gold and diamonds in Southern Africa in the latter half of the 19th century was founded with this objective of optimal extraction by any means necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021934713489880">Pallister, 1988</xref>).</p>

<title>Ecological and Environmental Devastation in Africa Today</title>
<p>Even though Africa (outside of South Africa that contributes 1.5% of the global carbon dioxide emissions) contributes only marginally to the emissions of global toxic greenhouse gases (about 3.7%), compared with China (21.5%), the United States (20%) and the European Union (14%), she bears the brunt of the devastating effects of global warming and climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021934713489880">Minter &amp; Wheeler, 2009</xref>). The effects of global warming are all too evident for any observer to see: the melting of the glaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro, the drying of the waters of Lake Chad, the reduction of water levels and fishing in Lake Victoria that affect all countries in the Great Lakes region of Africa, and the cycles of drought in East Africa and Southern Africa. Ecological disaster continues to pulverize countries and peoples around the world, particularly impoverished peoples. Uganda in East Africa, for instance, saw hundreds lose their lives in mudslides on Mount Elgon in 2010 as a result of flooding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0021934713489880">South African Press Association, 2010b</xref>). The most lethal effects of ecological and environmental devastation in Africa are evidenced through processes of mining, particularly deep-earth mining, oil drilling, continuous gas flares, pollution of fragile coastlines because of industrial and sewage waste, deforestation, and dumping of toxic waste from European and other countries as with the London-based Trafigura tanker ship that dumped tons of toxic waste on Abidjan, capital of Coté d’Ivore, under cover of night in August 2006 and that resultantly poisoned 100,000 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021934713489880">Milso, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The dumping of toxic and hazardous waste on Africa in particular (it has occurred in places like the Philippines and some Asian and Latin American and Caribbean island countries) is an index of the environmental racism endemic to capitalism’s operating philosophy: while the wealthy West benefits from industry, it dumps the end and side products on those who are of the least value on the human pyramid—people of color—especially Africans. A few years ago, Guinea-Bissau was offered US$600 million for storing and disposing of toxic waste from a European country, an amount equivalent to the country’s GDP. Other cases abound like “Benin, Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria, Somalia and Zimbabwe are just a few of the countries which have violated the OAU ban against importing toxic waste trading” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021934713489880">Bomani, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In Dakar, the capital of Senegal, 2.5 million people live near a hazardous waste landfill that is a serious threat to the drinking water supply of the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021934713489880">Ibitayo, 2008</xref>). Over 15,000 tons of incinerator potash from Philadelphia was dumped on Kassa Island in Guinea by Bulkhandling, a Norwegian company. Four officials in Guinea’s Ministry of Trade connived with staff in the Norwegian consulate in Conakry to forge this illicit deal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021934713489880">Ibitayo, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The major toxicity that Africa suffers is from the effects of mining throughout the continent, particularly in those countries that are dependent on mineral extraction for the principal source of revenue, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone, Ghana, and to some extent, Mali, Senegal, and Tanzania. The DRC that “has some of the world’s biggest unexploited reserves of copper, as well as rich deposits of cobalt, iron ore, nickel, gold, diamonds, and bauxite, a raw material for aluminum” is simultaneously a haven for ecological destruction of hills and valleys where minerals abound and thick tropical forest is found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021934713489880">Bream, 2007</xref>). Columbium tantalite (coltan) needed for cell phones and nuclear-powered aircraft, niobium, uranium, chromium, petroleum, manganese, and copper are also found in this country that has seen genocide and ecological decimation through the extermination of 10 million Bakongo people in the rubber plantations as the result of Leopold’s colonial policies in the early part of the 20th century and another 4 million in the war between 1997 and 2007 after the Mobutu regime was overthrown and Laurent Kabila led a massive military onslaught for the liberation of the Congo, only to be assassinated a few years later and succeeded by his son, Joseph Kabila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021934713489880">Snow, 2008</xref>). In the Congo, 1,200 people die each day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0021934713489880">United Nations News Center, 2006</xref>). Of the people of the Congo, 80% earn less than US$1 per day and one third eat only once each day. Plantation laborers in the DRC earn as little as US$3 per month in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, working for greedy European and North American corporations like Xastra and Phelps Dodge, Euro-Australian companies like BHP Billiton, Canadian corporations Rio Tinto Zinc and IAMGold, and Euro–South African company, Anglo American.</p>
<p>Not only are there huge craters being dug out of Congo’s land areas for copper and other mineral extraction and dumped into 12-storey trucks for transporting to processing plants for international export so that these areas will never be productive again because of such strip mining, but there is also destruction of the country’s priceless forests. William Minter and Anita Wheeler (2009) write,<disp-quote>
<p>The Congo Basin is home to the world’s second largest rainforest, second only to the Amazon. Africa’s forests help regulate both temperature and rainfall. But Africa is losing more than 4 million hectares of forests a year, according to the UN Environment Programme. This is more than three times the world’s average rate, equivalent to clearing an area the size of Switzerland every year. As a result, according to UN estimates, by 2020, some African countries may see a 50% reduction in rain-fed agricultural yields.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like the Amazon rainforest, “the lungs of the planet” that has lost 20% of its cover and is under constant siege, invasion, and penetration by profit-greedy loggers and the timber industry, the Congo basin is also under serious threat.</p>
<p>Gabon is a former oil-rich country whose oil wells are speedily running dry. The government there in cahoots with predatory timber corporations from China and Europe is involved in destroying the forests that cover 85% of the country’s land area so that half of the country’s forests are now under timber lease. China is the leading importer of Gabonese timber. Although there are official Sustainable Forest Management policies and laws that govern protection of such vital forested areas, Chinese and European firms engage in illegal logging in violation of Gabon’s environmental protection laws with the complicity of the Gabonese government.</p>
<p>In Tanzania, in East Africa, processes promoting privatization of agriculture and land cultivation and liberalization of commercial policies in conformity to the dictates of globalization have particularly effected Indigenous peoples who are pastoralist and hunter-gatherers and who have seen their traditional land rights progressively eroded by government policies that favor large private transnational ranching corporations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021934713489880">Cameron, 2004</xref>). Communal lands are increasingly under threat as regimes like that of the Tanzanian government continue to modify national land protections and allow unbridled access to such lands by wealthy Western conglomerates bent on exploiting forested areas and woodlands for optimal profit. African communal lands are thus mortgaged off to the highest bidder ironically by African governments that claim that they exist to protect the health and well-being of their citizens. If most Africans are poor, Indigenous communities within Africa are clearly fourth-class citizens in the lands of their birth.</p>
<p>In Kenya, Maasai Mara is considered the world’s most popular wildlife game park, generating millions of dollars in revenue for the Kenyan government. Yet, the Kenyan government has consistently refused to honor 100-year treaty obligations from the old British colonial regime that accord the Maasai self-determination and rights to occupation of their traditional ancestral lands, causing Maasai activists to protest in 2004, resulting in many being shot dead by Kenyan police. The Maasai are currently engaged in a fierce struggle to preserve their last ceremonial ground in neighboring Tanzania, the Naimina Enkiyio Forest, and are battling the designs of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) that is funded by the European Union to keep the forest open for tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021934713489880">Johnston, 2005</xref>). The privatization of traditional Maasai lands for ownership by wealthy White companies has continued steadily during this aeon of globalization. Miyere Miyandazi, an activist from the Maasai community, walked in protest from Kenya to the east coast of South Africa to highlight Maasai’s struggle for rights to their ancestral lands and was arrested by border authorities at various points for not having a passport. He now works with homeless “street children” in eThwekwini, South Africa—Africa’s wealthiest country. Miyandazi encapsulates Maasai culture, with two rudimentary principles: to be free and enjoy life, and to live by the philosophy that land can only be used, never owned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021934713489880">Sawubona, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Mining has had devastating effects on Southern Africa, particularly on Azania/South Africa, and been the cornerstone of the South African economy for over 150 years with the mining of gold, diamonds, platinum, and other precious minerals. The country’s mining-based economy was visibly shaken by massive wildcat strikes by miners demanding decent wages and safe living condition from August through October 2012. The violent response of police and the authorities recalled South Africa’s vicious apartheid culture when over 34 miners were killed by security forces at the platinum mine in Marikana owned by Lonmin, a British mining conglomerate, on August 17, 2012. An ongoing national investigation reveals that the police may have planted weapons in the hands of the shot miners to justify their trigger-happy actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021934713489880">BBC News Africa, 2012</xref>). While there’s much talk about South Africa possessing the most substantial mineral deposits of any country in the world, estimated at US$2.5 trillion, higher than Russia’s reserves of US$1.6 trillion, little is said that many of the mines in the country are reaching exhaustion levels with some having just another 20 to 50 years left. Gold Fields, which operates the South Deep mine near Kloof, has a life expectancy of 50 years and is the country’s “last surviving deep-level gold mine.” Australian, Canadian, and European mining conglomerates like Gold Fields and Harmony, BHP Billiton, and Rio Tinto Zinc, operate these gold mines. Because of gold mining, underground water supplies around the Rand area of Gauteng in South Africa have all been polluted by residues from the mines. The South African government is supposedly now investigating the serious environmental side effects from decades of gold mining to discern ways in which these companies can be directed toward cleaning up their environmental mess.</p>
<p>The case of a South African miner who was inflicted with silicosis, first diagnosed with tuberculosis and obstructive airways disease, and subsequently terminated in 1995 after working for AngloGold then, and subsequently, AngloGold Ashanti as the company is known today, is the tip of the iceberg of the insouciance of mining capital. The man, Thembekile Mankayi, was paid 16,320 South African rands (R) or US$2,170 in damages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021934713489880">Pather, 2010</xref>). He has sued AngloGold Ashanti for R2.7 million for lethal health damages, after the Johannesburg High Court ruled in June 2008 that “Section 35 of the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act effectively takes away an employees common-law right to sue his or her employee for damages” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021934713489880">Pather, 2010</xref>). Anglo American faces another eight cases of compensation for lethal diseases sustained from mining.</p>
<p>While South Africa experiences a power generation crisis (there were three power blowouts, including a fire in one week in Pietermaritzburg in 2010), mining consumes 15% of the energy demand while it generates just 7.5% of South Africa’s GNP and industry consumes 45% of South African energy resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021934713489880">Community Organizers Toolbox, 2002</xref>). South Africa uses coal to meet up to 35% of its energy needs, which indicates an environmental disaster considering that coal burning is one of the leading causes of toxic emissions into the atmosphere and advances global warming. Given the strain on South Africa’s power grid and the critical shortage of energy capacity, up to 10% of factories and mines are faced with the prospect of closure or will be forced to radically scale down operations. South Africa is now embarking on expansion of nuclear energy, even though the lethal effects of this energy source, especially radiation leaks and effusion of nuclear waste into vital water supplies are well known around the world.

<p>What about oil drilling that today provides up to 90% of revenues for countries like Nigeria, Algeria, Angola, Libya, and lower percentages for the Sudan, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021934713489880">Gary &amp; Karl, 2003</xref>)? In oil-rich Nigeria, the situation has steadily worsened, with oil workers and community groups in the Niger Delta up in arms against Shell Oil for contaminating their water supplies, vitiating the fragile ecosystem in that region, and extracting vast oil profits while impoverishing the Ogoni people and other residents in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021934713489880">Ibeanu &amp; Luckham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021934713489880">Obi &amp; Rustad, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021934713489880">Peel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0021934713489880">Ukeje, 2003</xref>). According to the International Crisis Group, 14,000 people in Nigeria have been killed as a result of “ethnic” and interreligious community violence, often rooted in deep socioeconomic disparities among diverse classes in the country. In the first 9 months of 2008, 1,000 people were killed and a drop of US$23.7 billion in oil revenues resulted from the bleeding of Nigeria by oil corporations like Shell and Chevron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0021934713489880">Umunna &amp; Omojola, 2009</xref>). Constant attacks on oil facilities have reduced oil production by 445,000 barrels per day from a high of 2.25 million barrels per day, adding to the woes of oil production that provide 90% of Nigeria’s export earnings and 16% of its GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021934713489880">Bloomberg, 2010</xref>). The impact of constant gas flaring in Nigeria as the result of natural gas extracted accompanying oil drilling is one of the two most serious causes of carbon dioxide emissions in Africa, with Nigeria following Russia as the second largest gas-flaring country in the world with an estimated 40.6 billion cubic meters in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021934713489880">Minter &amp; Wheeler, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In September 2010, 10 people were killed by police in Maputo, Mozambique, protesting the astronomical increases in food and energy prices, in a country where the majority of people earn US$2 or less per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021934713489880">Patel, 2010</xref>). While Mozambique boasted an economic growth rate of 8% between 1996 and 2003 and a huge US$1.5 billion aluminum smelting plant, Mozal, along with a large gas pipeline to ship gas to South Africa and titanium and coal mines, most Mozambicans are unemployed and mired in deep poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021934713489880">Hanlon &amp; Keynes, 2010</xref>). Global warming has caused devastating floods in the country from the early 1990s, and with Russian wheat production handicapped by the worst heat wave in a century forcing the Russians to curb exports of wheat on which Mozambique depended, the situation in the Southeast African country became dire for the already poor majority and resulted in massive food riots in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021934713489880">Mozambique, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>What does Africa receive from all of these holes being punctured into her like the off-shore oil drilling off the coast of Libya now at far greater depths than the Gulf of Mexico BP rigs that caused what is now indisputably the world’s worst oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico with over 5 million barrels of oil that gushed into the Gulf as BP prepared to seal the leak with mud and cement in the 1st week of August 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021934713489880">Reuters, 2011</xref>)? The U.S. government approved the first new deepwater drilling permit for BP in the Gulf of Mexico since the massive toxic oil spill in April 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021934713489880">Krauss, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021934713489880">Michael Klare (2008)</xref> aptly describes the impact of oil drilling and mineral extraction on Africa:<disp-quote>

<p><italic>While the rich West grows richer, the African poor . . . die quicker.</italic> The more loans that African governments receive from Western financial institutions and “aid” agencies, the more impoverished Africans have become. As conflict theorist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934713489880">Herbert Ekwe-Ekwe (1993)</xref> explains that “the humanity of this continent has not ceased to create wealth for the West despite the obvious deterioration of local social existence” (p. 88), substantiating the fact of Africa’s orbit within Western neocolonialism as being the most formidable factor in Africa’s continued underdevelopment and impoverishment. The more African regimes develop partnerships with Western powers, such as the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD), the more African people are marginalized in global economic, political, and social relations. Oil and energy companies in Africa generally leave “massive unemployment, broken promises, and large empty holes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021934713489880">Klare, 2008</xref>, p. 176). In gold, platinum, and coal mining giant South Africa, the laying off of thousands of miners and the residue of toxic mining tailing in mines around the Witwatersrand in 2012, this pattern of “large empty holes” is real (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021934713489880">Biyase, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0021934713489880">South African Press Association, 2010d</xref>).</p>
<p>Africa’s 50 wars across the Sudan, Congo, Angola, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal (Casamance), Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, DRC, and Nigeria, for example, have had the effect of decimating the environment and causing the displacement of millions of people along with destroying animal and plant habitats across the continent. For instance, in 1996, 14 of 53 African countries were involved in internecine military conflicts that resulted in 8 million people becoming refugees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0021934713489880">Tandon, 1999</xref>). War is not just an antihuman activity; it contaminates the air with poisons from shells, and kills animals and other life on the Earth when strafing and bombs are used from the air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021934713489880">Rodrigo, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The European practice of hunting continues to be a formidable part of Africa’s tourist economy. Governments in Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, and South Africa are all engaged in dislocating rural communities and Indigenous peoples’ villages so that hunting reserves can be established. Poaching animals like the rare white rhino for their horns has been devastating to rhino herds in Africa. In 2010, nine White poachers, including businessmen engaged in organizing hunting expeditions, were arrested by the South African authorities for killing several white rhino for their horns, which could each fetch anywhere between US$20,000 and US$50,000. The African lion, long a symbol of the African plains, is currently under threat, with lion numbers dwindling by 30% in the past 20 years and Kenya alone losing 100 lions each year from its pride of 2,000 in the country, principally because lions are killed for medicinal value by Far East traders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0021934713489880">South African Press Association, 2010c</xref>).</p>

<title>Indigenous African Philosophical and Cultural Responses to the Ecological and Environmental Crisis in Africa</title>
<p>There are three principal responses for Africa in this regard.</p>
<p>First, Africa must be decolonized and <italic>Return to the Source</italic>, in the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021934713489880">Amilcar Cabral (1974)</xref>. For Africa to move forward politically, economically, and socially, she needs to revert to her cultural roots that reestablish her authentic identity as an independent continent grounded in her Indigenous heritage and history so that she no longer operates as a reflection of Europe and the West in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021934713489880">New African, 2009</xref>). Veteran American Indian Movement leader, Russell Means, noted that the singular most important accomplishment for him was <italic>knowing who he really is</italic> prior to his passing to the spirit world in 2012; Africans need to take heed of such wisdom from one who led a relentless resistance movement for the decolonization of Indigenous people in Turtle Island (North America) for over five decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021934713489880">Know the Truth TV, 2011</xref>). Africa needs a cultural decolonization revolution that forces her to begin the tumultuous process of dismantling all colonially determined boundaries and neocolonial regimes and reintegrating the continent into a Pan-African whole where all peoples and nations can conjointly engage with the international world on the basis of mutual respect for cultural sovereignty, economic justice, and participatory democracy. The shameful military interventionist and colonialist role that the United States and European imperialist powers like France and Britain continue to play in marginalized and impoverished countries like Mali, Niger, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, and Djibouti, under the pretext of combating “terrorism,” serves as a stark reminder that Western imperialist forces still see Africa as a haven for extraction of vital energy resources like oil and uranium and view the continent essentially as their colonial territory and economic property as in yesteryear.</p>
<p>The process of cultural decolonization is the principal manner that Africa can reclaim her ancestral spiritual power and shake off the shackles of neocolonial imperialism that have beset and devastated Africa’s beautiful landscape and ecology, and caused such devastation on the continent’s natural environment. Predator corporations must be disallowed from using Africa as a landscape for mineral and oil looting, be they Shell, BP, Chevron, Texaco, ExxonMobil, Total, Elf Equitane, Anglo American, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto Zinc, AngloGold Ashanti, De Beers, Xstrata, or Arcelor Mittal, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, China National Petroleum Corporation, or any other parasitic company that has decimated the African continent for oil and gold, diamonds and platinum, zinc and cobalt, copper and cocoa, and the like. Notable radical political economist, Samir Amin, contends that Africa has had its historical and social evolution violently fractured and disrupted with the invasion by colonialism and the entrenchment of capitalism, and is consequently peripheralized. He asserts that Africa must extricate herself from the globalized capitalist system by <italic>delinking</italic> from the tentacles of corporate capital and instead establish constructive agricultural and industrial links and partnerships with progressive nations of the South. Countries like Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador are examples of this South-South collaboration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021934713489880">Amin (1990)</xref> explains,<disp-quote>
<p>The alternative option of autocentric, national and popular development is not only possible, in Africa and elsewhere, in the sense that there is no overwhelming “technical” obstacle making it impossible (the obstacle is always social), it is even objectively necessary, in the sense that a persistent rejection of this option means remaining in a trap.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021934713489880">Amin (1990)</xref> avers that agriculture must become the most important priority so that Africa is autarkic and able to feed herself, and that all industrial production must favor the development and expansion of agriculture so that Africa is no longer dependent on the West. Nonfood consumption must be satisfied by local production, and imports must be reduced to a minimum so that Africa consumes what she produces and exports surpluses to countries that engage in fair and equitable trade unlike those subscribing to the unfair practices of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The roles of peasant producers and genuine rural and urban cooperatives underlined by participatory and egalitarian democracy are key in this plan of establishing and entrenching self-sufficiency in the continent. I would supplement Amin’s advocacy of such autocentric and national development of Africa by urging decentralization of Africa’s economies so that agricultural producers are supported by way of inputs such as natural fertilizers, tools, and other machinery in small communities typical of Indigenous cultures in many parts of the continent, as opposed to concentrating resources in highly bureaucratic and centralized structures. Africa’s neocolonial governments in the main constitute the leading obstacle to such autocentric development because they cater to the needs of globalized capital as a function and priority. These movements for radical transformation must thus be rooted in rural and urban communities that persist in independent organizing and harnessing resources free of dependence on neocolonial governmental institutions and organizations. Radical trade unions representing teachers, agricultural workers, and other sectors of small-scale industry are key in effective community organization particularly given historical resistance movements in places like Guinea, Nigeria, Ghana, Zambia, and Kenya, for example.</p>
<p>The philosophical and epistemological principle undergirding this movement of expulsion of these predatory companies is that of ancient Pan-African ancestral tradition, indeed global Indigenous traditions, which declares as the Maasai and the San, the Dineh and the Nauru of Australia, the Shona and the Afar <italic>that the land cannot be owned by anyone</italic>, echoing Jones Benally, the internationally renowned Dineh traditional healer and Hoop Dancer from Northern Arizona. This is no reified or romanticized principle. The fact of the matter is that the Earth will determine where human beings are headed: Impending catastrophic crises of a geopolitical (war over energy, oil, natural gas, and water) and economic (greed for monetary and material accumulation) nature ensures that ruling regimes will be in conflict for some time. A 15- or 30-second earthquake along the San Andreas fault in California would very quickly change the dynamics of Silicon Valley and the Alameda Naval base, let alone wreak havoc on Chevron’s oil storage tanks in Richmond that have poisoned the Black community in that town for years. It could even destabilize the banking system in downtown San Francisco. The late October 2012 devastation of the northeastern part of the United States by Hurricane Sandy that resulted in the bulk of the state of New Jersey being flooded and New York City being overwhelmed by power outages, floods, and the virtual collapse of the underground rail system is yet another indicator of the power of natural forces connected to the warming of the Earth and violation of spiritual harmony by reckless capitalist industrialism and obsession with profit maximization at the cost of annihilating Earth’s creatures.</p>
<p>This valorization of the Earth is still practiced by peoples all over West Africa in particular, such as the Akan who thank the Earth goddess, <italic>Ala</italic>, by pouring libations in gratitude and honor of the Earth and describe her as the “great-breasted goddess” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021934713489880">Mbon, 1987</xref>). The Anlo view Earth, <italic>Anyigba</italic>, as the Spouse of Heaven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021934713489880">Gaba, 1987</xref>). All Indigenous cultures of Africa are spiritually grounded with the Earth being considered a living source of life and thus, sacred.</p>
<p>Mother Africa has suffered too long at the hands of duplicitous profit and war-mongering transnational oil and mineral conglomerates; it is high time for Africa to shake off the shackles that bind her and reclaim and reappropriate her Indigenous innovative technological approaches that can provide her with food and her people with three balanced meals a day, through terraced agriculture that wards off soil erosion and shares water resources for development of electricity across the continent. African fishermen and fisherwomen can expand fishing the lakes and rivers of the continent so that people can benefit as they did historically from fish protein. Just as pre-1978 China did, Africans could harness all of the junk metal and scraps being discarded so that they are recycled into bicycles and other instruments needed for agricultural production and manufacturing those goods that are vital especially for the rural impoverished on the continent and for constructing schools. This is no pipe dream; it is a vision for Africa that the poor island of Cuba fought for and institutionalizes—free education so that everyone is literate, and engineers, doctors, artists, artisans, teachers, and intellectuals are all trained to serve the nation; free health care so that everyone is entitled to a decent life, and infant mortality is widely abolished; and affordable housing for all so that nobody is homeless and landless. Cuba is ranked 51 among “high human development” countries from 189 countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0021934713489880">United Nations Development Programme [UNDP], 2009</xref>, pp. 172-173). Cuba’s life expectancy is 78.5 years just under the United States of 79 years. Its literacy rate is 100%, above the United States that has an official literacy rate of 92.1%, but in actuality is closer to 75%. Cuba is an example of a nation and people that has been able to accomplish much with little, notwithstanding social contradictions of race and culture for example, far more than South Africa, Africa’s wealthiest country, that has a Human Development Index of 129 among 189 nations, where life expectancy is 52, and where there is a 36% chance of an adult not living beyond age 40, compared with Cuba where it is 4% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0021934713489880">UNDP, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, in this revolutionary reclamation of Indigenous cultural mobilization, the power of women is axiological. Indigenous spirituality and ancestral wisdom is best reclaimed by the resilience of women’s knowledge and the distinctive manner in which women are most productive and conservative with the least resources available.</p>
<p>The rigid patriarchal structures that characterized Western Christian religious traditions were out of sync with the fundamental core of Indigenous religio-cultures on the African continent, and were transmitted through the experience of enslavement and resistance to such subjugation into the Americas and the Caribbean. From ancient Egypt, Kush, and Nubia, the central role of women as divinities with creative mother attributes like Hathor in Egypt, symbolizing the Goddess of love and healing, Neith, a creator Goddess from the Old Kingdom dynasty, and Auset (Isis) signifying leadership is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021934713489880">Dove, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021934713489880">Hart, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0021934713489880">Stone, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0021934713489880">Winston &amp; Romer, 2008</xref>). Female queens complemented male kings in the administering of ancient Egyptian, Kushite, and Nubian society. The imposition of patriarchal structures both by early West Asian Islamic cultures from the medieval period and European colonial cultures were fundamentally at odds with the gender complementary cultures of ancient African civilizations and Nnobi and Igbo cultures of West Africa for instance, sparking gender and social polarization that further weakened Indigenous African social ways with women and men living in reciprocal respect of one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021934713489880">Amadiume, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021934713489880">Oyewumi, 1997</xref>). Although not all Indigenous cultures in Africa are matrilineal or matriarchal in culture as in the cases of the Akan and the Tuareg, for example, the fact of respectfulness for women and embracement of the powerful role that women play in religious practices is found in many parts of the African continent, even where male domination may assume precedence as among Sesotho cultures in Southern Africa, for instance, and even among the Igbo during the Biafran war when women resisted domineering British colonial men and the African men who collaborated with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021934713489880">Houessou-Adin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021934713489880">Masenya, 1997</xref>). The water pot in the shrine of the Yoruba arch-deity, <italic>Obatala</italic> or <italic>Órîsà-ñla</italic>, is always kept full by women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021934713489880">Awolalu, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021934713489880">Omoyajowo, 1982</xref>). The Lozi of Zambia consecrate rituals involving beer blessed by women alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0021934713489880">Turnbull, 1976</xref>). Within Tswana culture, rainmaking is only possible if young women fill the sacred pots with water and ceremonially take them all over the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0021934713489880">Turnbull, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021934713489880">Bridgett Sackey (2006)</xref>, conducting research on women independent churches in Africa, such as the Sofo Aba Essawah of the Savior’s Church, in Sekondi, the Sofo Grace Affanyi of Grace Divine Healing Ministry, Twiekrom, “Auntie” Grace Mensah of Spiritual Revival and Healing Center in Abura Edumfa near Cape Coast, Ghana, Rev. Mary Owuxu of the Great I Am That I Am Church, and Rev. Christie Doe Tetteh of the Solid Rock Chapel International in Accra, notes that women are prominent in shaping the contours of religious and social life in Ghana, deriving from the matrilineal Akan cultures of West Africa, unlike the mission churches in Ghana that have been traditionally male dominated in terms of structures and hierarchy. The religious and political roles of priestess and queen mother are the basis for practice of the queen mother introducing the head of the community or “chief” in colonial parlance, to the ancestor stool. Sackey points that the word for such a figure is <italic>ohene</italic>, which can be both female and male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021934713489880">Sackey, 2006</xref>). The works of leading critical studies on gender in Africa by scholars like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021934713489880">Ife Amadiume (1987)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021934713489880">Oyeronke Oyewumi (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021934713489880">Ama Ata Aidoo (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0021934713489880">Niara Sudarkasa (1986)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0021934713489880">Filomena Steady (1994)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021934713489880">Clenora Hudson-Weems (1994)</xref>, Zulu Sofala (1993), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021934713489880">Brigid Sackey (2006)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021934713489880">Hoehler-Fatton (1996)</xref> provide a different perspective on gender, in which complementariness of role was foundational in many Indigenous African societies prior to the onslaught of colonialism that refused to understand and accord women equal political and leadership roles as men, and propelled the male dominance over women within the political, economic, and social arena, including within education, a legacy still entrenched within most African societies today.</p>
<p>In Zimbabwe, women are not just midwives and attendants. Medicine is practiced by 92.9% of midwives, and they are involved in nutritional counseling and administering prenatal and postnatal health care for holistic healing of communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021934713489880">Chavanduka, 1994</xref>). Shona-speaking women have always been the maintainers of <italic>dambo</italic> gardens in the drier areas of Zimbabwe and other parts of Southern Africa where crops like maize, rice, and vegetables are cultivated during the rainy season without irrigation and “signify indigenous technological innovation that saves time and energy for women since they function as an available water source even when arid climatic conditions prevail” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021934713489880">Kunnie, 2000</xref>, p. 38). In North Africa, Tuareg women are the shapers of cultures and determine the culture and scale of the household.</p>
<p>Finally, the element of Indigenous-oriented and grounded <italic>education</italic> is a life-surviving imperative. Education of African children must begin where it always started: in the family and at home. If there are community schools, Africa must strive, and we all have a role to organically play in this ongoing transgenerational effort, to forge African-centered curricula at all school and college levels. Books must be available in the major languages of the African continent such as isiZulu, seSotho, Kiswahili, Yoruba, Fulani, Hausa, Arabic, Wolof, and related languages, and be moored primordially within African continental history and germane to the sociocultural and ecological landscape of the African continent. The elders and griots all across Africa, female and male, need to be drawn into the curriculum and provided with opportunities to teach and philosophize. At the University of Kwazulu-Natal in South Africa, over 1,000 traditional healers are associated and deployed within the Nelson Mandela Medical School at that university. At the University of Limpopo, Indigenous Knowledge Systems have become core in the university curriculum, and students are able to take exams in their mother tongue, principally Tshivenda in that part of the country. Africa is the only continent in the world where foreign languages are used as the principal medium of instruction, and this colonizing history must be forcefully arrested. In the same vein, the literature, mathematics, sociological, and political science theories must begin with the African reality and then proceed to engage with cultures of the West, Asia, the Pacific, and Latin America so that the teachings of Ptahhotep, the ancient Egyptian, Nubian, and Ethiopian classics, and writers like Ama Ata Aidoo, Ayi Kwei Armah, Chinua Achebe, Bessie Head, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Mariama Ba, Florence Nwapa, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, and the like become standardized texts—in African languages at that.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Africa must arise, and like the Sleeping Giant <italic>will</italic> arise, not in the confusing and mythic linear time that Western Europe has imposed on Africa and the world, but in her own cyclical time. Africa must begin with decolonizing the minds of her children from preschool so that a stronger pro-Indigenous Pan-African-oriented seventh generation from today materializes. The legacy of ecological devastation wrought by Western capitalist industrialism in Africa must be uprooted so that she becomes independent, sustainable, just, and returns to shaping global civilizations as she did 600 years ago and before. Africans on the continent and in the Diaspora who desire the well-being and independence of Africa cannot afford to succumb and be seduced by the meretricious and illusory trappings of Western capitalism and consumerism that continue to subjugate, peripheralize, and intensify the impoverishment of and compound the obscene disparities between rich and poor on the continent in line with global capitalism. The working class women, men, youth, and children of the continent specifically must remain steadfast in their trust in and loyalty to the ancestors of Africa who never surrendered their cultural and social independence, but resisted with their lives. Africans cannot afford to entrust their lives and future in a Western-derived predatory and vampirish hegemonic materialistic, economic, and cultural system that persists in maintaining an unwinnable rat race for the maximum accumulation of wealth, while incessantly destroying the Mother Earth and her creatures in the land, air, and water. Posterity will remember the current generations of resistance that made it possible for the great-great-great-grandchildren of this generation to live spiritually strong and with fruitful purpose in harmony with the Earth, unlike the myopic and greedy beneficiaries of the present dysfunctional global economic order who are destined for annihilation given their pathological ongoing war against Mother Earth.</p>
