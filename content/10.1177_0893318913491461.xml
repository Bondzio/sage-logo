<abstract>
<p>Organizational values demand that working mothers separate the maternal from the professional. Due to the nature of maternity leave in the United States, however, working mothers who are breastfeeding have little choice but to bring motherhood into the workplace. In investigating the ways women navigate this situation, we found that to maintain their reputations as good workers participants practiced <italic>bounded motherhood</italic> at work, constraining breastfeeding practices to preserve norms of professionalism. However, participants sometimes practiced <italic>unbounded motherhood</italic> wherein their inter/actions disrupted organizational orders by merging motherhood and work in material ways. This embodiment of a <italic>good working mother</italic> identity expands the repertoire or action for working mothers and contributes to a re-meaning of the relationship between work and motherhood. This study demonstrates one means for making breastfeeding while working more feasible as well as to how workers’ bodies can be sites of resistance and reinforcement of gendered symbolic orders in organizations.</p>

<body>
<p>Built upon masculine norms and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318913491461">Acker, 1990</xref>) and around men’s bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0893318913491461">Trethewey, 1999</xref>), the world of work has historically been separated from the domestic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0893318913491461">Martin, 1990</xref>). However, this separation is becoming increasingly tenuous; women make up nearly half of the workforce in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0893318913491461">U.S. Department of Labor, 2009</xref>) yet remain children’s primary caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0893318913491461">Williams, 2001</xref>). As what it takes to fulfill each role becomes progressively more demanding researchers are turning their attention to how working mothers discursively manage the tension between the identities of <italic>good mother</italic> and <italic>good worker</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318913491461">Buzzanell &amp; Liu, 2005</xref>). Women engage in various forms of meaning-making in light of this opposition, such as forsaking one identity for the other, cycling between the two, or altering meanings of good mothering in ways that neutralize or reframe the tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318913491461">Buzzanell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0893318913491461">Johnston &amp; Swanson, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0893318913491461">2007</xref>). Mostly absent from this research is how women negotiate the traditionally separate domains of work and motherhood via their bodies. Although organizational communication scholars have established the importance of discourse in understanding workers’ identities, often the body at work is abstracted or neglected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318913491461">Cheney &amp; Ashcraft, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The embodied experience of navigating working and mothering is particularly salient for working women who breastfeed because their maternal, lactating bodies must be managed within professional space and time. In this case, the separation of work and motherhood is potentially more problematic than in other cases where maternal and professional embodiment can be more readily compartmentalized. In the past, mothers who did not wish to breastfeed would bind their breasts to stop the production of milk. This can be seen as an apt metaphor for many women today who combine breastfeeding and paid labor. Breastfeeding workers describe suppressing breastfeeding practices at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0893318913491461">Payne &amp; Nicholls, 2010</xref>) to limit disruptions and maintain credibility as good workers. The binding of motherhood at work creates difficulties that may contribute to early cessation of breastfeeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0893318913491461">Kimbro, 2006</xref>). In effect, women’s bodies, in addition to their identities, are bound by the material and discursive separation of and tension between motherhood and work. However, women may be finding ways to materially negotiate this tension, just as they find ways to discursively manage it.</p>
<p>In this article, we begin by outlining the obstacles women face in combining breastfeeding with paid labor in the United States. Next, we demonstrate the need for focusing on bodies as sites for organizational resistance and control. Finally, we illustrate how breastfeeding, working mothers’ embodiment both reinforces and resists the binds of work-motherhood. At times, participants performed <italic>bounded motherhood</italic>, maintaining organizational orders by suppressing maternal practices. Other times, however, they performed <italic>unbounded motherhood</italic>, challenging organizational orders and the separation of work and motherhood. By integrating these realms in material ways, they embodied a <italic>good working mother</italic> identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318913491461">Buzzanell et al., 2005</xref>). The performance of unbounded motherhood may help to diminish obstacles women face in combining work and breastfeeding and incite organizational change in the process. In explicating these findings, we demonstrate the relationships between the body and discourse and resistance and control to highlight the materiality of communication.</p>

<title>Combining Breastfeeding and Work in the United States</title>
<p>In the past decade, more mothers with children under the age of 18 joined the U.S. workforce than ever before. Between 2004 and 2008 the rates of working mothers with young children in the United States hovered around 71%, a significant increase from 47% in 1975 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0893318913491461">U.S. Department of Labor, 2009</xref>). As mothers are still often the primary caregivers for children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0893318913491461">Williams, 2001</xref>), their increased participation in paid labor requires that work-family issues be addressed both personally and organizationally. Women and organizations must contend with questions and concerns about breastfeeding, which has been pushed to the forefront of mothering discourse in U.S. culture via recommendations from national health organizations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318913491461">American Academy of Pediatrics, 2012</xref>), and public health campaigns (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318913491461">American Public Health Association, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The United States is one of the few industrialized nations that does not offer standardized paid leave for new mothers (or fathers) and lags behind most in leave time, regardless of pay. For example, Sweden offers nearly a year and a half of 80% paid leave for mothers and fathers while breastfeeding rates there far exceed those in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0893318913491461">Galtry, 1998</xref>). In the United Kingdom, many women are eligible for up to 52 weeks leave at 90% pay. In Norway, 9 weeks paid leave is mandatory for women, and 44 additional paid plus 52 unpaid weeks are optional. Finally, in addition to 14 weeks leave at 80% pay, Switzerland’s policy mandates that working mothers be provided with a nursing room and one hour of nursing break time per shift/day for 1 year after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318913491461">Catalyst, 2013</xref>). Therefore, many issues surrounding the combination of breastfeeding and paid labor may be nonexistent or partially mitigated by leave policies in places other than the United States.</p>
<sec id="section2-0893318913491461">
<title>Material Obstacles</title>
<p>Given that the U.S. Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 allows for only 12 weeks of unpaid leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0893318913491461">Wilcox &amp; McGarth, 2000</xref>), yet the American Academy of Pediatrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318913491461">AAP, 2012</xref>) recommends infants be breastfed for at least 6 months and preferably 1 year, women who work and breastfeed are likely to be doing both at the same time. Breastfeeding/working women can express and bottle breast milk or nurse infants by traveling to them or having them brought to the workplace. In any case, mothers producing milk need to empty their breasts up to 3 to 4 times a day to maintain supply and prevent complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0893318913491461">Faught, 1994</xref>). Organizations are beginning to feel legislative pressure to provide support to employees in the form of designated break time and space for lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0893318913491461">U.S. Department of Labor, n.d</xref>.). However, only 25% of U.S. employers reported providing an on-site lactation room in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318913491461">Center for Disease Control, 2009</xref>). Thus, women may face obstacles in carrying out breastfeeding practices while at work.</p>
<p>Statistics generated in the United States suggest that combining breastfeeding and paid labor impede success for mothers who initially choose to breastfeed. Women who work full time while pregnant typically cease breastfeeding before returning to work, often at either the 6-week or 3-month mark, while those who work part-time or do not work for pay breastfeed longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0893318913491461">Ross Products Division of Abbott Laboratories, 2003</xref>). Although there is no relationship between returning to work and initiation of breastfeeding, there is a strong negative relationship between returning to work and cessation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0893318913491461">Kimbro, 2006</xref>). Often, work seems to take priority, at least in practice, since the duration of breastfeeding is dependent on the duration of work leave and the intensity of work upon return (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0893318913491461">Roe, Whittington, Fein, &amp; Teisl, 1999</xref>). The relationship between breastfeeding and work is moderated by demographic characteristics. Those who are able to breastfeed while working for significant lengths of time tend to be educated, White, middle to upper class women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318913491461">Arlotti, Cottrell, Lee, &amp; Curtin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0893318913491461">Li, Darling, Maurice, Barker, &amp; Grummer-Strawn, 2005</xref>). In fact, women who occupy nonprofessional positions with hourly wages, more rigid work schedules., and where lactation space rarely exists are more constrained in their breastfeeding choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0893318913491461">Galtry, 1997a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0893318913491461">1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0893318913491461">Guendelman et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Discursive Obstacles</title>
<p>As if the competing physical demands of work and breastfeeding are not enough to make their combination difficult, working mothers also contend with ideological dilemmas. A substantial body of research has documented the discursive struggles working mothers experience in light of the opposing discourses of <italic>good worker</italic> and <italic>good mother</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318913491461">Buzzanell &amp; Liu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0893318913491461">Johnston &amp; Swanson, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0893318913491461">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0893318913491461">Payne &amp; Nicholls, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0893318913491461">Ridgeway &amp; Correll, 2004</xref>). This research has included mostly women who are privileged in terms of education, occupational status, and/or income.</p>
<p>The <italic>good worker</italic> discourse holds that an ideal worker is not only dedicated to the job, but goes above and beyond expectations for the average employee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318913491461">Acker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318913491461">Deetz, 1992</xref>). A good worker puts in extra hours, is always on call, and sacrifices personal life for the good of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0893318913491461">Ridgeway &amp; Correll, 2004</xref>). Further, good workers discipline their bodies to be fit, young, and professional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0893318913491461">Nadesan &amp; Trethewey, 2000</xref>). These metrics are based on the lives and bodies of men and on (White, upper-middle class, U.S.) norms of masculinity; therefore women face difficulty existing in the space of <italic>good worker</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318913491461">Acker, 1990</xref>). A woman who is a mother exists even further outside of this identity, because the good worker is “not someone who chooses pregnancy, who exhibits feminine and sexual qualities, who prioritizes personal needs such as childbearing over corporate needs, and who cannot be in the office 24/7/365 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318913491461">Deetz, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0893318913491461">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0893318913491461">Perlow, 1998</xref>)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318913491461">Buzzanell &amp; Liu, 2005</xref>, p. 11). Furthermore, a woman who breastfeeds brings into the workplace a leaking, undisciplined body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0893318913491461">Trethewey, 1999</xref>). The breastfeeding, working mother has three strikes against her as a woman, mother, and nursing mother because all breach professional expectations regarding the body at work.</p>
<p>Women may also be implicated by the discourse of <italic>good mother</italic>. The dominant voice on motherhood in U.S. culture says that mothers should be the primary caregivers of children and should engage in <italic>intensive</italic> mothering, which requires almost full-time physical presence, self-sacrifice, monetary investments, and attention to expert advice on parenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0893318913491461">Hays, 1996</xref>). Breastfeeding has become a key exercise in intensive mothering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0893318913491461">Marshall, Godfrey, &amp; Renfrew, 2007</xref>), deemed optimal by medical and public health associations (AAP, APHA), encouraged by organizations like La Leche League, supported by alternative medicine professionals, and pushed by U.S. government initiatives (e.g., “Healthy People 2020”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318913491461">CDC, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Granted, mothering happens within specific cultural contexts; not all women in the United States may feel pressured by intensive mothering or pro-breastfeeding discourse, nor the competition between these and the <italic>good worker</italic> discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318913491461">Arendall, 2000</xref>). However, because the <italic>good worker</italic> and <italic>good mother</italic> discourses serve as the culturally dominant standards in larger U.S. culture, women who do not meet these expectations are often implicated by others as deviant. Hence, as working mothers are accountable to both discourses, they may struggle to construct coherent identities in the face of competing messages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0893318913491461">
<title>Navigating Tension, Constructing Identities</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0893318913491461">Johnston and Swanson (2007)</xref> found that full-time working mothers in the United States had difficulty meeting the demands of mothering and work; “Their most common response was neutralization—a state of perpetual disequilibrium in which they are ricocheted back and forth between dialectic poles” (p. 456). However, a few participants kept these roles separate in space and time, and by refusing to buy into the ideology of intensive mothering they maintained a strong worker identity without experiencing a great deal of tension. Another few reframed intensive mothering to intensive <italic>nurturing</italic>, constructing child-care as a shared responsibility. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318913491461">Buzzanell et al. (2005)</xref> found that women in managerial roles reframed the <italic>good mother</italic> construction to a <italic>good working mother</italic> construction, described as one who “makes quality child care arrangements by herself; who takes on the job of allocating tasks . . . and who feels pleasure in both working and mothering—the best of both worlds—despite initial ambivalence and feelings of separation from infants upon returns to paid work” (p. 276).</p>
<p>These studies provide a framework for understanding the ways working mothers discursively construct identities in the face of divergent discourses. However, they do not provide a sense of how the competing worlds of work and motherhood are materially negotiated. Combining breastfeeding and work presents a situation in which the separation or integration of motherhood and work is more materially problematic. For full-time working mothers, breastfeeding practices cannot feasibly be relegated to nonwork time and space, and yet are “not amenable to assimilation to a male norm of embodiment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0893318913491461">Hausman, 2004</xref>, p. 276). Therefore, breastfeeding workers must find ways to discursively <italic>and</italic> materially manage two opposing spheres at once.</p>
<p>Payne and Nicholls attended to both discourse and embodiment in examining how, through bodily practices, women worked to negotiate discourses of motherhood and work. Their participants constructed their choice to breastfeed despite being physically separated from their babies as fulfillment of the good mother identity and constructed their efforts to minimize breastfeeding practices at work as maintaining the good worker identity. In effect, they “negotiated the tensions created by the subjectivities of good worker and good mother, through disciplining of self . . . ” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0893318913491461">Payne &amp; Nicholls, 2010</xref>, p. 1814). The authors concluded that this self-disciplining of the maternal body keeps breastfeeding marginalized in organizations.</p>
<p>This study does well to join materiality and discourse and to illustrate how organizational norms and values exact control over women’s bodies and identities. However, research that focuses exclusively on control instead of simultaneously exploring resistance “fails to adequately theorize the possibilities for human agency at the level of everyday organizing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0893318913491461">Mumby, 2005</xref>, p. 27). Therefore, it is important to investigate how breastfeeding workers’ bodies both uphold and challenge the systems of power that undergird organizations. Work that attends to both discourse and embodiment as well as both control and resistance may produce a clearer picture of the complexities of organizational life and communicative practice.</p>

<title>Connecting Embodiment and Discourse, Resistance and Control</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318913491461">Cheney and Ashcraft (2007)</xref> argue “through an overemphasis on the symbolic . . . organizational communication scholars tend to inadvertently downplay the significance of material considerations, including the body at work” (p. 154). They recommend a focus on the performance of professionalism in mundane actions as well as on how codes of professionalism are political in that they “can simultaneously coordinate and deny divisions and hierarchies of labor” (p. 163) based on gender and other mechanisms of difference. We respond to this call by connecting everyday performances to larger cultural discourses and organizational change. This work, as does other (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318913491461">Allen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318913491461">Ashcraft, 2011</xref>), calls researchers to examine embodiment at the intersection of gender, class, and race. Given the nature of breastfeeding, we focus on gender while giving space for other elements of difference to emerge. In addition, our study is responsive to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0893318913491461">Mumby’s (2005)</xref> call to hold control and resistance in tension. He argues that critical organizational studies that focus solely on control tend to characterize workers’ resistance to power as ineffectual, while those that focus solely on resistance idealize the impact of workers’ oppositions.</p>
<p>An exploration of the ways breastfeeding workers navigate material and discursive constraints in ways that both conform to and challenge expectations of professionalism can contribute to our understandings of gender in organizations, communication as an embodied practice, and how the body matters in organizations. In this study, we examine breastfeeding, working women’s accounts of their embodiment at work and how they construct meaning for their embodied inter/actions in light of the discourses of <italic>good worker</italic> and <italic>good mother</italic>. A focus on embodiment lends itself to a socio-semiotic approach, as this perspective assumes that bodies can engage in both signifying and agentic communication. Embodiment can represent “traces of culture and power” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0893318913491461">Waskul &amp; Vannini, 2006</xref>, p. 11) when we manage physicality in ways that conform to dominant discourses. However, we also can “ . . . give out negotiated knowledge” by transgressing norms of embodiment (p. 12).</p>
<p>We use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0893318913491461">Strauss’s (1993)</xref> socio-semiotic framework as a heuristic device to analyze how breastfeeding, working women’s embodiment is constrained by and also influences organizational standards and sensibilities. Strauss argues that there are various types of <italic>symbolic orders</italic> or implicit and explicit rules that guide inter/actions but also are created, sustained, and challenged by these inter/actions. Among the symbolic orders Strauss identifies are the <italic>spatial order</italic>, which refers to the ways objects are arranged or inter/actions are prescribed in a given space, the <italic>temporal order</italic>, which refers to the ways inter/actions are normally timed and scheduled, the <italic>work order</italic>, which refers to the ways work itself is construed (i.e., what does and does not count as work), the <italic>sentimental order</italic>, which refers to expectations for attitudes or relationships (i.e., organizational climate), the <italic>moral order</italic>, which refers to values and ethics, and the <italic>aesthetic order</italic>, which refers to propriety of style, grooming, and bodily comportment.</p>
<p>Strauss also provides concepts for better understanding the reciprocal impact of symbolic orders and everyday inter/actions. Most actions are <italic>routine actions</italic>, normative and repeated because they uphold established orders of, for example, professionalism. However, certain actions challenge the organizational status quo. <italic>Problematic actions</italic> disrupt the existing state of affairs and expand the available repertoire for ways of being and knowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0893318913491461">Strauss, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Employing Strauss’s framework allows us to analyze how women carry out breastfeeding at work in ways that position them as good mothers, good workers, both or neither in relation to specific rules and sentiments. Further, we can identify how their inter/actions are restricted by and challenge the constraints set out by symbolic orders that define motherhood and work as separate, competing spheres. Toward these ends, we asked the following questions:</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Eligible participants were women over the age of 18 who had returned to full-time work within 3 months of giving birth and while still breastfeeding. Participants were recruited using informational flyers posted at relevant locations such as breastfeeding support venues, retail and resale stores catering to new mothers, and birthing classes. Snowball sampling was also used. Recruitment resulted in a sample of 15 women from across the United States who occupied various employment statuses including semiprofessional and professional as well as hourly and salaried. Their occupational categories included healthcare provider, academic, consultant, corporate trainer, corporate manager, nonprofit manager, and administrative support staff. Although the diversity of employment was good for a small sample, most participants were educated, all were Caucasian, and all had at least some flexibility and/or autonomy in their jobs that led them to see combining breastfeeding and work as a feasible option, at least at first.</p>
<p>The first author drew upon her experience of having breastfed and worked in order to design and conduct semistructured interviews with participants. This insider identity allowed her to attend to specific embodied elements of this experience. Interviews were designed to capture specific instances where participants felt they experienced a significant interaction or moment of decision around breastfeeding that defined them as mothers/employees. The interviews were first guided by general questions such as, “How did you manage breastfeeding and working simultaneously? What situations did you feel positive and not so positive about while breastfeeding and working? Did you tell others you were going to breastfeed and work? If so, what were their reactions?” then quickly became unique conversations. In fact, during one interview that took place at a conference, another woman who was nearby asked if she could join and share her experiences. Throughout discussions, experiences that had emerged in previous interviews were inserted, when appropriate, to see if they rang true to others. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed for analysis.</p>

<sec id="section8-0893318913491461">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>After several readings and individual open coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0893318913491461">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>) of the interview transcripts, we met to discuss possible themes. We had both noted material ways participants negotiated breastfeeding at work that reinforced, resisted, and also blended the good worker and good mother discourses. We discussed our notes and agreed upon initial thematic categories. Next, the second author engaged in focused coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318913491461">Charmaz, 2000</xref>) using these initial themes (e.g., <italic>taking as little time as possible, combining work and pumping</italic>) as a guide. She coded discussions of embodied inter/actions in which participants managed the combination of breastfeeding and work and referenced identity issues in the process. For example, two participants said they used a manual rather than an electric breast pump at work because the noise made by the electric one embarrassed them. This was coded as an act of concealment that constructs breastfeeding practices as inappropriate in the workplace. The second author conducted this individual coding process as an “outsider”—a woman who has never breastfed or done so while working. We believed this perspective would be beneficial to the first phases of analysis because the first author might take for granted some of the inter/actions participants discussed (e.g., eating while pumping), seeing them as consistent with her experiences and therefore not necessarily significant.</p>
<p>In the next phase, the second author engaged in axial coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0893318913491461">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>) where data are reassembled to produce
<disp-quote>
<p>an understanding of the central phenomenon in the data in terms of the conditions which give rise to it, the context in which it is embedded, the action/interaction strategies by which it is handled . . . and the consequences of those strategies. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0893318913491461">Punch, 2005</xref>, p. 210)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She analyzed each significant datum against Strauss’s concepts of routine versus problematic action and organizational orders. Specifically, an inter/action was interpreted as upholding the <italic>good mother</italic> discourse when the participant described enduring hardship in order to breastfeed for the sake of her baby. Second, a datum was regarded as routine or a reinforcement of the <italic>good worker</italic> discourse when the participant conducted breastfeeding in a way that upheld an organizational order. For example, participants pumped while eating lunch to preserve work time. This was coded as maintenance of the <italic>time order</italic>. Third, participants’ practices were interpreted as resistant when they defied organizational orders and were constructed as acceptable. For instance, the act of breastfeeding during a meeting was coded as a problematic action that challenged the separation of work and motherhood.</p>
<p>In the final phase, the first author used her “insider” perspective to confirm/question the second author’s analysis and to provide additional insights based on her embodied familiarity with participants’ experiences (e.g., that having to pour out breast milk is a significant sacrifice). For more information about this insider/outsider approach see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0893318913491461">Turner and Norwood (forthcoming)</xref>. Finally, we reconvened and reconciled through discussion the few divergences in our interpretations. Together, we generated the concepts of bounded and unbounded motherhood to capture the most significant contributions of our analysis.</p>

<title>The Un/Binding of Motherhood in the Workplace</title>
<p>Participants recounted experiences that substantiated the burden of negotiating opposing spheres of meaning. Their stories partially echoed the findings of previous research, depicting participants as good mothers because they breastfed and as good workers because in doing so they did not impinge on the organization. Interestingly, though, participants sometimes described performing motherhood at work in ways that violated the bounds of professionalism, and yet did not construct themselves as inferior employees for doing so. Below, we present our analysis of these emergent themes with an eye toward how routine and problematic action upheld and/or disrupted organizational orders. We demonstrate how their actions reinforced the struggle between the embodied identities of <italic>good worker</italic> and <italic>good mother</italic> and/or worked to create space for the embodiment of a new identity—<italic>good working mother</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section10-0893318913491461">
<title>Breastfeeding, Good Mothers</title>
<p>Overwhelmingly, participants constructed breastfeeding as a practice that allows them to be good mothers despite their absence from infants while working outside the home. They cited breastfeeding as “what’s best” or “right” for babies and mothers. When asked why she chose to breastfeed, Nina, an administrative project manager at a university, said:
<disp-quote>
<p>Gosh! All the information that’s out there about how healthy it is and . . . it makes your kid smarter. You know, you want your kids to be smarter. The immunity that, you know, it gives them, the defense. And just that bonding that it allows you.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And when asked what advice she would give to other women who choose to combine breastfeeding and work, Nina offered:
<disp-quote>
<p>I would just say to be prepared for the work . . . the dedication . . . you have to understand that it’s going to be a lot of lugging . . . this extra bag back and forth . . . so I think you have to be able to just stay strong mentally and stay confident in your ability to breastfeed. You just have to stay confident because if you lose confidence, you just won’t do it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants engaged in significant mental, physical, and emotional effort to maintain an adequate supply of milk. This “labor of love,” as one woman called it, fits with the discourse of good mothering in terms of selflessness, intensive care, and compliance with expert advice, allowing participants to embody at least part of the good mother identity. Participants also discussed breastfeeding as an extension of their bodies, or a way that they could be materially connected to their babies when physically absent. Kathy, a single mother and business service support specialist at an insurance company discussed the difficulties she faced:
<disp-quote>
<p>And there would be times I would be at work and just . . . I just miss him . . . I think the nursing helped me through that because I felt like I kind of was substituting, like maybe because I’m working and I can’t be there all the time, but I’m giving you this. And maybe that’s why I was toting around milk in airports and pumping out of town or whatever it may be . . . to always feel that connection . . . because it does get hard when you return back [to work].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Unfortunately, bringing the breastfeeding body into the workplace is an infringement on the symbolic orders therein. In response to this, participants reported separating mothering and work practices and hiding breastfeeding activities in order to limit the maternal body’s intrusion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0893318913491461">
<title>Bounded Motherhood, Good Workers</title>
<p>Consistent with previous research, participants described tucking breastfeeding practices into slivers of time and space to minimize the impact of motherhood, thereby maintaining work, spatial, aesthetic, and temporal norms. They shared these stories as if offering secrets or best practices. Participants rarely attributed their suppression of breastfeeding to a lack of support from coworkers or supervisors, but rather to their desire to maintain a <italic>good worker</italic> identity. This presence and practice of maternity that is restricted to fit professional norms and values constitutes the performance of <italic>bounded motherhood</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0893318913491461">1</xref></sup>. In performing bounded motherhood, women emulate the bodies of those who have power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0893318913491461">Strauss, 1993</xref>)—namely, men.</p>
<p>While bounded motherhood stretches the limits of what it means to be a good worker in the strictest sense, it allows women to maintain a foothold in this sphere because maternity is done in ways that maintain the organizational orders. Specifically, the work order is maintained by keeping breastfeeding practices physically separated from work activities and by conceptualizing them as a personal responsibility that should not interfere with professional responsibilities. Spatial order is maintained through the ways women use and do not use space. Often, participants reported making do with inadequate spaces for pumping, like storage closets, bathrooms, or even phone booths and were reluctant to ask for appropriate spaces. These stories were often shared with a sense of pride regarding having successfully breastfed despite significant sacrifice. Further, participants concealed breast milk or pumping equipment. Asked if they stored breast milk in shared refrigerators, Mallory, who worked in an administrative support role in a university, and Faye, an organizational consultant, commiserated over embarrassment:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Mallory:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, I did . . . with my pump came a little traveling bag that was just plain black. It looked like a lunch pail . . . Where I would get in trouble is if I would go home at lunch . . . for some reason forget to bring that back, that’s when I would be using plastic bags and trying to stash it. I didn’t want anyone to see it . . . I had an electric [pump] and a manual and I only used the manual one at work.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Faye:</speaker>
<p>I was self-conscious about that, too, because . . . the bathroom that I was in is in a hall . . . and people would walk by and I know they could hear this whir, whir, whir.</p>
</speech>
<p>Even the sounds associated with pumping were perceived by some participants to be a violation of the sentimental order, as these noises were thought to broadcast the performance of maternal activities and therefore to disrupt the professional feel of their organizations.</p>
<p>Although some participants who had private offices were able to use them for pumping, others had to make do with lesser venues. However, even if a woman had a private office where she could pump the fact that this was a work space sometimes brought about a sense of discomfort. Eleanor, a recruiter at a university, said:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s a little bit—it’s probably a little bit uncomfortable, you know, to be doing that in your workplace . . . in your office where you meet other people and just talk about work.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And, even if there was a designated lactation space, it was not always adequate. Donna, manager of a training development team at a corporate firm, described such a space:
<disp-quote>
<p>Once we didn’t have light in there . . . the lights didn’t work.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<speech>
<speaker>Paaige:</speaker>
<p>So, did you pump in the dark?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Donna:</speaker>
<p>I tried, but I just could not . . . fortunately, our keys worked for the First Aid room next door, which had a window . . . It probably let all the “peeping Toms” look in, too, but at least we could see . . . I had a maintenance guy walk in on me once. Fortunately . . . I was just packing up . . . there was a sign on the door that said “In use.” . . . but he just ignored it and walked right in.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Paaige:</speaker>
<p>Does it say “Lactation Room” or anything on the door?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Donna:</speaker>
<p>“Mothers’ Room.”</p>
</speech>
<p>This exemplar illustrates the obstacles women work around and the privacy risks they bear simply to keep their breastfeeding practices from disturbing organizational orders. The label on the door Donna describes is a testament to her experience as a breastfeeding mother in the workplace—the choice to label the space “Mothers’ Room” sidesteps a reference to a leaking body and at the same time emphasizes the separation of maternal practices from work practices.</p>
<p>In addition to the spatial order, participants’ accounts suggested that they worked hard to maintain the aesthetic order of the workplace by containing their bodies. They experienced embarrassment when their bodies violated the boundaries of professionalism. When asked if there was a time when breastfeeding made her uncomfortable at work, Patty, a manager at a software company, recounted a story about leaking breasts:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, yeah. When I would let down in the middle of a meeting . . . I was wearing something that I didn’t feel comfortable in, anyway . . . I’m very conscious of the size of my breasts since I’ve been breastfeeding because they’re bigger than they ever were . . . So I’m talking, and I look down and I don’t even know what happened . . . It was shortly after that that I got these . . . little silicon thin strips . . . they make enough suction that you don’t leak . . . . I don’t know if anybody noticed . . . I sat there like this (indicating arms folded across chest) for the rest of the meeting, and I was just mortified . . . as soon as I got back to my office, I put my jacket on . . . There’s always a second layer . . . not just for leaks, actually, just because I—I’m self-conscious about my body . . . And I feel like . . . everybody can tell that I’m breastfeeding . . . And so at work I don’t want to be overt about that. I don’t know why, but it’s like I don’t want to bring attention to that fact more than I have to because I’m already sitting in the conference room twice a day [pumping] . . . since I cart my pump in and out of the office, I feel like I’m trying not to do it overtly, which is actually an interesting comment on the maleness of my office because it was a very male office . . . I don’t want to show any sign of weakness, you know . . . and because I’m nursing, that introduces an element of something that would be considered weakness.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Patty recognizes that organizational orders are founded on masculine norms, values, and bodies and that this entails a devaluing of femininity. She acknowledges that when she does not uphold masculine norms she risks negative professional consequences.</p>
<p>In addition to work, spatial, and aesthetic orders, temporal orders were important for participants to maintain in performing bounded motherhood. Participants put work responsibilities first and kept breastfeeding activities efficient to ensure work productivity. They often delayed pumping to the point of near-leaking so as not to interrupt or reschedule meetings or other work events. Participants described pumping while eating lunch or when work was slow enough to warrant a quick “break” and stayed late to make up for time spent pumping. Jan, a hospital clerk aide, painted a hectic scene of finding time to pump at work:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s kind of stressful at work cause . . . you get slammed and I like to try to pump every three to four hours . . . where I can build up my milk supply, but at work sometimes you just can’t do it . . . One time I couldn’t pump for five hours . . . being the secretary, I got to run around and get all the paperwork ready, take all the paperwork from the lab, order all the labs for the patients, and then I have to clean the rooms after they deliver or after they have a C-Section, and just kind of help with everything . . . And a lot of times you don’t take a meal break . . . if I eat, it either has to be when I’m pumping or I’m at the desk taking phone calls and doing other stuff and just kind of biting as I go.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Maintenance of the temporal order is important to Jan. Pumping and even eating is often delayed or forsaken in order to complete work tasks. Similarly, Esther, a technician at a university research laboratory, talked about how she compartmentalizes her mother and worker identities and keeps pumping to a minimum, maintaining the work as well as the temporal order:
<disp-quote>
<p>I almost never pumped twice a day, even though in theory if I was nursing her four times a day when I was home, I should have been pumping more often, but—</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<speech>
<speaker>Paaige:</speaker>
<p>Why didn’t you?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Esther:</speaker>
<p>Cause once I’m at work, I focus at work. I mean, I—I focus at what I’m doing and if it didn’t feel like I had to pump, I didn’t pump ‘cause I was working.</p>
</speech>
<p>Likewise, Liz, a research project manager at a university, shifted pumping around work responsibilities to maintain the temporal order and avoid the perception that being a mother made her a lesser employee. Liz said she felt bad skipping a pumping to attend meetings, as if she were somehow failing to care for her child. When asked why she chose to be on time to meetings rather than to pump and be late, she responded:
<disp-quote>
<p>Just because of what other people would say. You know, if I were meeting with my staff, the people under me—no question, I would always say, “Give me ten minutes . . . But if I were meeting with . . . the director of the department . . . I would absolutely make sure not to be, not to cause a wave, you know, to be my same old self.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Liz perceived breastfeeding to be something that would “cause a wave” at work and motherhood as threatening to her “old self,” her professional identity.</p>
<p>In the same way that women may employ their bodies to breastfeed as a way to be good mothers, they may employ their bodies to perform bounded motherhood at work as a way to be good workers. We argue that both of these performances of motherhood constitute what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0893318913491461">Strauss (1993)</xref> calls <italic>routine actions</italic>. That is not to say that these actions are in any way easy or even common. They are routine in that by performing them, women’s bodies conform as well as they can to established orders and, therefore, uphold both <italic>good mother</italic> and <italic>good worker</italic> discourses.</p>
<p>Most participants characterized bounded motherhood as a balance; they made do with what space they could find between competing and seemingly closed realms. They detailed the difficulties, labors, leakages (literal and metaphorical), and stresses they endured in combining breastfeeding and working this way, but often characterized it as “worth it.” In trying to fulfill some requirements of <italic>good mother</italic> and some of <italic>good worker</italic> participants were silently burdened by the stress of keeping them separate, of squeezing each in around the other, of stretching their bodies across two domains without sitting comfortably in either. Donna captures the difficulty of meeting the demands of medical experts and the demands of her organization:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve said it over and over, after I returned to work, I’m like, “You know, anybody, any of those people on the American Academy of Pediatrics who set that twelve-month timeframe probably didn’t return to work and try to do this because it’s really hard.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Donna implicates the top-down influence of macro-level discourse when she refers to the burden of the AAP’s recommendations for optimal breastfeeding. While performances of bounded motherhood minimize the impact of motherhood on work, participants also described ways their everyday actions could minimize the impact of work on motherhood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0893318913491461">
<title>Unbounded Motherhood, Good Working Mothers</title>
<p>Amidst the accounts of bounded motherhood, there were descriptions of a different way of negotiating breastfeeding and working. At times, participants were unwilling to hide breastfeeding practices, did not hesitate to ask for accommodations, and did not report feeling embarrassment or guilt. By not keeping their practices as workers and mothers separated, they refused to comply with the notion that these domains are exclusive. This mode of combining breastfeeding and work constitutes a performance of <italic>unbounded motherhood</italic>. The practice of unbounded motherhood disturbs the orders that bounded motherhood upholds.</p>
<p>The following exemplars show how some participants inserted motherhood into the workplace in ways that problematized spatial and temporal orders. While some performed unbounded motherhood by refusing to fit pumping into space and time that would not interfere with work, others comfortably combined pumping or breastfeeding with work. Participants described pumping while answering phone calls, returning emails, reading documents, or even engaging in small meetings. Kellie, who worked as a pharmacy technician and a server in a restaurant, even performed her duties at the pharmacy while nursing:
<disp-quote>
<p> . . . the director of the facility called me at home . . . and said, “Is there any way—I know you’re not supposed to come back for like seven more weeks. We are in the biggest jam . . . And I was like, “Well, I got my son and I’m nursing.” . . . And he’s like, “Whatever he needs is fine. Just bring him with you. You can keep him in there. I’ve talked to the girl in Medical Records. They can watch him in between. If you’re not comfortable with that, just leave him next to you. We don’t care.” And so I literally remember at one point, not an exaggeration, our pharmacy had like a cut-out window, you know, so like you sat at a desk and people walked up to you . . . and I remember at one point I was just nursing my son. I had a blanket over my shoulder and I was standing there talking with a doctor, taking an order for a chemotherapy treatment and nobody bats an eyelash.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Victoria, a development director for a religious organization, offered another particularly striking example of combining breastfeeding and work. She once nursed her son during a board meeting at the suggestion of her supervisor.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p> . . . I actually believe it was probably all men that day . . . And it was on my maternity leave, but my boss wanted me to come in. And I was like, “I’ll come in, but I have to bring my son.” . . . He’s like, “No problem.” And so this meeting’s long. In the middle I have to leave. So I go in the other room and bring Alex . . . I’m breastfeeding him and my boss is like, “Victoria, just come on in here. It’s no problem.” And, you know, it’s all guys, and I have—I don’t have much modesty . . . It doesn’t bother me because I think it’s just a real natural thing that we should be allowed to do in most places . . . .And so I went in there and he’s like, “Does anybody have a problem with Victoria breastfeeding?” And he was sincerely trying to make me feel comfortable and say, “Hey, don’t miss out” . . . which was really nice. And so I’m like, “All right.” So I’m sitting there looking around like, “These are all men like over 60 . . . they cannot be comfortable with this.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Kellie’s and Victoria’s experiences are paradigmatic examples of unbounded motherhood. With the requests, invitations, and support from their supervisors, they combined work and breastfeeding in a very literal way. This semipublic nursing disturbs all manner of organizational orders. It brings breastfeeding and work together in space and time, challenging both of these orders, as well as the work order wherein personal and professional activities are distinct. Further, by breastfeeding in the company of others these participants’ actions disrupted the aesthetic and sentimental orders. Victoria acknowledges the latter in saying the men in the room could not be comfortable with what was happening.</p>
<p>It is interesting that in both cases the participants were asked by their employers to work during their maternity leaves, and seemingly in exchange, the supervisors offered profuse support of breastfeeding at work. Perhaps in asking women to disrupt the routine actions of motherhood, which should be undisturbed during maternity leave, the supervisors felt the need to mitigate this breach by bending organizational orders to accommodate mothering. Also of note is that Kellie said no one reacted to her nursing while working. This hints at a possibility of transformation. When organizational members refrain from policing behaviors that threaten the status quo, problematic actions have the potential to become routine.</p>
<p>Although they described the boldest cases, Kellie and Victoria were not alone in pumping or nursing in the presence of others or in being open about the fact that they were breastfeeding. Carla, a professor, also chose not to be contrite about breastfeeding or motherhood:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think motherhood—I don’t make any apologies for, for the role that I have as mother when I’m at work . . . to me, part of being successful in this whole enterprise of working mom is that you’re not apologetic about the things that you choose to do. And so I don’t think I would have said something [on her door sign] as coy as “Privacy, please.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Carla’s description of bringing breastfeeding practices into the workplace exemplifies the significance of unbounded motherhood for working mothers and for organizations—it is not simply a matter of falling short of <italic>good worker</italic> standards coupled with a justification for failure. Instead, it is a conscious effort to embody a <italic>good working mother</italic> identity, which denies the currency of discourses that position working mothers as lesser. Accordingly, Mallory thought it important for college students to see unboundedness so that it might establish a new precedent:
<disp-quote>
<p> . . . my office is in the middle of the career services area on campus, you know, and so at first I was like, “Well, is someone going to be offended?” and then I sort of decided that that was a risk I was willing to take . . . in an environment where college students are coming in and thinking about their job opportunities and job options, I felt like I want the women walking down that hallway to know that this is something they can do at work.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Liz shared a similar construction of herself as an example for others:
<disp-quote>
 <p>I really felt like at work that was a great chance for me to role model, you know, to other women that were getting pregnant or having babies or even the men . . . I worked next door to a man and his wife was pregnant at the time and I thought, “Well, this is a good way for me to role model.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although these examples show that unbounded motherhood has a presence in organizations, participants who practiced unbounded motherhood also practiced bounded motherhood. Mallory, for example, expressed embarrassment that coworkers might see her breast pump and worried that her breastfeeding might offend them. She ultimately constructed her challenge to workplace norms as risky, but worth it as she felt a sense of responsibility to other women to create space for motherhood at work. Liz felt comfortable performing unbounded motherhood with certain coworkers and clients, but felt she must bind motherhood in the presence of her supervisors. She described a situation where she felt torn between binding and unbinding motherhood:
<disp-quote>
<p>I never told them [her supervisors]. I was so afraid. I mean, I was a great employee. I went above and beyond. I never did anything wrong. For some reason that was just one thing I never could reconcile—I just didn’t feel comfortable not taking her [her baby], but I didn’t feel like I could ask permission to take her, but I knew nobody would care there [at the meeting], but . . . how do you tell your boss, “I’m going to a business meeting and I’m taking my baby,” . . . because in most people’s minds that would not be appropriate, but . . . we were meeting in a restaurant. It was like a three-hour meeting . . . I gave my presentation holding her. I breastfed her sitting at a table talking to people, you know.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<speech>
<speaker>Paaige:</speaker>
<p>Do you think it added to the meeting or to your relationship with them?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Liz:</speaker>
<p>Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I think it definitely enhanced it, but I don’t think I could ever get that through to my superiors . . .</p>
</speech>
<p>Liz not only believed that her performance of unbounded motherhood did not detract from her work, but she believed it bolstered her work in the eyes of colleagues/clients. This is a significant claim as it undercuts the assumption that mothering detracts from work and vice versa.</p>
<p>Patty, the same woman who described concealing leaks and the size of her breasts, also described one of the most conspicuous and extended performances of unbounded motherhood:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . my daughter came to see me every day at lunch and we nursed. And that was significant for lots of different reasons, but for the workplace, that was significant because they had to give us a place to nurse . . . I talked to a couple of other girls that had pumped and a lot of them had pumped in the bathroom, including my boss, and, you know, she had done that for two kids, and I just was like, “This bathroom’s gross anyway. I don’t want to.” . . . I went to the H.R. person and I said, “Is there any other spot . . . can I reserve a conference room, for example, twice a day?” And they told me that, yes, I could. So I reserved a conference room in the morning at 10:15 and in the afternoon at 2:15 [for pumping] . . . for almost fourteen months . . . They let me use an old office at lunch . . . we’d sit in there with just a lamp on . . . and nurse . . . that meant that I was bringing my daughter into the office where other people’s offices were, going into this one every day, which, you know, to me at the time it just seemed like, “Well, that’s what I’m doing. That’s normal,” but in retrospect, that was a little weird, I guess, to other people, that here’s this baby just coming in and she’s getting—you know, I mean, it . . . had never been done before.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Patty recognizes that asking for accommodations of space and time and bringing her daughter to work to nurse goes against organizational norms. She even says that her requests and actions were “significant” for her workplace because the organization was asked to make changes to accommodate breastfeeding. Interestingly, even as she acknowledges that she challenged the routine orders of time and space, she constructs her actions as normal. By not framing these actions as troublesome, she not only challenges the orders of time, space, work, and aesthetics in her organization, she refuses to answer to traditional notions of work and motherhood.</p>
<p>Most of the participants who performed unbounded motherhood still tried to uphold the temporal order. This may indicate that they believe some rules, like those pertaining to time, are more strictly policed or more important to uphold and others are less risky to violate. Regardless, even the intermittent performance of unbounded motherhood opens an arena for discussion and opportunity for new practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0893318913491461">Strauss, 1993</xref>) and, therefore, creates space for the embodiment of a <italic>good working mother</italic> identity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Working mothers bear considerable burden in combining breastfeeding and work due to the seeming incompatibility of work and motherhood. Our participants considered breastfeeding a bridge between these spheres that allows them to be good mothers while working full time. At work, however, they often bound breastfeeding practices so as to embody norms of professionalism. Doing so was arduous; they took pains to conceal breast milk, pumps, pumping practices, and leaking bodies as well as to use as little time as possible to accomplish breastfeeding tasks while maintaining work responsibilities. In effect, participants often straddled two domains, being especially careful not to let motherhood spill into work.</p>
<p>When they performed unbounded motherhood, however, participants inserted breastfeeding into work in ways that did not abide by the rules of masculinity that underlie organizations. In exhibiting embodiment that goes against organizational norms and values, without apologizing for or justifying their behaviors in light of the <italic>good worker</italic> discourse, they embodied a <italic>good working mother</italic> identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318913491461">Buzzanell et al., 2005</xref>). They eschewed the divisive contradiction of good worker-good mother, making room for themselves and other women to be both at once without failing at either. Instead of straddling separate fields, they undermined the orders on which the separation is built. At these moments, their embodiment was not defined by precarious separation of the professional and the domestic, but a blending of two formerly discrete realms<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0893318913491461">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Participants did not neatly fall into the categories of bounded or unbounded mothers. In a sense, most participants were findings ways both to make motherhood work within the constraints of professionalism and to remake work so that motherhood is compatible with professionalism. The impetus to move between bounded and unbounded performances may be connected to the risks of challenging deeply rooted organizational values. The combination of bounded and unbounded motherhood performances shows that resistance is not an all-or-nothing endeavor—it may be characterized by vacillation with movement toward change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0893318913491461">Tracy and Rivera (2010)</xref> refer to such a phenomenon as “meaning in movement” (p. 5) where flickers of transformation may be observed alongside actions and discourse that reify established scripts. The altering of an established system is unlikely to happen all at once, but instead through partial reworkings and gradual gains.</p>
<p>Perhaps those gradual gains will begin with—changing of certain orders before others. For example, participants seemed less willing to challenge the temporal order compared to other organizational orders. When participants engaged in unbinding with regard to space, aesthetic, work, or sentimental order, they tended to continue to bind breastfeeding with respect to time. This careful upholding of the temporal order may be connected to both the changing nature of work and the centrality of time to organizational values. Increasingly, work is being conducted in homes, at coffee shops, across continents, and virtually. For many employees, the confines of a traditional workspace, and all that entails, no longer apply. However, while work time may be becoming more pliable in some ways (e.g., taking work home with us), we still are held to notions of company time; “‘Time is money’ is the key metaphorical concept on which the logic of industrial production is built” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0893318913491461">Tietze &amp; Musson, 2005</xref>, p. 133). Therefore, it is not surprising that women may choose to combine work and breastfeeding in ways that uphold what remains a core symbolic order in organizations.</p>
<p>The approach and findings of this study offer both practical and theoretical contributions. Next, we expound on these while offering further contextualization for and reflection on the concept of unbounded motherhood. Finally, we suggest directions for future research.</p>
<sec id="section14-0893318913491461">
<title>Embodiment Matters</title>
<p>Organizations, and the norms and values therein, have significant effects on our bodies; the demands of the <italic>good worker</italic> discourse might motivate us to work to the point of exhaustion, convince us not to get the tattoo we want, compel us to suppress our sexual orientation, or cause us not to breastfeed. However, bodies impact organizations and discourse as well. The presence in the workplace of various bodies that do not fit the narrowly defined ideal worker—female, non-White, disabled, or transgender bodies, for example—has brought about both formal and informal change in discourses surrounding work, although there is a long way to go before such bodies cease to be considered deviant and potentially problematic.</p>
<p>An embodied perspective on the construction of a <italic>good working mother</italic> identity is essential for considering how communication can change working mothers’ circumstances, “For it is in the expression of bodily presence, movement, gesture, adornment, and so on that we find not only material instantiations of meanings of professionalism but also (re)combinations and new assertions of identity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318913491461">Cheney &amp; Ashcraft, 2007</xref>, p. 158). The body communicates in sensual ways that may be more impactful and harder to dismiss than other modes of communication. For instance, it is one thing to be told that a coworker is a breastfeeding mother, but it is another to sit beside her while she nurses a child during a meeting. The latter experience may conjure stronger feelings of discomfort than the former, but also may provide a symbolic rupture that speeds the process of transforming norms and values. Bodies are particularly powerful resources for organizational change.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is important to consider what kinds of bodies can create change or even enact performances with potential to bring about change. It may be that unbounded motherhood is performed largely by White, educated, middle to upper class, able-bodied, heterosexual women in the United States and/or only tolerated when performed by such women. Unbounded motherhood may be outside of the realm of possible action for women who work certain jobs, experience layers of discrimination, or have bodies that are physically limited. Alternatively, there may be some working mothers who, due to their particular subject positions, routinely and unconsciously integrate the identities and practices of <italic>good worker</italic> and <italic>good mother</italic>. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318913491461">Arendall (2000)</xref> argues that African American mothers may experience “less stress in combining parenting and paid work than do Anglo women,” because their “employment rates have been higher for a longer period of time and are recognized within the community as being essential to family survival” (p. 1199). In order to better understand unbounded motherhood and the intersections of embodiment, gender, and work it is important to pursue such possibilities.</p>

<title>Facilitating the Combination of Breastfeeding and Work</title>
<p>The performance of unbounded motherhood can help to facilitate the successful combination of breastfeeding and paid labor, which to this point has proven problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0893318913491461">Kimbro, 2006</xref>). While bounded motherhood keeps breastfeeding marginalized in organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0893318913491461">Gatrell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0893318913491461">Payne &amp; Nicholls, 2010</xref>), unbounded motherhood brings it closer to the center. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0893318913491461">Gatrell (2007)</xref> concluded that we are far from a feminist politics of motherhood in which breastfeeding would be considered normal in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0893318913491461">Hausman, 2004</xref>), but our findings warrant a more optimistic outlook.</p>
<p>We do not mean to suggest that breastfeeding has been fully accepted in organizations, or that combining breastfeeding and work is becoming standard or easy. Our findings do indicate, though, that some women may perceive that the risk of violating organizational orders is decreasing or that violating them is necessary to accomplish their goals, or both. In any case, these participants did not report any punishment for their breaches and they depicted those who were aware of their unboundedness as supportive. Through repetition of unrepentant action coupled with the explicit and tacit support of coworkers and supervisors, unbounded motherhood may become routine, thereby reconstituting the symbolic orders of organizations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318913491461">Broadfoot, Deetz, and Anderson (2004)</xref> explain, “ . . . changes, wrought by individuals or institutions, draw on their awareness of, accessibility to, and appropriation of alternative repertoires of conduct . . . ” (p. 197). Because unbounded motherhood expands the repertoire of action for negotiating work and breastfeeding, it is a step toward a feminist politics of motherhood wherein breastfeeding will not be considered a potentially discrediting practice at work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0893318913491461">
<title>Unbounded Motherhood as Resistance-Control</title>
<p>Even as unbounded motherhood constitutes embodied opposition to organizational norms, we must reflect on the complex relationship between power and resistance. While Victoria and Kellie performed unbounded motherhood in ways that hold transformative potential, they did so at their supervisors’ requests that they interrupt their maternity leaves to benefit the organizations. This suggests that certain performances of unbounded motherhood may be another form of corporate colonization of the life-world in which the organization expands its reach into the nonwork lives of employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318913491461">Deetz, 1992</xref>). Organizational resistance and control may operate as a dialectic, “a process of ongoing, multiple, and unpredictable calls (power) and responses (resistance) in which power and resistance are often indistinguishable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0893318913491461">Fleming &amp; Spicer, 2008</xref>, p. 305). Innovations in the conduct of work can at once give employees more freedom and organizations more control (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0893318913491461">Martin, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0893318913491461">Edley (2001)</xref>, for example, argues that technology creates a gendered paradox for women who work and mother: “Technology’s ability to extend the body, space, and time can be empowering. Simultaneously it can be a form of control” (p. 30). Unbounded motherhood may function similarly, concurrently making the combination of work and breastfeeding more viable for women and expanding the organization’s influence in their lives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0893318913491461">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>Future research should investigate when, where, and by whom unbounded motherhood is being performed. We know that there are lower rates of breastfeeding while working among minority and low-income women, partly due to a lack of flexibility and autonomy in jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318913491461">Arlotti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0893318913491461">Li et al., 2005</xref>). For some women, breastfeeding while working and particularly in an unbounded way may not be feasible. Future research that undertakes a broader-based analysis should attend to how work conditions are connected to bounded and unbounded motherhood in organizations. Additionally, researchers should investigate whether unbounded motherhood, or bounded, for that matter, translates across cultures. It would be worthwhile to know whether more progressive maternity policies in other countries create an atmosphere where being a <italic>good</italic> (breastfeeding) <italic>mother</italic> and a <italic>good worker</italic> is not a struggle or whether other work-life issues arise from extended leaves (e.g., fewer parents in leadership positions).</p>
<p>In addition, future research should investigate the effects of unbounded motherhood on work environments. While we can infer some things about organizational climate from participants’ stories, we cannot know how their performances were perceived by others, nor if and how problematic action impacted their organizations. Conversations with managers and human resource staff would provide a better picture of how organizations formally respond to such performances. Additionally, coworkers’ responses to unbounded motherhood should be explored given that informal, peer influence is important to the utilization of work-family policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0893318913491461">Kirby &amp; Krone, 2002</xref>). Ultimately, research should examine whether the flickers of transformation we found actualize in changes to implicit norms and official policies regarding breastfeeding. Along with this research, scholars might examine whether men perform fatherhood at work in ways that both reflect and expand gendered ideals of professionalism as well as how other aspects of identity besides parenting, like sexual orientation or disability, are suppressed by and impact organizational orders.</p>
<p>Finally, organizational communication researchers can make use of Strauss’s framework to investigate broader changes to the way work is done. Our finding regarding the maintenance of the temporal order may bear out in other circumstances. In the case of unbounded motherhood, the body’s maternal presence tests the spatial order (and others) of traditional work environment, yet the temporal order is largely unopposed. Similarly, in the case of telecommuting the spatial order is transformed or even erased due to an absence of workers’ bodies in a traditional work environment. This may be another instance in which the temporal order emerges as a key symbolic order. Employees might be free to work on couches or while wearing pajamas, but they are likely not as free with respect to time, as interconnectedness among employees and clients probably necessitates coordination of schedules. As some symbolic orders change, one or more orders may remain sturdy or gain prominence as a means for organizations to maintain some standard of control. Examining which orders are more and less flexible, which constrain workers in problematic ways, and the specifics of the reciprocal impact between embodied inter/actions and organizational orders would allow theorists and practitioners to better target efforts to understand and affect change.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0893318913491461">Hausman (2004)</xref> argues that “we have yet to see the organisation of waged employment, or even contemporary social life, really take account of what having babies means for women who work outside the home” (p. 276). Often, it means that women are asked to occupy two competing worlds of work and motherhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0893318913491461">Edley, 2001</xref>), making the accomplishment of being both a <italic>good worker</italic> and a <italic>good mother</italic> difficult, at best. However, our findings show that working, breastfeeding women can blend mothering and working in ways that challenge the forces that situate these identities in tension. We do not mean to suggest, though, that it is up to working mothers alone to change the circumstances that create such tension. Organizations must face the fact that the workforce is comprised of not only near equal numbers of women and men, but of a large number of women who are mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0893318913491461">U.S. Department of Labor, 2009</xref>). Therefore, instead of maintaining orders that suppress a good number of their employees, organizations should engage in a reordering that accommodates and supports lactation and other feminine practices in the workplace.</p>

<p>Our invocation of the term “bounded” is inspired by the concepts of <italic>bounded rationality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0893318913491461">Simon, 1976</xref>) and its alternative, <italic>bounded emotionality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0893318913491461">Mumby &amp; Putnam, 1992</xref>) in the sense that something is restricted or limited within organizational contexts, and therefore constraint must be exercised in one way or another.</p>

<p>This argument is reminiscent of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0893318913491461">Hochschild’s (1997)</xref> that due to varying pressures of family and employment home and work have reversed. However, where Hochschild saw that persons were getting from home what they were supposed to get from work and vice versa, we see that women are blending elements of home and work in ways that seem to help them navigate an otherwise difficult divide. Although both arguments play on the notion of fluidity between these realms, they claim quite different things about this fluidity.</p>
