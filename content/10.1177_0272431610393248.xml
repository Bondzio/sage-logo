<abstract>
<p>This paper examines the risk and protective factors associated with sexual behaviors among Thai youth ages 13-14 (N=420) living in Bangkok, Thailand. Cross-sectional data were collected using a random sample of households methodology. Three outcomes were assessed: (1) intention to engage in sexual intercourse, (2) pre-coital behaviors, and (3) sexual initiation. Bivariate analysis indicated that parental disapproval of sex, exposure to pornographic media, refusal self-efficacy and having a boyfriend/girlfriend had the strongest relationships with all three outcomes. Multivariate analyses found that parental disapproval of sex and exposure to pornographic media (internet or TV) were significantly associated with all three outcomes. Having a boyfriend or girlfriend was associated with pre-coital behaviors and intentions and sexual refusal self efficacy was correlated with pre-coital behaviors only. The potential competing influences of parent disapproval and exposure to pornographic media on adolescent sexual behaviors should be considered when adapting HIV prevention interventions for Thai youth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Thailand has experienced a remarkable reduction in HIV seroprevalence due to government supported interventions targeting the commercial sex industry and its patrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431610393248">Hanenberg, Rojanapithayakorn, Kunasol, &amp; Sokal, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272431610393248">Mason et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431610393248">Nelson et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272431610393248">Rojanapithayakorn &amp; Hanenberg, 1996</xref>). As HIV-prevention efforts have taken hold in Thailand, there has been a gradual shift from males engaging in sex with commercial sex workers to sex partnerships with unmarried females which are now viewed as more acceptable and less risky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272431610393248">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). Contributing to these changes are dramatic shifts in the Thai economy and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0272431610393248">Vuttanont, Greenhalgh, Griffin, &amp; Boynton, 2006</xref>) where Western views of sexuality have come in conflict with traditional Thai values.</p>
<p>Adolescent populations are particularly vulnerable to this “dual value system” (Vuttanont et al., p. 2072) with expectations from their traditional Thai culture that values modesty and reverence to elders clashing with a desire to experience dating and engage in sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0272431610393248">Vuttanont et al., 2006</xref>). Although population based data on younger Thai populations is limited, cross-sectional studies of older vocational students have documented earlier age of sexual debut when comparing 15 to 17 year olds to 20 to 21 year olds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272431610393248">Liu et al., 2006</xref>), lack of condom use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431610393248">Allen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272431610393248">Thato, Charron-Prochownik, Dorn, Albrecht, &amp; Stone, 2003</xref>) and significant increases in number of sex partnerships comparing cross-sectional surveys conducted in 1991 and 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0272431610393248">Whitehead et al., 2008</xref>). These risk behaviors have heightened adolescent risk of HIV, other STIs, and pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431610393248">Allen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0272431610393248">Whitehead et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to examine the risk and protective factors associated with the sexual risk behaviors among Thai early adolescents of whom there has been little published using a theoretically driven approach to variable selection. In this article, we examine the correlates of precoital behaviors, intentions to have sex, and sexual initiation among Thai youth ages 13 to 14 who participated in a household survey of 420 adolescents in Bangkok, Thailand.</p>
<p>The Risk and Protective Framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431610393248">Hawkins, Catalano &amp; Miller, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431610393248">Jessor, 1991</xref>) is the theoretical framework of our study and is used to guide variable selection. The framework takes into consideration the following: (a) individual, (b) peer, (c) family, (d) school, and (e) community-level factors that can contribute to or protect adolescents from high-risk behaviors including sexual risk taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272431610393248">Blum &amp; Mmari, 2005</xref>). In this exploratory analysis, we assess the impact of these risk and protective factors on precoital behaviors, intentions to have sex, and ever having sexual intercourse. Described below are the risk and protective factors under each of these five domains that are associated with risky sexual behaviors in either the Western and/or Thai literature and are therefore included in this exploratory analysis.</p>
<p>At the individual level, we include key <italic>psychosocial</italic> variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272431610393248">Noar &amp; Zimmerman, 2005</xref>) such as <italic>sexual refusal self-efficacy, attitudes about delaying sex</italic>, and <italic>perceived consequences of HIV infection</italic> that have been found to be negatively associated with sexual risk taking in the United States (for review see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272431610393248">Sheeran, Abraham, &amp; Orbell, 1999</xref>) and in Thailand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431610393248">Guruge et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272431610393248">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272431610393248">Rasamimari, Dancy, Talashek, &amp; Park, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272431610393248">Thato et al., 2003</xref>). We also include characteristics innate to the individual such as <italic>interdependence, independence</italic>, and the practice of <italic>Buddhism</italic>. A U.S. study found that women with a strong sense of familial interdependency had a lower risk of pregnancy than those with lower levels of familial interdependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431610393248">Mendez &amp; Majumdar, 2005</xref>). Among Thai adolescents, there persists a deep obligation to the family unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272431610393248">Spielmann, 1994</xref>) and also a desire to embrace more Western concepts of independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0272431610393248">Vuttanont et al., 2006</xref>). We therefore include <italic>interdependence</italic> as a protective factor and <italic>independenc</italic>e as a potential risk factor for sexual risk-taking behaviors. In Thailand, <italic>Buddhism</italic> is interwoven into many elements of Thai culture. The practice of <italic>Buddhism</italic> has been viewed as protective for sexual risk behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0272431610393248">Ubillos, Paez, &amp; Gonzalez, 2000</xref>) and is included as a potential protective factor. Last, we include male <italic>gender</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272431610393248">Rasamimari et al., 2007</xref>) and older <italic>age</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431610393248">Guruge, Isaranurug, Nanthamongkolchai, &amp; Charupoonphol, 2004</xref>) as important risk factors.</p>
<p>At the peer level, we include <italic>peer norms</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272431610393248">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431610393248">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>) that have been found to be associated with sexual risk taking in U.S. studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272431610393248">Noar &amp; Zimmerman, 2005</xref>). We also include <italic>having a boyfriend/girlfriend</italic> which has been associated with early sexual intercourse in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431610393248">Blum, Buehring, &amp; Rinehart, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431610393248">Halpern, Joyner, Udry, &amp; Suchindran, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272431610393248">Thorton, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>At the family level, we include parental characteristics found to be protective for sexual risk taking in the United States and Thailand including <italic>parental monitoring</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272431610393248">Harris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272431610393248">Longmore, Manning, &amp; Giordano, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272431610393248">Resnick et al., 1997</xref>), <italic>parental closeness</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272431610393248">Miller, Benson, &amp; Galbraith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272431610393248">Paul, Fitzjohn, Herbison, &amp; Dickson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272431610393248">Resnick et al., 1997</xref>); <italic>parental disapproval</italic> about sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272431610393248">Resnick et al., 1997</xref>), and <italic>parent–child communication</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431610393248">Allen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272431610393248">Hutchinson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272431610393248">Romer et al.,1999</xref>).</p>
<p>At the school level, we include <italic>school attachment</italic> and self-reported <italic>academic performance</italic> both of which have been found to be associated with delay in sexual debut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431610393248">Billy, Brewster, &amp; Grady, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272431610393248">Lammers, Ireland, Resnick, &amp; Blum, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272431610393248">Raine et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272431610393248">Resnick et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Last, at the community/societal level, we include <italic>exposure to pornographic media</italic> on the internet or television and perception of <italic>neighborhood disorganization</italic>, as potential risk factors. In the Thai literature, exposure to sexualized media has been correlated with sexual risk behaviors and attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431610393248">Guruge et al., 2004</xref>). Thai studies have also shown that adolescents’ perceptions of greater <italic>neighborhood disorganization</italic> are related to higher levels of minor and serious delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272431610393248">Byrnes, Miller, Cupp, Zimmerman, &amp; Chookhare, in press</xref>).</p>

<title>Sampling Procedures</title>
<p>Using a cross-sectional design, families (<italic>N</italic> = 420) were randomly and proportionally selected from seven districts of Bangkok, Thailand. Sampling was based on the former Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) that divides districts into three zones (the inner, middle, and outer zones). There are 10 districts in the inner zone (14.7% of the Bangkok population), 27 districts in the middle zone (56.1% of the city’s population), and 13 districts in the outer zone (29.2% of the city’s population). The selection of districts was based on a sampling fraction of each of these zones that was proportional to the total Bangkok population using the probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling method (with case multiplication technique). Using district-level population data from 2006, one district was selected from the inner zone, four from the middle zone, and two from the outer zone (<italic>n</italic> = seven districts). Within each district, 35 blocks were selected using the PPS method of selection, resulting in a total of 245 blocks (35 blocks × 7 districts). There were slightly more than 4,000 households per district or 30,471 households across all seven districts. Surveyors made contact with 28,174 of the 30,471 households (82.6% of the total).</p>
<p>The Mahidol University researchers in conjunction with Thailand’s National Statistical Office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272431610393248">NSO; 2000</xref>) conducted a household census and identified a total of 957 households (3.4%) determined to have a 13- and/or a 14-year-old present. Of the total, 79 (8.3%) refused to be interviewed and 116 households (12.1%) were unwilling to participate in the study, leaving 762 families who agreed to participate (79.6% of all households with 13- and/or 14-year-olds). Of the 762 families, 66 families were randomly sampled in each of the seven districts, yielding 60 completed adolescent surveys and 60 completed parent interviews from each district for a total sample of 420 completed pairs of adolescent and parent interviews across all seven districts (60 × 7 = 420). For this analysis, only the adolescent survey data, not the parent survey data, were used (<italic>n</italic> = 420), yielding 85% power to detect a standardized multiple regression coefficient of .15 making standard assumptions about a Type II error (α<sub>2-tails</sub> = .05).</p>
<p>Adolescent survey data were collected using audio-computer-assisted self-interviews (ACASI) on a laptop computer with one adolescent per family. Face to face interviews were completed with one mother per family. Formative interviews indicated that parents were less comfortable with computers, therefore, in-person interviews were conducted. Because only the adolescent data were used for this analysis, the different data-collection strategies did not impact our findings.</p>

<p>Adolescents in our sample (<italic>N</italic> = 420) were on average 13.45 years of age (<italic>SD</italic> = .50), 50.5% were female, and represented mostly ethnic Thais (91.2%; data not shown). Few adolescents reported ever engaging in sexual intercourse (4.5% female and 3% males).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0272431610393248">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>To ensure that survey measures were equivalent (i.e., measuring the same construct when comparing the U.S.-based measures to the same measures when adapted and translated in Thai), a number of steps were taken. Interview instruments were adapted in partnership with the Thai and U.S. research teams. Suggestions for changes were made to ensure they measured the same underlying domain of interest. A Thai research member translated the survey into Thai and a second Thai researcher back-translated into English to reduce the possibility of a biased assessment. Back-translated versions were reviewed by the entire research team to assess whether the original intent of the questions were communicated. Last, Thai parents and teens, not involved in the primary study, provided feedback on the instrument to assess wording clarity and interpretation.</p>
<sec id="section6-0272431610393248">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>Three dependent variables were derived from the adolescent self-report cross-sectional surveys. The first dependent variable was intention to have sex. Respondents were asked, “How likely do you think it is that you will have sexual intercourse by the time you finish high school?” Responses used a 4-point scale ranging from 1 = <italic>very sure I won’t</italic> to 4 = <italic>very sure I will</italic>. The second measure, an index of precoital behaviors, was assessed with a six-item latent index, adapted from a similar measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272431610393248">Martino, Elliott, Collins, Kanouse, &amp; Berry, 2008</xref>). Items inquired about kissing, “French-kissing or tongue kissing,” “touching a girl’s breast” (for boys) or “someone having touched your chest or breasts” (for girls), touching someone else’s “private parts below the waist,” and someone “touching your private parts below the waist.” Responses used a 4-point ordinal scale where 1 = <italic>no, never</italic>, 2 = <italic>yes, once</italic>, 3 = <italic>yes, a few times</italic>, 4 = <italic>yes, many times</italic>. The scale was found to have good reliability in our Thai sample with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.87 for males and 0.86 for females. The third and final dependent variable was having experienced sexual intercourse. Respondents were asked, “Have you ever had sexual intercourse (By this we mean ‘going all the way’ or ‘doing it’)” measured as a single item dichotomous variable (<italic>yes</italic> vs. <italic>no</italic>).</p>

<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272431610393248">Table 1</xref>, we describe the multi-item constructs that fall into one of the five categories of the Risk and Protective Framework. All multi-item constructs has response categories ranging from 1 to 4 with higher scores tending to represent greater prosocial behaviors, attitudes, or norms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272431610393248">Table 1</xref>). These constructs include the following at the level of the individual: Sexual refusal self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431610393248">Donohew et al., 2000</xref>), sexual attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431610393248">Floyd, 2009</xref>), and perceived HIV severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0272431610393248">Witte, Girma, &amp; Girgre, 2002</xref>), level of interdependence and independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272431610393248">Singelis, 1994</xref>), and the practice of Buddhism. At the peer level, we included peer norms about sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431610393248">Floyd, 2009</xref>) and having a boyfriend or girlfriend (<italic>yes</italic> vs. <italic>no</italic>). Variables at the family level include parental monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431610393248">Capaldi &amp; Patterson, 1989</xref>), parental closeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431610393248">Harris et al., 2003</xref>), parental disapproval of sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272431610393248">Jaccard, Dittus, &amp; Gordon, 1996</xref>) and parental communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431610393248">Diloria, Kelley, Hockenberry-Eaton, 1999</xref>). At the school level, we included school connectedness, and at the community level, exposure to pornographic media and neighborhood disorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431610393248">Elliott et al, 1996</xref>).

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>For our initial exploratory analysis, we conducted bivariate analyses using the Pearson correlation coefficient to assess the correlation between each of the three dependent variables and each of the variables that fell into one of the five categories of the Risk and Protective Framework (individual, peer, family, school, and community, significant effects presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272431610393248">Table 1</xref>) establishing statistical significance at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. We then examined the correlation between significant predictor variables conducting a correlational matrix using the Kendal rank order correlation. Variables from each domain (individual, peer, family, school, and community) that were significantly associated with any of the three outcomes in bivariate analyses (at <italic>p</italic> = .05) and not highly correlated with each other (τ &lt; .40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), were included in a series of simultaneous regression equations, specific to each risk and protective level, to assess which variables were more strongly correlated with each of the three outcomes (data not shown). We selected a <italic>p</italic> value of .05 (instead of a smaller <italic>p</italic> value) because of the exploratory nature of these analyses to detect potentially important correlates of sexual behaviors. That is, we felt that a Type II error (missing potentially significant finding) was more important that a Type I error (incorrectly concluding a relationship was significant). We used linear regression for engagement in presexual behaviors and intention to have sex and logistic regression for ever having sexual intercourse (significance at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). We examined violations to homoscedasticity and multicollinearity among our predictor variables by examining residual plots for each predictor variable and by assessing tolerance values. The most significant variable (as measured by the coefficient and <italic>p</italic> value) from each of these multivariate analyses at the individual, peer, family, school, and community level, were then included in a series of simultaneous regression models for each of the three outcome variables (data not shown). Final reduced models were then estimated for each outcome variable, comparing the full to the reduced models, using change in <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> for linear regression and the likelihood ratio test for logistic regression.</p>
<p>In our final reduced regression models, significant numbers of respondents were excluded from the analyses due to missing data. A missing data analysis was run to assess whether those who were missing on any of the independent variables in the final multivariate models reported significantly different responses on variables of interest than those included in the final models (see Results section).</p>

<title>Bivariate Results</title>
<p>The three sets of bivariate results (one set in each column for each of the three dependent variables—precoital behaviors, intention to have sex by the end of secondary school, and ever had sex) are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272431610393248">Table 2</xref>. These analyses are organized by each risk and protective level (individual, peer, family, school, and community). Independent variables not significantly correlated with any of the three dependent variables (general parental communication, and independence) were dropped from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272431610393248">Table 2</xref> and further analyses. Bivariate results were generally similar across the three outcome variables. At the individual level, refusal self-efficacy, and attitudes about delaying sex had the strongest bivariate relationships with all three outcomes with absolute values of correlations between <italic>r</italic> = .29 and <italic>r</italic> = .14. Level of interdependence and engaging in Buddhist practices were weakly correlated with all three dependent variables, whereas perceived consequences of HIV infection was weakly, negatively correlated with precoital behaviors and intentions to have sex. At the peer level, having a boyfriend/girlfriend was highly correlated with precoital behaviors (<italic>r</italic> = .40, p &lt; .0001) and weakly correlated with intentions to have sex and ever having sexual intercourse (<italic>r</italic> = .22 and <italic>r</italic> = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, respectively). Perceived peer norms were not correlated with any of the three outcomes. At the family level, parental disapproval about sex had the strongest association with precoital behaviors, intentions, and ever had sex (<italic>r</italic> = –.31, <italic>r</italic> = –.38, <italic>r</italic> = –.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, respectively) followed by parental closeness (<italic>r</italic> = –.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; <italic>r</italic> = –.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; <italic>r</italic> = –.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, respectively) and parental monitoring (<italic>r</italic> = –.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; <italic>r</italic> = –.19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>r</italic> = –.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, respectively). At the school level, school connectedness and self-reported grades were both moderately correlated with the three risk behaviors with absolute values ranging from <italic>r</italic> = .17 to <italic>r</italic> = .29. At the community level, exposure to pornographic media was strongly correlated with precoital behaviors (<italic>r</italic> = .37, p &lt; .001) and moderately correlated with sexual intention and ever having sex (<italic>r</italic> = .20, <italic>r</italic> = .22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, respectively).</p>

<p>Tests for multicollinearity were done in all regression models and multicollinearity was clearly not present. The tolerance value (1 – <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) was greater than .7 for all predictors in all three equations and the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was less than 2.0. We also tested for heteroscedasticity in our linear regression models (predicting precoital behaviors and intentions to have sex) by plotting residuals against values of predicted scores. After viewing the plots, we concluded there was very little heteroscedasticity for our variables in both analyses, with much less than the threshold of three times greater variance of residuals for any predicted value when compared to another predicted value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272431610393248">Tabachnik &amp; Fidell, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Missing Data Analysis</title>
<p>In the final reduced multivariate models, missing data (<italic>n)</italic> ranged from 45 to 75 across the three outcomes. To assess whether our findings from our final reduced models were affected by missing cases, we compared those participants who remained in our analysis to those participants who had missing data for precoital behaviors, intentions to have sex, and ever had sex. Variables assessed as potentially differing between the two groups included the following: age, gender, parental communication about sex, parental closeness, independence, interdependence, perceived HIV risk, attitudes about waiting to have sex, Buddhist practices, neighborhood problems, and school attachment. For “ever had sex” there were no significant differences between the 377 included in the regression model and the 43 who were missing on any of these variables. For intentions to have sex, there were five variables on which the two groups (those included in the model, <italic>n</italic> = 345 and missing cases, <italic>n</italic> = 75) differed significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Those with missing data were slightly younger, perceived themselves to be at higher HIV risk, had more negative attitudes about waiting to have sex, practiced Buddhist practices less, and were less connected to school. Thus our results from our multivariate model are probably weaker than if these potentially higher risk individuals had participated and generalizing to the population should be done cautiously. For the precoital behavior analysis, three variables were significantly different between the two groups (<italic>n</italic> = 345 and <italic>n</italic> = 75, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.05). Those with missing data communicated less with their parents, practiced Buddhism more frequently, and perceived more problems in their neighborhood. These variables were less consistent (in terms of level of risk) and therefore we can probably generalize with less caution for this analysis to the entire sample population.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The Risk and Protective Framework serves as a useful organizational framework to examine variables operating at the individual, school, peer, family, and community levels that may be associated with sexual risk taking. This is particularly true in a culture like Thailand that is undergoing dramatic social change. Our multivariate findings indicate that parental disapproval of sex (at the family level) was negatively correlated with all three outcomes, serving as a robust protective factor, whereas exposure to pornographic media (at the community level) was associated with all three outcomes and may act as an important risk factor. These cross-sectional findings underscore the tension documented in the Thai literature between parents’ strong influence on their children’s behavior on the one hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272431610393248">Spielmann, 1994</xref>) and the ubiquitous influence of Westernization and adolescent exposure to sexually explicit information through the internet and television on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0272431610393248">Vuttanont et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>At the peer level, having a boyfriend/girlfriend was correlated with engaging in precoital behaviors and intention to have sex, serving as a potential risk factor for these earlier risk behaviors. These findings, consistent with the Western literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431610393248">Blum et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272431610393248">Thorton, 1990</xref>), point to the opportunities that having a boyfriend or girlfriend provide for experimenting with precoital behaviors and formulating intentions to have sex. Having a boyfriend or girlfriend did not remain significant for engaging in sex, contrary to other research findings, and may be due in part to the lower statistical power to detect significant effects given the few adolescents who engaged in sexual intercourse in this sample.</p>
<p>At the individual level, sexual refusal self-efficacy was negatively correlated with engaging in precoital behaviors in our final reduced multivariate model but it did not remain a significant protective factor for intentions to have sex or ever had sex. Similarly, our other psychosocial variables such as sexual attitudes, refusal self efficacy, and perceived consequences of HIV, found in the Western literature to be associated with sexual risk behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272431610393248">Noar &amp; Zimmerman, 2005</xref>), were not associated with any of our outcome variables in our final, reduced, multivariate models. It is important to note that sexual refusal self-efficacy was moderately correlated with sexual attitudes and weakly correlated with all other pyschosocial variables at the individual level. Further, the means of these multiscale measures were high, suggesting that the Thai youth in our sample generally ascribe to prosocial attitudes and tend to regard HIV infection as a serious disease. The sample also has very low levels of sexual involvement. It may be that these psychosocial processing variables tend to have greater impact for more sexually active populations, who experience greater variation in sexual attitudes and behavior.</p>
<p>The practice of Buddhism was found in bivariate analysis to be associated with all three of our outcomes including intentions, precoital behaviors, and ever having sex and was weakly correlated with all other predictor variables at the individual level. However when included in a multivariate model with only the significant variables from the individual level, Buddhism was significantly associated with only precoital behaviors. Because its beta coefficient and significance value was not as high as refusal self-efficacy, it was not included as the individual level characteristic in the full or reduced multivariate models predicting precoital behaviors. Finally, at the school level, school attachment was a significant protective factor for intentions to have sex but was not significantly associated with precoital behaviors or ever having sex.</p>
<sec id="section15-0272431610393248">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>A significant limitation of this analysis was a lack of power to assess correlates of ever having sex, given the small sample of respondents who were sexually active. The data were also cross-sectional; therefore we can only assert correlations between the independent and dependent variables not causality. Finally, because of the strong taboos that exist in Thai culture for discussing sexual behaviors, there may have been some level of social desirable responding among adolescents when completing surveys. To the extent possible, the research team tried to minimize the effects of social desirable responding by having youth self-administer the survey using laptop computers with ACASI software.</p>
<p>In summary, our data suggests that parent’s disapproval about sex and exposure to sexually explicit media are robust competing risk and protective factors for sexual behaviors and intentions among Thai adolescents. Our findings of the potential protective affect of parental disapproval on engaging in precoital behaviors, formulating sexual intentions, and initiating sex, are consistent with earlier research conducted in the United States among inner-city families indicating that parental attitudes towards sex can serve to inhibit engagement in early sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272431610393248">Dilorio, Dudley, Soet, &amp; McCarty, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272431610393248">Paikoff, 1995</xref>). Both Western and international studies have documented the association of exposure to sexually explicit media and permissive sexual attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272431610393248">Peter &amp; Valkenburg, 2008</xref>) and early sexual initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431610393248">Braun-Courville &amp; Rojas, 2009</xref>). Future longitudinal studies should examine the complex relationships between these competing risk and protective factors and HIV-prevention interventions should consider their potential influence when adapting HIV-prevention intervention for Thai youth.</p>
