<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to assess if a specific personality structure and personality profile might be observed in Africa comparing data from four African regions (<italic>N</italic> = 1,774) with data from Burkina Faso (<italic>N</italic> = 717) and Switzerland (<italic>N</italic> = 1,787), according to the Five-Factor Model (FFM). A total of 4,278 participants completed the French version of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) made up of 240 items. Concerning the structure, a recombination of Extraversion and Agreeableness in two factors labeled Love and Dominance was observed before targeted factor analyses. After Procrustes rotation, the Swiss factorial structure replicated well in Africa. The only specificity was that the Excitement Seeking facet scale loaded consistently on the Openness factor in Africa. However, personality structures obtained in different African regions were not more similar among themselves than they were to the structure found in Switzerland. Finally, multigroup confirmatory factor analyses suggested that the NEO-PI-R dimensions reached configural and metric invariances, but not scalar invariance, indicating that the mean personality profiles might be difficult to compare. Thus, this study showed no evidence for a unique pan-African structure.</p>

<body>
<p>The Five-Factor Model (FFM) of personality is a hierarchical model assuming that five broad domains, named Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, adequately map personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022022112468943">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1999</xref>). These five domains, each subdivided into six facets or traits, and their structure are highly heritable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022112468943">McCrae, Jang, Livesley, Riemann, &amp; Angleitner, 2001</xref>). Several authors claim that personality should be a universal feature of individuals and that its structure should be stable across languages and cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022112468943">Allik &amp; McCrae, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022112468943">Rossier, Dahourou, &amp; McCrae, 2005</xref>). Most cross-cultural studies in personality psychology have shown that the FFM is well replicated across cultures. Nonetheless, African cultures are usually underrepresented in personality research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022112468943">Rossier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022022112468943">Rossier et al., 2008</xref>). The first aim of this study was to investigate if a pan-African personality structure might be observed in a large African sample using the FFM. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022022112468943">McCrae and Costa (1999)</xref> suggest that mean levels might be affected by culture and might thus vary in predictable ways. More precisely, mean trait levels should be similar in culture separated by a small cultural distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022112468943">Allik &amp; McCrae, 2004</xref>). Thus, the second aim of this study was to investigate the level of invariance of the FFM dimensions in order to assess if mean trait levels can really be compared and if a specific pan-African personality profile, comparing data from four African regions with large samples from Burkina Faso and Switzerland, might be identified.</p>

<title>FFM Structure Across Cultures</title>
<p>Most cross-cultural studies done on the FFM personality structure demonstrated that this model is well replicated across languages and cultures. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022112468943">Rolland (2002)</xref> reanalyzed data from 16 countries and found that Neuroticism, Openness, and Conscientiousness were highly replicable across cultures and that Extraversion and Agreeableness varied slightly across cultures. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022022112468943">McCrae et al. (2005a)</xref> analyzed the stability of the FFM personality structure using observed-rating personality data from 50 cultures representing six continents. Factor analyses within cultures showed that the FFM personality structure was replicated in most cultures and was recognizable in all. However, for Africa, the congruence coefficients were globally lower compared with those found for other countries (mean total congruence coefficient = .85). In fact, the total congruence was high for Burkina Faso (&gt; .90); borderline (.90 ≥ congruence coefficient &gt; .80) for Botswana, Ethiopia, Morocco, and Uganda; and poor (≤ .80) for Nigeria. However, the sample size for each country was relatively small (≤ 207) and the quality of the data seemed lower for these countries. The internal consistencies of these countries (except for Burkina Faso) were also among the lowest in the study (especially for Openness). Globally, the factor structure replicated better in Western cultures.</p>
<p>Only a few studies, whose aim was to assess the replicability of the FFM in Africa, were conducted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022112468943">Heaven, Connors, and Stones (1994)</xref> were not able to replicate the FFM in a small South African sample using a list of 112 adjectives. The use of an English version might partly explain this result. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022112468943">Heuchert, Parker, Stumpf, and Myburgh (2000)</xref> also used an English version of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022112468943">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992</xref>) in a South African sample and observed that the five-factor structure was clearly replicated. However, this replication was much weaker in a very small group of Black students. In Zimbabwe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022022112468943">Piedmont, Bain, McCrae, and Costa (2002)</xref> used a Shona translation of the NEO-PI-R and observed relatively good replication of the five-factor structure even if they acknowledged problems with their translation. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022112468943">Rossier et al. (2005)</xref> used a well-validated French version of the NEO-PI-R in a large sample from Burkina Faso and also found that the FFM was well replicated in that cultural setting.</p>
<p>Several studies conducted in collectivistic cultures showed, before targeted factor analyses, a variation in the orientation of the interpersonal domain (Extraversion and Agreeableness). Regarding Extraversion and Agreeableness, these two dimensions recombined in two factors, labeled Affiliation and Surgency by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022022112468943">Katigbak, Church, and Akamine (1996)</xref>, and Love and Submission by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022112468943">McCrae et al. (1998)</xref>. The Affiliation or Love factor is usually defined by Warmth (E1), Gregariousness (E2), Positive Emotions (E6), Trust (A1), Altruism (A3), and Tender-Mindedness (A6) facet scales. The Surgency or Submission factor usually contains Assertiveness (E3), Activity (E4), and Excitement Seeking (E5) with Straightforwardness (A2), Compliance (A4), and Modesty (A5). Such reorientations have been reported for Burkina Faso (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022112468943">Rossier et al., 2005</xref>), Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022022112468943">Piedmont &amp; Chae, 1997</xref>), and the Philippines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022022112468943">Katigbak et al., 1996</xref>). However, these reorientations were not systematically observed in collectivistic cultures. For instance, in Korea or the Philippines, a reorientation was observed in one sample but not in another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022022112468943">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022112468943">McCrae et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, in China, which can be considered a collectivist country, the Extraversion and Agreeableness factors clearly emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022022112468943">McCrae, Zonderman, Costa, Bond, &amp; Paunonen, 1996</xref>). The orientation of the interpersonal domain might be related with cultural aspects such as collectivism, but the reliability of this reorientation according to culture should be further analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022022112468943">Konstabel, Realo, &amp; Kallasmaa, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Some studies explored the source of variations in the structure of personality traits across cultures at the facet level. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022022112468943">Konstabel et al. (2002)</xref> analyzed the different degree of association between Impulsiveness (N5), Extraversion, and Conscientiousness in 18 cultures. They observed that Impulsiveness and Extraversion were more strongly related in cultures scoring low in Conscientiousness and high in Individualism and Openness. However, in the only African sample of their study, Impulsiveness loaded primarily on Neuroticism, as expected, and a negative secondary loading on Conscientiousness was observed. The same pattern was also found in Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe in following studies. In Burkina Faso, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022112468943">Rossier et al. (2005)</xref> observed that the Excitement Seeking (E5) facet loaded primarily on Openness, which replicated earlier findings from a study conducted in Zimbabwe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022022112468943">Piedmont et al., 2002</xref>). However, this pattern was not observed in a previous study based on a South African sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022112468943">Heuchert et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we examined the overall replicability of the FFM in a large African sample, with participants from different African regions, using a well-validated personality measurement. The minor deviation from the normative structure, found in previous studies, might reflect a common African variation of the structure. It can also be hypothesized that this variation might simply be due to error. For this reason, we examined if the reorientation of the interpersonal domain and the structural difference concerning Excitement Seeking (E5) might be considered as a common African small variation of the FFM structure. Finally, we compared the structure found in the four African regions to the Burkinabè and Swiss structures, extracted from large samples, to determine whether a pan-African personality structure might be identified or not. If a specific pan-African FFM personality structure exists, then the structure found in the four African regions should be more similar to the Burkinabè structure compared to the Swiss one. In our study, the Burkinabè and Swiss samples were used as reference samples, because they were the largest of the study.</p>

<title>Mean Personality Trait Levels Across Cultures</title>
<p>Comparison of mean personality trait levels across cultures is still a controversial issue. For some authors, cross-cultural mean comparisons of aggregated scores, notably for mean personality traits, should be interpreted with caution as they can be influenced by several factors that do not result from cultural differences, such as the reference-group effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022112468943">Ashton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022112468943">Heine, Buchtel, &amp; Norenzayan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022112468943">Heine, Lehman, Peng, &amp; Greenholtz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022022112468943">Oishi &amp; Roth, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022022112468943">Perugini &amp; Richetin, 2007</xref>). However, a recent study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022022112468943">Mõttus et al. (2012)</xref> suggested that the reference-group effect does not explain mean-level differences on personality traits across cultures. Moreover, mean-level comparison should only be achieved when scalar or full-scale equivalence has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022112468943">Duarte &amp; Rossier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022022112468943">Poortinga, van de Vijver, &amp; van Hemert, 2002</xref>). Scalar equivalence refers to one of the three types of measurement equivalence, with configural and metric equivalences, which has to be reached for achieving reliable cross-cultural mean comparisons. Measurement equivalence (or invariance) refers to “whether or not, under different conditions of observing and studying phenomena, measurement operations yield measures of the same attribute” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022112468943">Horn &amp; McArdle, 1992</xref>, p. 117). For comparing means in cross-cultural research, it implies, at least, (a) that the factorial structure of a concept measured by an instrument similarly replicates in several groups (configural equivalence), (b) that the scales used have the same metric across the groups (metric invariance), and (c) that the scales have a same origin (or zero point) across the groups (scalar equivalence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022022112468943">Steenkamp &amp; Baumgartner, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies showed that personality measurement might not reach scalar equivalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022022112468943">Poortinga &amp; van Hemert, 2001</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022112468943">McCrae (2002)</xref> claimed that comparisons of NEO-PI-R scores across cultures led to meaningful results. Country FFM personality scores correlated with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022112468943">Hofstede’s (2001)</xref> indices. For example, Neuroticism correlated with Uncertainty Avoidance and Masculinity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022112468943">Allik and McCrae (2004)</xref> analyzed data from five continents (<italic>N</italic> = 27,965) using hierarchical cluster analysis to identify similarities according to cultures in terms of mean personality profiles. They observed that personality profiles were geographically organized. Countries separated by a small cultural distance had similar personality profiles: European and American cultures contrasted with Asian and African cultures. The European and American cultures were higher in Extraversion and Openness to Experience and lower in Agreeableness than people from Asian and African cultures.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022112468943">McCrae et al. (2005b)</xref> achieved a comparison of mean personality trait levels in a large sample from 51 cultures and observed systematic differences, with Europeans and Americans generally scoring higher in Extraversion than Asians and Africans, replicating, thus, previous results by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022112468943">Allik and McCrae (2004)</xref>. Moreover, they observed several correlations between culture-level personality scores and other culture-level variables as values, beliefs, or economic indicators. For example, Extraversion correlated positively with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022112468943">Hofstede’s (2001)</xref> Individualism dimension, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022022112468943">Inglehart and Norris’s (2003)</xref> Self-Expression value, negatively with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022022112468943">Leung and Bond’s (2004)</xref> Fate Control social axiom, and positively with the gross domestic product per capita or the human development index. Based on these results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022112468943">McCrae et al. (2005b)</xref> claimed that a rough scalar equivalence of the NEO-PI-R factors and facets was supported. More precisely, they do not deny the possibility that items might not be strictly equivalent across cultures, but they make the assumption that the differences, at the item level, are random and cancelled out at the scale level. Nevertheless, this appears not to be the case, as shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022112468943">Church et al. (2011)</xref> in a study conducted in the United States, the United Mexican States, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022112468943">Rossier et al. (2005)</xref>, comparing data from Burkina Faso and Switzerland, failed in confirming several of their hypotheses based on culture-level scores on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022112468943">Hofstede’s (2001)</xref> dimensions. More precisely, they observed that, unexpectedly, Burkinabè scored higher on Neuroticism and lower on Agreeableness than Swiss and that, as expected, the former scored lower on Extraversion and Openness and higher on Conscientiousness than the latter. In fact, the mean differences between the two countries were relatively small despite the supposed large cultural distance. The mean difference was slightly higher for Openness, which seemed rather less stable across cultures.</p>
<p>The comparison of mean personality traits across cultures, obtained with different instrument, led usually to mixed results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022112468943">McCrae et al. (2005b)</xref> reported a significant culture-level correlation between Neuroticism scores, assessed with the NEO-PI-R and with the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022022112468943">Lynn &amp; Martin, 1995</xref>). No significant correlation between Extraversion scores was obtained with these two personality measurements. Moreover, no significant culture-level correlations were observed between the NEO-PI-R scores and the EPQ scores, using data reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022022112468943">van Hemert, Van de Vijver, Poortinga, and Georgas (2002)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022112468943">Aluja, Rossier, García, and Verardi (2005)</xref> analyzed the pattern of mean level differences in a Spanish and a Swiss samples using the NEO-PI-R and the 16PF5 with the expectation of a similar pattern. Unexpectedly, Spaniards scored lower than Swiss on both the Anxiety facet scale of the NEO-PI-R and the Emotional Stability primary factor of the 16PF5, which are known for being negatively correlated. The authors suggested that these inconsistent results “could be due to the poor cross-cultural replicability of the 16PF5” (p. 61). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022022112468943">Rossier et al. (2007)</xref> reported data from a large sample including China, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States and using the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ). They also observed discrepancies between the culture-level mean personality scores obtained using the NEO-PI-R and the ZKPQ. In this study, these discrepancies could not be attributed to the poor cross-cultural replicability of the factor structure of the personality measurement used. Similar results were found in a large international study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022022112468943">Schmitt et al. (2007)</xref> and including samples from North and South Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Discrepancies were found at culture-level scores between the Big Five Inventory (BFI) and the EPQ. The correlation between the two Extraversion scales was low. Moreover, correlations between Agreeableness and Openness scales of the BFI and the NEO-PI-R were also low. The authors explained these discrepancies by the large cultural distance between their different samples and suggested that Western and non-Western participants might have a slightly different answer strategy. All these studies suggest that culture-level mean personality score differences are small and might not be consistently observed using different personality measurements. This might be due either to the fact that these measurements do not assess exactly the same dimensions or to the fact that the differences are too small to be reliably assessed.</p>
<p>Two recent studies investigated metric and scalar invariances across culture of personality measurements using either the item response theory or multigroup confirmatory factor analyses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022022112468943">Johnson, Spinath, Krueger, Angleitner, and Riemann (2008)</xref> used the item response theory in order to test the scalar equivalence of the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire in German and American samples. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022112468943">Church et al. (2011)</xref> studied the metric and scalar invariances of the NEO-PI-R in American, Mexican, and Filipino samples using multigroup confirmatory factor analyses. Both studies concluded that scalar invariance was not reached, explaining maybe the observed discrepancies in terms of mean scores when using different instruments measuring similar personality dimensions.</p>
<p>Thus, the last aim of this research was to analyze the level of invariance of the FFM dimensions in order to assess if mean trait levels can really be compared and if an alternative pan-African personality profile, different from the Swiss one, might be identified. The level of invariance of the FFM dimensions will be analyzed using multigroup confirmatory factor analyses. Cross-cultural mean comparisons are possible only when measurement invariance is well established across groups.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The sample included 4,278 participants from nine French-speaking African countries and Switzerland (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022112468943">Table 1</xref>). The Burkinabè (<italic>N</italic> = 717) and Swiss (<italic>N</italic> = 1,787) samples were used as reference samples. The other African samples were grouped according to four regions: North Africa included samples from Algeria (<italic>N</italic> = 203) and Tunisia (<italic>N</italic> = 240); West Africa included samples from Benin (<italic>N</italic> = 210), Mali (<italic>N</italic> = 240), and Senegal (<italic>N</italic> = 238); Central Africa included samples from Democratic Republic of Congo (<italic>N</italic> = 220) and Republic of Congo (<italic>N</italic> = 187); and Mauritius was considered as a region by itself (<italic>N</italic> = 236). When not used as a reference group in the analyses, Burkina Faso was included in the West African sample. Note that French is an official language in all countries except in Algeria and Tunisia, where it was formerly some years ago. Thus, all educated people in French-speaking Africa are fluent in French.</p>

<title>NEO-PI-R</title>
<p>The validated French-language version of the NEO-PI-R was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022022112468943">Rolland, 1998</xref>). This self-rating questionnaire of 240 items measures the five domains of the FFM: Neuroticism (N), Extraversion (E), Openness to Experience (O), Agreeableness (A), and Conscientiousness (C). Each domain is made up of six facets. Responses are made on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to <italic>strongly agree</italic>.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Each African national research group was in charge of collecting data from about 60 women and 60 men aged from 18 to 25 years and the same gender quota from participants aged 26 years or older. The data were collected from a larger amount of participants in Burkina Faso and Switzerland to create two reference samples. The quality of data was assessed in our samples using the criteria suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022112468943">Costa and McCrae (1992)</xref>: More than 40 missing responses by questionnaire, repetitive responses (e.g., more than nine consecutive <italic>disagree</italic> responses), and acquiescent responses. According to these criteria, 13 participants were eliminated because they had more than 40 missing responses, 17 participants disagreed consecutively more than nine times, and 509 participants gave acquiescent responses. However, acquiescence might be considered as a cultural communication style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022022112468943">Smith, 2004</xref>). For this reason, these participants were not eliminated, and an acquiescent index was computed using the method suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022022112468943">Van Herk, Poortinga, and Verhallen (2004)</xref>. To compute this index, the number of positive answers (<italic>agree</italic> and <italic>strongly agree</italic>) was counted and subtracted to the number of negative answers (<italic>disagree</italic> and <italic>strongly disagree</italic>). The resulting number was then divided by the number of items (i.e., 240). The acquiescence index ranged from -1.00, indicating a tendency to answer more negatively than positively to the items, to 1.00, indicating a tendency to answer more positively than negatively to the items.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In the Swiss sample, the internal reliability coefficients, calculated with Cronbach alphas (raw alphas), for the five domains ranged from .87 to .92 (<italic>Mdn</italic> = .90) and from .53 to .82 for the 30 facets (<italic>Mdn</italic> = .73). In North Africa, the alphas ranged from .79 to .88 (<italic>Mdn</italic> = .82) for the five domains and from .34 to .69 (<italic>Mdn</italic> = .60) for the facets. In West Africa, the alphas ranged from .67 to .86 (<italic>Mdn</italic> = .78) for the five dimensions and from .23 to .62 (<italic>Mdn</italic> = .52) for the 30 facets. In Central Africa, the alphas ranged from .61 to .85 for the five dimensions (<italic>Mdn</italic> = .77) and from .13 to .57 (<italic>Mdn</italic> = .43) for the facets. In Mauritius, the alphas ranged from .80 to .91 (<italic>Mdn</italic> = .86) for the five dimensions and from .17 to .76 (<italic>Mdn</italic> = .63). As noted in previous studies, the alpha coefficients were slightly lower in Africa and, especially, for the facets O4 Actions (mean α = .30) and O6 Values (mean α = .31) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022022112468943">Piedmont et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022112468943">Rossier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022022112468943">Rossier et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Gender differences were analyzed in the African and Swiss samples. At the domain level, in North Africa, women scored significantly higher than men on Neuroticism, <italic>t</italic>(400) = 2.89, <italic>p</italic> = .004, <italic>d</italic> = .29, and Openness, <italic>t</italic>(404) = 2.17, <italic>p</italic> = .031, <italic>d</italic> = .21. In West Africa, women scored significantly higher than men on Neuroticism, <italic>t</italic>(1,216) = 4.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = .25. In Central Africa, women scored significantly higher than men on Neuroticism, <italic>t</italic>(323) = 2.91, <italic>p</italic> = .004, <italic>d</italic> = .32, and Extraversion, <italic>t</italic>(322) = 2.48, <italic>p</italic> = .014, <italic>d</italic> = .28. In Mauritius, no gender differences were observed at the domain level. In Switzerland, women scored significantly higher on Neuroticism, <italic>t</italic>(1,744) = 7.78, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .00, <italic>d</italic> = .37, Openness, <italic>t</italic>(1,739) = 4.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = .22, and Agreeableness, <italic>t</italic>(1,743) = 10.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = .48. Gender differences were slightly more marked in Switzerland than in the African regions. The correlations between age and the five domains were conducted in the four African regions and the Swiss sample. Age negatively correlated with Neuroticism (<italic>Mdn</italic> = −.21), and positively with Agreeableness (<italic>Mdn</italic> = .23) and Conscientiousness (<italic>Mdn</italic> = .17) in each of the African regions. Significant correlations between age and Extraversion (<italic>Mdn</italic> = −.08) have been observed in West Africa and Mauritius. Age correlated negatively with Openness (<italic>Mdn</italic> = −.19) in North Africa, West Africa, and Mauritius. In the Swiss sample, age correlated negatively with Neuroticism (<italic>r</italic> = −.23), Extraversion (<italic>r</italic> = −.23), and Openness (<italic>r</italic> = −.27) and positively with Agreeableness (<italic>r</italic> = .19) and Conscientiousness (<italic>r</italic> = .21).</p>
<p>To summarize, the alphas were similar but lower in Africa than in Switzerland, especially for two facets, Actions and Values, of the Openness dimensions. Gender differences and correlations with age were similar in Africa and Switzerland. Note that gender differences were slightly lower in Africa. Additionally, concerning acquiescence, the indexes calculated were generally low. The value for the Swiss index was higher (.23) than for the African ones (North Africa = .18, West Africa = .22, Central Africa = .18, Mauritius = .20). Differences between regions were significant, <italic>F</italic>(4, 4,277) = 39.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, but the effect size of these differences was small (η<sup>2</sup> = .04). This result is consistent with other ones found in Africa by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022022112468943">Verardi et al. (2010)</xref>, suggesting that acquiescence does not explain much of the mean score differences on personality traits.</p>
<sec id="section9-0022022112468943">
<title>FFM Structure Across Cultures</title>
<p>Principal component analysis with varimax rotation of the 30 NEO-PI-R facets was conducted for Switzerland. Cattell’s scree test suggested to retain five factors, which explain up to 58.8% of the variance. The first seven eigenvalues were 5.38, 4.32, 3.71, 2.56, 1.68, 1.05, and 0.95. A one-to-one association between the five factors, obtained by principal component analysis, and a priori domains was observed. Factor I correlated with Neuroticism (<italic>r</italic> = .96), Factor II with Conscientiousness (<italic>r</italic> = .95), Factor III with Agreeableness (<italic>r</italic> = .95), Factor IV with Openness (<italic>r</italic> = .97), and Factor V with Extraversion (<italic>r</italic> = .89). To determine if the five-factor structure could be replicated in the African data set, principal component analysis with varimax rotation of the 30 NEO-PI-R facets was computed. Cattell’s scree test suggested to retain four factors, which explain up to 45.8% of the variance or five factors explaining up to 50.4% of the variance. The first seven eigenvalues were 5.80, 3.42, 2.63, 1.88, 1.39, 1.19, and 0.98. However, to evaluate the replicability of the FFM, the five-factor solution was considered. Factors related to Neuroticism (<italic>r</italic> = .88), Openness (<italic>r</italic> = .89), and Conscientiousness (<italic>r</italic> = .89) (these correlations were computed on the basis of unweighted raw domain scores) clearly emerged, but Agreeableness and Extraversion were recombined in two factors that can be interpreted as Love versus Hate, and Submission versus Dominance.</p>
<p>Finally, to determine whether the FFM would replicate in the African data set, an orthogonal procrustes rotation was computed to assess the cross-cultural replicability of the structures in Africa and Switzerland, using the Swiss loading matrix as the target matrix (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022112468943">Table 2</xref>). The total congruence coefficient was of .96. Only one facet (E5 Excitement seeking) did not reach a congruence coefficient higher than that of 95% of rotations from random data. The structures found in the African regions were then compared with the Swiss and the Burkinabè structures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022022112468943">Table 3</xref>). Using the Burkinabè matrix as the target, the total congruence coefficients ranged from .89 to .96. When the Swiss matrix was used as the target, the total congruence coefficients ranged from .88 to .96.</p>

<p>According to the results, the overall FFM structure was clearly replicated in the African regions and Switzerland. However, as found in previous studies, we observed a reorientation of the interpersonal domain and a structural difference concerning the Excitement Seeking (E5) facet. The comparison of the structures of the four African regions with the Burkinabè and Swiss ones did not show the existence of a specific pan-African structure different from the FFM personality structure. In fact, the structures found in the four African regions were not more similar to the Burkinabè one compared to the Swiss one.</p>

<p>Structural equation modeling, more precisely multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022022112468943">Jöreskog, 1971</xref>), was used to analyze measurement invariance. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022022112468943">Steenkamp and Baumgartner (1998)</xref>, mean scores of different groups can be compared only when configural, metrical, and scalar invariances are reached, meaning that the factorial structure, the metrics (or the scale intervals), and the zero point of the scale are the same across different groups. In statistical terms, configural equivalence involves testing whether the items or facets have acceptable loadings on the relevant facet or domain without any cross-cultural constrain on the loadings or intercepts. For testing metric equivalence, factor loadings are constrained to be equal across cultures, but the intercepts are freely estimated for each culture. For testing scalar equivalence, factor loadings and intercepts are both constrained to be equal across cultures.</p>
<p>To increase the fit of our models, modification indices were computed for possible covariation between error terms using Amos 7.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022022112468943">Arbuckle, 2006</xref>). Covariation associated with a modification indice equal or higher than 50 were considered for possible modification of the model. A maximum of one covariation between error terms of facets at the domain level and of two between items at the facet level was introduced in the models. In order to test configural, metric, and scalar equivalence across Swiss and African samples, we computed multigroup confirmatory factor analysis using <italic>M</italic>plus 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022022112468943">Mùthen &amp; Mùthen, 2010</xref>) and based on the Satorra-Bentler’s maximum likelihood mean adjusted method, which allow us to compute a better approximation of the χ<sup>2</sup> under nonnormality. Five models were computed to assess measurement equivalence according to the five personality domains. Moreover, 30 models, at the facet level, were computed for the same purpose (for an example of an application of this procedure with a personality inventory, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022022112468943">Rossier, Hansenne, Baudin, &amp; Morizot, 2012</xref>). The following fit indices were considered for each model: the Satorra-Bentler χ<sup>2</sup>, the comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). Concerning CFI and TLI, values above .90 suggest good fit. For RMSEA, values under or equal to .05 suggest low error of approximation, values between .05 and .08 suggest acceptable error of approximation, and values equal or above .10 bad error of approximation. Finally, values under .08 for SRMR indicate a well-fitting model. These fit indices interpretation were based on the guidelines established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022022112468943">Hu and Bentler (1999)</xref>.</p>
<p>As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022022112468943">Table 4</xref>, at the domain level, Neuroticism and Conscientiousness reached a high level of configural and metrical invariances. The same result was noticed for Openness and Agreeableness, although the values for some indices were borderline. It usually concerned the TLI. For Extraversion, results suggested that this dimension did not strictly reach configural and metric invariances, even if the fit indices were close to what would be expected for an acceptable model. Finally, none of the five dimensions did reach an acceptable level of scalar invariance. For facet scales, results varied from one dimension to the other. Values largely below the cutoff criterion were observed for seven facets concerning configural invariance: Activity (E4), Excitement Seeking (E5), Positive Emotions (E6), Actions (O4), Values (O6), Competence (C1), and Modesty (A5). Regarding metric invariance, these facets, as well as Self-Consciousness (N4) and Impulsiveness (N5), did not reach acceptable values. Additionally, none of the facets attained acceptable levels of scalar invariance.</p>

<p>To summarize, most of the NEO-PI-R domains and facets reached configural and metric invariances, explaining, for example, why correlations between personality traits and demographic variables remain stable across cultures. Nevertheless, none of the domains and facets attained scalar invariance, suggesting that mean-level score comparisons are not reliable and might be difficult to interpret. For this reason, mean-level scores at both domain and facet levels were not compared in this study.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>At the descriptive level, we observed that the internal consistencies were lower in the African regions than in Switzerland. More particularly, the alphas of the facets Actions (O4) and Values (O6) were low. These results are similar to those previously reported and confirm that internal consistencies are lower in collectivistic cultures than in individualistic ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022022112468943">Piedmont et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022112468943">Rossier et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022022112468943">2008</xref>). Concerning gender differences, they were larger in Switzerland than in the African regions. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that gender differences are more marked in Western cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022112468943">Rossier et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, regarding the correlations between age and personality across cultures, most results were similar to the pattern usually observed in Western countries. However, as observed in Zimbabwe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022022112468943">Piedmont et al., 2002</xref>), Extraversion was unrelated to age in North and Central Africa, and the correlations were small in West Africa and Mauritius. Surprisingly, Openness did not significantly correlate with age in Central Africa.</p>
<p>Likewise, in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022112468943">Heuchert et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022022112468943">McCrae et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022022112468943">Piedmont et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022112468943">Rossier et al., 2005</xref>), the FFM personality structure was clearly replicated in Switzerland and in the four African regions. In the African sample, a recombination of the Extraversion and Agreeableness facets into two factors labeled Love and Dominance were observed. This result is consistent with previous studies done in non-Western cultures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022022112468943">Church &amp; Katigbak, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022112468943">Rossier et al., 2005</xref>). As also observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022022112468943">Katigbak et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022112468943">McCrae et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022112468943">Rossier et al., 2005</xref>), the Extraversion facets of Warmth, Gregariousness, and Positive Emotions combined with the Agreeableness facets of Trust, Altruism, and Tender-Mindedness to define the Love versus Hate factor. In the same way as for Extraversion, Agreeableness facets of Straightforwardness, Compliance, and Modesty combined with the Extraversion facets of Assertiveness, Activity, and Excitement Seeking to define the Submission versus Dominance factor. Additionally, the Excitement Seeking facet (E5) loaded on the Openness dimension in Africa and on the Extraversion factor in Switzerland as already observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022022112468943">Piedmont et al. (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022112468943">Rossier et al. (2005)</xref>. Finally, the total congruences obtained by procrustes rotations were all above the threshold of .85. Despite the two specificities mentioned above in the African samples, the personality structure of the African regions was not more similar to the Burkinabè structure in comparison to the Swiss one. This result was also confirmed by the fact that configural invariance was reached across regions. According to these results, no evidence of a specific pan-African personality structure, different from the structure postulated by the FFM, was found.</p>
<p>The evaluation of measurement invariance of the domains and the facet scales, using multigroup confirmatory factor analyses, showed that Neuroticism, Openness, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and a large majority of the facet scales seemed to reach configural and metric invariances. Results for the Extraversion domain were less convincing, particularly for metric and scalar invariances. The fact that Extraversion and some facets of the NEO-PI-R did not clearly attain metric invariance suggests that scale intervals are not the same across cultures. This could partly explain why the impact on personality dimensions of some demographic variables, such as age or gender, was slightly different depending on the culture or region. Although the personality structure measured by the NEO-PI-R was to a great extent replicated across cultures, acceptable levels of scalar invariance were neither reached at the domain, nor at the facet levels. Consequently, mean personality profiles were not compared across the studied samples. At a more practical level, these results also imply that specific norms should be established for each country or region to use the French version of the NEO-PI-R in clinical or counseling settings in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022112468943">Duarte &amp; Rossier, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The absence of complete measurement equivalence could be due to several methodological biases, some of them being specific to this particular study (e.g., a sampling bias) and some other being specific to the measurement instrument used. The first apparent bias related to the instrument used in this study is that it was developed in a specific culture. In another word, it induced the application of an <italic>imposed-etic</italic> approach in the assessment of cross-cultural differences. As underlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022022112468943">van de Vijver and Leung (2001)</xref>, “imported personality instruments are more likely to run into bias problems because they may be inadequate in tapping the underlying personality constructs outside their culture of origin …” (p. 1012). This statement does not suggest that personality structure, in terms of domains and facets, as postulated by the Five Factor Theory of Personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022022112468943">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1997</xref>), is not universal. Rather, the lack of scalar invariance implies that universal norms cannot be developed for the NEO-PI-R, and such an instrument is not adequate to evaluate cross-cultural mean differences of personality profiles, even when a single language version is used. Finally, the Five Factor Theory of Personality suggests that the expression of personality dimensions, or of the basic tendencies (in terms of behaviors), is mediated by the characteristic adaptations. These adaptations are influenced by external factors considered as moderators of the expression of basic tendencies in behaviors. By such a statement, latent traits, assessed by screening usual behaviors, should also be affected by external influences including the cultural setting. This could imply that it might be very difficult to develop a “culture-free” personality measurement reaching scalar invariance. Consequently, non-invariant-biased items may provide information about true cultural differences in the manifestation of the associated characteristic adaptations or dispositions.</p>
<p>To develop a personality measurement for a specific culture, a combined etic and emic approach can be used, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022112468943">Cheung, van de Vijver, and Leong (2011)</xref>. Such an approach was used for developing the Chinese Personality Assessment Inventory (CPAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022022112468943">Cheung et al., 1996</xref>) that includes an Interpersonal Relatedness dimension that seems to be specific to this cultural setting. Additionally, it would be interesting to further study the interaction between culture and personality by conducting cross-cultural research using several personality inventories, developed in different cultural settings. In this perspective, a possible way to develop personality measurements that might possibly reach higher level of measurement invariance across culture would be to use a cross-cultural and multicentric approach. The Basic Traits Inventory (BTI) can be taken as an example of an instrument developed using such an approach. This inventory was simultaneously developed in two South African ethnic groups (Black and White South Africans) using two official language versions: Afrikaans and English. It has been shown that this instrument reaches a high level of measurement equivalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022022112468943">Taylor &amp; de Bruin, 2006</xref>). More specifically, (1) Neuroticism, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness clearly reached scalar invariance, and (2) Extraversion reached configural and metric invariances, but the fit indices were slightly under or below the usual cutoff values for scalar invariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022022112468943">Rossier, Zecca, Antonietti, &amp; de Bruin, 2010</xref>). In a same perspective, the South African Personality Inventory project (SAPI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022022112468943">Nel et al., 2012</xref>) is an example of the application of a multicentric and mixed-method approach. The SAPI project aims at developing a personality inventory simultaneously in the 11 official South African languages taking into account relevant imported personality clusters and culture-specific personality patterns.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned biases, another limitation can be raised in light of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022022112468943">Van de Vijver and Leung’s (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022022112468943">2001)</xref> classification of biases in cross-cultural research. These authors make a distinction between three categories of biases. The first one, named <italic>construct bias</italic>, referring to the dissimilarity of a construct in several cultures, was actually not observed in this current study. Indeed, the five personality dimensions are well replicated in the Swiss, and the African samples and the relations between the dimensions and the facets are very similar. The second one, <italic>method biases</italic>, referring to sampling and other problems such as the influence of response styles, were this time present. First, African data were collected using a French validated measurement instrument, and French is usually not the first spoken language of the current studied population. This could partly explain the often poor quality of African data observed in studies including African samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022112468943">Rossier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022022112468943">Terracciano et al., 2005</xref>). In our study, the convenience samples included individuals coming from a more educated urban population that was not representative of the majority of the inhabitants. It would be interesting to further study the relationship between culture and personality in an African context using an instrument based on an indigenous language, allowing us to consider population from rural areas. The last type of bias mentioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022022112468943">Van de Vijver and Leung (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022022112468943">2001)</xref> is the <italic>item bias (differential item functioning)</italic>, referencing, for example, poor translation or inaccurate uses of items in some cultural samples. In our study, the poor-observed scalar invariance might be a direct consequence of such bias. For this reason, we should question whether or not scalar invariance is a realistic goal for personality inventories. This could be done by comparing, across culturally representative samples, the stability of a large set of items from different instruments.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study showed that the FFM structure tends to replicate well in Africa, confirming that the model and its underlying theory might be universal. Even if some culture specificities were observed (recombination of Extraversion and Agreeableness in two factors labeled Love and Dominance; Excitement Seeking facet scale loading consistently on Openness), we did not find a specific pan-African personality structure. Finally, mean personality profiles were not compared as domains and facet scales of the NEO-PI-R did not reach scalar invariance. Thus, further research needs to be done to study the relevance of the development of a “culture-free” personality inventory, using a variety of instruments or adopting a multicentric approach. If scalar invariance were not reached with such methodologies, this would imply that the expression of personality traits would be systematically moderated by the environment.</p>
