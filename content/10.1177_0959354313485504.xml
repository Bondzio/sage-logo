<abstract>
<p>In a recently published major article in the <italic>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</italic>, Daryl Bem (2011) made a strong claim for the existence of a parapsychological phenomenon called retroactive causation. Across nine experiments, aspects of stimuli were shown to correlate with participants’ responses provided before the stimuli were generated by the computer’s random generator. Early critical debates of these provocative findings have been focused on issues of statistical significance testing. Going beyond these issues, we argue that Bem’s research has three crucial shortcomings: (a) a lack of a theoretical explanation, (b) the possibility of selective filtering of empirical results, and (c) the confusion of the <italic>explanans</italic> and the <italic>explanandum</italic>. We propose that all three methodological principles should be rigorously applied during the journal review process and the communication of empirical findings in general.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although contemporary psychology has gained the status of a respected scientific discipline, thanks to a rich canon of sophisticated methods and a wealth of useful empirical evidence, the typical teething troubles of a young discipline are not fully overcome. The recent publication of a parapsychological article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354313485504">Daryl Bem (2011)</xref> in one of its most selective publication outlets, the <italic>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</italic> (<italic>JPSP</italic>), highlights the discipline’s struggle to apply its standards to provocative but unorthodox research. Dealing with presumed psi phenomena may be a challenge for the classical science of physics, but it constitutes a threat to psychology’s image as a young empirical science that aims to stand on firm nomological ground. This sort of insecurity may be justified because psychologists’ public image depends on their success in setting their field apart from anomalous phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354313485504">Lilienfeld, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Bem’s article on precognition and retroactive causation is ideally suited for a discussion of what we consider a critical developmental task for psychological science, namely, to explicate its common ground and its basic methodological assumptions. After a long and productive era of hunting and gathering empirical results, often driven by the success criterion of visibility, it is now essential to reclaim firm criteria of validity, which permit the separation of the wheat from the chaff in the growing heap of empirical evidence. This developmental task calls for a commonly shared methodology in which superordinate rules of scientific inquiry guide the selection of subordinate rules of statistics, psychometrics, and research design.</p>
<p>This article is organized as follows. We first present a summary of the findings that led Bem to infer the presence of an anomalous influence of future events on past cognition and affect. We then briefly review statistical arguments that have been made by supporters and critics of Bem’s thesis, but we note that a focus on statistics alone short-circuits a discussion of more essential questions of theory construction and evaluation. Beyond statistical significance testing, there lie three crucial methodological sources of weakness that cast Bem’s conclusions into question: (a) the lack of a theoretical explanation, (b) the possibility of selective filtering of empirical results, and (c) the confusion of the <italic>explanans</italic> with the <italic>explanandum</italic>. We conclude that all three methodological principles should be applied rigorously not only to Bem’s particular case but in the journal review process in general and to the way in which we interpret and communicate scientific results. Bem’s work, or work of similar surprise value, should not be singled out for particularly close scrutiny. Standards work best if applied blindly.</p>
<p>The editors of <italic>JPSP</italic> assert that the evaluation of Bem’s work followed ordinary routines. His article was to “be evaluated just as any other manuscript on the basis of rigorous peer review” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354313485504">Judd &amp; Gawronski, 2011</xref>, p. 406). We are not convinced that this goal was met. In our experience, a research report has little chance of being accepted for publication in a selective peer-reviewed journal if it has one of the following problems: a lack of a solid theoretical base from which to predict and explain the findings, weak or out-of-date statistical methods, unresolved contamination from selective inclusion, or a confusion of the <italic>explanans</italic> with the <italic>explanandum</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354313485504">Bem’s (2011)</xref> article has all of these problems, and we cannot agree with the view that it was evaluated with the same scrutiny and rigor as other research. We suspect that its publication attests to an insensitivity of the review system to certain methodological principles that we want to lay out in the remainder of this article.</p>

<title>Summary of the evidence for precognition</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354313485504">Bem’s (2011)</xref> article comprised nine experiments, the first two of which dealt with the precognitive detection of erotic stimuli (by clicking on one of two curtains on the screen before the computer’s random generator determined behind which curtain the stimuli would be hidden) and analogous precognitive avoidance of aversive stimuli. The next two pairs of experiments were devoted to retroactive priming (where matching vs. non-matching primes were randomly generated after the participants’ responses to the targets) and retroactive habituation or exposure effect (where participants’ preferences for one of two stimuli in a pair were biased toward the one stimulus that was later selected randomly for an extra subliminal exposure), respectively. Conversely, in one experiment on retroactive boredom induction, participants tended to avoid the one stimulus in a pair that was later selected for multiple (supraliminal) exposure. The last two experiments addressed retroactive recall facilitation (i.e., selective recall of items to be selected for rehearsal after the recall test).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0959354313485504">
<title>The limits of statistical theory evaluation</title>
<p>Not offering a theory of why all this should happen, Bem staked his claim on statistical grounds alone. Relying entirely on the elementary <italic>t</italic> test for analysis, he noted that in most experiments the evidence was improbable given the null hypothesis of randomness. Although some tests were not significant and although he resorted to one-sided tests and ad hoc moderators to wrest significance for others, Bem arrived at an informal meta-analytic argument that the combined odds were overwhelmingly low under the null.</p>
<p>With the statistical argument being so central to the claim, it was the first to be challenged in print. In an article published alongside Bem’s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354313485504">Wagenmakers, Wetzels, Borsboom, and van der Maas (2011)</xref> took the opportunity to point out that no appropriate α corrections had been conducted and that Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) in general is inappropriate and should be replaced by Bayesian estimates of the relative a posteriori odds of competing hypotheses (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354313485504">Krueger, 2001</xref>, or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959354313485504">Nickerson, 2000</xref>). Indeed, Bayesian <italic>t</italic> tests showed that Bem’s data lent more support to the null hypothesis than to the psi hypothesis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0959354313485504">
<title>Beyond data analysis: Fundamental weaknesses of the precognition hypothesis</title>
<p>We believe that neither NHST nor Bayesian statistics offers a definitive test of the truth or validity of a theory. The outcome of every statistical test is contingent not only on the truth of the guiding theory but also on a number of other boundary conditions (e.g., operational definitions of the theoretical variables, reliability of measures, assumptions about prior odds, etc.) that are distinct from the theory proper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354313485504">Lakatos, 1978</xref>). We are therefore reluctant to elaborate on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959354313485504">Wagenmakers et al.’s (2011)</xref> general critique of current methodology. Focusing on the original Bem article, we would rather take the debate back to the conceptual level by noting that Bem was not testing any articulated theory but merely seeking to provide an existence proof of an alleged phenomenon. With respect to such a modest goal—an existence proof that in and of itself pits any finding against the possibility of no finding—the pragmatic response of the Bayesian approach is to set a more conservative limit for false-positive results (Type I errors) than NHST, which means to increase the likelihood of false-negative results (Type II error).</p>
<p>Although scientific conservatism has its merits, it creates a barrier to bold and innovative research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354313485504">Jacob Cohen (e.g., 1992)</xref> educated psychologists on the dangers of underestimating Type II errors. Given the typical effect sizes, samples sizes, reliabilities, and complexities in behavioral research, the danger of many real effects going undetected can be expected to be very high. For psychological science to flourish, it appears to be of advantage to refrain from too high a threshold for innovation and unusual findings and to place more emphasis on controlled replication and improved design. From Bem’s point of view, finding small significant or almost significant effects across nine experiments should be challenging enough not to ignore the phenomenon but to evaluate its validity with regard to other scientific criteria than significance testing.</p>
<p>Ironically, however, the statistical conversation distracts from other weaknesses in Bem’s research that strike us as more fundamental. Let us now turn to these non-statistical issues, which are intrinsically related to the fundamental question of what distinguishes science from other cultural forms of knowledge and discourse (e.g., narratives, <italic>feuilleton</italic>, or common sense).</p>
<sec id="section4-0959354313485504">
<title>The logic of explanation</title>
<p>Consider the logical structure of Bem’s experiments. In an evaluative priming setting, participants first categorize evaluative target stimuli as either positive or negative. Then, after that response has been determined, the computer randomly generates a positive or negative prime. The congruity rate is shown to be larger than chance (i.e., about 53%). This demonstration is taken as evidence for the influence of future events on preceding cognitive responses.</p>
<p>Many readers will share the feeling that something must be wrong with this interpretation, but hardly anyone who contributed to the debate so far has articulated this feeling. What renders this interpretation strange and anomalous is the confusion of the <italic>explanandum</italic> (the event to be explained) and the <italic>explanans</italic> (the argument used for explanation). Given an antecedent, already determined positive or negative evaluation by human participants, the <italic>explanandum</italic> is the computer’s bias toward congruent consequent responses. Both the early rationalists (e.g., Spinoza, Leibniz, Kant) and empiricists (Bacon, Hume, Mill) who laid the foundations for modern science and the 20th-century philosophers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354313485504">Hempel &amp; Oppenheim, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354313485504">Reichenbach, 1951</xref>) who built on these foundations agreed on one thing: Antecedent conditions explain consequent events, not the other way round. With regard to Bem’s procedure, this means that what has to be explained and understood is the computer’s bias to produce congruent responses rather than the antecedent human evaluations that provide the independent condition for the inference of congruity. In other words, if the evidence is valid, it must be interpreted as owing to metaphysics in the computer’s chips rather than precognition in the human brain.</p>
<p>Not adhering to this basic rule of scientific inference about what influences what produces anomalous and contradictory implications, resulting in the kind of epistemic collapse that Humphrey warned about (see introductory quote). If consequent events in a computer can motivate antecedent “precognitive” responses, then there is no reason not to read any other social-psychological finding (or any finding) backward. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959354313485504">Schwarz and Clore’s (1983)</xref> demonstration that life satisfaction increases when the weather is nice could be interpreted as evidence for the impact of human satisfaction on the climate. The mere exposure effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959354313485504">Zajonc, 1968</xref>) could be interpreted as an influence of liking on repeated exposure of a stimulus. Or the P300 in ERP (a positive event-related potential that occurs 300 ms after the stimulus onset; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959354313485504">Zani &amp; Proverbio, 2003</xref>) could become the cause rather than the consequence of the antecedent stimulus. It is no exaggeration to say that all well-established evidence that can be considered state of the art at a given stage of the historical process could be cast into question and turned into an absurdity if we abandon the conditional inference direction from antedecent to consequent.</p>
<p>The terms “antecedent” and “consequent” pertain to the logical and methodological structure of an inference; they need not necessarily correspond to the temporal or chronological order of objective events. A future goal can become an antecedent condition of willful action if an individual anticipates the goal prospect. Imagining or simulating an unreal scenario can create false memory intrusions or self-fulfilling prophecies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959354313485504">Rosenthal &amp; Rubin, 1978</xref>). Or a priming experiment may use a negative SOA (stimulus-onset asynchrony) such that the target onset precedes the prime onset. However, crucially, in all these cases, process models can explain a consequent outcome conditionalized on antecedent conditions (e.g., self-generated memory strength; compound-cue formation in priming, etc.). If future expectancies are said to drive present behavior in an expectancy bias, the anticipatory process that turns a temporally later event into a psychological antecedent must in principle be demonstrable (through introspection, implicit-memory checks, protocols of anticipatory reactions, response biases in a signal detection framework, submotor responses, or neuropsychological indices). Manipulations that undermine anticipatory activities must be shown to eliminate expectancy effects. Alternatively, interindividual differences in the degree of expectancy can be tested as a causal mediator.</p>
<p>In the game of science, the logical ordering of antecedent and consequent conditions does not allow us to interpret an earlier event as caused or influenced by a later event, unless there are good reasons to transform the later event into a logical or psychological antecedent. Otherwise, we run into serious anomalies that undermine the validity of existing cumulative evidence. In this context, one should not overlook Bem’s claim of having demonstrated a causal influence of future events on earlier cognition. Such a causal claim highlights the need to adhere to the logical ordering of antecedent and consequent conditions. How can a prior evaluative reaction be causally contingent on a later computer event if the latter is not manipulated experimentally? This is the way in which causality is commonly defined in empirical science. It is certainly true that causality can have a different meaning in different cultural contexts, such as the arts, history, or science-fiction writing. However, we repeat that the notion of a causal influence in empirical science must be restricted to a conditional inference argument that clearly distinguishes between antecedent and consequent conditions. Otherwise, the building of empirical science will lose its meaning and collapse like a house of cards.</p>
<p>We are dealing here not only with theoretical anomalies but also with eminently practical implications of a useful concept of causality. If research successfully demonstrates a causal relationship, we can then use this evidence to produce or prevent future effects (e.g., use a fertilizer to increase crop yield). In Bem’s world, it is hard to see how we can go into the future to set conditions in order to affect what is happening now or has happened in the past. However, his argument implies exactly this, namely, that one can now set conditions that affect things that happened in the past. But they have already happened. Would they be changed now because of our intervention? If so, there would be two pasts, an original one and a retroactively revised one. Such practical anomalies are even harder to contemplate than Bem’s experimental findings.</p>
<p>Our argument should not be misunderstood to imply that all science must be confined to causal relationships. Just as research in zoology or archeology can be descriptive or taxonomic in nature without any need to impose simplifying causal interpretations on carefully assessed observations, good behavioral science can be concerned with careful descriptions and existence proofs. For example, existence proofs of surprising cognitive feats among infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959354313485504">Perner &amp; Leekam, 2008</xref>) or hyper-memory among chess grandmasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354313485504">Boggan, Bartlett, &amp; Krawczyk, 2012</xref>) can impress and enlighten. Likewise, just as modern theories of relativity and quantum physics no longer require simple mechanistic rules of causality, psychologists may come to abandon the notion of causality in favor of more sophisticated, dynamic-systems models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959354313485504">Vallacher, Read, &amp; Nowak, 2002</xref>) that explain behavior in terms of attractors and the emergent properties of task environments. Such models use multiple constraints without requiring linear causal ordering. Instead, they treat antecedent conditions as complex environmental patterns that bypass the notion of causality.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354313485504">Bem (2011)</xref>, however, does not present such a model. His intended contribution, and the public attention given to his evidence, rather depends on the claim that he has shown a unidirectional causal influence of future events on prior behavior. Without this causal claim, there is hardly anything in his research that could raise the interest that it received.</p>
<p>In advocating his causal interpretation of a retroactive influence, Bem not only ignores the common rules of causal inference; he also fails to consider alternative interpretations. While he is quick to dismiss established laws of forward cognition, he retains the premise that his random generators are genuinely random. How can one call a physical device random if it is shown to correlate with preceding human responses? If randomness is another term for unpredictability, the computer’s output was not random (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Does the premise of genuine random generators enjoy the status of an incontestable fact that is not subject to critical test? We believe the strong point that Bem tries to make for the random generators based on radioactive decay is unwarranted if their output can be predicted by preceding keystrokes. Or in other words, why should metaphysics be more taboo than parapsychology in dealing with strange data?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0959354313485504">
<title>How selective is the evidence?</title>
<p>An important question is how strange and abnormal the evidence really is. Here we are not raising the blatant and incriminating question of whether Bem is (not) completely explicit about the population of all studies and study conditions that have been run in his lab. We would rather like to sensitize the reader to ubiquitous voodoo correlations that are an essential part of paradigmatic science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354313485504">Fiedler, 2011</xref>). In any experimental research project, researchers engage in pilot testing to select appropriate task and parameter settings to optimize the chances of finding strong effects in their main studies. They sample stimuli, task items, and levels on independent variables in a non-random fashion, thereby inflating the strength of their empirical findings. Researchers virtually never publish all studies they conduct. Many trials in this creative trial-and-error game may be conducted by students, so that principal investigators hardly ever monitor and control the entirety of research that underlies a finally published paper. In this dialectical process, it is hard to distinguish post hoc between pilot studies and real studies, a priori ideas and a posteriori findings, and it is impossible to count the number of hypothetical questions—or implicit significance tests—that had to be conducted before some interesting findings were finally selected to enter a published paper.</p>
<p>The editors’ assertion that “we can only take the author at his word that his data are in fact genuine and that the reported findings have not been taken from a larger set of unpublished studies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354313485504">Judd &amp; Gawronski, 2011</xref>, p. 406) refers to personal honesty rather than to such sampling filters that render all paradigmatic research selective. As a matter of rule, we would object that if an author honestly declares to be free of such selectivity, this only testifies to the unconscious and sometimes self-deceptive nature of the filtering process. Just as we cannot entirely trust participants’ introspections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959354313485504">Nisbett &amp; Wilson, 1977</xref>), methodology calls us to employ critical reflection rather than believing in researchers’ introspection.</p>
<p>In this regard, it seems hard to believe that Bem’s lab does not produce a wealth of findings that can be packed and unpacked in multiple ways, yielding seemingly regular patterns in a few aspects along with an unknown list of nonsignificant results in many other aspects. Even in the published work, precognition effects emerged with erotic stimuli but not with other hedonically relevant stimuli. Precognition worked with people high in the trait of sensation-seeking (or extraversion) but not with low sensation-seekers (or introverts). Women showed psi effects with highly arousing stimuli, whereas men did not.</p>
<p>Other potential moderators and poorly understood boundary conditions are suggested in the final discussion, where Bem reveals his suspicion that the findings with erotic stimuli may not be replicable and that the findings may to an unknown degree be peculiar to North American college students. Moreover, the experimenter’s own conviction may also play a role:
<disp-quote>
<p>In three psi experiments [not Bem’s] specifically designed to investigate the experimenter effect, a proponent and a skeptic of psi jointly ran a psi experiment, using the same procedures and drawing participants from the same pool. … In two of the three experiments, the proponent obtained a significant result, but the skeptic did not. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354313485504">Bem, 2011</xref>, p. 422)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Bem tried to minimize experimenter effects in his research by “leaving the experimental instructions and other interactions with the participant to the computer program” (p. 422) and by using minimally trained undergraduate assistants as greeters and debriefers. No experiments with skeptical experimenters were run or reported, however.</p>
<p>It seems to us, then, that the author reveals a good deal of his own experience in saying that psi phenomena may appear in subsets and substrata of data that can only be identified post hoc, by careful elaboration on the overall set of empirical materials obtained in such a research program.</p>
<p>Bem knows that the long way from the context of discovery to the context of justification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959354313485504">Reichenbach, 1951</xref>) is highly selective and open to many post hoc and ad hoc influences. In his famous essay on “Writing the Empirical Journal Article,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354313485504">Bem (1987)</xref> invites scientific writers to
<disp-quote>
<p>become intimately familiar with the record of their behavior: the data. Examine them from every angle. Analyze the sexes separately. Make up new composite indices. If a datum suggests a new hypothesis, try to find further evidence for it elsewhere in the data. If you see dim traces of interesting patterns, try to reorganize the data to bring them into bolder relief. If there are participants you don’t like, or trials, observers, or interviewers who gave you anomalous results, drop them (temporarily). Go on a fishing expedition for something—anything—interesting. (p. 172)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This advice is a striking endorsement of sampling filters leading to surprising but hard-to-replicate findings. When applied to the psychology of research participants, this mindset bears the stigma of bias and irrationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354313485504">Fischer, Aydin, Fischer, Frey, &amp; Lea, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354313485504">Nickerson, 1998</xref>), and so it does in scientific discourse. The term “fishing expedition” is a virtual epithet. It suggests the absence of prior theory and a lack of discipline in the treatment of the data. Surely, Bem did not intend this meaning. Instead, he sought to highlight the benefits of exploration. But there is a problem. The more variables a data set contains, the more likely it is that <italic>some</italic> variable will be involved in a significant association. At the same time, it becomes <italic>less</italic> likely that the precise pattern of significant and nonsignificant results will be replicated. With regard to Bem’s finding, one wonders what one should hope for in replication studies. Suppose that in a replication study, introverts show signs of psi, whereas extraverts do not. Without theory-derived constraints on the post hoc acceptance of moderator variables, one would conclude that psi is alive and well in a two-way interaction. The susceptibility to psi varies with personality and over time.</p>
<p>We do not wish to raise unfair or unwarranted suspicion with this open and realistic description of the scientific process. Instead, we only want to stress the point that it would be naïve to exclude the possibility that selectivity may have entered the findings that were finally collected for Bem’s target article on precognition. Nobody—not even Bem himself— is in a position to estimate the amount of selectivity (i.e., the number of glances at the data, moderators, moderator splits, pilot tests, post hoc ideas, etc.) that led to the final compilation of the present research package.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0959354313485504">
<title>Need for theoretical explanation</title>
<p>Because of the pervasive problems of data fishing and voodoo-correlation filters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354313485504">Fiedler, 2011</xref>), having a good theory is vital to the validity of empirical findings. As a remedy for the creativity and flexibility of the strategies with which researchers can convince and deceive themselves of the validity of their hypotheses, scientific inference not only requires independent replications but, even more importantly, has to rely on a clearly articulated theory that helps to distinguish haphazard from systematic findings. Not only does Bem’s article lack a plausible account of how the alleged precognition effects are brought about, it also does not present any rationale for why sensation seeking, sex, or erotic affect should moderate psi effects. Why should these phenomena depend on culture? And why should experimenters have to believe in psi? Why should critical scientists be willing to explain the latter kind of constraint in terms of still another mysterious influence of human beliefs, rather than just interpret it in terms of the simplest account that suggests itself: an experimenter effect?</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0959354313485504">
<title>Concluding remark</title>
<p>In the absence of any theoretical explanation, let alone systematic replication and cross-validation, empirical evidence is of limited value. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354313485504">Bem (2011)</xref> has a point when maintaining that “the discovery and scientific exploration of most phenomena have preceded explanatory theories” (p. 408), but this point applies only to findings that do not conflict with other well-established theories and empirical evidence. Bem’s own work does not fall into this category. If taken seriously, his findings would require radical changes in the basic assumptions of how the mind (and the world) works.</p>
<p>This is the paradox of parapsychology. By definition, parapsychology seeks to document the existence of anomalous phenomena. If parapsychologists were to succeed in presenting a theory that can accommodate both traditional results and their own novel findings, then these novel findings would no longer be anomalous, and hence there would no longer be a field of parapsychology. Parapsychology, in other words, can only succeed at the cost of destroying itself.</p>
<p>In theory, there is a third way. Anomalous findings can be accepted as true without destroying traditional paradigms and without destroying their own privileged and separate status if they are considered miracles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354313485504">Bem (2011)</xref> can be read as suggesting that he worked a miracle. He attempted to show that the future influences the past. Even if no one replicates his results, the results are what they are (and advocates of psi will argue so for years to come). Arguably, the findings are miraculous because they violate the empiricist notion of the direction of causation as well as the Kantian a priori, without nullifying these ideas.</p>
<p>In a famous essay, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354313485504">David Hume (1748/2000)</xref> asked what it would take to accept a miracle. He suggested that the falsity of the evidence would have to be more surprising than the existence of the miracle itself. Illustrating his criterion with the example of resurrection, he said that he would believe that resurrection occurred if an error in the report that resurrection occurred were even more miraculous than the resurrection itself. Hume, for one, felt that human error was more likely than a reversal of death. Applying his criterion to Bem’s report of retroactive causation, we suspect that human error is more likely than the reversal of the arrow of time.</p>
<p>Standards for a mature science are available, and they are usually upheld by the journals of the American Psychological Association. It seems to us, however, that most of these standards refer to matters of proper design and analysis. A renewed discussion of the role of psychological theory and of the logic of science is needed for the continued health of the field. In this regard, Bem’s paper may have been prescient.</p>
