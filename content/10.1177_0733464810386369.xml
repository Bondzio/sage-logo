<abstract>
<p>Nursing assistants provide more than 80% of direct care to residents. However, it is unknown whether or not they clearly understand the purpose of nursing home regulation and incorporate regulatory standards in their care delivery process. This study uses qualitative methods to explore their experiences with nursing home inspection. Findings suggest that the subtle nuances of human interaction between nursing assistants and residents tend to be overlooked in the midst of enforcing highly strict and detailed regulatory standards that mainly focus on visible outcomes of care. In addition, the state survey might deepen the chasm between nursing assistants and nursing home administration so that the hierarchical culture of mistrust and ritualism continues in nursing homes. To resolve such problems, it is critical to rethink the impact of nursing home regulation at the level of direct interactions between nursing assistants and residents and to consider increasing nursing assistant involvement in the inspection process.</p>

<sec id="section1-0733464810386369">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) 1987 Nursing Home Reform legislation arose from growing concerns about the poor quality of nursing home care and the need for strengthening federal regulations for nursing homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0733464810386369">Harrington &amp; Carrillo, 1999</xref>). It sets standards for nursing home care and logistics for the state survey/certification process so that state governments can perform on-site inspections to determine whether nursing homes at least meet the minimum criteria for quality of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0733464810386369">Wan, 2003</xref>). The results of state-regulated annual nursing home inspections are recorded by the Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting (OSCAR) system, which is a national-level database managed by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0733464810386369">Harrington, Zimmerman, Karon, Robinson, &amp; Beutel, 2000</xref>). The database includes nursing home information, including staffing levels, case mix, and available services as well as individual resident health information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0733464810386369">Mor, Zinn, Angelelli, Teno, &amp; Miller, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The OSCAR data system is composed of two separate health surveys of residents’ characteristics and nursing home care deficiencies. The first data file is the Minimum Data Set (MDS), which contains information about nursing home resident characteristics collected from self-reports, and includes information about residents’ physical status, mental status, and other special conditions such as the percentage of residents who spent most of their time in bed or in a chair or have contractures, pressure sores, incontinence, urinary catheters, and physical restraints.</p>
<p>The second OSCAR data file is a report about deficiencies that are the result of state surveyors’ inspections of nursing home performance in the provision of care, such as deficiencies issued due to substandard care activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0733464810386369">Harrington &amp; Carrillo, 1999</xref>). When a state inspection team visits a nursing home to oversee its care quality, the team reviews resident medical charts, interviews a sample of residents, family members, and administrative staff, observes care processes, and evaluates the nursing home environment. When state surveyors find quality of care problems that could negatively affect the health and safety of residents and/or nursing homes that violate state or federal minimum standards for care, deficiencies are issued and reported to OSCAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0733464810386369">Harrington et al., 2000</xref>). This data file about nursing home care deficiencies is made up of 17 categories with 185 items, which are requirements to be met by nursing homes to maintain status as a certified nursing facility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0733464810386369">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is argued that a deterrence approach has been adopted in nursing home regulation, making the tone of inspection punitive in that nursing homes might face monetary penalties, denial of payment, or decertification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0733464810386369">Harrington, Mullan, &amp; Carrillo, 2004</xref>). As a result, the outcome of state nursing home inspections greatly influences the business interests of nursing homes. It has become one of the priorities of nursing home administrations to fit the structure and culture of its care provision to the requirements of the annual state survey. For example, nursing home professionals (i.e., administrators, directors of nursing) in Missouri have expressed a wish for state involvement in clear interpretation and consistent application of nursing home regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0733464810386369">Putnam, Tang, Brooks-Danso, Pickard, &amp; Morrow-Howell, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0733464810386369">
<title>Focus of Study</title>
<p>This study approaches nursing home regulation from the perspective of nursing assistants who provide more than 80% of direct care to residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0733464810386369">Beck, Ortigara, Mercer, &amp; Shue, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0733464810386369">Harmuth &amp; Dyson, 2005</xref>). Given their significant roles in providing for the physical and psychosocial well-being of nursing home residents, they are not adequately compensated as evidenced by a mean income of US$13,224 per year and the lack of health insurance and pension benefits in many cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0733464810386369">Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0733464810386369">Yamada, 2002</xref>). The high turnover rate of 71% per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0733464810386369">Decker et al., 2003</xref>) is not surprising considering their poor working conditions. Lack of proper job orientation, training, and advancement opportunities, and a centralized management style are also known to contribute to high turnover rates among nursing assistants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0733464810386369">Bowers, Esmond, &amp; Jacobson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0733464810386369">Cancian, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0733464810386369">IOM, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though OBRA 1987 mandates that every nursing assistant must complete 75 hr of entry-level training, 12 hr of in-service training every year, and pass a competency examination within 4 months of employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0733464810386369">Wiener, 2003</xref>), it is unknown how the implementation and application of nursing home regulations are taught to nursing assistants by management. Little is known as to the degree of nursing assistants’ involvement in the inspection process. While nursing home surveyors’ interviews with residents are often part of the inspection, there are not many opportunities for nursing assistants to vocalize their views about the care that they provide.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0733464810386369">Bowers and Becker’s (1992)</xref> observational study revealed that rules and regulations governing the care process were not communicated to nursing assistants and they were confused about how to provide adequate care that meets federal and state standards. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0733464810386369">DuBeau, Ouslander, and Palmer (2007)</xref> found that there were discrepancies in terms of both knowledge and attitudes about revised federal guidance for incontinence care between nursing home staff and state surveyors. For example, nursing home staff mistakenly equated urinary incontinence management with toileting programs and thought that compliance to the new guidelines, which state surveyors wanted to enforce, would violate resident rights.</p>
<p>Thus it is possible that annual nursing home inspection might be conducted without nursing assistants’ full understanding of its scope and purpose. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0733464810386369">Bowers et al. (2003)</xref> found that nursing assistants often felt their supervisors were dismissive and demeaning when they communicated and enforced organizational policies to nursing assistants. There was not much room for nursing assistants to have a voice in the process of organizational policy implementation. It might be a similar case with annual nursing home inspection that nursing assistants remain invisible and the specifics are not clearly conveyed to them. If so, nursing assistants might also have negative perceptions about how the process of nursing home inspection is explained and conducted.</p>

<sec id="section3-0733464810386369">
<title>Research Question</title>
<p>It is important to explore nursing assistants’ experiences with nursing home inspection to explore how much the original purpose and intention of regulation enforcement is aligned with nursing assistants’ own understanding and interpretation of the nursing home regulation. By directly listening to nursing assistants, we might examine the impact of nursing home inspection at the level of resident–nursing assistant direct interaction. Furthermore, we can open up a discussion about the extent to which current nursing home regulations are or are not part of nursing assistants’ daily work lives and care provision.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0733464810386369">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>A grounded theory approach was appropriate for this study’s purpose. Using the guidelines enlightened by grounded theory methods, study participants’ meanings and actions related to nursing home inspection could be understood. Qualitative coding enables researchers to label segments of data, sort them, and make comparisons among them. Also, using analytic notes called memos, abstract interpretations could be made about how study participants constructed the relationship between themselves and a social structure, in this case the nursing home regulation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0733464810386369">Charmaz, 2005</xref>). Broader interview questions were used to get a richer description of nursing assistants’ experiences working in nursing homes and to capture their knowledge and attitudes related to nursing home inspection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0733464810386369">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>The study employed a purposive and convenience sample of 21 nursing assistants working in skilled nursing facilities in the greater Los Angeles area. Study participants were recruited through the SEIU Local 434B, a long-term care workers’ union. As opposed to selecting one or two nursing homes and then recruiting nursing assistants directly from those homes, this method captured the diversity in nursing assistants’ experience with nursing home survey conducted in multiple nursing homes. As a result, eight for-profit nursing homes were represented by the study participants. All of them were free-standing facilities and five of them belonged to the same corporation. The average rates of residents who were on Medicaid, Medicare, and private pay were respectively 79%, 11%, and 4%. The number of beds ranged from 98 to 342, and the occupancy rate ranged from 89% to 96%. The average nursing assistant hours per resident were 2.21 hr per day.</p>
<p>A letter to participants (i.e., an information sheet about the study) and participant release agreement (a postcard in which potential study participants could indicate their willingness to be contacted along with their contact information) were approved by the Institutional Review Board at UCLA. Two nursing home representatives from the union helped distribute these two forms among union members.</p>
<p>Participants had to have the following characteristics to be eligible for this study. First, they had to be working as full-time certified nursing assistants in state-licensed skilled nursing facilities where 24-hr medical nursing care was provided for people with serious illnesses or disabilities. Second, study participants had to have at least 1 year of experience as a nursing assistant. This was to ensure that study participants knew the job well enough to have had developed some ideas about their work and quality of care. Six of the participants were male and 15 were female, and the average age of the participants was 42 years (ranging from 22 to 58 years). Eleven years was the average time working as nursing assistant (ranging from 1 to 30 years). All nursing assistants were employed full time. Thirteen of the participants were immigrants from countries in Central or South America, and the other 8 were born in the United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0733464810386369">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were collected through 60 to 90 min face-to-face interviews using open-ended questions from March to October 2007. All of the interviews were audiotaped with permission from study participants. An interview guide was developed and used to direct the interview so that pertinent questions could be asked and so that the interview remained focused on the primary topics of interest. Some of the questions that were asked included, “Can you tell me what you know about the nursing home survey?” and “Please tell me what state surveyors look for when they come out for inspection.” Interviews were conducted at the nursing assistants’ location of choice, but meeting in the union office was suggested by the researcher first. All the interviews were conducted by the researcher in English.</p>
<p>A field notebook was used to document any thoughts and ideas while listening to study participants and to help the researcher recall the specifics of each interview, such as the date, time, location, and atmosphere. All of the interview tapes were transcribed verbatim within a week after each interview. All of the field notes, face sheets, and transcribed interviews were filed on each respondent with an identifiable number, not with their name. For data management purposes, ATLAS.ti, a qualitative research software, was used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0733464810386369">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Coding is a method of attributing labels to lines of transcribed interviews and is the first step of interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0733464810386369">Padgett, 1998</xref>). Open coding as a textual level analysis compares data, groups similar incidents, and gives the same conceptual label to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0733464810386369">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0733464810386369">Pandit, 1996</xref>). For example, study participants stated they delivered certain care activities every 2 hr. Those statements were coded both under the code “every two hours” and as the specific activity that they were engaged in, such as “toileting” or “repositioning.”</p>
<p>Then, axial coding was used to make conceptual links between the chunks of data that were grouped through open coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0733464810386369">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0733464810386369">Pandit, 1996</xref>). For example, in terms of study participants’ attitudes toward nursing home inspection, there were several codes that could fall into a category “negative attitudes,” such as “fake” and “no difference.” Thus main categories were derived by assigning higher level, more abstract overarching concepts to the chunks of data. Last, through focused coding, final decisions were made by the researcher about which codes and categories were the most significant and analytic. Then the transcripts were recoded only with those selected codes and categories resulting in a fuller description of selected categories with their various attributes in more detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0733464810386369">Charmaz, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>While sorting out codes, memos were written about certain codes that mingled together naturally or were used many times. They were used to make conceptual links among codes and to clarify why certain codes were grouped into one category and how each category was labeled. Memo writing also allowed theoretical sampling by directing the researcher where to go to stimulate conceptual and theoretical development in the data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0733464810386369">Charmaz, 2006</xref>). According to grounded theory approach, data collection can be suspended when collecting new data no longer adds “theoretical insights” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0733464810386369">Charmaz, 2006</xref>) and when new properties of core theoretical categories no longer emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0733464810386369">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>). Therefore, once core categories with the greatest explanatory power were identified, it was considered appropriate to stop gathering new data.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Nursing assistant descriptions about the way nursing home surveys are performed and their impact on the operation of nursing homes reveals a disjuncture between the intention of regulation and its consequences at the level of direct interaction between residents and nursing assistants. To nursing assistants, the nursing home survey fails to get down to the level of the care process and instead mainly focuses on what can be visually examined, such as detailed documentation in the charts and how residents look at the moment of inspection. They are aware of a few things that they need to pay attention to in order to avoid any troubles with state surveyors, such as the location of G-tubes, oxygen tanks, and catheter bags. Workers seem to think that as long as residents are presented as clean and free of any unnecessary restraints, they have done what is required of them by the inspection.</p>
<p>Nursing assistant understanding about externally enforced criteria for quality of care is also limited. Some workers have valid doubts about the utility of having an annual inspection lasting for only 3 days that judges quality of care based on what surveyors get to see. Nursing home workers seem to think that nursing home inspection is rather superficial and perfunctory so that it does not lead to any fundamental changes in the care process. There were no noticeable patterns in their views on nursing home survey that were associated with gender, length of time as a nursing assistant, age, or any facility factors. Two primary themes of nursing assistants’ knowledge and attitudes regarding nursing home inspection and several secondary themes have been identified. They are reported below.</p>
<sec id="section10-0733464810386369">
<title>Nursing Assistants’ Understanding About Nursing Home Inspection and Its Effects at the Level of Direct Interaction Between Residents and Nursing Assistants</title>
<p>Resident charts are tools for state surveyors when they conduct an inspection. Nursing assistants state that surveyors spend most of their inspection time reviewing the charts, and they pay special attention to documentation about medications and restraint orders. They check whether current medications and restraints for residents match with prescriptions written by physicians. If what has been written in a chart and what is being actually delivered to a resident are not in accordance, this flags a problem. In this regard, the charts provide a concrete starting point for state surveyors. Study participants’ gender and length of time as a nursing assistant are included at the end of each quote.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When the state surveyors come out, they look into charts mostly. (F, 16)</p>
<p>The state also looks if a patient has a restraint, they go look in their chart and make sure that the restraint is a doctor’s order. (F, 30)</p>
<p>The main thing is documentation and medication. They spend whole day reading documentation and complaints . . . interviews with the residents, the medication, and then food. They want to make sure the residents have order and proper medication. (F, 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is not a nursing assistant’s main responsibility to regularly assess and document resident physical and mental status in their charts. However, they have to document several activities for each resident such as the percentage of food and liquid taken, frequency of bowel movements, and vital signs. They report these to their supervisors, who are licensed vocational nurses (LVNs) in most cases, and the chart entries are signed off.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Each resident has a chart, so every day we need to comment, each resident has one page. So we need to comment on the percentage of food finished, bathing, output, and everything. (F, 6)</p>
<p>We have to document if they went to the restroom every two hours, how many times, and nurses have to chart, so we have to make reports to nurses. (M, 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Detailed documentation on each resident is meant to save both individual staff and the nursing home from potential litigation by proving that they did everything that they could in a timely way. For example, nursing assistants want to have a written record that they have tried to give the care activity at least three times after the refusal of a resident. Otherwise, they might be accused of not having delivered the care activity and could be held accountable for their inaction resulting in a verbal warning. Receiving more than three warnings could result in termination of employment.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If CNA charts okay, it’s already written in the chart, so you are okay. I have to write about each resident and everything . . . you’re gonna take your chart your LVN, your LVN to read it, and make sure it’s okay. She gotta sign it and you gotta sign it. She is your witness that can be your back up and you write it down and let her sign it. Don’t ever forget that let her sign it. That’s going to be your proof. If she doesn’t sign it, it doesn’t mean anything, you are responsible for it. (F, 13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Last, study participants indirectly reveal how nursing home regulation is interpreted and enforced at the level of direct interaction between themselves and residents by mentioning an “every two hours system.” The phrase “every two hours” is like a mantra that applies to many of the care activities delivered by nursing assistants for residents, including repositioning, toileting, and removing physical restraints. Repositioning residents and removing restraints every 2 hr are good strategies to comply with regulations included in nursing home inspection, during which rates of pressure sores or physical restraint use are always checked using resident charts.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Make sure every two hours the residents are repositioned. If they are contracted, they can have pressure sores . . . we need to reposition them to prevent it. Everybody now to the window, to the door, some of them it’s side to side. (F, 7)</p>
<p>They make sure that patients are positioned at the hours you are supposed to turn that patient, make sure that . . . the state looks out for things like that. Make sure that your patients get the restraint removed every two hours. (F, 30)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When state surveyors come out to nursing homes to conduct an annual inspection, they review resident charts and then they look at the things that are readily observable and available. Nursing assistants report that surveyors check residents’ cleanliness by closely looking at their nails, toes, mouths, and even belly buttons. They check whether the G-tube and catheter bags are approximately three inches above the floor. The surveyors also check whether nursing assistants wear gloves in the hallway (which is prohibited) and whether they change gloves with different residents. Nursing assistants know that there is a very long list of the things that state surveyors need to check.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The patients need to be covered when being transferred to the shower, they need to look clean, water should be in place, and call lights should be answered right away. (F, 15)</p>
<p>Mostly they look for G-tube that goes to the oxygen tank, they look for cathedral bags, make sure that the bag is not touching the floor, 3 inches above the floor, make sure the tube is carrying down the leg not over the body, make sure that under the patients’ nails are nice and clean, make sure their mouths are real clean and in-between their toes and belly button. (F, 22)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The inspection styles of state surveyors seem to vary. For example, certain state surveyors spend more time making close observations about the whole process of care activities. One nursing assistant reports that during the last inspection, a surveyor watched how she changed and transferred her resident. In most cases, state surveyors are more interested in “here and right now,” such as the current hygiene and presentation of residents. For example, call lights can pose a problem when not answered right away in the presence of state surveyors.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Last time they came, they did a good job. They see how you change your resident, how you assist the resident, how you take the resident to the bathroom . . . (F, 24)</p>
<p>If your patient looks untidy, we are gonna have a problem with survey. Once a patient looks good, you have no problem. (F, 5)</p>
<p>When the surveyors are here, they don’t want to see any call lights when the resident is calling. We don’t answer that call light, it’s a problem. (M, 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nursing assistants are asked very specific questions by state surveyors, such as the location of emergency food and water or procedures of a fire drill. One nursing assistant states that the nursing home inspection is similar to a home visit by Child Protective Services (CPS) because in both cases surveyors come out to see whether everything in the house is in order. Thus surveyors also examine the condition of the whole facility including residents’ rooms and the environmental safety of the building.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>They ask for code for fire, disaster, stuff like that, what we will do when we have an emergency, where the emergency food and water is . . . (F, 6)</p>
<p>They look for safety, cleanliness, quality care, and they look for everything that’s in order. It’s basically your house, that’s the way they see it as. They will look if your house is clean. It’s just like CPS. (F, 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section11-0733464810386369">
<title>Nursing Assistant Attitudes Toward Nursing Home Inspection: Neutral, Positive, and Negative</title>
<p>Some nursing assistants do not seem to be affected by a yearly nursing home inspection by state surveyors. They say that their work is not directly influenced by the presence of state surveyors and that they provide residents with the same care activities they would provide in the absence of state inspections. Nursing assistants consider state surveyors to be mere outsiders who are removed from the reality of the care delivery process but still come into the setting to conduct inspections. These nursing assistants do not seem to feel any organizational pressures about the result of nursing home inspections. As long as their residents look good to those outsiders, they do not have any problems.</p>

<p>Some nursing assistants acknowledge the value of having a nursing home inspection once a year. It is an opportunity to be examined by outsiders about whether they are doing a good job, from the physical condition of the nursing home to the way nursing home assistants work with residents. Also, some nursing assistants are glad to have an inspection because other staff members, especially nurses, are willing to help them out to minimize any risks or mistakes that may occur due to short staffing. Nursing assistants say that their supervisors and administrator treat them better when state surveyors are around. They perceive this temporary improved treatment as an administrative means to motivate them to do a better job by being more attentive to residents’ needs, thus reducing any possibilities for mistreatment that may affect the survey results.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is a good time for all CNAs because it’s the time when we really give good care to the residents because it’s the time when everybody is helping CNAs. They are afraid of survey and help us a lot. (M, 7)</p>
<p>That is when we are at our best. We go beyond the call of duty. We get treated better by our supervisors when the surveyors are there. (F, 22)</p>
<p>It is very important because it’s the only way they are going to control whether the place is in good condition or not. They are gonna see how the staff work with patients. (M, 3)</p>
<p>So they come in and look for if everything is in order and where it’s supposed to be. If anything is out of place, they will notice right away. (F, 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, other nursing assistants doubt the utility of the nursing home inspection because it does not result in actual quality improvement in nursing home care for residents. This view implies that even though a nursing home is cited for violations, the impact does not trickle down to the level of direct interaction between nursing assistants and residents, thus bringing about no actual changes in the care delivery process. Nursing assistants even state that they “fake” their activities during the survey because they excel only when state surveyors are present. For example, they will use more new linens than usual or they will answer call lights much faster than they usually do. This kind of temporary change is also encouraged by nurses and administrators. When the surveyors leave, everything goes back to the previous state. Some nursing assistants have doubts about the credibility of state surveyors because the surveyors do not seem to know what really happens between nursing assistants and residents and simply check off the items that are on their list.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The words spread like wild flower . . . it’s like a big front. We are fake. We are taught to be fake. Why can’t we pretend the state is here everyday? It will run so much better for all of us. (F, 30)</p>
<p>They ask me questions but they do not really know what’s happening because they follow books or papers that they can read. (M, 8)</p>
<p>They just come to lose their time because everything is the same, before and after. Before they come, everyone including the head of the hospital say they are coming, we need to do this, be careful, please try to do a good job. But after they go, they are gonna be the same. They are gonna start not caring about the residents, don’t care about nothing, doesn’t make any difference. (M, 5)</p>

<sec id="section13-0733464810386369">
<title>Regulation and Ritualism</title>
<p>After the introduction of the OBRA in 1987, state surveyors began to assess nursing homes’ compliance with more than 500 federal standards. Most of their work entails finding evidence of compliance with the standards by reviewing charts. For example, the surveyors examine whether physician’s orders are correctly followed and medications are correctly distributed. When listening to study participants, it is clear that documentation is an important aspect of nursing assistants’ work. For example, they have to report on residents’ food intake percentages and restroom use for the purpose of monitoring residents’ basic health status. Also, nursing assistants view documentation as an instrument for defending themselves so that they do not get into trouble. If they are not signed off by nurses after they write on resident medical charts, they can be held accountable for both their actions and inactions in the future.</p>
<p>Documentation is useful to track whether proper services have been provided to meet each resident’s special needs and condition. It also serves to monitor changes in residents’ health status and to update medication regimens accordingly. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0733464810386369">Miller and Mor (2008)</xref> raise a concern about the effectiveness of chart review by state surveyors because they tend to be better at just detecting inconsistencies in resident records than actually tracing the results of improper or substandard treatment in patient charts. Also, while documentation is intended to ensure that necessary care activities are provided in a timely manner, excessive focus on documentation might take away resources, such as time, from the actual care delivery process. The complexity of direct interaction between residents and nursing assistants can get lost when the care process is translated into a few sentences in resident charts. Thus it is worthy to note the possibility that excessive emphasis on regulatory accountability and heavy documentation might have strengthened the culture of ritualism in nursing homes.</p>
<p>Ritualism is one of the modes of adaptation to a normative order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0733464810386369">Merton, 1968</xref>) and it is a way of resisting regulation in a less confrontational and more subtle way without tackling the fundamental causes of noncompliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0733464810386369">Braithwaite, 1993</xref>). Nursing homes seem to have developed their own ritual to deal with nursing home regulation. For example, repositioning residents and removing restraints every 2 hr seem to be good strategies to deal with nursing home inspection, during which rates of pressure sores or physical restraint use are always checked. But it is paradoxical that the phrase “every two hours” implies both a minimum and maximum that nursing assistants can do for their residents. It is the minimum because they have to check on their residents at least every 2 hr to prove they have done whatever it takes to prevent pressure sores. At the same time, it is the maximum that they can do for residents since they will not have more time to check on the residents more frequently. Thus, without addressing the problem of short staffing, this system of checking residents every 2 hr seems to have been devised to get through nursing home regulation.</p>
<p>It is true that nursing home regulation has shifted its focus from input to outcome-oriented measures to deal with ritualism and to foster innovation in achieving regulatory goals. However, this newer strategy has still left what happens during direct interaction between nursing assistants and residents as a black box allowing nursing homes to achieve positive outcomes through whatever means they see fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0733464810386369">Braithwaite, 1993</xref>). The obsession about outcomes might overlook the care delivery process by ignoring the subtle nuances of human interaction between nursing assistants and residents. A study participant shared that state surveyors once watched the entire care delivery processes and monitored the way she interacted with residents during an inspection, which she considered a good job on their part. However, none of the study participants reports that state surveyors paid much attention to the psychosocial and relational aspects care during an inspection. Instead, nursing assistants place emphasis on the clean and tidy appearance of their residents because they think this is the first step to avoid any problems with state surveyors.</p>

<sec id="section14-0733464810386369">
<title>Regulation Deepening the Chasm Between Nursing Assistants and Nursing Home Administration</title>
<p>While some nursing assistants appreciate the value of inspection because they think it ensures a minimum quality of care in nursing homes, most study participants state that the scope of inspection is not as inclusive and thorough as it can be. Also, they hint that the yearly inspection does not change anything fundamentally in terms of quality of care. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0733464810386369">Harrington et al. (2004)</xref> also report that even though many nursing homes have been found with serious deficiencies, the actual follow-up enforcement action and sanctions are lacking. Nursing assistants are doubtful about whether a plan of corrections and the follow-up efforts of the nursing home administration will actually take effect after state surveyors leave because there are underlying problems, such as a lack of communication and cooperation among staff.</p>
<p>Study findings reveal that during the survey, nurses and the administrator change their attitudes toward nursing assistants. When surveyors are around, nursing assistants report that nurses and administrators treat them better and cooperate with them more. The “head department” (meaning nurses and administrators) fakes its behavior when surveyors are present. And when it is over, they go back to their original style of not being so helpful to and respectful of nursing assistants. The unusual eagerness to help among nurses and administrators during state inspections is considered a way of reducing the risk of further investigation, but increases nursing assistants’ distrust of nurses and the administrator. These temporary behavioral changes of the head department are contrasted to the statements made by the study participants who report that they deliver care activities to residents in the same way regardless of the presence of state surveyors.</p>
<p>Nursing assistants are not directly influenced by the result of the inspection, but nursing home administration deeply cares about the result because their business interests are at stake. For example, when a nursing home receives a deficiency citation by violating any of the standards, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services [CMS] can fine the nursing home, cease reimbursement, assign a temporary manager, or install a state monitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0733464810386369">Wiener, 2003</xref>). Thus yearly nursing home inspection seems to deepen the chasm between nursing assistants and the “head department” rather than encourage more team work and unified efforts to improve quality of care. The culture of distrust and a strong sense of a dichotomy between “us” (nursing assistants) and “them” (nurses and administrator) are not conducive to the provision of best care.</p>

<sec id="section15-0733464810386369">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>A limitation of this study is that all study participants were recruited from a restricted geographical area. The 21 study participants are from eight different nursing homes in Los Angeles County, California. These eight nursing facilities were for-profit and five of them belonged to the same corporation. Thus it is hard to claim that the analysis based on the responses of study participants represents the entire nursing home industry. This study did not find any consistent differences in study participants’ views on nursing home inspection that were associated with facility factors, such as size, fee structure, or nursing assistant hours per resident. However, future research might be needed to systematically examine whether or not there are any patterns in nursing assistants’ experiences with nursing home inspection based on ownership (for-profit vs. not-for-profit), facility type (freestanding vs. hospital owned), or the previous year’s inspection results. Last, only one interview was conducted with each study participant, and multiple interviews might have added more analytical depth in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0733464810386369" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There is another chasm between nursing home professionals (i.e., administrator, director of nursing, and dietician) and state inspectors in regard to their views on nursing home regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0733464810386369">Putnam et al., 2007</xref>). The similar “us against them” stance exists as evidenced by nursing home professionals’ critical accounts of state surveyors adopting a top-down approach during inspections without fully understanding the reality of how nursing homes function. While nursing home professionals in Missouri express a need to build trust and mutual respect with state inspectors, it is not widely accepted by state inspectors. Thus the current nursing home regulation process might need a change to foster collaboration and communication among nursing assistants, nursing home professionals, and state surveyors.</p>
<p>It is necessary to change the perspective that state surveyors are mere outsiders who once every year will come in to pinpoint only the defects in the organization. The clear sense of division between “us” and “them” and the resulting distrust is counterproductive. Instead of prescribing highly detailed regulatory standards, state surveyors could help provide strategies to build more competent direct care workers positioning themselves as advocates for residents.</p>
<p>Discussions about quality of care in nursing homes and nursing home regulation are intertwined since most data on quality of care are collected through the regulatory process itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0733464810386369">Walshe, 2001</xref>). As a result, the yearly state survey has shaped the way quality of care is interpreted by nursing homes and communicated to nursing assistants. Thus regulation is not simply a matter between state surveyors and nursing home administration; there needs to be more involvement of various stakeholders including residents, family members, and direct care workers with interests in quality of care in nursing homes. Approaches and mechanisms to include all stakeholders in the regulatory process need to be explored further.</p>
<p>Last, further study examining nursing home surveyors’ own inspection experience and their conceptualizations about quality of care will be beneficial. Like nursing assistants, state surveyors might experience certain discrepancies between the guidelines that they have to use professionally and what they perceive as good care. It is not known whether state surveyors as outside observers are prepared to detect even the problems that are embedded at the level of direct interaction between resident and nursing assistants. Thus we need to listen directly to state surveyors and find common ground to build a coherent approach to nursing home regulation among all stakeholders in assuring quality of care in nursing homes.</p>
