<p>International comparative studies have shown that Finnish students score well in tests measuring science, mathematics, and reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162353212468066">Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development [OECD], 2011</xref>). According to the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) studies, Finland is the highest achieving country in Europe and has always scored among the top three countries in these three domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162353212468066">OECD, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162353212468066">2011</xref>). Values determine the types of intelligence each country nurtures through its educational decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162353212468066">Tirri, 2007</xref>), and the values of equity and equality raise questions concerning the differentiation of education for a diversity of learners. One reason for Finland’s success in international comparison studies is the Finnish government’s “equal opportunity and high-quality education for all” principle. The first practical implementation of this principle is that education is free at all levels. The second is the government’s strong financial support of public sector educational institutions. This has led to a situation where no significant differences exist in teaching quality between public and special schools. Partly for this reason, only a small minority of the schools in Finland are special schools that have their own entrance examinations and financial support from private or corporate sources. The third implementation is that special education is mainly understood as supporting students with learning disabilities. Thus educational research has focused more on children with special needs and less on giftedness. However, a number of studies were done in the 1990s on differentiation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0162353212468066">Tirri &amp; Uusikylä, 1994</xref>), and since the turn of the century, research has broadened to include learning environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162353212468066">Ruokonen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162353212468066">Tirri, 2012</xref>); attitudes towards giftedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212468066">Laine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162353212468066">Tirri, Tallent-Runnels, Adams, Yuen, &amp; Lau, 2002</xref>); the self-conceptions, well-being, and academic potential of gifted students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353212468066">Hotulainen &amp; Lappalainen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353212468066">Hotulainen &amp; Schonfield, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0162353212468066">Thuneberg &amp; Hotulainen, 2006</xref>) as well as the multiple intelligences and moral sensitivities of gifted students and special programs for them (see Tirri’s publications).</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to give an overview of the ways gifted and talented pupils are served in Finland. The Finnish educational system and current official educational policy are reviewed as well as contextual factors influencing the opportunities that are available to gifted and talented pupils. The trend toward individuality and freedom of choice are discussed in terms of national policy affecting gifted education, and these trends are identified as advantages, particularly for the gifted. Special schools and programs designed for the gifted and talented pupils are presented with optional enrichment alternatives. These alternatives include intensive courses, competitions, and summer camps in mathematics and physics.</p>
<p>The emphasis that Finland places on science, mathematics, and linguistics is evidence of strong support for the development of gifted students. Furthermore, different types of creative talent are fostered by the high number of special schools and classes in art and music. The greater social and affective needs of gifted pupils are acknowledged with a recommendation to include more approaches to develop and enhance gifted education programs.</p>

<title>The Finnish Educational System</title>
<sec id="section2-0162353212468066">
<title>The Finnish School System</title>
<p>The Finnish educational system covers preschool education (up to the age of 6), basic education (9-year-long comprehensive school, with an optional 10th year), upper secondary level (upper secondary school and vocational education), and higher education. The educational aims are to support the growth of the whole person. The cognitive goals are to strengthen pupils’ thinking and studying skills. The affective and social goals are met by providing socioethical and esthetic education alongside the conventional learning of facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353212468066">Basic Education Act 628/1998</xref>, Section 2, Section 31a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162353212468066">Upper Secondary School Act 629/1998</xref>, Section 2, Section 29a). The purpose of comprehensive school is to promote social and regional equality by providing teaching, materials, school meals, and special education free of charge to every pupil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353212468066">Basic Education Act 628/1998</xref>, Section 2, Section 31).</p>
<p>Comprehensive school education has two levels. At the lower level (Grades 1-6), the teaching is uniform for all and is generally given by a class teacher, except for foreign languages taught by language specialists (specialized foreign language teachers). The teachers at the higher level (Grades 7-10) are specialized subject teachers. Finnish comprehensive school is intended to give all children a general education. Compulsory subjects at the lower level include religious education, environmental studies, Finnish or Swedish (depending on the child’s mother tongue), a foreign language (generally English, but also Swedish, German, French, or Russian), history and social studies, civics, mathematics, natural history and geography, physical education, music, art, and handicrafts. The same subjects continue at the upper level, with the addition of a second foreign language (usually Swedish), chemistry, physics, health education, and home economics. At the upper level, the pupil can also take optional subjects such as a third foreign language or computer studies.</p>
<p>Two types of upper secondary education exist in Finland. On one hand, there is the (traditionally) 3-year upper secondary school, which represents the rather academic general education tradition, and on the other, vocational education in its many forms. When pupils complete upper secondary school, they write a matriculation examination. This examination is a qualification for general university entrance. Each year, more than 30,000 pupils sit for it; however, only a third of those who pass gain access to university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353212468066">Hautamäki et al., 2012</xref>). Those who do not pass the exam seek vocational education or a job.</p>

<title>Trends in Finnish Curricula Designs</title>
<p>In Finland, as in other Scandinavian countries, society has traditionally attached great importance to special education as a means of looking after its weakest members—children with learning difficulties or behavioral problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353212468066">Niemi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162353212468066">Kumpulainen &amp; Lankinen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353212468066">Persson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0162353212468066">Urban &amp; Sekowski, 1993</xref>). Official educational policy of the 1970s strongly emphasized educational equality. The aim was to equalize educational opportunities. The arguments were not only ideological but also pragmatic: The reserve of talent was to be harnessed to increase the wealth of the nation. Education was seen as an investment in human capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162353212468066">Laukkanen, 1995</xref>). Understandably, any suggestion of special education for gifted children in such an atmosphere would have been labeled elitist and contrary to the principle of equality. The centralized decisions of the 1970s forced teachers to teach an entire age group for 9 years in accordance with a common curriculum. So it remained every teacher’s duty to differentiate instruction in the best possible way for 25 to 30 pupils. Naturally, teachers found this task very difficult.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, legislative reforms rapidly changed the education system in Finland. The centralized decision making of the 1970s changed in favor of decentralization. An essential reform was to abandon the concept of a national curriculum. Instead, the idea of municipal curricula was introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162353212468066">Laukkanen, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The trend to decentralize education continued in the 1990s. Curricular redesign characterized all levels of education in Finland and was closely connected with other megatrends such as deregulation, also evident in other countries of the European Union. Decentralization meant that most decision making concerning both the organization and the content of general and vocational education was transferred to the municipalities. At the national level, only general guidelines would provide the framework for steering education. The framework curricula for comprehensive schools and upper secondary schools were approved in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162353212468066">Framework Curriculum for the Comprehensive School, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353212468066">Framework Curriculum for the Upper Secondary School, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In a study investigating the most important educational innovations in Finland as identified by Finnish decision makers, all interviewees acknowledged the importance of the curricular changes. The seven persons interviewed were the most influential at the Ministry of Education, the National Board of Education, and the Teachers Union. Four identified curricula-related areas as the most important innovations in Finland. These changes were referred to in the interviews—more power to municipalities in designing the curricula, curriculum integration, municipality-based curricula, and increasing possibilities for teachers to plan their teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0162353212468066">Tirri &amp; Tella, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>As a result of the trend toward individualism, schools were encouraged to draft more individualized curricula. The curricular redesign allowed teaching in schools to be more differentiated. However, by the end of the 1990s, it was noticed that the pupils’ learning outcomes and grades in different schools began to diverge. This was seen as jeopardizing pupils’ rights, legal protections, and equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162353212468066">Siekkinen &amp; Saastamoinen, 2010</xref>). Therefore, a new orientation in the decentralization process was established at the beginning of 21st century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162353212468066">National core curriculum for basic education 2004, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162353212468066">National core curriculum for upper secondary schools 2003, 2004</xref>). These new curricula differed from the 1990s versions in clarity of learning objectives and stricter learning outcome requirements. Explicit evaluation criteria were formulated to help teachers uniformly measure learning in every school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162353212468066">Vitikka, 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, the municipalities and schools were still instructed to develop their own curricula.</p>

<title>Current Legislation</title>
<p>Despite the 21st century curricula being more detailed than those of the 1990s, the newest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353212468066">Basic Education Act (628/1998)</xref>, continuing the trend of individualism, allows for diverse education. This ethos was reflected in the professional ethics code for educators created in 1998. The code stresses the worth of individuals and the principle of accepting learners as unique, including respecting their rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162353212468066">Teacher’s Professional Ethics and Ethical Principles, 2010</xref>). These can be seen as an advantage, especially for gifted and talented pupils. In gifted education, the adoption of practices such as acceleration and grouping are the main issues that usually test the level of acceptance of differentiation for the gifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0162353212468066">Van Tassel-Baska, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353212468066">The Basic Education Act (628/1998)</xref> has allowed for flexible decisions with respect to acceleration. It has been possible for parents to decide whether their children will begin school at the age of 6 or 7 (previously the age was 7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353212468066">Basic Education Act 628/1998</xref>, Section 27; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162353212468066">Basic Education Act 476/1983</xref>, Section 36). Another possibility for acceleration has been ungraded school, which allows pupils to advance in their studies within a flexible schedule. This ungraded system has been in use in most upper secondary schools since 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353212468066">Iivonen, 2000</xref>). The possibility of attending ungraded school at the elementary grade level has been experimented in some schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353212468066">Basic Education Act 628/1998</xref>, Section 20). Parents have also had the right to choose the school their children attend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353212468066">Basic Education Act 628/1998</xref>, Section 6).</p>
<p>Despite possibilities for acceleration, Finnish legislation does not explicitly mention gifted individuals. Still, the education system has a special structure: Teachers at all levels receive academic professional training, and an educational program of differentiation is standard from kindergarten onward. This means that all children are already educated according to their individual developmental and learning needs, which is the core principal of gifted education. In this respect, the Finnish educational system is highly developed with regard to gifted education, even though it is not referred to in such terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353212468066">Mönks &amp; Pflünger, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>However, a lack of understanding of giftedness and gifted education has been noted in Finnish public discussion. Two clear misunderstandings have been found—that all children are gifted and that the gifted can succeed on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212468066">Laine, 2010</xref>). It is argued that gifted students should have the same right to receive support in their studies as pupils with learning and other disabilities, whose special education is granted by Finnish legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353212468066">Basic Education Act 628/1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162353212468066">Upper Secondary School Act 629/1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162353212468066">National core curriculum for upper secondary schools 2003, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162353212468066">National core curriculum for basic education 2004, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212468066">Laine, 2010</xref>). In the most recent cross-cultural studies on teacher attitudes toward gifted education, Finnish teachers were shown to be more concerned about the negative side effects of special classes and other special arrangements for the gifted outside the regular classroom than their American colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162353212468066">Tallent-Runnels, Tirri, &amp; Adams, 2000</xref>). In another study using the same instrument, a Bayesian predictive discriminant analysis demonstrated cultural differences concerning the scale used among Finnish, American, and Hong Kong teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162353212468066">Tirri et al., 2002</xref>). According to the Bayesian analysis, the variable, “There are no gifted children in our school,” was shown to be the most discriminating item in our questionnaire. The U.S. and Finnish teachers’ profiles were more in accord with each other with regard to this item than that of the Hong Kong teachers. The U.S. and Finnish teachers strongly disagreed with this item, and the Hong Kong teachers disagreed less strongly. This difference could be explained by the different criteria teachers use to define the concept of giftedness. The Hong Kong teachers might use a stricter criterion than the Western teachers in our sample. The second most discriminating variable, “The gifted should spend their spare time helping those who progress less rapidly,” was mostly supported by the Hong Kong teachers. The U.S. teachers had many attitudes regarding this item, whereas the Finnish teachers had two opposing attitudes. This trend reflects the difference between the help-oriented Asian culture and the more independent-oriented Western one. The third most discriminating variable, “All children are gifted,” showed again that the Hong Kong teachers differed from their Western counterparts. The Asian teachers had the most disagreement on this item, whereas the Finnish teachers had the most agreement and U.S. teachers had more varied responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162353212468066">Tirri et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>To promote teachers’ abilities to better recognize and support gifted pupils, the Finnish National Board of Education implemented the Project for the Development of Gifted and Talent’s Education in Finland during 2009 to 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162353212468066">Finnish National Board of Education, 2012</xref>). The project produced educational material and in-service training for teachers as well as an interactive Internet forum for discussing the education of the gifted and talented.</p>

<sec id="section5-0162353212468066">
<title>Special Schools and Classes in Finland</title>
<p>In Finland, pupils usually attend the elementary school in their neighborhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353212468066">Bernelius, 2011</xref>). Usually, the reason for selecting a school for their child other than the local one is the parents’ desire to emphasize foreign languages. In Helsinki, it is possible to attend a special elementary school where a child receives teaching both in Finnish and in some other language (e.g., English, French, German, or Russian). These schools may be private or supported by the state, and they select their pupils according to their own criteria. Comprehensive schools have several special music classes; admission to such classes is not only based on musical talent but also on a particular interest in music. Some elementary schools have arranged voluntary groups where pupils can advance in those skills where they show talent. These groups have had teaching in thinking skills and mathematics, project-oriented working, computers, and art (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353212468066">Lehtonen, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Following compulsory comprehensive school, approximately half of the student population continues in upper secondary school. The recent trend has been that the number of upper secondary schools has decreased, whereas that of special schools has increased. In the 1990s, there were 463 upper secondary schools, of which 37 were special schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353212468066">Blom, 1994</xref>). Today, in 2012, 418 schools provide upper secondary education (S. Hörkkö, personal communication, April 23, 2012), and the number of special schools has risen to 56 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162353212468066">Special Upper Secondary Schools, 2012</xref>). These special schools can just as well be called schools for the gifted and talented as it is very difficult to be accepted into them. For example, in 2011, altogether 109,000 students attended upper secondary schools in Finland; of these, 1,436 were studying for the International Baccalaureate (IB) examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162353212468066">Official Statistics of Finland, 2012</xref>). The special schools usually select their pupils based on their grade point average, and may also have an admission examination. The schools are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0162353212468066">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>As we can see in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0162353212468066">Table 1</xref>, most special schools in Finland nurture creative talent in art or sports. We have only a few either science or linguistically oriented schools. In addition, the number of IB schools and schools with an IB track, where pupils study all subjects in English and graduate with an IB degree, has risen significantly over the past two decades, due to an increasing interest in international affairs and in studying at foreign universities.</p>
<p>In recent years, several enrichment alternatives have become available to gifted learners on a voluntary basis. For instance, in mathematics and physics, talented high school pupils have met at the University of Tampere on evenings and weekends to be more challenged in these subjects. As part of the same project, intensive courses and summer camps in mathematics have been arranged. Some of the pupils have even participated in summer courses offered under the Open University program and have gained university credits in linear algebra and physics. The project has received support from the Ministry of Education and from industrial sponsors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162353212468066">Nieminen &amp; Piche, 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Päivölä boarding school</title>
<p>Päivölä is a private independent boarding school located in the countryside near Valkeakoski in Finland. Nokia, the largest information technology company in Finland, supports Päivölä’s mathematics program, meaning that living and studying in this school is almost free (approximately 40% governmental and 60% Nokia support). The mathematics program started in 1994. The school selects 20 students annually according to “excursion weekend” tests. The students are mathematically talented 15- to 18-year-olds who graduate from upper secondary school in 2 years instead of the average of 3 years. Dropping out from the program is rare. The gender distribution is quite even, with the proportion of females being about 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162353212468066">Tirri, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Almost all of the students continue to study at university and at least 10% will eventually work for Nokia. Päivölä provides a tailored curriculum emphasizing mathematics and natural sciences, but other courses and practical training also fit well with the studies. Päivölä’s students participate annually in both domestic and international mathematics, physics, and chess competitions, and have achieved good results. Päivölä is responsible for natural sciences and computer science, whereas the Valkeakoski upper secondary school handles the other subjects. Even though Nokia is not involved in planning and implementing the Päivölä curriculum, the Toijala Nokia Research Center supports the personal growth of talented youth through research projects, relevant training, and mentoring. Trainees work on both their own projects and actual Nokia projects. The students are mentored to pinpoint their talents, enhance their strengths, plan their future, and build networks inside and outside Nokia. They can explore new technologies and create and evaluate new innovations. The projects deal with mobile applications, Web 2.0, games, robotics, sensors, and other items. The National Research Center Toijala offers practical training for students 12 hr per week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162353212468066">Tirri, Nokelainen, &amp; Mahkonen, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>The LUMA Science Education Centre and the Millennium Youth Camp</title>
<p>The National LUMA (LU stands for “luonnontieteet,” or natural science in Finnish, and MA for mathematics) Center was launched in 2004 to serve as a collaborative organization between universities, schools, and the business sector. The objective of the LUMA Center is to promote the teaching and studying of natural sciences, mathematics, computer science, and technology on all educational levels. One of its many activities is the Millennium Youth Camp, which was held for the first time in 2010. The camp is geared toward 16- to 19-year-old students who are gifted in science. Each year, 30 talented young people around the world are chosen to participate in the international camp according to a two-stage application process. In 2012, there were more than 1,400 applicants from 100 countries. One of the goals of the camp is to provide the attendees with information on educational possibilities and career options in Finland while promoting the Millennium Technology Prize. The camp offers youth the possibility to network with like-minded people, enjoy a feeling of togetherness, and experience Finnish nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162353212468066">Vartiainen &amp; Aksela, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>The Future of Gifted Education in Finland</title>
<p>Since the 1970s, educational policy in Finland has emphasized equality for all pupils. This equality has meant mainly taking care of pupils with learning or other disabilities, whose rights to receive special education have been protected through legislation. This kind of caring has been seen as one of the factors behind Finland’s success in the PISA studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353212468066">Niemi, 2012</xref>). Finland has not traditionally recognized gifted education, in particular, in its legislation. However, since the 1980s, the trends toward individuality and freedom of choice have increased possibilities of accelerated study for the gifted. As well, in recent years the national need to find new innovations for the future has placed a greater importance on understanding of the needs of the gifted, and special education for the talented has become central in Finland. In 2007, Finnish government programs, for the first time, mentioned fostering talent and creativity as national educational goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353212468066">Government Programme of Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen’s Cabinet, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353212468066">Government Programme of Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen’s second Cabinet, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162353212468066">Strategy of the Ministry of Education 2020 (2009)</xref> has acknowledged recognizing potential talent as one of the main development areas in Finland, and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353212468066">Ministry of Education and Culture’s (2012)</xref> recent development program “Education and Research 2011-2016” defined equality of education to mean that every person, including the gifted, is entitled to develop his or her different kinds of talent.</p>
<p>Despite these steps having been taken in educational policy, it is important to understand Finland’s limitations due to it being a comparatively large country geographically with a small population. For example, in 2011, Uusimaa had 36,600 upper secondary students, while Central Ostrobothnia and Kainuu, which have similar or larger geographical sizes, had only 1,378 and 1,666, respectively (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162353212468066">Official Statistics of Finland, 2012</xref>). Because of this, it will not be possible in the foreseeable future to have separate schools in Finland for the gifted. Therefore, the challenge remains as to how to guarantee equal opportunities for every gifted and talented child, even in sparsely populated areas.</p>
<p>First, more accurate information and knowledge regarding giftedness need to be available in the public discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212468066">Laine, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the role of Finnish teacher education and in-service education will be crucial in educating teachers to better recognize and support giftedness, and to differentiate teaching accordingly. Half of the Finnish teachers who participated in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353212468066">Kuusisto, Gholami, &amp; Tirri, 2012</xref>) were found to have a <italic>growth</italic> mindset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162353212468066">Dweck, 2006</xref>), meaning they believed that students can develop their intelligence and personality. However, the other half felt differently—16% had a <italic>fixed</italic> mindset, indicating that they considered students’ ability to learn and develop their intelligence or personality to be fixed, while 34% had mixed mindset: growth mindset on intelligence and fixed mindset on personality or vice versa. Thus, in a larger perspective, teachers’ attitudes toward learning and development, as well as giftedness, require in-depth consideration.</p>
<p>Third, when comparing the current situation of gifted programs with that of the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162353212468066">Tirri, 1997</xref>), we can see that Finland has established its strength in supporting academic and creative talent through gifted programs and special schools. The trend has been for Finland to invest particularly in mathematics and linguistics; programs that foster the social and affective needs of gifted pupils are lacking, and intellectually gifted children often need nurturing in these areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353212468066">Andreani &amp; Pagnin, 1993</xref>). Therefore teachers, school counselors, and psychologists need more in-service education to better understand the importance of the social-emotional aspects of giftedness, so that these students might be provided opportunities to find like-minded peers and fit more completely into the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162353212468066">Tirri, 2012</xref>). However, no large-scale evaluations of special schools have been conducted in Finland, despite the acknowledgment of this need in 2010 by the Ministry of Education. So the future challenge for gifted programs is to concentrate on the core aim of Finnish education, which is to support the growth of the whole person.</p>
<p>Fourth, holistic education acknowledges not only the importance of the social and affective domains in students’ development but also student’s moral concerns. Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162353212468066">Tirri’s (2011)</xref> review, higher intellectual ability does not predict mature moral judgment; rather, moral judgment requires moral motivation and moral sensitivity. Gifted students may possess the best cognitive and logical thinking skills but may lack the ethical sensitivity that is needed to deal with moral issues. A recent study showed that highly gifted students in science asked less moral questions than scientific or societal ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162353212468066">Tirri, Tolppanen, Aksela, &amp; Kuusisto, 2012</xref>). A similar trend has been noted in earlier studies with gifted preadolescents and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162353212468066">Tirri &amp; Nokelainen, 2006</xref>). Thus, the goal is that in gifted programs, teachers actively focus on and discuss not only science but also moral questions with the gifted, since nurturing moral growth might be the best way to serve gifted and talented students in Finland and beyond.</p>
