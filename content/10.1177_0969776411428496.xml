<p>In Europe a range of segregation studies can be found in the North, West and South, but hardly any in Central Eastern Europe – a region where the major economic and political changes induced by the demise of socialism in 1989 contributed to new social divisions and related spatial patterns. However, these changes have not been uniform and have resulted in context-specific outcomes. Relying on data on the socio-occupational structure of the population from the National Census 2002 at the census tract scale, this article explores the levels and patterns of social segregation in three major Polish cities: Łódź, Cracow and Warsaw, urban areas that reflect divergent paths of more and less successful post-socialist transformations. This contribution concludes that, more than a decade after the demise of socialism, census tracts still generally contained populations that were heterogeneous with regard to socio-occupational status and that socioeconomic transformations in Poland and the social toll these processes involved have not yet been fully translated into intra-urban spaces.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is 20 years since the collapse of socialism and the beginning of national, regional and urban transformations in Central Eastern Europe (CEE). The proliferation of neoliberal policy agendas, the region-wide withdrawal of the ‘totalitarian’ welfare state and the growing exposure to global markets have had dramatic impacts. These transformations, however, did not result in uniform effects. Historically developed, context-specific and path-dependent characteristics of specific cities and regions gave rise to a range of outcomes. Thus, since 1989, outcomes have reflected both the contrasts in the earlier (socialist and pre-socialist) contexts and development trajectories, and the differences in recently adopted, post-socialist development strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0969776411428496">Pickles and Smith, 1998</xref>). Indeed, the systemic transformation of CEE resulted in increasing regional and local socioeconomic inequalities and, thus, in the emergence of ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ in transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0969776411428496">Węcławowicz, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the development of regional and urban systems under socialism was characterized by tangible socioeconomic inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969776411428496">Fuchs and Demko, 1979</xref>), the demise of socialism triggered a phase of profoundly uneven regional economic growth and decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969776411428496">Dunford and Smith, 2000</xref>). In general, economic growth has tended to be concentrated in larger cities that have been at the forefront of reforms since the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0969776411428496">Stenning, 2004</xref>). In particular, the capital cities of post-socialist states are argued to have experienced the most noticeable social change and the fastest economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0969776411428496">Stanilov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969776411428496">Musterd and Murie, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0969776411428496">Smith and Timar, 2010</xref>). Conversely, regions less exposed to globalization and internationalization, such as former mono-industrial mill towns with limited variety in their industrial structures as well as peripheral regions, witnessed a much slower pace of change and struggle with economic and demographic shrinkage.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the socialist phase was characterized by labour market segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0969776411428496">Szelényi, 1978</xref>), actual income inequalities were substantially lower than income inequalities in other systems at similar levels of industrial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969776411428496">Heyns, 2005</xref>). Most enthusiastically embraced in Poland and usually implemented in a less radical form elsewhere in CEE, a ‘shock therapy’ approach to transformation – a process involving an immediate removal of all price controls and state subsidies as well as a rapid privatization of almost all state assets – resulted in significant labour market transformations. Those post-1989 institutional arrangements, coupled with rapid globalization, economic restructuring and welfare state retrenchment, gave rise to labour market segmentation, growing income inequalities (polarization), unemployment, increasing non-participation in the labour market, a decreasing security of employment contracts and vanishing safety nets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969776411428496">Hörschelmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0969776411428496">Smith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969776411428496">Bandelj and Mahutga, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0969776411428496">Stenning et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, labour market segmentation between and within sectors, which is reflected in income inequalities, significantly contributed to a new, post-socialist stratification of social (socio-occupational) classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0969776411428496">Węcławowicz, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The rise of new income inequalities seems to follow the patterns of regional economic growth in CEE. Accordingly, in capital and larger cities, where systemic transformations and globalization have been most advanced and where the most rapid development has been noted, neoliberalizing urban change has come with significant social costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0969776411428496">Smith and Timar, 2010</xref>). Concomitantly, concepts such as social exclusion, social inclusion and social polarization have been suggested to describe newly emerging socio-spatial disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0969776411428496">Węcławowicz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969776411428496">Kovács, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0969776411428496">Sýkora, 1999b</xref>). It is therefore surprising that urban regions and changes in urban forms and structures have largely remained outside the mainstream transformation debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0969776411428496">Stanilov, 2007</xref>). At the same time, some scholars have argued that capital and large cities have been at the forefront of reforms and thus constitute a laboratory par excellence to study the economic and socio-spatial results of the massive political and economic changes that have been moulding societies and economies in CEE since 1989 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0969776411428496">Stenning, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>There are two common understandings of the term segregation: (1) segregation as <italic>pattern</italic> – the degree to which members of different ethnic/social groups live apart from each other; (2) segregation as a <italic>process</italic> by which such spatial inequality is produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969776411428496">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>: 92). Whereas there are numerous studies discussing the process of post-socialist segregation, the lack of empirical research is especially acute in studies on pattern description. In Europe, a range of such studies can be found in the North, West and South, but hardly any in CEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969776411428496">Malheiros, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969776411428496">Musterd, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969776411428496">Andersson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969776411428496">Arapoglou and Sayas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0969776411428496">Sýkora, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969776411428496">Musterd and Van Kempen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0969776411428496">Van Kempen and Murie, 2009</xref>). These studies would allow for a comparison of patterns of segregation in post-socialist cities with other urban regions in and outside CEE. More importantly, they would also enable an evaluation of the differentiated socio-spatial consequences of rising inequalities after socialism. In this article we will therefore address the following questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0969776411428496" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What are the levels and patterns of socio-spatial segregation in major Polish cities after socialism?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How can different levels of socio-spatial segregation between these cities be understood, using empirical information on the various Polish contexts and a more general theoretical framework developed for understanding urban inequality?</p></list-item></list>
<p>The emphasis of this contribution is empirical, with a focus on three major Polish cities: Łódź, Cracow and Warsaw – large urban areas of more than 600,000 inhabitants that reflect divergent paths of post-socialist transformation. We illustrate the influence of different contexts on the level and local patterns of post-socialist social segregation.</p>
<p>The following section sketches theoretical ideas regarding the development of urban social inequality in the Western world, as well as general similarities and differences between processes and patterns of social segregation in CEE after 1989. We then provide a succinct description of the case studies and discuss the methodology, methods and research materials. After elaborating on separation and concentration measures and on local patterns of residential segregation in Łódź, Cracow and Warsaw, we will interpret the differences within the wider theoretical and empirical framework sketched before.</p>

<title>Theorizing social inequality</title>
<p>Endorsing the argument that national, regional and local contexts mould the ground-level reality of post-socialist transformation, and the pace of segregation processes in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969776411428496">Burgers and Musterd, 2002</xref>), there are grounds for supposing that the scale, intensity and consequences of socio-spatial inequalities are sensitive to the character, history, size and rank of the city. Local urban and regional settings require much attention when differences in levels of socio-spatial inequality are to be understood. Local characteristics, which have been shaped in the recent and ‘deeper’ past, will influence economic and social processes and prospects in today’s urban contexts. Urban histories will co-determine whether and how regions will be affected by contemporary macroeconomic processes such as ‘globalization’, ‘internationalization’ and ‘economic restructuring’. Global forces and new international divisions of labour result in changing economic conditions across the globe. Specific parts of production that used to be found in the Western world have been shifted to elsewhere, while other parts (mainly high-tech, capital-intensive or highly interlinked economic clusters) have remained in former industrial countries. These continue to be converted into centres of advanced business services and centres in which control functions, creative industries and knowledge-intensive industries can be found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0969776411428496">Sassen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969776411428496">Musterd and Murie, 2010</xref>). However, this is not a clear-cut division, because the latter industries are also rapidly gaining position in other places in the world. Local economic structures seem to depend on more than just the general processes of globalization, improved interconnectedness and economic restructuring. Local states and their economic and wider welfare regimes, as well as regional and local historically determined economic and social profiles, also shape the conditions for further economic and social opportunities and effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969776411428496">Esping-Andersen, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>What does that imply for the expectations of socio-spatial inequality? The basis for the expectations has been formed by two scholars in particular. The first, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0969776411428496">Saskia Sassen (1991)</xref>, argued that processes of globalization and economic restructuring would have major impacts on social processes in so-called ‘global’ cities. These cities would be attractive to high-skilled professionals but also to unskilled employees, who could find jobs in the consumer services needed for the high-skilled advanced service workers. This would result in social polarization in these global cities: working rich versus working poor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0969776411428496">William Julius Wilson (1987)</xref>, the second scholar, offered an alternative theory. He argued that global forces and economic restructuring would result in a mismatch between the demand for and supply of jobs. The skills currently needed simply would not fit demand any more. This would result not in a polarization between working poor and working rich, but in a distinction between those who have a job and those who do not. However, Wilson did not talk about global cities. He in fact addressed ‘other cities’. This gives room to distinguish between the types of cities that would be affected by these processes depending on their current position. In other words, if a city has a Sassen-like profile of a global city of the first, second or third order, economic change might produce some level of social polarization. However, if a city does not have such a global city profile, but its character is clearly affected by a specific historically determined economic profile that would not fit today’s requirements, then these cities might have to cope with a mismatch between labour market demand and supply. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969776411428496">Burgers and Musterd (2002)</xref> argued that cities that are not (very well) able to connect to the global processes, and that are characterized by an economic profile that is connected to ‘old’ manufacturing industries and related activities and professional structures, might experience a Wilson-like mismatch problem. This would become visible in high levels of unemployment.</p>
<p>This implies that the context is crucial. We distinguish between two major types of context: welfare states and historically produced contexts. Welfare states may or may not reduce the polarization and mismatch effects by focusing on reducing social inequality, by redistributing and rebalancing social policies, by specific allocation policies, and by putting efforts into retraining those who have inadequate professional skills. Secondly, the historically produced contexts are crucial. When – over the centuries – cities have developed as important centres, such as capitals of countries, as major trade centres, as financial and control centres or as multi-layered cities with a varied range of economic activities, then these cities will more easily adapt to new circumstances compared with cities that have experienced less important, mono-functional and single-layered development pathways (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969776411428496">Bontje and Musterd, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>We hypothesize that capital cities and important, multi-layered and well-connected cities will show more social polarization and social inequality, resulting in growing segregation, whereas other cities will experience mismatch and show higher levels of unemployment, less social polarization and lower levels of segregation. How does that match up with post-socialist cities?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0969776411428496">
<title>Social inequalities and spatial segregation after socialism</title>
<p>Almost five decades of socialism meant relatively low social and income inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969776411428496">Heyns, 2005</xref>), permanent housing shortages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0969776411428496">Szelényi, 1983</xref>), an absence of real estate markets and a population distribution that relied on housing policy and on the ideological/social value of the labour force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969776411428496">Gentile and Sjöberg, 2010</xref>). These factors, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0969776411428496">Szelényi (1987</xref>: 7) put it, ‘produced an un-egalitarian system of housing allocation, which produced, and reproduced, residential segregation of occupational groups’. The return to the market economy, private capital, global markets and local territorial self-government initiated numerous processes that profoundly changed the societies and spaces of CEE. However, transformations occurred at different paces. Whereas political change and the implementation of crucial economic institutional arrangements were completed in a relatively short period of time, the change of settlement system will take decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0969776411428496">Sýkora, 1999a</xref>). The systemic transformations in the 1990s mainly unfolded in the inherited built-environment. Nevertheless, socioeconomic and physical changes have been much more advanced in capital cities and other large cities.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that globalization, labour market segmentation and welfare state retrenchment led to a rise in social and income inequalities in CEE. In turn, it was argued that newly emerging social inequalities coupled with differentiation of housing supply and changes in housing policy were triggering increasing social and ethnic residential segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969776411428496">Kovács, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0969776411428496">Węcławowicz, 1998</xref>). As a review of the literature on the complex geographies of housing and socio-spatial re-differentiation in CEE under transition has already been successfully undertaken elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0969776411428496">Tsenkova and Nedović-Budić, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969776411428496">Borén and Gentile, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0969776411428496">Stanilov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0969776411428496">Sýkora, 2009</xref>), we will limit our discussion to key processes that have significantly contributed to new social disparities and to local patterns of social segregation.</p>
<p>Since the level and patterns of residential segregation of the metropolis are a mediated outcome of employment structures generated by the production system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0969776411428496">Scott, 1988</xref>), one could argue that the transformation of the labour markets in CEE led to labour market segmentation and a concomitant growth of inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0969776411428496">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). Those inequalities set off major changes in the social structures after 1989. In general, post-socialist society could be roughly divided into two groups: the ‘winners’ and the ‘losers’ in transition. The former label pertains to white-collar workers, who witnessed the most significant growth in incomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969776411428496">Domański, 2004</xref>). This category, comprising the ‘elite’ and the middle class, primarily comes from the former communist elite, the communist upper- and middle-grade nomenclature members, part of the former anti-communist opposition, and part of the intelligentsia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0969776411428496">Węcławowicz, 2002</xref>). In contrast, industrial workers, the working poor and the unemployed form a much bigger, albeit varied, group of ‘losers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0969776411428496">Węcławowicz, 2004</xref>). In consequence, the major line of social divisions separates a relatively small elite from a more significant collection of those who lost their privileges and real income.</p>
<p>Changes in the housing system, especially the neoliberal development of land markets and substantial involvement of private developers, reinforce new social inequalities as well. Owing to massive privatization, often for a small portion of the actual price, the evolution of housing systems in CEE indicates a rapid increase in the level of owner-occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969776411428496">Ball, 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, Poland and the Czech Republic are still characterized by a partial preservation of former housing subsidies that is manifested by a relatively significant share of municipal/social stock and rent regulations in public and restituted housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969776411428496">Lux and Sunega, 2010</xref>). Since real estate prices skyrocketed in CEE in the mid-1990s, the move to new or reconstructed housing has mainly been limited to higher social classes that benefited not only from labour market segmentation but also from the privatization of housing. Lower social categories either stayed in the remaining public housing or became poor owners of dilapidated flats and buildings. In the latter case, they predominantly lack the resources to renovate their housing or to sell it and move to better-quality stock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969776411428496">Marcińczak and Sagan, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The emerging patterns of post-socialist segregation involve the socio-spatial results of suburbanization, gentrification and downgrading of the social status of some neighbourhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969776411428496">Brade et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0969776411428496">Sýkora, 2009</xref>). Rapid residential suburbanization is argued to be the dominant migration trend in the metropolitan areas of the CEE countries and a contributing factor to the development of social segregation at the city-suburban scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969776411428496">Leetmaa et al., 2009</xref>). It produced a centrifugal movement of population in the post-socialist city. The suburban and outer zones of post-socialist cities, inhabited by lower social strata under socialism, experienced rapid socio-spatial change. The majority of newcomers to the suburbs moved to newly constructed detached or semi-detached houses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0969776411428496">1</xref></sup> However, gated or otherwise protected condominiums are not unusual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969776411428496">Hirt, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to suburbanization, so far gentrification has proceeded in a piecemeal fashion and had more discrete and spatially limited results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0969776411428496">Sýkora, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969776411428496">Brade et al., 2009</xref>). Owing to the legacy of socialism, gentrification in CEE mostly occurs in the form of small-scale, luxury, new or renovated apartment buildings that are often mixed with socially and physically dilapidated urban fabric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969776411428496">Badyina and Golubchikov, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969776411428496">Kowalski and Śleszyński, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969776411428496">Murzyn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969776411428496">Kovács, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969776411428496">Cook, 2010</xref>). Supposedly doomed to become the slums of the 21st century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0969776411428496">Szelényi, 1996</xref>), and despite population outflow, socialist housing estates still seem to maintain their medium social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0969776411428496">Sýkora, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969776411428496">Kährik and Tammaru, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969776411428496">Marcińczak and Sagan, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though a huge number of papers have been published on the topic of post-socialist segregation, systematic empirical studies on patterns are still lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0969776411428496">Sýkora, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0969776411428496">Van Kempen and Murie, 2009</xref>). Although the term ‘social polarization’ has been repeated like a mantra since the early 1990s, there are virtually no studies that actually prove how segregated/polarized the post-socialist cities are. Recent studies of the changing patterns of residential segregation in the Prague metropolitan region between 1991 and 2001 proved the existence of a ‘paradox’ of post-socialist segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0969776411428496">Sýkora 2007</xref>) – the levels of segregation of particular social groups were rather low and decreasing during the period studied. This rather counterintuitive process was thought to stem from the temporarily smoothing effect of suburbanization and gentrification and the enduring stability of the residential structure of panel block estates.</p>
<p>However, because the most popular subjects of empirical investigation since 1990 have been the capital cities of CEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0969776411428496">Sýkora, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0969776411428496">Stanilov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969776411428496">Brade et al., 2009</xref>), our understanding of ongoing urban transformations in this part of the world is skewed towards a handful of urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969776411428496">Borén and Gentile, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969776411428496">Marcińczak and Sagan, 2011</xref>). In this connection, it is necessary to emphasize that the actual manifestation of socio-spatial restructuring is sensitive to the character, history, size and rank of the city, as expressed in the theoretical sections above. It is also important to bear in mind that studies on post-socialist social residential segregation have mostly relied on the level of education as the main variable approximating social status (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0969776411428496">Sýkora, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969776411428496">Kovács, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0969776411428496">Spevec and Klempić-Bogadi, 2009</xref>). This has enabled a comparison between the socialist and post-socialist period. The level of education is generally a good indicator of social strata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0969776411428496">Tammaru and Leetmaa, 2007</xref>), yet it has some limitations and does not entirely reflect the wider spectrum of the social (socio-occupational) structure and, thus, of post-socialist social and income inequalities.</p>
<p>In this context, the current article aims to elaborate on the scale and variety of the patterns of social segregation in the three major Polish cities, within the wider context of social segregation in Europe.</p>

<title>Data and research materials</title>
<p>The statistical unit (SU), which is the equivalent of a census tract, is widely used in segregation research on both sides of the Atlantic, and it has been chosen as the primary unit of global and local segregation analysis here as well. Statistical units are compact and small, functionally and morphologically homogeneous, with borders that usually coincide with visible features such as streets, railways or rivers. In 2002 there were 595 SU in Cracow, 720 SU in Łódź, and 1441 SU in Warsaw that had data on the socio-occupational structure of the population.</p>
<p>The data used in the analysis of social segregation are 2002 census data on population and housing that cover Łódź, Cracow and Warsaw. So far, this data set is the most reliable source of information on the social and demographic structure of the population that is available in census releases in Poland. Unfortunately, the different methodologies applied in the 1988 and 2002 censuses do not allow for direct comparisons over time between particular socio-occupational groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0969776411428496">2</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the socio-occupational classification of the population available from the 2002 census (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969776411428496">Table 1</xref>) has proved to be very useful in tracing social inequalities. Although Polish censuses do not include income data, the available division into different socio-occupational categories directly corresponds with post-socialist labour market segmentation and income inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969776411428496">Central Statistical Office, 2006</xref>) and with the proposed division into particular social classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0969776411428496">Węcławowicz, 1996</xref>).</p>

<p>For the analysis of global and local concentration patterns, we merged the original socio-occupational categories presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969776411428496">Table 1</xref> and divided them into four major groups. This new division was based on the degree of income disparities between particular groups and the social-class differentiation of the original categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0969776411428496">Węcławowicz, 1996</xref>). The categories ‘managers’ and ‘professionals’ were combined into a new category ‘higher class’. The categories ‘clerks’, ‘technicians’ and ‘machine operators’ comprised the ‘middle’ class. ‘Unskilled workers’, ‘sales and service workers’ and ‘industrial workers’ were aggregated to form the ‘lower’ class. The average income of the ‘higher’ class was roughly three times higher than that of the ‘lower’ class and two times higher than that of the ‘middle’ class. The income of the ‘middle’ class generally matched the average income in Poland, which was around 2500 Polish <italic>zlotys</italic> (approximately €620) in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969776411428496">Central Statistical Office, 2006</xref>). As an indicator of social weaknesses, the category ‘unemployed’ was left unchanged.</p>

<title>Case studies</title>
<p>Łódź, Cracow and Warsaw – the three most populous cities in Poland – reflect divergent paths of urbanization. As a product of raw ‘capitalism’, Łódź started its rapid economic and population development as a centre for the textile industry in the mid-19th century. Before World War II, the city was characterized by the lowest living standards, substantial housing shortages and one of the highest levels of employment in manufacturing industry in Poland. Under socialism, its character as a mill town was not only preserved but also reinforced. The economic structure was subordinated to textile production and the city maintained its ‘blue-collar’ character.</p>
<p>In contrast to Łódź, Cracow, a medieval town and the capital of Poland before 1596, from the very beginning relied on trade, administration and education. Said to be the capital of the Polish intelligentsia, Cracow and its social structure changed radically in the late 1940s when the new town of Nowa Huta, truly socialist in plan and design, was constructed along with a gigantic steelworks on the eastern outskirts of Cracow. This socialist investment, later merged with Cracow, was in particular aimed at introducing the working class into the world of the intelligentsia.</p>
<p>Warsaw, the capital city, has maintained its privileged position since before World War II. Unfortunately, unlike Łódź and Cracow, Warsaw suffered extensive damage during World War II that destroyed 80 percent of its buildings. Although the historic core of the city was reconstructed, vast areas of the former city centre were rebuilt in socialist style, including a very large central square for parades. Consequently, a new socialist centre for the socialist state capital was constructed. In Warsaw, the socialist period resulted in further industrialization (steelworks, a car factory, etc.), in population growth and in the clustering of employment in administration and planning. This clustering was actively supported by the former centrally planned economy. It is worth mentioning that, owing to its privileged position, Warsaw was subjected to a very selective inflow of population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0969776411428496">Rykiel, 1984</xref>). As regards the segregation patterns under socialism, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0969776411428496">Węcławowicz (1992)</xref>, Cracow and Warsaw tended to be the most segregated cities in Poland (in contrast to Łódź) as measured by the segregation of people with higher education.</p>
<p>The first signs of new regional disparities were already clearly visible in the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0969776411428496">Węcławowicz, 1996</xref>). Accordingly, some regions, especially large, multifunctional, diverse cities such as Warsaw, Poznań, Gdańsk, Wrocław and Cracow, were labelled as the ‘leaders in transformation’. It was argued that former mono-industrial regions based on extractive and basic processing industries, in particular Łódź and Katowice, were lagging behind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0969776411428496">Węcławowicz, 1996</xref>). More recent studies indicate an ossification of development patterns and further growth of regional inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0969776411428496">Węcławowicz, 2004</xref>), which have been more recently reinforced by the selective inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI).</p>
<p>Like other large cities in CEE, Łódź, Cracow and Warsaw witnessed rapid demographic, social and economic change. Closer inspection of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969776411428496">Table 1</xref> reveals a sharp difference between Warsaw and the other two second-tier cities. The disparities are especially evident in economic indicators. In particular, the level of gross regional product (GRP) per capita, mean personal income, municipal revenue and the number of companies with foreign capital are much higher in Warsaw than in Łódź and Cracow. Comparing Łódź and Cracow, one can observe an uneven pace of transformation outside the capital. Whereas Cracow experienced population growth from 1989 to 2002, Łódź lost nearly 10 percent of its population. Other social and economic indicators also point to the relatively more successful development of Cracow. Cracow also seems to be the most advanced in terms of housing privatization – the city had the lowest share of social housing in 2002.</p>
<p>A brief overview of the basic indicators in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969776411428496">Table 1</xref> generally reveals three distinctive faces of urban transformation after socialism. Warsaw, a ‘winner’ in transition, is characterized by steady population and economic growth, high salaries, increasing employment in more advanced services and wide exposure to globalization. The city seems to have achieved the status of a European metropolis that is internationally connected. This status goes along with significant labour market polarization. Cracow, a second-tier city that is undergoing rapid deindustrialization and subsequent development of the tertiary sector, is proving to be a regional-scale ‘winner’. On the one hand, the city is experiencing employment growth in low-paid services owing to high tourist numbers. On the other hand, there is a parallel rapid development of the financial management sector. Consequently, it is argued that Cracow’s labour market is also polarizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0969776411428496">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). Łódź has to be called a ‘regional’ loser. From 1989 to 2002, Łódź experienced almost total economic breakdown as the textile industry completely collapsed. The early 1990s were characterized by an enormous mismatch between the supply of and demand for labour, with massive unemployment and consequent pauperization of residents. In the late 1990s, a favourable shift was achieved and the city slowly developed – mostly owing to FDI in manufacturing industry such as the household appliances cluster of Indesit, Bosch and Siemens or, much later, the computer factory of Dell. Nevertheless, Łódź still suffers from high unemployment, population shrinkage and a lower level of economic development. Accordingly, accepting the argument that social inequalities are higher in big cities and in rapidly globalizing regions and then polarizing in particular, we should expect socio-spatial segregation to be lower in Łódź and higher in Warsaw, with Cracow in the middle.</p>

<sec id="section8-0969776411428496">
<title>Methodologies and methods</title>
<p>Referring to the recent debate on the measurement of patterns of segregation, two main strands of research can be distinguished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0969776411428496">Peach, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969776411428496">Johnston et al., 2010</xref>): (1) a more traditional index-based approach that dates back to the early Chicago School, and (2) a more recent raw data approach. Reflecting two main dimensions of residential segregation – evenness and exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0969776411428496">Reardon and O’Sullivan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969776411428496">Brown and Chung, 2006</xref>) – these strands pertain to two wider notions of spatial segregation: spatial separation and spatial concentration. The first notion applies to the residential separation of a group within a broader population: the greater the deviation from an even (uniform) distribution, the greater the degree of separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0969776411428496">Van Kempen and Özüekren, 1998</xref>). The concept of concentration highlights the problem of an overrepresentation of a particular group in selected neighbourhoods and is often concerned with local spatial patterns of segregation.</p>
<p>The index-based approach has been limited to global studies of segregation. In such studies the term ‘segregation’ applies to a wider area only (a city within administrative boundaries or an urban region) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0969776411428496">Reardon, 2006</xref>). The indices of dissimilarity (ID)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0969776411428496">3</xref></sup> and of segregation (IS)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0969776411428496">4</xref></sup> have been the most pervasive tools employed to measure the level of ethnic and social segregation across time and space. Despite their purely descriptive and global character, those measures are still commonly used in segregation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0969776411428496">Simpson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Developed over a decade ago, the raw data approach generally denies the validity of traditional indices in segregation research and of dissimilarity and segregation indices in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0969776411428496">Poulsen et al., 2001</xref>). Because this approach is exclusively concerned with concentration patterns, its advocates generally endorse the properties of the isolation index only. Especially in modified composition-invariant form (the modified index of isolation – MII<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0969776411428496">5</xref></sup>), this measure is argued to be acceptable in comparative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969776411428496">Johnston and Jones, 2010</xref>). Introduced and popularized by Johnston, Poulsen and Forrest (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0969776411428496">Poulsen et al., 2002</xref>), threshold analysis, along with concentration profiles, seems to be one of the main analytical tools of this approach. Recently, this approach has also been more closely dealing with the methods of exploratory spatial data analysis, methods that uncover local patterns of ethnic/social segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969776411428496">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, as recent studies indicate, the choice of measurement can lead to conflicting results (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0969776411428496">Simpson, 2004</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969776411428496">Johnston et al., 2005</xref>). Consequently, it can be argued that any comprehensive study on residential segregation should simultaneously incorporate methods and measures that address the two notions of segregation. It should also be emphasized that, so far, studies of segregation have primarily developed the topic of ethnic segregation, whereas the social (socioeconomic) dimension has usually been under-researched (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969776411428496">Musterd, 2005</xref>). This is especially true of concentration studies.</p>
<p>This study proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, deploying indices of segregation, the global level of social segregation in Łódź, Cracow and Warsaw in 2002 is assessed. Accordingly, the dissimilarity index (ID), the segregation index (IS) and the modified index of isolation (MII) were computed for nine socio-occupational categories. Additionally, in order to examine the patterns of concentration of different social groups more closely, concentration profiles were produced for the four broader socio-occupational groups (classes). In the second stage, in order to put more geography in, the local patterns of social segregation in the three cities were investigated. We limited our analysis to three groups: higher and lower classes and the unemployed. The location quotient (LQ) was used to illustrate spatial patterns of concentration. To distinguish between places of concentration and significant concentration of particular social strata, the results of the LQ were scaled based on the properties of the binominal distribution (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969776411428496">Musterd and Deurloo, 1997</xref>). LQs were independently computed and scaled for each social class examined in this study. To reveal the ground-level reality of residential segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969776411428496">Brown and Chung, 2006</xref>), we provided key housing characteristics (tenure and age structure of the housing stock) for the places of concentration and significant concentration of each social group. In addition to housing characteristics, data on the inflow of newcomers from other parts of Poland were also included.</p>

<title>Socio-occupational disparities at the global scale</title>
<p>Index-based analysis of the separation and concentration of particular social groups reveals a generally low level of segregation. Regarding the separation of socio-occupational categories, the relatively even distribution of the analysed groups was confirmed by IS indices in the low 20s or lower. Despite the marked difference in social segregation in the late socialist phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0969776411428496">Węcławowicz, 1992</xref>), the differences between Łódź, Cracow and Warsaw in the level of social segregation in 2002 turn out to be negligible (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0969776411428496">Table 2</xref>). Although more studies on the dynamics of segregation after socialism are needed to provide a meaningful explanation of this phenomenon, one can speculate that the ‘paradox’ of the post-socialist transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0969776411428496">Sýkora, 2009</xref>) is more tangible in the more prosperous and better-connected cities. The results of IS indices seem to be in line with a wider pan-European trend concerning the nature of socio-spatial disparities. As in the socialist city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969776411428496">Ladányi, 1989</xref>) and in the West European city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969776411428496">Musterd, 2005</xref>), the segregation curves in Łódź, Cracow and Warsaw are characterized by an irregular ‘U shape’. The higher social categories tend to be more separated from the remainder of the population than the lower categories, and, consequently, the lower social categories lean towards socially heterogeneous neighbourhoods. Nevertheless, both the higher and lower groups were more segregated than the middle social class from the rest.</p>

<p>The separation of socio-occupational categories was further illuminated by the indices of dissimilarity (ID). This measure was calculated to evaluate the level of separation between each pair of social groups in each city. The results are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0969776411428496">Table 3</xref>. The level of segregation is almost perfectly in line with the social distance between particular categories. The trend seems to indicate that the wider the gap in socio-occupational status, the higher the unevenness in spatial distribution. This pattern confirms the more substantial separation of higher social categories and the socially mixed character of neighbourhoods of middle and lower social strata. Moreover, the results appear to confirm a primary bipartite split between white-collar and blue-collar social groups and neighbourhoods, which has been argued to be the major line of social divisions in the capitalist city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0969776411428496">Scott, 1988</xref>). This regularity was consistent in each city. However, some minor differences stemming from inherited social profiles could be reported. In Cracow, one can still observe a relatively stronger separation of white-collar and blue-collar occupations, that seems to result from the general division between ‘old’ Cracow and Nowa Huta.</p>

<p>As with the IS indices, the modified index of isolation (MII) reveals a generally low level of residential isolation. This index also confirms the trend illustrated by the analysis of separation: in each city, higher classes were more isolated compared with lower classes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0969776411428496">Table 2</xref>). Only in Łódź does the pattern seem to be distorted by a relatively higher level of isolation of the unemployed than in the other cities. Since MII is compositionally invariant, the Łódź condition could have had its roots not only in a more significant proportion of unemployed compared with Cracow and Warsaw, but also in this group’s patterns of concentration and the city’s development path.</p>
<p>Additional clarification of the character of social segregation in Łódź, Cracow and Warsaw is provided by the concentration profiles of the four wider socio-occupational classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0969776411428496">Figure 1</xref>). The figure illustrates the cumulative distribution of each social group in each city across the threshold bands (0, 10, 20, 30…). The data for Łódź, Cracow and Warsaw show that members of the higher class tend to live in ‘socio-occupational’ enclaves, areas where this category accounts for 30 percent or more of the total population. In contrast to the indices, this method illustrates apparent differences between the cities. The level of spatial concentration of the better-off is much higher in Warsaw than in the other two cities. In the capital city, 10 percent of the population classified as higher class lives in neighbourhoods where the members of this social group comprise at least 30 percent of the total population. Moreover, the scale of concentration of the higher class – highest in Warsaw and lowest in Łódź – appears to confirm the argument that post-socialist capital cities are indeed more segregated. The lower classes are most concentrated in Łódź and least in Warsaw. Although it is tempting to suggest that the level of residential concentration of particular social classes is sensitive to the pace of economic development and post-socialist transformations, more research in different contexts is needed to draw any meaningful conclusions.</p>

<p>On the basis of index calculations we found that the level of social segregation is low and fairly similar across the cities. These findings thus shed new light on the phenomenon of socio-spatial polarization in the post-socialist city. In 2002, the lower social groups were not substantially segregated from the higher social categories, at least not at the scale of census tracts (neighbourhoods), unlike in Western cities, where the phenomenon of social polarization was clearly identified. Nonetheless, this relative socio-occupational heterogeneity of many neighbourhoods does not necessarily exclude socio-spatial polarization. As illustrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969776411428496">Marcińczak and Sagan (2011)</xref>, in some districts of post-socialist cities, inner cities in particular, growing social heterogeneity often implies socio-spatial polarization at the micro scale of individual buildings. In other words, actual upgrading is frequently limited to single properties located in the physically and socially decaying neighbourhoods. It thus seems that labour market segmentation and rising income and social inequalities have not been fully expressed in urban space yet. It also appears that the inherited ecological structures, in which new socio-spatial change unfolds, are still significant and, so far, contribute to growing heterogeneity.</p>
<p>As Łódź, Cracow and Warsaw had distinctively higher levels of social segregation in the late socialist phase, and recent social segregation has been significantly lower in Łódź than in other large cities in Poland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0969776411428496">Węcławowicz, 1992</xref>), one could speculate a smoothing effect of transformation that is not only tangible inside the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0969776411428496">Sýkora, 2009</xref>) but also sensitive to the pace of change in different cities. Diverse patterns of segregation were uncovered by the concentration profiles. This clearly indicates that the level of concentration of particular social groups is notably different in each city. The capital city is the most segregated, at least in terms of the concentration of the higher classes.</p>

<p>The results provided by the LQ maps offer a number of telling insights into the similarities and differences in the patterns of spatial concentration of the social classes in Łódź, Cracow and Warsaw.

<p>Illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0969776411428496">Figure 2</xref>, the patterns of spatial concentration of the higher social strata in each city reveal a considerable degree of similarity. In Łódź, Cracow and Warsaw, this social class tends to concentrate in a discrete rather than a contiguous manner. This type of distribution is especially visible in the central areas, which were neglected under socialism. The central districts are also the places where the major differences between the less and the more prosperous cities can be found. In each city this social category resides either in the former bourgeois tenements or, especially in Warsaw, in the apartment buildings of the socialist era. The higher-class concentration in central areas is least significant in Łódź. Despite the scale of the socialist era redevelopment in Warsaw and the related social consequences, it appears that demand for inner-city regeneration of largely dilapidated stock is much lower in a shrinking city such as Łódź than in the more rapidly developing Warsaw and Cracow (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969776411428496">Kowalski and Śleszyński, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969776411428496">Murzyn, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in each city, the higher strata’s concentration patterns in the outer zones – areas outside the historic cores – seem to be more clustered and form sector-like constellations. This could be partially explained by the legacy of the socialist phase, when new prefabricated housing estates that attracted higher-status residents were constructed along the main communication arteries. Also the reserves of residential land in outer zones that were never developed under socialism have resulted in a growing rate of new construction on easily available and accessible greenfield sites.</p>
<p>Closer inspection of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0969776411428496">Table 4</xref> reveals that the legacy of socialism in both the tenure and the age structure of housing was quite significant. The higher class still relies heavily on the late-socialist era cooperative stock. Under socialism, the down payment was much higher on cooperative apartments, but a higher standard was guaranteed and owners were allowed to sell the apartment or leave it to their heirs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969776411428496">Ciechocińska, 1987</xref>). It thus seems that the socialist era cooperative block estates, primarily those of higher quality constructed in the mid-1970s and later, have retained their medium to higher social status. Nonetheless, private ownership among the higher class is also substantial. This shows that the higher social categories have largely followed new housing investments. This is particularly evident in Warsaw, where more than 50 percent of housing in the areas in which the higher class is significantly overrepresented was constructed after 1989. Finally, concerning the inflow of newcomers, which is no longer regulated, it seems that this process is contributing to the concentration of higher social categories in both Warsaw and Cracow. Consequently, one could argue that the phenomenon of the concentration of higher social groups has a more exogenous nature in a more rapidly developing post-socialist city than in a declining region.</p>
<p>Turning to the LQ maps of the lower social categories, these illustrate a remarkably different pattern of spatial distribution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0969776411428496">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0969776411428496">4</xref> reveal that the areas in which the lower social class is concentrated largely overlap with the locations where the unemployed are overrepresented. Both categories tend to be markedly concentrated in the outer and peripheral zones. Nevertheless, the parts of inner cities surrounding historical cores (the socialist zone in transition) also house a substantial proportion of the lower classes. The inner-city locations of the lower classes as well as their overrepresentation in the periphery were a salient feature of the socialist city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0969776411428496">Szelényi, 1983</xref>). As with the higher class, the lower strata’s concentration seems to have divergent spatial patterns in the ‘winning’ and ‘losing’ cities. The case of Łódź illustrates how the socialist legacy and the lack of larger-scale post-socialist regeneration has led to the social and physical decline of the inner city. This area is densely built up with 19th-century tenement houses, often of poor quality, which were constructed to house the rapidly growing population of the mill town. Already in the 1930s, this district was characterized by the worst living conditions compared with other large Polish cities at that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969776411428496">Marcińczak and Sagan, 2011</xref>). The situation worsened under socialism, when the higher social categories largely moved out to the panel blocks. This pattern should also be read as resulting from severe housing shortages under and after socialism that resulted in the continuing concentration of the lowest classes in the worst-quality stock.</p>
<p>In contrast to the higher strata, the lower strata mostly rely on social/municipal housing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0969776411428496">Table 4</xref>). Although this trend, which stems from socialist housing policy, was most evident in Łódź, it was also noticeable in Cracow and Warsaw. Comparing this finding with the age structure of the housing stock, one can point to pre-war inner-city tenements, nationalized under socialism and usually of low quality. Conversely, a relatively significant share of private housing tends to be related to the (often substandard) pre-socialist, rural single-family housing in the former suburban zone that was incorporated into the socialist city. Owing to permanent shortages, those areas were never redeveloped into a more urban form under socialism. Finally, the inflow of newcomers from other parts of Poland seems less important than in the areas where the higher class is concentrated and also of a relatively more rural character.</p>
<p>The analysis of local patterns of concentration reveals a distinctive format of socio-spatial divisions. Discretely located in urban space, the opposing social classes tend to be juxtaposed in each city. This trend is especially visible in the historic centres of Łódź, Warsaw and Cracow, and further confirms the rapid social change in the historic core of the post-socialist city (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969776411428496">Kovács, 2009</xref>). Comparing the LQ maps with the results of extensive factorial ecology studies on the largest cities in Poland in the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0969776411428496">Węcławowicz, 1988</xref>), in particular with the spatial distribution of the socio-occupational status of the population, one could argue that a general trajectory of socio-spatial change exists. On the one hand, it appears that the centrifugal movement of population to the outskirts was limited to the higher and middle classes and that the places of concentration of the lower strata are much more rooted in the inherited urban fabric. On the other hand, it also seems that the centrifugal movement of higher social groups resulted in the growing social heterogeneity of the peripheries of each city. In some cases, opposing social strata were overrepresented within the same statistical unit. This simply means that those areas were characterized by a ‘mix’. Finally, as in the late-socialist stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0969776411428496">Węcławowicz, 1988</xref>), in 2002 Łódź, Cracow and Warsaw appear to have preserved a mosaic-like structure of socio-spatial disparities. In turn, this mosaic seems to be maintained and, in part, made more explicit by the residential mobility of the higher and middle-level social classes and the relative residential immobility of the lower classes.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article, we have attempted to assess the level and local patterns of social residential segregation in three major Polish cities that represent divergent paths of post-socialist transformation. We hypothesized that the level of social inequality and thus of social segregation would be dependent on the degree of polarization and professionalization of labour markets. We also hypothesized that, as a result of more advanced globalization, the more prosperous and globally connected capital cities of CEE would be more segregated than declining old industrial areas that suffer from severe mismatch and mass unemployment. Consequently, we measured the extent of socio-occupational segregation to test whether parallel patterns of segregation typified Łódź, Cracow and Warsaw. We defined patterns of social residential segregation as the separation and concentration of population according to socio-occupational status.</p>
<p>A key finding of this study is the similarity in the residential distribution of the major occupational groups in the three cities, as measured by the indices of evenness and isolation. Global levels of segregation were virtually the same in more and less prosperous cities. Despite some minor inversions in rank order among the indices, the indices clearly show a low level of social segregation in each city. When compared with the levels in West European cities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969776411428496">Musterd, 2005</xref>), the magnitude of social segregation in the three cities appears to be average. The results thus reveal that, more than a decade after the demise of socialism, statistical units still generally contain a population that displays socio-occupational heterogeneity.</p>
<p>A somewhat different pattern of social segregation was discerned in the analysis of concentration patterns. The upshot of this method is arguably more in line with the hypothesized degree of segregation in the case-study cities. However, it seems that the expected order of the level of segregation was limited to the higher strata. The concentration patterns of the lower social groups were actually inversely related to the economic position and performance of the city. This finding also raises the question of measurement, which, in our opinion, cannot be limited to single number indices only.</p>
<p>In the final section of this article, we elaborated on the local patterns of social segregation in Łódź, Cracow and Warsaw. The local patterns of concentration of the examined social groups not only highlight the differences stemming from historically developed socio-spatial profiles but also illuminate the differences between more prosperous and less prosperous cities. It seems that the divergence in the pace of socio-economic change is most evident in the historic cores of the three cities. In particular, a more successful development path appears to mean a higher proportion of the better-off in the inner city. Further research is essential to discover what part of this concentration was inherited from the socialist phase and what part is of post-socialist origin.</p>
<p>As regards the influence of the post-socialist transitions on the level and patterns of social residential segregation, the conclusion seems to be that the effects of this relationship, as indicated by the case-study cities, are different from what has been argued in the literature on post-socialist urban change. Despite some minor differences in the level and patterns of separation and concentration in the examined cities, there is no clear evidence that post-socialist cities that are more successful and better positioned in the global economy are also more spatially segregated than those suffering from demographic and economic shrinkage. Accordingly, although higher income inequalities constitute the preconditions for higher residential segregation, the examined cases seem to indicate an opposite trend at the neighbourhood scale. In other words, the ‘shock therapy’ approach to transformation in Poland and the social toll this process involved have not yet been fully translated into intra-urban social space, at least not during the first decade since the return to a market economy.</p>
<p>A possible explanation is that the transformation of the inherited uneven spatial structures of the non-market economy is a process that appears to temporarily equalize socio-spatial divisions at the neighbourhood scale. One could thus argue that the spatial scale and pace of residential mobility have been curbed by the lingering legacy of the socialist socio-spatial arrangements, a phenomenon partly reinforced by the weak development of mortgage markets in CEE in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0969776411428496">Roy, 2008</xref>) and by the general continuation of pre-transformation security of tenure, as well as by a low supply of new or renovated affordable housing. Thus, the situation does not adequately reflect new social and income divisions and people’s housing aspirations, in particular the aspirations of the middle class. This, in turn, indicates the pervasive existence of a ‘dormant’ potential for contingent intra-urban migrations that dates back to the socialist era housing shortages. As yet it is unclear whether this equalizing tendency is more advanced in more rapidly globalizing post-socialist urban areas, particularly in capital cities. It is thus not appropriate, as far as the first decade since the demise of socialism is concerned, to view large post-socialist cities as socially polarized landscapes of clearly delineated and internally homogeneous neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>The increasing social mix of many neighbourhoods has brought distinctive spatial results. It arguably resulted in growing social segregation at the micro scale of neighbouring apartments, buildings and street blocks, a phenomenon that has contributed to the further fragmentation of the inherited socio-spatial mosaic. Yet, bearing in mind that income and social inequalities are now more significant than under socialism, one may equally argue that, whereas the spatial distance separating social classes in the post-socialist city has shrunk, the social (socio-material) distance has risen rapidly. Finally, if we assume further growth in income disparities, a more rapid tempo of residential suburbanization, accelerating gentrification as a result of a rise in mortgage lending and in housing production and the dwindling social status of panel block estates, then we consider the current social mix to be an intermediate stage in the evolution of the socio-spatial structure of the CEE city. The process will arguably result in a rising spatial separation of social classes and a growing residential concentration of higher social categories in more attractive central and suburban locations, while large-scale panel-block estates might eventually turn into the slums of the 21st century (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0969776411428496">Szelényi, 1996</xref>). It remains an open question whether the pendulum has already started to swing back in the second decade after the fall of socialism and whether those changes have responded to the uneven pace of regional development in CEE.</p>
