<p>Men’s Health</p>
<p>Men’s health is unnecessarily poor. Too many men still die prematurely with just 66% reaching the age of 75. Men are more likely than women to die from heart disease, cancer and suicide, to be overweight, to smoke and to drink alcohol excessively, yet men are less likely to use a wide range of health services effectively or to take part in health improvement programmes. In response, a special workshop on men’s health has been developed. This one-day course will be of value to all frontline staff working with men who have a remit to encourage males to improve and maintain good health.</p>

<title>More women giving birth later in life</title>
<p>New figures reveal that more women over 40 years are giving birth. Last year almost 30,000 women over 40 gave birth; three times more than in 1991.</p>
<p>Whilst the birth rate among the over 40s rose by 6.7%, for those aged under 20 years it fell by 8.7%. The figures, which were published by the Office of National Statistics, also showed the number of births in general rose by 22% in the past decade, reaching 724,000 in England and Wales in 2011. Encouragingly, the number of deaths has decreased for the third consecutive year and the figure has stayed below half a million at 484,367.</p>
<p>Fertility declines sharply after 35 years. However it is thought that the reason behind these figures is that more women are choosing to stay on in higher education and establish a career to ensure financial stability before starting a family.</p>
<p>The average age of mothers also increased last year to 29.7, up by 0.1 the previous year. The figures also showed more than a quarter of babies are now born to foreign-born mothers each year and almost half of children are now born to unmarried parents; a rise of more than 7% in a decade.</p>
