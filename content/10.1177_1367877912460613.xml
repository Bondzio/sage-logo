<abstract>
<p>Amid social and political conditions that could well lead to Colombia being described in the terms of a failed state, the country’s electorate chose Álvaro Uribe as its thirty-ninth president in 2002, and again in 2006, preferring to keep in office a man who seemed to be putting the country together again, rather than respecting the constitutional prohibition against consecutive presidential terms. Though his presidency was marked by scandals and irregularities – most notably, the <italic>falsos positivos</italic> (false positives: young, poor Colombian civilians, assassinated in cold blood by the zealous armed forces and listed as guerrilla kills) – Uribe enjoyed approval ratings previously unknown in Colombian history. He is in fact credited with giving Colombia its ‘second independence’, and his leaving office was, for many, tragic. Here, I present an explanation for this paradox, analysing an aspect of Uribe’s discourse for the way it contributed to producing a shared national sentiment by articulating a social imaginary with limited possibilities for making sense of Colombia. Drawing on Geertz, Durkheim and Brubaker and the concepts of hegemony and identification, I elucidate the effectiveness of Uribe’s discourse of the nation in a context of a long experience of frustration and decadence, and show why and how so many Colombians could, at least for a time, give their overwhelming support to a regime wherein murder was authorized, unacknowledged as anything more significant than the price to be paid for that second independence.</p>

<p>Álvaro Uribe was president of Colombia for two consecutive terms, from 2002 to 2006 and from 2006 to 2010. Though Colombian law prohibits presidents from serving a second consecutive term, Uribe won an exception to that rule, due to his immense popularity. He had taken charge of country on the edge of catastrophe. In 2001 Colombians of means were seeking refuge abroad in anticipation of an advance by Colombia’s guerrillas into the cities. Foreign commentators were invoking the notion of ‘collapse’ and ‘failed state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367877912460613">Browitt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367877912460613">McLean, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367877912460613">Richani, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367877912460613">Rotberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367877912460613">DeShazo et al., 2007</xref>), or, in a somewhat different register, speaking of Colombia as ‘something other than a nation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367877912460613">Lobo, 2009</xref>). Fountain’s representation of the situation just prior to Uribe’s ascendancy, though taken from a fictional short story, is not inaccurate:<disp-quote>
<p>Colombia was busily ripping itself to shreds. Gargantuan car bombs rocked the cities each week; judges and journalist were assassinated in droves; various gangs, militias, and guerrillas fought the Army and the cops, while the drug lords and revanchists sponsored paramilitary <italic>autodefensa</italic> squads that seemed to specialize in massacring unarmed peasants. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367877912460613">2006</xref>: 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Under Uribe, however, things changed, and in August 2010, on Uribe’s last weekend in office, the major Colombian dailies – <italic>El Tiempo</italic> and <italic>El Espectador</italic> – devoted entire pull-out sections to celebrating the man’s eight years in office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877912460613">‘Logros de Uribe’, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367877912460613">‘Uribe: ocho años que cambiaron al país’, 2010</xref>), with only a brief reference to the problematic activity that marked his administrations. There was no mention whatsoever of the irregularities that have prompted the analysis and argument contained here: what are called <italic>falsos positivos</italic>, a special subset of extra-judicial killings by state and para-state (paramilitary) actors during his administrations. False positives are civilians – among Colombia’s poorest, part of the population that has always suffered the brunt of the country’s violence – gunned down and counted as terrorist kills, either by military or para-military agents. Uribe himself has admitted the existence of evidence of 22 false positives, but the Colombian attorney general’s office, on the other hand, reports 1666 victims during the Uribe period up to April 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367877912460613"><italic>Mesa de Trabajo</italic>, 2009</xref>: 77). As for extra-judicial killings <italic>tout court</italic>, between July 2002 and December 2007 there were 13,634 cases, of which evidence points to culpability in 8049 of them. In 75.4 percent or 6068 of those 8,049, <italic>the state was either directly or indirectly culpable</italic>: in 17.53 percent or 1411 of the 8049 directly so; in 57.87 percent (4658 cases) indirectly so. In only 24.59 percent of the 8049 cases (1980 cases) were the guerrillas responsible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367877912460613">Observatorio de derechos humanos y derecho humanitario, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367877912460613">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>I want to understand why, given these irregularities, over 75 percent of the polled population approved of the man as he left office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367877912460613">‘Santos-Uribe’, 2010</xref>). Such approval constitutes what could be articulated as a silent, implicit but effective consent to these same irregularities,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1367877912460613">2</xref></sup> leading me to approach Uribe’s Colombia in terms of hegemony, as elaborated by Antonio Gramsci through Stuart Hall and most recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877912460613">Michael Bérubé (2009)</xref>. But I inflect this concept with insights from Clifford Geertz and from Emile Durkheim,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1367877912460613">3</xref></sup> which I develop below. Hegemony is to be understood not as a reference to a social field organized on the basis of relations of knowledge and ignorance, of subjects and objects, but to one in which power relations are constituted on the basis of more or less informed consent. Summarizing Gramsci, Hall writes that hegemony: ‘is in operation when the dominant class fractions not only dominate but <italic>direct</italic> – lead: when they … command and win the consent of the subordinated classes to their continuing sway’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367877912460613">1977</xref>: 332). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877912460613">Bérubé (2009)</xref> adds that hegemony refers to the fact that consent is <italic>won</italic>, and insofar as this is so, we must respect the consenters – rather than dismiss them as dupes – even as we investigate why they consent. This understanding of social relations recognizes the individual and collective agency of the actors in the phenomena we are trying to understand, while still admitting that such agency is frequently heavily conditioned by already existing mores, structures, traditions, institutions and social forms in general.</p>
<p>Geertz, while not speaking in terms of hegemony, adds something most useful to this approach. ‘For a state’, he says, to ‘do more than administer privilege and defend itself against its own population, its acts must seem continuous with the selves of those whose state it pretends it is, its citizens – to be, in some stepped-up, amplified sense, <italic>their</italic> acts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877912460613">1973</xref>: 317). Departing somewhat from the emphasis that we find in the theory of hegemony, Geertz argues that this ‘is not a mere question of consensus’. Rather it ‘is a question of immediacy, of experiencing what the state “does” as proceeding naturally from a familiar and intelligible “we”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877912460613">1973</xref>: 317); it is more akin to something like identification. Such identification bypasses the very issue of consent because, as established thoroughly by psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367877912460613">Travis and Aronson, 2007</xref>), people are loath to sanction their own problematic actions: not only will the victimizer blame the victim but the more or less well-intentioned mistake-maker will put his errors down to being drunk, or tired, or blame it on a misunderstanding or on circumstances – anything to mitigate the sense that he is, in the simplest of senses, at fault. If, then, identification with the state can be achieved, the population will overlook problematic statecraft, insofar as they see the state as the mere extension of themselves. But this will not lead them to absolving themselves of responsibility for criminal activity; the consequence of such identification is more profound: they will have difficulty registering that something untoward was even – ever – done. The issue then is one of how identification is won: how is it that a good number of the population will understand their government’s actions to be their own, and thus ignore them or rationalize them away? In my answer, the figure of the nation will be important. I argue that an identification was articulated through the nation, between population and state. On the one hand the population was interpellated as a nation; on the other, the state – through the figure of Uribe himself – was identified with the nation, and thus was understood as acting not on behalf of the nation, but as the <italic>nation acting</italic>. Though not completely successful among the totality of the population – hence the need for a concept like hegemony – this identification was successful to a great degree, rendering a situation in which the population became the state and the state the population: its acts were my acts.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877912460613">Durkheim’s (1964 [1893])</xref> understanding of the relationship of crime and social solidarity allows us to understand how identification – which we would tend to misrecognize as arising from the nature of things – is, in reality, produced, a social artefact. Crime, for Durkheim, is that which offends the sensibility of a population. However, against the naturalistic thrust of Durkheim’s argument, the shared sense of offence is not necessarily mobilized or operationalized; it may not even be apprehended by those offended. But interested parties can, if the conditions are right, produce not only the apprehension of offence, but construct from that apprehension the basis of a sense of unity, of identification. For example, people with no real opinion about immigration can, under the right conditions and given the right framing of the situation, feel that immigration is offensive, and on this basis a community, in some sense now <italic>for itself</italic>, can cohere. An unremarkable situation can become one characterized or defined by a basic antagonism between two more or less ‘new’ collective subjects: them against us. In Colombia, the population began to cohere and identify with the state on the basis of a reframing of what was happening in Colombia’s historic confrontation between left-wing guerrilla insurgents and other actors, which allowed it to support and excuse a politics quite clearly implicated in murder.</p>

<title><italic>Uribista</italic> discourse: the nation – reloaded</title>
<p>In this section, I focus on the refiguration and resurgence of the nation in Colombia. Uribe, I argue, successfully <italic>discursivized</italic> a number of divergent and radically differentiated Colombian experiences in terms of one: that of a nation under siege from guerrilla terrorists. This nation was in a sense a nation reloaded. To understand what I mean it would help to recall that Colombia has something of a vexed relationship with its own nation-ness – or lack thereof. This has to do with the basic facts of Colombian history. In the 19th century the political classes of what can roughly be called Colombia – the name of the country as well as its geographical extension have changed again and again over the years – were bloodily at each other’s throats, and promulgated at least 20 different constitutions, each one illustrating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367877912460613">Foucault’s (1980</xref>: 90) observation that political peace is merely the formalization of the balance of forces at the close of armed confrontation. While the violence continued to erupt with almost rhythmic constancy, the recourse to rewriting the constitution came to a halt with that of 1886, which endured until 1991. Although it lasted more than 100 years, this constitution was never really able to fulfil its stated intention: ‘to consolidate national unity and to guarantee [the goods of] justice, liberty and peace’, and was replaced by a new, postmodern constitution in 1991: postmodern insofar as its 7th article, one of several grouped together ‘The Fundamental Principles’, essentially gives up on the nation as it had hitherto been imagined in terms of homogeneity and singularity. This 7th article affirms that the ‘State recognizes and protects the ethnic and cultural diversity of the Colombian Nation’. This postmodern emphasis on difference and heterogeneity against sameness and homogeneity, may appear to be progressive and democratic; but one would be hard pressed to find many examples of the successful construction of national identity and national order founded on such terms. To the contrary, most of the countries that we recognize today as being successful in terms of nation-ness have both discursively and practically proceeded on the basis of homogeneity, of singularity, erasing or attempting to erase the presence of the confounding ‘other’ – both symbolically and physically. Canada, a country with a historically quite small population, would be the exception that proved the general rule; and still, we would have to take into consideration that the differences between French and British Canada were always smaller than they may have been perceived to be by the minority. While it is true, of course, that what have been called nations have never been the homogeneous communities that they purport to be, the attempt to turn the fact of heterogeneity into a virtue, while still using the discourse of the nation, would seem to be something of a fool’s errand. The whole charm of the nation is that it speaks to one-ness, to unanimity, however chimerical. That is what makes it such an appealing idea, and why the attempt to heterogenize the nation would seem to amount to something like a contradiction in terms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1367877912460613">4</xref></sup> As Geertz has noted with regard to a different context, that of Indonesia:<disp-quote>
<p>[o]rganizing a cultural hodgepodge into a workable polity is more than a matter of inventing a promiscuous civil religion to blunt its variety. It requires either the establishment of political institutions within which opposing groups can safely contend, or the elimination of all groups but one from the political stage. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877912460613">1973</xref>: 315)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The failure of the 1991 constitution, which embraced multiculturalism as the very foundation of the nation, has given way to the latter approach in Colombia: the attempted elimination of all groups but one from the political stage.</p>
<p><italic>Uribista</italic> discourse manifests this attempt. It can be understood as a discourse of the nation reloaded because it embodies a rejection of the supposed content of the postmodern nation; it revives a sense of the nation that was strong, not because it included all but because it included only some. In shearing off a sector of the population – not only the guerrillas but anyone who might seek even mere understanding of their practice, and anyone who might not fall lockstep into agreement with the government’s plans – it does away with the idea of good faith interlocutors seeking to come to some negotiated compromise and creates an enemy, an other, against which it seeks to forge a Rousseau-ian general will, a nation of the old-school variety, as articulated by the Abbé Siéyès on the eve of the French Revolution:<disp-quote>
<p>The Nation exists before all things and is the origin of all. Its will is always legal, it is the law itself.… Nations on earth must be conceived as individuals outside the social bond, or as is said, in the state of nature. The exercise of their will is free and independent of all civil forms. Existing only in the natural order, their will, to have its full effect, only needs to possess the <italic>natural</italic> characteristics of a will. In whatever manner a nation wills, it suffices that it does will; all forms are valid and its will is always the supreme law. (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367877912460613">Smith, 2001</xref>: 43)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The nation here is conceived not as many but as one – an ‘individual’ that ‘exists before all things’ and is the ‘origin of all’, as well as being the ‘supreme law’ – a law unto itself, its will ‘always legal’. If the nation is thus understood, it does not matter how it wills, only that it does will, for howsoever the nation does will, its will must be done – a reasoning that constitutes an apologetics for any and all governments which proceed on the basis that they do not represent but actualize the nation. And though political theory might suggest that states <italic>represent</italic> nations, people’s lived experience can lend itself to being expressed in terms of an identification whereby <italic>we</italic> are acting when the state acts, much in the same way as <italic>we</italic> won – or lost – when the football team we support wins or loses. It would be more correct to say <italic>they</italic> won or lost. But we don’t. We slip into identification quite readily – which does not excuse us from explaining it, of course.</p>
<p>These identifications – of the population with the nation and of the state with the nation and therefore of the population with the state – were effected by a discourse that in some way emanated from the state – from Uribe as candidate and from Uribe as president. That discourse produced a clear line of demarcation between us – the nation – and them – the nation’s enemies. This binary social imaginary echoed that articulated by the post-9/11 discourse of the Bush administration, according to which, as heard in an address to Congress (and the world at large): ‘Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367877912460613">Bush, 2001</xref>). This move by the US allowed other governments to reconstrue their own internal security problems in terms of ‘us’ against the terrorists – a local instance of a global problem – and in the Colombian presidential campaign of 2002, Uribe was the candidate who most skilfully deployed this tactic. To appreciate this I want to draw from an on-line essay that traces Uribe’s words as he moved from being candidate to president-elect to president, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367877912460613">Posada Carbó (n.d.)</xref>, a noted Uribe supporter and apologist. Posada Carbó observes that as a pre-candidate, as early as the year 2000, Uribe referred not to terrorists but to ‘irregular groups’ and ‘violent groups’ (n.d.: 2) and that this nomenclature continued even after 9/11. But by February 2002 Uribe is affirming that in ‘Colombia there is not political violence but terrorism’ (n.d.: 3). Posada Carbó then quotes from Uribe’s speech in which he formally announced his candidacy for the presidency and called for ‘the violent ones … to suspend their terrorism’ (n.d.: 3). But only in November 2002, according to Posada Carbó, does the now President Uribe finally succumb to his discursive logic and refer to ‘terrorist groups’ in Colombia (n.d.: 5). Posada Carbó makes much of the fact that Uribe distinguishes between actors, whom he did not always label as terrorists as such, and acts, which he does call terrorism. One might imagine, then, that Uribe is marking off a distinction between agents and deeds, between the sinner – whom we should love or at least attempt to understand – and the sin, which we should of course abhor. But if Uribe was indeed insisting that acts can be terrorist acts independent of the precise nature of the agent who perpetrates them, one is justified in asking why, whether as candidate, president or now ex-president, Uribe has been unable to understand the targeting of civilians by the state as terrorism. The short answer is that, despite Uribe’s parsing of the difference, only terrorists can commit terrorist acts (terrorism), and the obvious corollary is that terrorist acts (terrorism) can only be committed by terrorists. For those in power and those who support those in power, this logic holds across the board: state aggression against civilians can never be terrorist since that would mean that the state itself was terrorist. Thus, while Posada Carbó’s insistence that during his campaign and as president-elect Uribe was not using the <italic>word</italic> terrorist to refer to the guerrillas might be correct in a technical sense, the fact of the matter is that his <italic>discourse</italic> was producing the guerrillas <italic>qua</italic> terrorists, and in doing so injecting that tried and true classic binary opposition – between us, the good guys, and them, the bad guys – into the heart of the Colombian social imaginary. This binary opposition works to neuter the multicultural pretensions of the constitution’s 7th article and creates a space for the population to identify more simply as a nation against its enemies.</p>
<p>Let us look at some of the specific forms this discourse has taken. In early February 2009, while still hoping to win a third presidential term in 2010, Uribe was characterizing all reasoned argument against his government and its policies and practices as coming from the FARC’s (RevolutionaryArmed Forces of Colombia) ‘intellectual bloc’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367877912460613">‘Uribe critica’, 2009</xref>) – as being birds of a feather with terrorism. He allows for no loyal opposition or reasoned critique. Here, as head of state, he speaks as the nation:<disp-quote>
<p>We are not going to let them fool us. The guerrillas, trying to confuse us, produce blood, but they speak of peace. We are not going to permit this, compatriots. We are not going to allow the ‘FARC’s intellectual bloc’ to confuse us with a discourse of peace that ends up strengthening terrorism. We have to wage this battle in the whole country. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367877912460613">‘Uribe critica’, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He continues, broadening the notion of the enemy while continuing to invoke an embattled, totalized <italic>us</italic>: ‘They speak of human rights at all hours of the day, only to instil fear in our soldiers and police’, he says. Here the very notion of human rights is presented as being nothing more than a way to unsettle and impede the armed forces. Though deeply implicated in crimes against civilians as we saw above, Uribe cannot conceive of them behaving in any but the most righteous way. As part of the military’s PR campaign we have been seeing in Colombia for the last few years anything from billboards to television commercials to refrigerator magnets emblazoned with a soldier’s image, a Colombian flag and three slogans: ‘Faith in the Cause’, ‘Their cause and ours, is Colombia!’ and ‘Superior Ethical Behaviour’. Regarding the behaviour, the facts, unfortunately, beg to differ. But the cause – theirs and ours – is Colombia, and the ends cannot but justify the means. And so Uribe simply dismisses human rights discourse as part of the product of a terrorist intellectual force. Challenged by it he asks ‘Are we not to fight? Should we allow the country to return to the confusion that leads to the exaltation of terrorism headed by the “intellectual bloc of the FARC”? Let us not fall into that trap’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367877912460613">Uribe critica, 2009</xref>). Uribe’s reference to a ‘return to confusion’ reminds his public that before his interventions there was no solid sense of us and them, and that the guerrillas were understood – naively, confusingly – as legitimate political actors. But he puts things to rights, producing a guileless division between us and them, between the population/nation/state and the enemy.</p>
<p>Here is another instance of this discourse, from July 2007, when Colombia’s Constitutional Court was impeding Uribe’s efforts to demobilize and reintegrate paramilitaries into society with no accounting for their years of crime. The Court had found that ‘the crime of criminal conspiracy could under no circumstances be transmuted into sedition’ and thus, the paramilitaries, criminal groups ostensibly committed to fighting the guerrillas, could not claim a political character and could not be amnestied. Uribe found the Court’s intervention to be an affront to his prerogatives and counterproductive with regard to the normalization of Colombian society. In his response to the Court’s opinion, Uribe appealed to the population and invoked the need for the ‘unity of the state’, arguing that the ‘institutions [of the state] have to cooperate harmoniously in seeking to fulfil the superior ends of the state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367877912460613">‘Para dar estatus político’, 2007</xref>). He says, ‘I am going to invite my compatriots to help the government’ while insisting that it was – whatever constitutional theory might say – irresponsible to ‘invoke the independence of the [state’s] institutions’. Here, as Uribe insists on his intention to ‘bring great relief to the country’ – to you, the population, the nation – we see that discursive production of the very identification that we have talking about between population and nation and state. The idea is one that erases distinctions and undermines the very notion of checks and balances in order to produce an effective unified force that can simply get things done.</p>
<p>Finally, even out of office, Uribe continues to wield the discourse that served him so well as president. When Isabelle Durant, the vice-president of the European Parliament, visited Colombia to investigate abuses under Uribe, the now ex-president denounced her as a ‘justifier of terrrorism’; and when the <italic>Washington Post</italic> reported that the wire-tappings of the Uribe administration against political opponents used technology provided by the US embassy in Colombia, he summarily condemned it as a ‘terrorist sympathizer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367877912460613">Valencia, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>The difficulty of being Colombian</title>
<p>Uribe’s discourse of the nation reloaded resonated among the Colombian population because of what might be described as the historical difficulty of being Colombian. It is often said that there is no national Colombian culture, that it is a country of regions and regionalisms. This is connected to the fact that, as Kline states, the actual ‘process of [Colombian] independence was regional’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367877912460613">1999</xref>: 11), and the reality of independence was best described in terms of ‘large numbers of landowners [holding] power within their territories – in effect, forming private governments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367877912460613">Kline, 1999</xref>: 11). While the country does have a long bipartisan constitutional tradition, it is a bloody one. When a popular movement threatened the privileges of the traditional ruling factions, its head was cut off. Following the murder of its leader, Jorge Gaitán, a period of violence known as, well, <italic>La violencia</italic>, lasted 10 years, and attenuated only when the two traditional parties agreed to share power in the <italic>Frente Nacional</italic>, essentially forging a power-sharing alliance against the long-dominated masses. This was also the period in which the FARC emerged, having been shut out of any participation in the official political process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367877912460613">Hylton, 2006</xref>). The advent of narco-trafficking, with its quite irrational profit margins, only added to the chaos. In the period just before Uribe’s election the country really seemed to be coming undone. Bands of outlaws and guerrillas made travel by land too risky: being kidnapped was a distinct possibility. Colombians also had to comprehend the fact that their president from 1998 to 2002, Andrés Pastrana, ceded to the FARC a huge part of southern Colombia called San Vincente del Caguán, an area larger than some European countries. This was possible on the understanding that the guerrillas were legitimate political agents, but could be framed by others as an affront to any nominal idea of national sovereignty.</p>
<p>I want to argue – and here I do not disagree with Uribe – that this context was one of confusion; but it might be more precise to talk about it as an anomic situation. In ‘Reflections on two charismas’ Greenfeld writes:<disp-quote>
<p>what makes people particularly responsive to charisma is the condition of anomie which renders values and norms incapable of guiding people in their actions. The individual is left groping in normative darkness, yearning for the authority of a confident leader to show him the way out of this situation. A charismatic personality provides such leadership, offering through his contagious excitement a badly needed model for behavior and restoring to the confused individual his sense of order. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367877912460613">2006</xref>: 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We recognize, and perhaps one might say become vulnerable to, charisma when otherwise disoriented, when otherwise lost. Shils explains that we will defer to someone when we believe that she is ‘effectively in contact with what is most vital, most powerful, and most authoritative in the universe or society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367877912460613">1975</xref>: 129). If, as we have understood it, the nation is precisely one of those vital entities, then Álvaro Uribe appeared to be in contact with it as he radically redrew the terms of belonging and not belonging, and articulated, at the same time, a singular goal: the end of terrorism and the terrorists, no matter the cost, this being the condition of possibility of achieving the nation. Most relevant here is Bourdieu’s insight that ‘the nation’ only:<disp-quote>
<p>exists if and when there exist agents who can say that they are the [nation], by the mere fact of speaking publicly, officially, in its place, <italic>and of being recognized as entitled to do so</italic> by the people who thereby recognize themselves as members of the [nation]. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367877912460613">1989</xref>: 24)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This recognition was for the first time effected in Colombia under Uribe, who offered up not the multicultural, multi-ethnic nation, but the nation of the good against the non-nation, against the terrorist other. Making no concessions to the idea of multiculturalism, Uribe turned a historical social and political conflict into a struggle between Colombia and terrorists; he also turned non-governmental organizations, unions and in fact everybody who didn’t agree with him into the enemy. He managed to rekindle the idea of the nation as one, rather than as many. Which is why his eight years in power are talked about as a ‘second independence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367877912460613">Matiz Cortés, 2010</xref>: 2) and why the public was not at all averse to seeing him as a saviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367877912460613">Margolis, 2009</xref>). There were critics of course, who could, upon learning that Uribe would be denied a third term, assert: ‘Now begins the national reconstruction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367877912460613">Bejarano Guzman, 2010</xref>), but they were clearly in the minority. The fact remains that <italic>uribismo</italic> is credited by many with saving Colombia, with its liberation from the scourge of the FARC (even though, as we have seen, the FARC were not, in quantitative terms, the main problem) and indeed, with making it possible to be Colombian again – or even for the first time.</p>
<sec id="section3-1367877912460613">
<title>Towards an understanding</title>
<p>In order to understand what happened in Colombia I want to refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877912460613">Brubaker’s (1996)</xref> notion of the eventfulness of nation-ness. Brubaker suggests that nation-ness – the sense that the nation is a real, compelling entity – doesn’t develop over time; rather, it happens, all of a sudden. We should think of it as:<disp-quote>
<p>something that suddenly crystallizes rather than gradually develops, as a contingent, conjuncturally fluctuating, and precarious frame of vision and basis for individual and collective action, rather than as a relatively stable product of deep developmental trends in economy, polity, or culture. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877912460613">Brubaker, 1996</xref>: 19)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He invokes the idea of being ‘overcome by nationhood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877912460613">1996</xref>: 20), a phrase coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367877912460613">Slavenka Drakulic (1993)</xref>, to explain how people suddenly become ‘imprisoned by an all-too-successfully reified category’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877912460613">1996</xref>: 20): the nation. Being overcome in this way consists in the ‘relatively sudden and pervasive “nationalization” of public and even private life’, which:<disp-quote>
<p>has involved the nationalization of narrative and interpretative frames, of perception and evaluation, of thinking and feeling. It has involved the silencing or marginalization of alternative, non-nationalist political languages. It has involved the nullification of complex identities by the terrible categorical simplicity of ascribed nationality. It has involved essentialist, demonizing characterizations of the national ‘other,’ characterizations that transform Serbs into Chetniks, Croats into Ustashas, Muslims into Fundamentalists. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877912460613">1996</xref>: 20–1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And in the present case, it has turned various political actors – and even the poor non-combatants who would become false positives – into terrorists and legitimate targets of the armed forces, an internal other to be extirpated. The thing we should not overlook, of course, is that while for some this being overcome by nationhood may well constitute a sort of ‘imprisonment’, for others – who might well comprise a majority – it would constitute a liberation – a second independence indeed.</p>
<p>Some startlingly clear evidence of this manifested itself in 2008 when, on two separate occasions (4 February and 20 July), unprecedented numbers of Colombians took to the streets to protest against the FARC and their practice – admittedly reprehensible – of kidnapping both members of the armed forces and civilians in order to gain leverage with the government. The marches also expressed unmitigated and unprecedented levels of support for <italic>uribismo</italic> and the man Uribe and, perhaps most importantly, the armed forces. Colombians seemed to be thrilled to have finally, seemingly, become nationalized, and were keen to recognize those who had made it possible. One of the main slogans of the marches, appearing on T-shirts, billboards, banners, advertisements, and of course on the lips of the participants was <italic>Colombia soy yo</italic> (I am Colombia). This is more than consent: it is identification. Recall what the Abbé said: it does not matter how the nation wills, only that it does will, for its will is the supreme law. If I am Colombia, <italic>since</italic> I am Colombia, my will is thus the nation’s will, and so let my will be done. Thus, even if no decent person would condone the killings of the poor – the false positives – one must factor in the way in which identification with the nation and the state has made it so difficult for Colombians to, as it were, be decent or respond in what might be considered a decent fashion – to repudiate, to distance themselves from them, to demand their end, to demand justice – to the crimes of the state – and by extension the crimes of the nation – and by extension, their own crimes. But on what basis could this identification be effected? It is here that Durkheim’s insight matters so much.</p>
<p>Durkheim investigates one of the ‘links of social solidarity’, one of the things that binds the members of a population together, that unites minds that are otherwise just juxtaposed bodies. In his <italic>Division of Labour in Society</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877912460613">1964 [1893]</xref>) he asks about the nature of crime, so as to understand how it works to link the different members of a society. He finds that people are linked insofar as they find an act to be offensive; in so being, it is a crime and worthy of punishment – because it ‘shocks the sentiments which, for a given social system, are found in all healthy consciences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877912460613">1964 [1893]</xref>: 73). Further on, Durkheim tempers the requirement of universality, saying rather that the sentiments offended only have to be ‘common to the average mass of individuals in the same society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877912460613">1964 [1893]</xref>: 74). In Colombia, the identification of the population with the state precipitates a situation in which crimes perpetrated by the state against (poor) civilians are less considered to be crimes or even mistakes, and more likely to be misunderstood as more or less merited acts carried out against more or less deserving agents – not victims, for that would be to admit victimizers, that we/I are the victimizers – a psychologically impossible thought for most people to entertain about themselves. But, at the same time, the crimes of the guerrillas – especially kidnapping – offend almost all healthy consciences, the average mass of individuals, thus making the guerrillas – and their potential sympathizers – legitimate targets for the no-holds-barred military strategy whose principal booster was no less than the president himself. These crimes offend almost all healthy consciences insofar as all Colombians are potential victims of the guerrillas. Why? Because the guerrillas are against the system as such, and thus anyone involved in the system – and everybody is involved in it – is <italic>inherently</italic> part of the problem, a legitimate target for those dedicated to bringing down the system. Conversely, the acts of state forces and paramilitary forces are not directed against, even potentially, anyone and everyone. As rotten as the system may be, those who participate in it are not, <italic>ipso facto</italic>, legitimate targets. The targets of the state and para-state are the guerrillas but also the poor and desperate – those who <italic>might</italic> make common cause with the guerrillas or <italic>might</italic> have some sort of interest in potentially making common cause with it. The middle and especially the upper classes are safe, and as a sociological group not much offended when such people are killed.</p>
<p>Let me offer three quick observations to back up this argument. First, while there were two huge marches condemning the FARC, and only the FARC, during 2008, marches which were massively promoted and covered by the media, there was also, on 6 March, a third march, sandwiched between the other two. This march was called to denounce the violence of <italic>all</italic> actors in Colombia, not only the guerrillas, but also the paramilitaries and the state – who, as we saw above, are actually the chief perpetrators of killing and disappearing in Colombia. But this was a poorly attended march and covered by the media in the most cursory fashion. It was almost as if it didn’t happen. (For coverage of the anti-FARC marches see the 5 February, 20 and 21 July 2008 editions of <italic>El Tiempo</italic>, and the 3–9 February and 20 July editions of <italic>El Espectador</italic>; for the cursory coverage of the march decrying all forms of violence, see the 7 March editions of both papers.) If the identifications that I am talking about were achieved, this would explain the lack of interest in the 6 March march: to have participated would have been, in effect, to have marched against oneself. Durkheim remarks in his reflections on the nature of crime and social solidarity that, if ‘we come upon adults who do not know [the] fundamental rules or do not recognize their authority, such ignorance or insubmissiveness is an undeniable sign of pathological perversion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877912460613">1964 [1893]</xref>: 74), and indeed this other march, which did not recognize the dominant moral sentiment, was not only poorly covered, but slandered as a terrorist march from the beginning (see, for example, comments from Uribe’s chief adviser in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367877912460613">‘José Obdulio Gaviria insiste’ [2008]</xref> and from the retired General <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367877912460613">Valencia Tovar [2008]</xref>). Second, during the December holidays of 2010, two upper middle-class university students were murdered while vacationing out in the country. Their murder was decried in the media. Nevertheless, in February 2011 300 ‘uniformed men’ were able to arrest four suspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367877912460613">‘Cae autor intelectual’, 2011</xref>) from the region’s leading criminal organization, the <italic>Urabeños</italic>. Such an effort was remarkable for its infrequency, leading to suspicion that some Colombians are more valued, their murder more reprehensible, than others. And indeed, when news of the murders broke, <italic>Semana</italic>, one of Colombia’s most important news outlets, printed the victims’ picture on its cover as its headline proclaimed them ‘Innocent Victims’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1367877912460613">‘Víctimas inocentes’, 2011</xref>) – as if confirming that all the other – poor – victims of Colombia’s lawlessness and culture of impunity were somehow guilty – or at least they were definitely not innocent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1367877912460613">5</xref></sup> Last, in an informal conversation with some people who are members of Colombia’s middle class, the subject of the false positives came up. What was expressed was that in a war such as Colombia’s there could be no quarter, and that phenomena like the false positives were simply part of the price that had to be paid. Durkheim again provides understanding when he insists that ‘we must not say that an action shocks the common conscience because it is a crime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877912460613">1964 [1893]</xref>: 81) – for in such a case, the false positives would have shocked the consciences of those present, and they did not; rather, we must say that something ‘is criminal because it shocks the common conscience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877912460613">1964 [1893]</xref>: 81), which is why kidnapping and its practitioners were able to become the site of a division in Colombia’s social imaginary, according to which an identification, a nation and a (bloody) politics could be constructed successfully, at least for a while.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><italic>At least for a while</italic>, because we are, after all, talking about hegemony, an always provisional condition always in need of reconstruction insofar as it is always precarious and susceptible to challenge by other tendencies and forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367877912460613">Williams, 1977</xref>: 108–14). But for a while, in Colombia, we can see how a social bloc coalesced around a set of values and sentiments, a sense of belonging to the nation whose very existence depended upon unleashing its armed forces against its internal enemies – whether real or imagined. These internal enemies were not only the guerrillas at arms, but also the poor – potential guerrillas – whose deaths were just part of the price to be paid for being able to be Colombian again. The situation I have been describing would seem to confirm Moreiras’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367877912460613">2002</xref>) argument that any hegemonic articulation will always be constitutionally dependent on some kind of subaltern other, who, being subaltern, being beyond the articulations of the hegemony in question, cannot speak, can at best only be spoken for, and even then we find that almost nobody is listening. For the most part, this hegemony seems to be holding up: Uribe has been replaced by Juan Manuel Santos, Uribe’s Minister of Defence from 2006 to 2009. In such a position Santos was a key figure in putting into practice Uribe’s ideas and words about Colombian security and was serving when the false positives scandal broke. This, however, presented no real obstacle to his being elected. In fact, he was elected precisely on the basis of his commitment to the policies of <italic>uribismo</italic> and Uribe campaigned enthusiastically for his election. Given the chance to repudiate the bloody politics and the price of <italic>uribismo</italic>, the electorate opted, rather, for continuity. Nonetheless, there are also signs that certain accommodations to shifting sensibilities are having to be made, almost as if the widespread support lent to <italic>uribismo</italic> is evidencing something of a half-life. For example, despite being the Defence Minister for Uribe, Santos as president has broken with the former by returning to a discourse of social conflict in Colombia which allows the guerrillas some degree of legitimacy as political actors, whereas Uribe had abandoned any such notion in preference for a discourse of terrorism which afforded them no legitimacy whatsoever. This shift has led to much criticism from the former president (often expressed, amusingly enough, on Twitter), even as he suffers the indignity of being questioned – not only at home but also, as we have seen, in Washington and Europe – about some of the sinister goings-on during his government. Though re-signifying the Colombian conflict in a way that angers Uribe, Santos nonetheless recently seemed to attempt to refurbish his <italic>uribista</italic> credentials by pushing a law through the Colombian congress that would shield the armed forces personnel from any non-military instances of justice. Incredibly, however, the initiative had to be withdrawn due to widespread opposition. The government has promised to rewrite and reintroduce the initiative, but for now the armed forces, the recipients of so much indulgence by Colombian politicians and larger sectors of the Colombian population, were denied carte blanche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367877912460613">‘Reversazo’, 2011</xref>). This volte-face by the government, so unexpected on the basis of the foregoing analysis and argument, reminds us again that any determinate hegemony is always provisional, but more than that, with all due respect to Gramsci,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1367877912460613">6</xref></sup> it reminds us that the very concept of hegemony – insofar as it acknowledges the reality of countervailing forces and tendencies, of the constant pressure under which the regnant articulation survives, and of its susceptibility to challenge and change – compels us to cultivate not only an optimism of the will, but of the intellect as well.</p>

<p>Although false positives have a long history in Colombia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367877912460613">‘Las cuentas’, 2009</xref>), the recent spate is said to stem from Ministerial Directive No. 029, 2005, which provided monetary and other rewards to those who helped in capturing or killing guerrillas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367877912460613">‘Directiva’, 2008</xref>).

<p>I am hugely indebted to two anonymous reviewers of a previous version of this article, whose comments, questions and criticisms are largely responsible for whatever value the current version has. To the reviewer who suggested talking about the current point in terms of silent consent, I am specifically indebted. The poll which finds an approval rating of 75 percent for Uribe is a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367877912460613">Gallup Poll (2010)</xref>, based on a sample of 1200 interviews, which is affirmed to represent a real population of 8,676,133 ‘men and women of 18 or more years from all socio-economic strata’, with a margin of error of +/-3 percent. Though it states that all socio-economic strata are represented, the poll was carried out only in Colombia’s major cities (Bogotá, Medellín, Cali, Barranquilla and Bucaramanga), suggesting that the rural population – often-times most at risk in Colombia from the various armed actors – was not consulted. Also problematic is the fact that the methodology relied on landline telephone interviews, which would have left out of consideration poorer Colombians. This suggests that the margin of error might well be greater than that acknowledged by Gallup. There are no alternative sources for such information in Colombia. At least one reason for this is the difficulty and danger to which other methodologies for collecting opinion data would expose poll workers.</p>

<p>This is not to say that attempts to construct the heterogeneous nation are not alive and kicking in many places, notably in the Caribbean and in other Latin American societies – and indeed in so-called developed societies like the United States and Britain, where multiculturalism has become the dominant paradigm for attempting to think the modern nation – but it is to point out that such attempts, while the subject of much academic attention, are more interesting for what they seem to promise, than what they have actually achieved. When we do see people or communities that we would at first sight conclude were different living harmoniously together, is it not rather that they have in fact become more similar than different, despite perhaps exhibiting now quite superficially different physiognomies, practising different faiths or eating different foods?</p>

<p>Gramsci of course is known not only for his seminal contributions to the theory of social struggle with the concept of hegemony, but also for having surveyed the Italian situation under fascism and judged it to be almost hopeless; this led him, famously, to talk of a ‘pessimism of the intellect’, but being a good militant, of an ‘optimism of the will’, nonetheless.</p>
