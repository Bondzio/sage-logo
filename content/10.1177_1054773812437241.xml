<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this article was to explore sexual knowledge in persons who had suffered from myocardial infarction (MI). Seventy-six Swedish persons completed the “Sex after MI Knowledge Test” questionnaire. Overall, 53% of the men and 45% of the women scored maximum in the test. In a comparison between sexes, the men scored significantly more often a correct answer compared to the women for two out of the 25 items. The levels of correct answers were less then 50% for 14 out of the 25 items in both sexes. In conclusion we found that people who had suffered MI had poor levels of knowledge about sex and that there were some differences concerning lesser knowledge among the females in comparison to males. In regard to application, using a validated instrument facilitates an interactive communication between the patient and health care professionals, and opens up for a tailored education in line with the patient’s and his or her partner’s needs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>When recovering from myocardial infarction (MI) it is important to maintain a good, or least acceptable, level of well-being, which also includes resuming one’s sexual life. Sexual life is often affected after MI as a result of sexual dysfunction caused by drugs, of fear about engaging in sexual activity by patients and partners, of unpleasant symptoms during sexual activity, of exercise intolerance, or for other unknown reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1054773812437241">Jaarsma, Steinke, &amp; Gianotten, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773812437241">Steinke, Wright, Chung, &amp; Moser, 2008</xref>). It has been reported that a minority of patients with cardiac disease receive sexual counseling after their MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773812437241">Ivarsson, Fridlund, &amp; Sjoberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1054773812437241">Lunelli, Rabello, Stein, Goldmeier, &amp; Moraes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1054773812437241">Steinke &amp; Patterson-Midgley, 1996</xref>). Thus it is important to dispel myths and fears about this subject and provide correct information to both the patients and their partners though there is a need for them to understand how and to what extent physical activity, including sexual activity, may influence the risk for recurrence of MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1054773812437241">Steinke, Mosack, Barnason, &amp; Wright, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Health care professionals, who care for these patients, especially in the acute phase of a severe ischemic episode, feel insecure about providing sexual guidance during a patient’s stay in hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1054773812437241">Lunelli et al., 2008</xref>) or lack knowledge, competence, and skills in how to communicate about sexual issues after MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1054773812437241">Doherty, Byrne, Murphy &amp; Mc Gee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773812437241">Ivarsson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1054773812437241">Steinke et al., 2011</xref>). Health care professionals have been found to be more likely to inform and discuss sexual concerns with their patients if the patient first raised the question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1054773812437241">Jaarsma et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1054773812437241">Steinke et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, it has been suggested that nurses estimate that their patients could be upset, embarrassed, and anxious if they were asked about sexual concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1054773812437241">Jaarsma et al., 2010b</xref>). The first step to provide adequate guidelines, information, and support to patients and partners is to explore how knowledgeable the patients are about sexual activity and MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1054773812437241">Svedberg et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1054773812437241">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>Thus the aim of this pilot study was to explore sexual knowledge in males and females who had suffered from myocardial infarction and to investigate if there were any differences in sexual knowledge between the genders.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1054773812437241" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>A convenience sample of persons was recruited from The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1054773812437241">National Association of Heart and Lung Patients (2009)</xref> at 10 local meeting places in different areas of Sweden and was carried out during spring 2007. The inclusion criteria were for the respondents to have own experiences of an MI and living with a partner. The initial purpose was to recruit a total of 100 persons from 10 local associations in Sweden. At each meeting, a member of the research team informed the respondents about the study and asked the respondents who met the inclusion criteria to fill in the questionnaire at the meeting. Seventy-five persons (46 men and 29 women), eligible at the time for the study, were included. The majority of the respondents were &gt; 65 years old (80%). The study was conducted in accordance with the rules of the Helsinki Declaration on informed consent and confidentiality.</p>
<p>The questionnaire “Sex after MI Knowledge Test” is a 25-item self-rating questionnaire measuring knowledge about resuming sexual activity post-MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773812437241">Steinke &amp; Swan, 2004</xref>). The respondents had a choice of the three alternative answers: “True,” “False,” or “Do not know.” Correct responses received a score of 3; incorrect responses received a score of 1 while “Do not know” responses received a score of 2, which generates a maximum score of 75 if all answers were correct (range 25-75). The Swedish version has been assessed for validity and reliability, Cronbach’s α = .61 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1054773812437241">Svedberg et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Data are presented as descriptive statistics. The total score of sexual knowledge was computed as a continuous variable, that is, higher scores represented better sexual knowledge and gender differences were analyzed with Mann–Whitney-U test. The 25 items were also categorized dichotomously as correct answer (score 3) or incorrect/do not know answer (score 1 and 2) and gender differences on item levels were analyzed with chi-square tests. A <italic>p</italic> value &lt; .05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Data were analyzed using SPSS 17.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1054773812437241" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The total scores on the “Sex after MI Knowledge Test” ranged from 47 to 72 for men and 48 to 69 for women (mean score 59.2 vs. 57.7, respectively, <italic>ns</italic>). Among the males, 53% responded correctly to all items, while the corresponding score for the females was 45%. This difference between the genders was not significant.</p>
<p>On item level, the participants showed highest level of knowledge within the following statements: “A normal response during sex is an increased heart rate, blood pressure and rate of breathing” (i.e., true; 81%) and “If you have chest pain during sex, you should stop and rest” (i.e., true; 80%) and “A common emotional reaction after heart attack is depression” (i.e., true; 77%).</p>
<p>In 14 of the 25 items the level of correct answers was less than 50%. The most limited knowledge among all participants was found for the items; “It is important to have sex as often as before your heart attack” (i.e., false; 19%), “A danger sign to report to the physician is shortness of breath or increased heart rate (pulse) for more than 15 min after intercourse” (i.e., true; 25%), and “You should try not to upset your partner with your fears about resuming sex” (i.e., false; 26%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1054773812437241">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<sec id="section6-1054773812437241">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the sexual knowledge in persons who had suffered from an MI and showed that both genders had poor levels of knowledge about sexual activity post-MI and that females had even lesser knowledge than males for two of the items. The reason for the gender differences is unknown, and further larger studies are needed to scrutinize this disparity. The overall low levels could be due to talking about sexuality being considered as “taboo” by many people. Even in Sweden, health care professionals still feel uncomfortable discussing patients’ sexual issues and how to communicate sexual function after MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773812437241">Ivarsson et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>While a healthy sexual life is regarded as an important aspect of quality of life, research about male and female’s knowledge about sexual activity post-MI is still scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773812437241">Steinke &amp; Swan, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1054773812437241">Lunelli et al. (2008)</xref> found that 60% of the patients, more males than females, have doubts about the resumption of sexual activity when they left the hospital. In Ivarsson et al.’s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773812437241">2009</xref>), there were no differences between genders regarding receiving information about sexual function before discharge from hospital. There are many situations available for nurses to verbally provide sexual information either planned or opportunistically, which could be supplemented by written material. Using a validated instrument, such as “Sex after MI Knowledge Test” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773812437241">Steinke &amp; Swan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1054773812437241">Svedberg et al., 2012</xref>), when assessing and discussing the patients’ knowledge could be a tool to help the health care professionals develop both comfort and confidence in dealing with sexual issues with their patients. This is in line with the study from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1054773812437241">Doherty et al. (2011)</xref> who found that the cardiac rehabilitation staff reported a lack of assessment and counseling protocols for addressing sexual health problems. This lack of knowledge and preparation in the provision of sexual counseling seems to be an ongoing issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1054773812437241">Steinke et al., 2011</xref>) and it is thus of great importance to provide educational programs on sexual assessment and sexual counseling.</p>
<p>A limitation of this study is the generalizability of the results. We recognize that this is a small and highly selective sample as delegates visiting a local patient association meeting might not be representative for the majority of patients with an MI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1054773812437241">
<title>Application</title>
<p>The findings of this pilot study showed that in this particular study setting, persons who had suffered from an MI had poor levels of knowledge about sex after MI. There were also some differences between the genders concerning lesser knowledge among the females. It is important to explore how knowledgeable patients are about sexual activity in cardiac rehabilitation for the nurse to be able to provide adequate guidelines, information, and support to patients and their partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1054773812437241">Potvin, Richard, &amp; Edwards, 2000</xref>). In line with the current study, also possible gender differences should be taken into account. Future patient education ought to address the knowledge of sexual behavior, especially highlighting and focusing on danger symptom signs after intercourse and that it is relevant to talk to the partner about one’s fears about resuming sex. Using a validated instrument, such as “Sex after MI Knowledge Test,” facilitates an interactive communication between the patient and health care professionals, and opens up for a tailored education corresponding to the patient’s and his or her partner’s needs.</p>
