<abstract>
<p>As the hotel industry’s structure has become more complicated over the past decades, the asset management profession has likewise been evolving. To understand its genesis and current status, this article documents the evolution of hotel asset management from its early troubleshooting role to its present ongoing role of maximizing hotel values for owners. Based on a survey of hotel asset managers, this study found that these asset managers are highly educated, all had hotel management experience before becoming asset managers, and most had also been hotel developers. Many of the asset managers began their careers as hotel operators, but a substantial number began as consultants. Increasingly, asset managers are involved in analyzing strategic issues and making operating recommendations intended to improve the value of a hotel asset. Responding asset managers reported spending substantial time in monitoring the asset’s financial performance, operational reviews, and capital expenditure analysis. Typical performance measures are value creation, financial performance, operating measures, asset utilization, and growth measures, using such common metrics as <italic>gross operating profit</italic> (GOP) and revenue per available room (RevPAR).</p>

<body>
<p>Hotel asset managers fulfill the role of agents who are hired by the principals (hotel owners) to maximize the owners’ wealth. In this framework, risk-averse managers are paid their reservation wage (outside opportunity) and risk-neutral owners bear the risk and take residual value from the operation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938965512458351">Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green 1996</xref>). The principal–agent relationship involving asset managers has evolved to its current status as the hotel industry has become structurally sophisticated with both a proliferation of lodging products and an ownership structure that increasingly involves institutional investors of many types. A probable starting point for the specific need for asset management was the first successful hotel real estate investment trust (REIT) Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 1993 (RFS Investors). Since then, REITs have become major owners of hotel real estate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938965512458351">Singh 1999</xref>), with fourteen public lodging and resort REITs representing a market capitalization of more than US$27 billion (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://REIT.com">REIT.com</ext-link>). Other sophisticated investors include private equity, foreign investors, and pension funds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938965512458351">Denton 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A critical issue for the hotel industry is aligning the interests between owners and operators, most particularly compensation of management firms so that they work for the best interest of the owners (while fairly rewarding the operators). Asset managers have increasingly become involved in day-to-day management of hotels and properties and can provide owners with information related to management compensation and preservation of the asset’s value.</p>
<p>In this article, we review the evolving role of asset managers in the hotel industry, especially with regard to the changes in the product market and ownership landscape. We also discuss the issues that are emerging due to the separation of ownership and management. We specifically examine the following aspects:</p>

<sec id="section1-1938965512458351">
<title>The Genesis of Asset Management?</title>
<p>The initial purposes of asset management, both for hotels and other real estate asset classes, were (1) oversight of the day-to-day management of the real estate and (2) responsibility for husbanding and preserving the physical asset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938965512458351">Brooks-Liberator 1990</xref>). However, even twenty years ago, the position involved far more. In a 1990 issue of the <italic>Journal of Property Management</italic>, an asset manager for offices and retail observed: “The increase in pension fund and institutional ownership has given rise to a new segment of the real estate industry—the asset manager. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938965512458351">Matthews 1990</xref>, 8)” The author, then a vice president at Equitable Real Estate, elaborates on the function of the asset manager, describing a role that goes far beyond property oversight, as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>A successful asset manager is a catalyst for change. He or she makes positive things happen, creating value and solving problems. Today’s asset manager will have a thorough understanding of the owner’s objectives and of the property and its market. The best asset managers can perceive, express, and balance owners’ and tenants’ views. Nor should the asset manager’s knowledge stop with the property and its immediate market. To successfully guide the financial future of a building, the asset manager must have an understanding of world issues and of technical innovation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938965512458351">Matthews 1990</xref>)”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other elements of asset management were borrowed from the financial services industry in which asset management is the process of managing investments for clients. Asset managers in the financial services industry are fiduciaries who listen to investors, contributing to and refining their clients’ financial objectives. They make allocations among different types of investments according to their clients’ risk tolerance, investment horizon, and tax situation. Competent asset managers “read” investment cycles, surveying the broader marketplace to find performing investments that contribute to the client’s long-term financial goals, while disposing of those investments that are declining, or likely to decline, in productivity. Asset managers of this type are responsible for decisions of a strategic nature.</p>
<p>The late Stephen Brener is credited with introducing the term <italic>asset management</italic> to the lodging industry in 1987 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938965512458351">Brener 1987</xref>). He subsequently described hotel asset management in a 1991 article with the following observation: “The goal of asset managers is to make recommendations about the operating performance, physical plant, market position, and management [of a hotel]” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965512458351">Brener 1991</xref>, 21). The evolution of asset management to an oversight <italic>and</italic> strategic function appears to have occurred at least by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938965512458351">1994</xref>. Writing in <italic>Lodging Hospitality</italic>, Stephen Rushmore captured succinctly the essence of asset management as it had evolved in the lodging industry:
<disp-quote>
<p>In general terms, hotel asset management is the service of assisting hotel owners in realizing their investment goals. Asset managers act as an owner’s agent or representative to ensure that a hotel is acquired for a reasonable price; is then operated properly during the period of ownership; and ultimately is disposed of at an appropriate time and price. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938965512458351">1994</xref>, 20)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The transformation of a hotel asset manager from someone who simply provided operational oversight to someone who also was involved in strategic investment decisions paralleled the restructuring of the lodging industry. Let us examine the events that drove this evolution.</p>

<title>The Evolution of Hotel Asset Management</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938965512458351">Lori Raleigh &amp; McCarthy (1995)</xref> have pointed out, the tax-driven limited partnerships of the 1970s employed asset managers, who in some cases were general partners charged with making all of the partnership’s important investment decisions to preserve the limited partners’ status as passive investors. In other cases, the asset manager’s role was more akin to that of an auditor and analyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938965512458351">Beals 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, although asset managers existed in some form before the 1980s, the function became increasingly defined and independent in the 1980s and 1990s. Indeed, the wider emergence of asset management can be attributed to a number of factors, some common to all real estate asset classes, others specific to hotels.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938965512458351">Raleigh &amp; McCarthy (1995)</xref> noted, the late 1980s and early 1990s saw the emergence of a sophisticated and demanding real estate investor. A summary of the 1990 asset management symposium of the Institute of Real Estate Management (IREM), for instance, notes that “performance measures have increased in importance for several reasons” and identifies the following factors as pushing investors to demand greater accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938965512458351">Pekala 1990</xref>):</p>
<list id="list2-1938965512458351" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Significant growth in institutional investment in real estate, including closed-end funds</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An increase in the number of designated pools investing in specific types of real estate assets</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A corresponding increase in institutions’ interest in understanding the economics and operating characteristics of the properties they invest in</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increasing concentration of real estate investments in the hands of a limited number of registered investment advisors and pension funds</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The mind-set of the sophisticated real estate investor who replaced owner–operators is summed up by William Ramseyer of JMB Realty, at the time a significant investor in hotel real estate: “We no longer have the luxury of selling blind pools on good faith and management . . . . We have to express to institutional investors the essence of properties and portfolios, a big change in the business” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938965512458351">Pekala 1990</xref>, 26).</p>
<p>Lodging real estate ownership today is part of the broader commercial real estate industry. Although there is no publicly available information specifically for hotel real estate ownership, we believe the lodging industry ownership profile closely resembles the broader commercial real estate ownership structure. According to the 2011 “Emerging Trends in Real Estate” report published by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938965512458351">Urban Land Institute and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (2011)</xref>, private equity represents 72 percent of the equity capital flows to commercial real estate (i.e., private investors and funds, pension funds, foreign investors, life insurance companies, and private financial institutions). The remaining 28 percent constitutes public equity, represented by REITs and public untraded funds.</p>
<p>In addition to asset management, institutional owners, REITs, and investment funds also needed third-party property-management expertise, resulting in the growth of hotel operating companies. The balance of power between owners and operators has seesawed over time, and the terms of management contracts have in turn favored operators or owners. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938965512458351">deRoos and Eyster (2009)</xref>, from the 1950s to the 1970s, these contracts favored the operators partly due to fewer operators relative to the number of owners looking for operators to manage their hotels. Contracts that were signed in the early 1980s still continued to be more operator friendly, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938965512458351">Feldman (1995)</xref>. However, contracts signed in the 1990s provided a more balanced document for both operators and owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938965512458351">Feldman 1995</xref>). In fact, deRoos and Eyster stated that the increasing sophistication, scale, and strength of owners resulted in the pendulum swinging toward the owners in terms of management contract provisions in the 1990s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938965512458351">deRoos and Eyster (2009</xref>, 141) noted that the “situation has changed in the 2000s, where power has shifted back to the branded operators.”</p>
<p>Although most industry observers would agree that the current environment represents a period of equilibrium in management contract terms between owners and operators, it is important to know that this balance depends on specific situations and economic conditions when the contract is signed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938965512458351">deRoos 2012</xref>). Generally, the contentious issues in the contracts pertain to contract duration, fees and fee structures, operator financial contributions, performance clauses, termination provisions, and budget and spending limitations. Of particular interest to the analysis of asset management, two landmark court decisions established the fiduciary responsibility of the operator to the owner (i.e., <italic>Wooley v. Embassy Suites</italic> 1991; <italic>2660 Woodley Road v. ITT Sheraton</italic>; in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938965512458351">Shindler 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938965512458351">1998</xref>). That issue is not settled, however. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938965512458351">deRoos (2012)</xref> stated that fiduciary responsibility still remains a contentious issue between owners and operators. Also a matter of contention are operator performance measures, which involve both property owners and asset managers as their agents. As early as 1995, Feldman stated that “perhaps the greatest source of friction between asset manager and property operator centers on measuring the operator’s performance. (p. 41)” The issue continues today, as deRoos notes that the issue of relative amount of base fee to incentive fee shows an owner-induced shift to more incentive fees. Yet performance-termination clauses provide more flexibility for operator today to “cure” cash flow shortfalls and avoid dismissal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938965512458351">deRoos 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to a financial advisor, when an asset manager is selected by an owner to represent its interests, the asset manager must understand the owner’s specific investment objectives and reflect those objectives in the way the manager approaches the assignment. To be successful, it is imperative that an alignment of interests is created (between owner and asset manager) and that the asset manager understands, articulates, and is capable of fulfilling the owner’s investment strategy. The three principal areas where alignment is needed are the investment horizon, the financial return objectives, and the tolerance for risk.</p>
<p>When the 1980s development bubble popped at the end of that decade, the U.S. lodging industry struggled through the worst period of its history since the Great Depression. Faced with a declining economy and the travel slowdown resulting from the Gulf War, equity investors, lenders, and the Resolution Trust Corporation turned to workout specialists to repackage and sell their Real Estate Owned (REO)portfolios and regain some fraction of the value they had lost. This activity was arguably the single most important factor in creating the need for the hotel asset management function, brought in as a consulting troubleshooter.</p>
<p>The initial concept seems to have been that the asset manager function would no longer be needed once all the workouts were complete and the lodging industry returned to prosperity. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938965512458351">Denton (1999)</xref> pointed out, the earliest literature about asset management typically described the work of the asset manager during the lodging industry shakeout and emphasized the asset manager’s role as a workout specialist. But the industry had changed substantially in the crucible of the 1980s. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938965512458351">Feldman (1995</xref>, 36) stated in her seminal article,
<disp-quote>
<p>With complex management contracts, large scale development, and a difficult competitive climate, hotel ownership became increasingly complex, so that many investors in the hospitality industry turned to asset managers for assistance in managing the long term value of the asset.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hotels had become both a complex investment and a sophisticated product with numerous product tiers. Thus, hotels required a division of labor between operational strategy and investment strategy. The conventional owner–operator model has become increasingly difficult to sustain in this complex environment. As a consequence, asset management became a necessary element for the hotel industry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1938965512458351">
<title>Asset Management: Profile of an Emerging Profession</title>
<p>As the ownership of commercial real estate has “institutionalized” over the past fifty years, the role of the real estate asset manager has evolved to fill a need that was created largely by the separation of the ownership and operating management functions. The early view that asset managers were essentially troubleshooters (i.e., workout artists) soon gave way to the realization that asset managers could be ongoing catalysts for growth and improved investment performance.</p>
<p>Thus, thoughtful observers today understand that asset managers are equal parts overseers of lodging properties and long-term strategists who are an integral part of a sophisticated team of operators, owners, brands, and other specialists. Although this article profiles asset managers, we acknowledge the important role of the other players in the hotel deal. One goal of this article is to communicate accurately and fully the hotel asset managers’ duties and to articulate the multiple metrics used to evaluate their role in creating value for the asset, which in no way diminishes the role of the hotel operators and franchise companies in hotel investments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1938965512458351" sec-type="methods">
<title>Research Methods</title>
<p>To delineate the status and role of asset managers, we conducted a study designed to create a profile hotel asset managers and the profession of hotel asset management. Following a review of the relatively limited literature on the topic, which we presented above, we conducted a comprehensive survey of members of the Hospitality Asset Managers Association (HAMA). (The <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1938965512458351">appendix</xref> contains a brief history of the creation of HAMA.) The study objectives were to identify specific functions and activities of asset managers, and to summarize their opinions about issues related to the current profession of hotel asset management. We developed the survey questionnaire based on feedback at HAMA meetings, and all HAMA members were invited to fill out the survey on the web. Participants were given an opportunity to respond over a three- week period and were sent three reminder e-mails. Survey information was tabulated based on eighty-six responses, representing a 57-percent response rate. Just over two-thirds of the respondents were vice presidents or senior vice presidents, and about one-fourth were presidents, principals, or partners. Five had the title of director or asset manager.</p>
<p>We first present the summary statistics from the survey. Whenever possible, we also present the cross-sectional relationships between the asset managers’ profiles, practices, functions, and their beliefs based on Pearson correlation analysis.</p>

<title>Profile of Hotel Asset Management Practice</title>
<p>Based on results of the survey (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1938965512458351">Exhibit 1</xref>), asset management companies may be broadly divided into three types of practices: (1) approximately 34 percent of asset managers work for private ownership groups, (2) institutional owners constitute 31 percent of asset management practices, and (3) 17 percent of asset managers are independent advisors. A few asset managers (5%) work for lenders, and 13 percent noted “Other” in their response. Five respondents who marked “Other” work for REITs, and two work at private equity firms. Private ownership groups comprise private equity investors, opportunity funds, sovereign funds, wealthy individuals, property development firms, and companies whose ownership of hotels is incidental to their primary business functions. Institutional owners are broadly characterized by pension funds, endowment investors, life insurers, banks, and publicly traded companies. Independent advisors operate as third-party asset managers hired by private investors or institutional owners.</p>

<p>When reading the table vertically, we note that only 4 percent of the respondents stated their first job was in asset management, whereas 50 percent said it was their third job and 54 percent said that it was their fourth job.</p>
<p>The table may also be interpreted diagonally to identify the progression of careers. Reading from the top left corner of the table, we see again that 56 percent started in hotel management as their first job, whereas 20 percent stated that their second job was consulting, and 13 percent said that their third job was real estate development; 54 percent chose asset management as their fourth job, whereas 10 percent had accounting as their fifth job. If they started in consulting as their first job (18%), 50 percent became asset managers on their third job. It is clear that the path to an asset management position is shorter if one starts with a real estate development or consulting position as their first job. This speaks to the financial orientation of hotel owners who employ asset management resources, but it also demonstrates the value proposition of asset managers possessing direct experience in hotel operations.</p>
<p>The last row of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1938965512458351">Exhibit 3</xref> is the weighted mean of all the responses and is indicative of the proportion of respondents who had worked in various positions leading to the time this survey was done. By their sixth job, all had held asset management positions, by definition, and 100 percent had also held positions in hotel general management, 57 percent in consulting and investment advisory, 83 percent in hotel development, and 83 percent in accounting.</p>

<title>Chronology of Asset Management Hiring Practices</title>
<p>A deeper understanding of the evolution of the asset management profession emerged when we drilled further into the sample survey data to identify when firms hired asset managers, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1938965512458351">Exhibit 4</xref>. Few asset managers were in practice until the mid-1980s, but as we said above, the hotel industry’s 1980s bubble and development of product tiers were the beginning of asset management as a fixture in the industry. When the hotel deals exploded and hotels went into receivership, the Resolution Trust Corporation and other financial organizations required the services of asset managers. Private equity firms and institutional investors hired asset managers to protect their interests, particularly during the 1993 to 1997 time period, when the industry was in its recovery phase. Most hires during this time period were either at private equity, asset management, or consulting firms, as new owners sought to maximize investment returns through renovations, rebranding, and repositioning strategies. It was also during this time that owners successfully challenged the control property managers had enjoyed under management contracts signed in the previous decades, and also won the court decisions holding that operators were expected to bear a fiduciary responsibility toward hotel owners. By this time, the separation of ownership and management had become part of hotel industry structure, and the profession of asset management had become an integral part of the business model.</p>

<p>As the industry continued to recover and grow profitable from 1993 through 2007 (with the interruption of the 2001 recession and 9/11 attacks), the growth of new ownership entities such as REITs resulted and the availability of debt and equity capital during this period resulted in the growth of hotel development firms, and private equity and private investment companies.

<title>Asset Management Training and Education</title>
<p>To further understand the development of asset managers and their current profile, the questionnaire asked how they learned their asset management skills. As noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1938965512458351">Exhibit 5</xref>, most asset managers (30%) said that they learned their essential skills in hotel operations—not surprising given the fact that more than half the respondents started their careers in hotel management. Other major sources of training and education during their career were “training in an asset management firm” (20%) and “training in a real estate advisory firm” (16%). Other sources of skill development included “college” (13%), “professional education courses” (10%), and “other” sources (11%). “Other” included experience in corporate offices of hotel companies, reading trade and research publications, investment courses, and work experience in various companies such as lending, acquisition, development, brokerage, and accounting firms.</p>

<p>Although the survey did not specifically ask the respondents about the nature of their training and education, we may surmise from their responses that these followed a building-block pattern. As they progressed through their careers, the asset managers built on their general learning from various sources (such as college and hotel operations), which they brought into sharper focus and sophistication at an asset management firm.</p>
<p>Based on correlation analysis, we find that master’s degree holders are more likely to learn asset management from college courses than from hotel operations. Bachelor’s degree holders, however, are more likely to learn that skill from hotel operations, indicating that asset management is not taught in undergraduate programs. It is possible that asset management as a profession or career track is better suited to graduate-level instruction, which is likely professionally oriented, whereas in undergraduate studies, asset management can hardly become a “concentration” or “career track.”</p>
<p>We further analyzed the data to cross-tabulate the respondents’ first jobs and sources of asset management skills (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1938965512458351">Exhibit 6</xref>). If hotel asset managers started their career in hotels, that became the most likely training ground for asset management skills; whereas for those who started in consulting or hotel development, the training ground was most likely in a real estate advisory firm. The logical conclusion of this analysis may be that asset managers who started in hotel operations will bring a strong set of operational analysis skills to their position as asset managers, compared with those who started in consulting and development. The latter are more likely to be stronger in their real estate and investment-analysis skills.</p>

<title>Time Allocation for Asset Management Activities</title>
<p>To determine the amount of time spent by asset managers on their job functions, the respondents were asked to rank order their activities based on the amount of time spent on each activity in the past twelve months, with 10 at the top. Based on the distribution of responses, we summarized the results in three categories: most time spent, average time spent, and least time spent. As noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1938965512458351">Exhibit 9</xref>, asset managers allocated the most amount of time to monitoring the asset’s financial performance, with 71 percent of the respondents choosing Ranks 10 through 8 for this. About 44 percent of the respondents said they spend most of their time on operational reviews, whereas 37 percent placed operational reviews in the average time category. Capital expenditure commanded similar time allocations between most time and average time spent—about 40 percent each. The respondents were evenly split in their time allocation for revenue management activities, with about one-third ranking it between 10 and 8, a little over one-third ranking it 7 to 4, and about one-third ranking it 3 to 1. About 52 percent of the asset managers spent an average amount of time for ownership advisory functions and 39 percent spent an average amount of time for investment advice to owners. In the past twelve months, these asset managers had not spent much time with loan compliance, contracts, or franchise affiliation activities. The low amount of time spent on loan compliance issues may be explained by a generally strong asset performance environment in 2007. In general, when asset performance is strong, less attention is paid to management contract and franchise performance issues.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-1938965512458351">Exhibit 10</xref> presents the correlation coefficients matrix, which shows interesting patterns between asset managers’ training backgrounds, education, and the activities on which they spend their time. For example, asset managers working for institutional owners spend the most time on revenue management. With regard to monitoring the investment community and contracts, asset managers with master’s degrees spend considerable time on these functions, but those with bachelor’s degrees spend the least time on them. Asset managers working for private owners spend the most time advising ownership on management issues, while independent advisors spend the least time on advising investment strategies. Those trained in real estate advisory firms spend the least time on contracts. More experienced asset managers spend the least time on operational reviews. The data suggest that asset managers’ education, training, experience, and employer types are associated with the activities on which they spend their time.</p>

<title>Measurement and Benchmarks of Asset Management Performance</title>
<p>Hotel asset managers’ performance measures were categorized into five quantitative measures and two qualitative measures of performance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-1938965512458351">Exhibit 11</xref>). The quantitative measures are value creation, financial performance, operating measures, asset utilization, and growth measures, using such common metrics as <italic>gross operating profit</italic> (GOP) and revenue per available room (RevPAR). We also selected the performance benchmarks used by asset management firms to gauge their managers’ performance. For example, as noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-1938965512458351">Exhibit 11</xref>, value creation measures are benchmarked against “increased value” or “comparison with investment objectives set at acquisition.”</p>

<p>The qualitative measures are as follows. One was associated with developing or maintaining relationships with stakeholders such as operator, brands, owners, and lenders, and the other was associated with quality. The second one was measured through various property condition, guest satisfaction, and quality scores. Asset managers’ responses did not identify benchmarks for either one of these qualitative measures.</p>
<p>One respondent indicated the use of a Balanced Scorecard performance measurement system, which includes both qualitative and quantitative measures in an integrated, cause–effect system of measurement. It was interesting to note that no response indicated the use of “sustainable development” measures or “green” metrics to evaluate hotel asset manager performance.</p>

<title>Essential Knowledge, Skills, and Experiences for Asset Manager Effectiveness</title>
<p>To help us further understand the practices of effective asset managers, respondents were asked to identify the essential knowledge, skills, and experiences necessary for performance effectiveness as an asset manager, with the results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-1938965512458351">Exhibit 12</xref>. An analysis demonstrates the wide range of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) required for asset managers. Most responses pointed to strong operational experience and a particular understanding of drivers of revenue and costs, along with “intangibles,” such as skills associated with service management and guest satisfaction. Furthermore, a few asset managers stated that experience with franchise and management companies is valuable, as most asset managers have hotels associated with brands. Finally, with regard to experience, a few respondents stated that a wide range of experiences in operations and investment analysis is the best recipe for hotel asset manager success.</p>

<p>As the KSA survey question was open ended, we collated the results into specific categories to allow additional analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-1938965512458351">Exhibit 12</xref>). Based on the survey responses, the knowledge areas emphasized by asset managers were in specialized subjects such as real estate, finance, economics, management contracts, engineering, project management, marketing, and law. Most skills identified by the hotel asset managers could be divided into five categories: investment skills, financial skills, soft skills, planning skills, and people management skills.</p>

<title>The Current State of the Hotel Management Profession</title>
<p>Finally, the survey asked the respondents to state their agreement or disagreement with eight issues associated with the profession, four of which directly speak to the principal–agent relationship between owners and asset managers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table13-1938965512458351">Exhibit 13</xref>). While a little over 20 percent felt that the balance of power has shifted in favor of owners, 28 percent were tentative (s<italic>omewhat disagree</italic>) on this issue, and 50 percent felt that management companies still held sway over ownership. We think this is an important insight, as asset managers have better information than owners based on their day-to-day involvement in operations.</p>

<p>The survey results point out potential misalignment between the goals of owners and operators, a great concern of principal–agent theory, as only 12 percent agreed with the statement that the goals of operating management and ownership are aligned, and 45 percent somewhat agreed with the statement. This result may indicate that the severe dichotomy between the parties has diminished over the years. With regard to the asset managers, they believe that owners have become more demanding in asset managers’ performance—more than 80 percent agreed with this statement. However, a link between the compensation of asset managers and value enhancement was confirmed by only 42 percent, while 27 percent somewhat agreed, and 25 percent did not think that compensation is linked to value enhancement. The evidence indicates that, at least from the perspective of the asset managers that we surveyed, there is plenty room for improvement in terms tying compensation more closely to value enhancement.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the respondents felt that the role of the hotel asset manager has shifted toward investment advisory, with 36 percent in agreement and 28 percent somewhat agreeing with the statement. However, it is clear from the open-ended responses that a regular monitoring of the asset is still an important part of an asset manager’s job. This may be why the respondents said that a grounding in real estate investments and a grounding in hotel operations were equally important. At the moment, the responding hotel asset managers either did not know or disagreed that current coursework at universities and colleges adequately prepared them to enter the profession.</p>
<p>Our cross-sectional correlation analysis also indicates some interesting patterns between asset managers’ training and their beliefs on these issues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table14-1938965512458351">Exhibit 14</xref>). Managers trained in asset management firms are least likely to believe that the balance of power today favors ownership over management. Managers trained in hotel operations are less likely to believe that the best asset managers in the future will have a strong grounding in real estate investments, and instead this group is most likely to believe that the best asset managers in the future will have a strong grounding in hotel operations. Those trained in real estate firms hold a diametrically opposed view. Those with several years of work experience and those working for institutional owners believe that the best asset managers in the future will have a strong grounding in real estate investments, and these respondents were the least likely to believe that the best asset managers in the future will have a strong grounding in hotel operations. Those trained via professional education courses are most likely to believe that the asset manager’s role has shifted from day-to-day monitoring to strategic investment advisory, and this group believes that the best asset managers in the future will have involvement with hotel operations. Clearly, the type of training that asset managers received in preparing for their profession affects their views on how to develop the best asset manager.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The hotel industry currently has a distinct separation between hotel owners and hotel operators, and on the ownership side there is a growing degree of separation between financial partners and operating partners. Both of these recent trends have contributed to the growing need for dedicated hotel asset managers who can act as intermediaries between the operating and investment disciplines. As the profile of real estate investment ownership shifts over time, the hotel asset management profession will continue to evolve accordingly to continue to serve the needs of hotel owners and investors worldwide. Results of this study help provide a baseline understanding of the evolution of asset managers from their initial role of troubleshooters to their current ongoing professional role of representing ownership interests and working synergistically with hotel operators to maximize investment value. The study thus adds to the academic and professional literature. As the hotel industry continues its growth and evolution, we expect issues inevitably to arise pertaining to typical principal–agent relationships. Fortunately, the extensive literature in economics and financial management provides ample theories and tools to understand and tackle these issues.</p>
<p>As a closing note, we point out that our survey has its limitations. The respondent pool is relatively small, and the survey avoided issues related to litigation against asset managers. Given the voluntary nature of data gathering, we did not include that issue in our survey.</p>

<title>Appendix</title>
<sec id="section17-1938965512458351">
<title>The Hospitality Asset Managers Association (HAMA)</title>
<p>In 1991, asset managers assembled in a hotel room at the Los Angeles Airport to think of a way to address their joint frustration with their lack of influence over the management companies operating their hotels. This small group consisted of David Johnstone, Kenneth J. Geist, Robert Kline, Gary M. Driggers, C. Barry Robinson, and Anthony C. Dimond. The result of this initial meeting was the formation of the HAMA. The association’s principal objective was to create a unified voice for hotel owners to deal with their frustrations with management companies and the hegemony they enjoyed through contracts that heavily favored the operator. HAMA, which started with the 6 founding members just mentioned, is now a professional body consisting of 160 members. The owners represented in HAMA own approximately 2,000 hotels and 500,000 hotel rooms. The association’s current mission statement signifies its evolution from a loose-knit group of owners’ representatives to a professional organization representing an emerging and vitally important profession.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1938965512458351">
<title>HAMA Mission Statement</title>
<p>The HAMA is the preeminent organization of professionals representing hotel ownership worldwide. Our mission is the enhancement of hospitality asset values through the educational advancement of the profession and serving as the collective voice of ownership.</p>
<p>Despite its important position in the hotel industry today, asset management is a relatively young profession that combines aspects of hotel operations and real estate investments. As a representative of ownership interests, asset management as a discipline emerged in the 1980s. Initially seen as workout specialists, asset managers evolved into professionals who provided oversight for a hotel’s operations and physical assets, and more recently they have taken on the strategic role of managing the investment with an eye to value creation. To date, there has been no comprehensive academic study to document this evolution of hotel asset management. In particular, the causes and effects of the trend in the industry for ownership and operation to be separated have not been fully explored.</p>
<p>To capture the essence of a discipline or practice such as hotel asset management, it is important to establish definitions and define roles, responsibilities, and practices. These invariably will change as the industry continues to evolve and ownership groups continue to change. As a young and dynamic profession, the evolving role of hotel asset management is interesting and important to both academia and professionals in the field.</p>
