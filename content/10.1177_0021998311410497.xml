<abstract>
<p>A flax-reinforced sandwich structure suitable for replacing wood in the top plates of string musical instruments was developed. The mechanical properties of Sitka spruce, the most widely used wood species for this application, were taken as a benchmark when the new materials were developed. The materials were characterized by static and dynamic methods to determine the dynamic Young’s modulus, shear modulus, internal friction, and static mechanical properties. Based on the material characterization, a hand lay-up process with a two-part closed mold and internal pressure bladder was developed and six prototype ukuleles were manufactured. The results show that the flax-reinforced sandwich structure can successfully act as a top plate and that an efficient manufacturing process can be developed to produce monocoque string musical instruments out of composite materials.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311410497" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In relatively recent times, the development of composite materials has led to superior performance for many applications. An often overlooked application that has benefited greatly from their development is musical instruments. A variety of musical instrument components are now commonly made from composite materials including saxophone reeds, neck stiffeners, bows, and string instrument top plates. Top plates are an especially interesting application since the inherent orthotropic behavior of composites makes them a suitable replacement for wood. For this reason, composite guitar and violin top plates were developed as early as 1975.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410497">1</xref></sup> Several string instruments with composite top plates can now be found in the marketplace ranging from cellos to mandolins. There are several reasons why composites have been used in string instruments including better resistance to environmental changes, less material variability, lower production time, and the depleting supply of certain wood species.</p>
<p>Several types of composite materials have been previously investigated for this application ranging from synthetic fibers such as carbon and fiberglass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410497">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311410497">5</xref></sup> to natural fibers such as bamboo and wood fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311410497">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311410497">7</xref></sup> A category of natural fibers that have not yet been considered are bast fibers. Bast fibers are derived from the stems of certain species of plants and have a relatively low density and high stiffness. The wood-like properties of these fibers make them seem like ideal candidates for this application and were therefore selected as the focus of this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021998311410497"><title>Background</title>
<p>Wood is a remarkable material due to its low density and high specific modulus. Consequently, it is not straightforward to select another material to replace it. In general terms, wood can be seen as a natural composite material, with cellulose fibers surrounded by a lignin and hemicellulose matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311410497">8</xref></sup> The low density of wood comes from its high porosity, typically around 60% for spruce.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311410497">9</xref></sup> It would initially seem possible to replace it with an equally porous natural fiber composite since these materials are also normally cellulose based. However, this approach was not feasible since the microstructure of wood is very complex and both microscopic and macroscopic properties contribute to its high mechanical properties. Even though the layer angles in the cell wall of wood are much the same as a composite material ply sequence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311410497">8</xref></sup> it would be very difficult to recreate this complex microstructure with existing manufacturing technology.</p>
<p>Throughout the history, certain species of wood have been known to possess good qualities for use as top plates. The instrument’s success has traditionally relied upon the skills of a luthier to select these species and to choose sections that are free from defects. Sitka spruce (<italic>Picea sitchensi</italic>) has been known for centuries to produce good top plates but it was not until relatively recent times that researchers have determined which mechanical properties make it desirable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410497">10</xref></sup> It has been generally agreed upon that materials with a high specific modulus and low internal friction in the grain direction producethe best top plates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311410497">11</xref></sup> Ono et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311410497">12</xref></sup> further demonstrated that the stiffness in the cross-grain direction also contributes to the overall sound quality and that the shear modulus governs the behavior in the high frequency range. Thus, all these dynamic properties must be taken into account when developing a synthetic material that results in the same dynamic behavior as Sitka spruce. Other important factors are the density and strength of the material. It is desirable not to exceed the areal density of a typical spruce top plate in order to maintain the radiation efficiency of the instrument. Aspruce top plate of 2.5 mm thickness typically has an areal density ranging from 1.1 to 1.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410497">1</xref></sup> The material must also be strong enough to withstand the tension of the strings. Finally, a high degree of anisotropy is also desirable so that the top plate responds better to a wider range of frequencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311410497">11</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0021998311410497"><title>Mechanical characterization</title>
<p>Since it was not feasible to imitate the microstructure of wood, the approach of developing a sandwich structure was taken as was done in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410497">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311410497">12</xref></sup> To achieve the required mechanical properties for a top plate, it was critical to select appropriate fiber, matrix, and core materials. In the past, it would have been difficult to make a good top plate based on natural fibers but with the quality of these fibers increasing it is now more realistic. After selecting appropriate materials, both static and dynamic tests were performed to compare the mechanical properties of the natural fiber composite with those of Sitka spruce.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0021998311410497" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title>
<p>Due to the limited availability of useful fabrics made from bast fibers, only flax (<italic>Linum usitatissimum</italic>) was considered in this study. Unidirectional (FUD-180) and woven (FFA-200) flax prepregs with fiber areal densities of 180 and 172 g/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, were obtained from the Belgian company Lineo. Sitka spruce was obtained from the luthier supplier Stuart Macdonald for comparison. Balsa wood strips were obtained from a local hobbyist store for use as a core material. Balsa was selected for its low damping properties based on the results of McIntyre and Woodhouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311410497">13</xref></sup> In that study, it was found that a carbon fiber/balsa sandwich structure had lower internal friction than Sitka spruce.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021998311410497"><title>Sample preparation</title>
<p>Flax samples were manufactured on a heated press with a pressure of 100 psi. This pressure was chosen to correspond to that which was applied during manufacturing of the prototype ukuleles. The tool consisted of two nested aluminum plates that were not sealed so that resin was able to bleed off during the process. For the tensile testing, samples were also manufactured by vacuum bag techniques for comparison. The cure cycle was selected from the material specifications and corresponded to a 2°C/min heating rate followed by a hold of 140°C for 30 min and a cooling rate of 2.5°C/min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0021998311410497"><title>Static testing</title>
<p>Tensile, compression, and shear testing was performed on a 100-kN MTS® load testing machine. Five samples were tested for each case and an average was taken for the final results. A summary of the results is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311410497">Table 1</xref>, where herein FUD-180 and FFA-200 represent the cured unidirectional and woven flax/epoxy prepregs, respectively.

<sec id="sec7-0021998311410497"><title>Tensile</title>
<p>Tensile testing was carried out in accordance with ASTM D3039<sup>14</sup> using a sample size of 2 × 15 × 25 mm<sup>3</sup>. Along with the cured flax prepregs, spruce and balsa were also tested. A displacement rate of 5 mm/min was applied for the fiber direction and 1 mm/min for the transverse direction. A tangent of the initial section of the curve was used to calculate the elastic modulus. An average of the stress–strain curves is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410497">Figure 1</xref>. The relationship between fiber volume fraction and Young’s modulus is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311410497">Figure 2</xref>.

<p>Due to the large difference in bulk density of the materials, it was more useful to compare their specific properties, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311410497">Figure 3</xref>. It can be seen that Sitka spruce had the highest specific modulus in the grain direction. Therefore, it was concluded that the flax prepreg, processed by the above methods, did not lead to a suitable top plate material on its own. However, by creating a sandwich structure with a low-density balsa core, it was feasible to achieve the required bending stiffness without exceeding the areal density limit.
<fig id="fig3-0021998311410497" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Specific tensile properties: (a) modulus and (b) strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311410497">15</xref></sup>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410497-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It should be noted that the specific modulus of the unidirectional flax/epoxy was comparable to literature values for E-glass/epoxy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311410497">15</xref></sup> However, E-glass/epoxy was far superior in specific strength. This suggests that flax fibers have the potential to replace glass fibers in stiffness-driven applications but not strength-driven applications. This is in agreement with the conclusions of other studies on flax fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311410497">16</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311410497">18</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0021998311410497"><title>Compression</title>
<p>Due to the bending moment applied by the bridge on the top plate of the instrument, there are some fibers that are in tension and others that are in compression. Since composite materials generally have lower properties in compression, it was important to obtain the compressive strength of the materials in order to determine accurate failure criteria.</p>
<p>To perform compression testing, specimens were supported using detachable steel tabs with a gage length of 1 cm and a loading rate of 1 mm/min was applied. The dimensions of the specimens were 3.4  ×  14  ×  25 mm<sup>3</sup>. This configuration was based on the work of Shokrieh.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311410497">19</xref></sup> Two failure modes were observed with this setup: buckling and kinking. Pure compressive fiber failure was likely not observed dueto the relatively low modulus of the natural fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311410497">20</xref></sup> The resulting specific compressive strength was comparable to literature values for Sitka spruce.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311410497">21</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0021998311410497"><title>Shear</title>
<p>As mentioned above, it has been shown that there is a correlation between the shear modulus and the high-frequency behavior of a top plate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311410497">12</xref></sup> Using a sandwich structure inevitably leads to a reduction of in-plane shear properties. Consequently, this factor was taken into account. This effect was minimized using a balsa core that had some contribution to the shear properties. To obtain the shear properties, a three-rail test fixture developed by Eilers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311410497">22</xref></sup> was used with a 100-kN MTS® load testing machine. The results of the shear testing showed that the flax materials had a higher specific shear modulus than literature values for spruce. However, by combining the flax prepreg with balsa wood, it was possible to make a sandwich structure with similar apparent shear properties.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0021998311410497"><title>Dynamic testing</title>
<p>Although static testing provided a good initial assessment of the flax sandwich structure’s ability to act as a top plate, it could not determine the internal friction or dynamic elastic properties. These properties define the dynamic behavior of the final material; thus, were critical for an application that was a coupled system of vibrating elements. To obtain these properties, dynamic testing was performed in accordance with ASTM E1876-09.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311410497">23</xref></sup> This standard involved exciting small beam specimens in flexural and torsional modes of vibration to determine the dynamic Young’s and shear moduli, respectively. Several other methods of obtaining these parameters from orthotropic plate samples have also been investigated in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311410497">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311410497">24</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311410497">27</xref></sup> However, at the time of writing of this article, no standardized test existed.</p>
<p>Based on the results of static testing, classical laminate theory was used to predict which ply sequences and core thickness would lead to the desired mechanical properties. The lower limit of the number of plies was restricted by the required bending stiffness and the upper limit by the maximum allowable areal density. It was found that a 2-mm thick balsa core with outer skins of one unidirectional layer led to a sandwich panel with comparable bending stiffness to a 2.5-mm thick spruce top plate without exceeding the allowable areal density.</p>
<p>It was also desired to develop a ply sequence for theback plate that had similar properties to one of themost commonly used wood species for this component, European maple (<italic>Acer pseudoplatanus</italic>). To achieve this, two additional woven layers were added to the top plate ply sequence. It was determined that a core thickness of 1.6 mm led to the bending stiffness of a 2.5-mm thick maple back plate. This resulted in a slightly greater areal density compared to typical maple back plates; however, this was not deemed to be a problem since the back plate has been traditionally selected for its appearance and not its mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998311410497">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>To test the samples, a dynamic testing setup was designed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311410497">Figure 4</xref>). Both the non-contact excitation method and impulse excitation were selected in order to minimize errors on the measured loss factors. The response of the beams was measured using a Polytec OFV-2000 laser Doppler velocimeter and the excitation was generated using a steel ball hanging from a thread. The thread was 32 cm long and the ball was dropped from an angle of 15°. This angle provided a good signal while being close enough to consistently place the location of impact. The samples were supported in a steel frame suspended by fine fishing line and the assembly was placed on a damping isolation pad. The recommended dimensions of the beam samples were 20  ×  80  ×  3 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410497">3</xref></sup> in order to comply with beam theory assumptions and also to the place the resonant frequencies in an acceptable range. However, due to fixed core and skin dimensions, the actual sandwich structure samples were 2.66 mm thick for the top plate and 2.82 mm thick for the back plate. Small holes of approximately 1 mm in diameter were drilled in the node lines so that the samples could be supported by the fishing line. This can be shown to have little effect on the measured properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311410497">13</xref></sup> A sample of the time- and frequency-domain responses obtained from this setup is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410497">Figure 5</xref> where the latter was obtained by fast-Fourier transform analysis in MATLAB.
<fig id="fig4-0021998311410497" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Schematic of dynamic testing setup.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410497-fig4.tif"/></fig>

<p>It can be seen that the time-domain signal contained two main frequencies. A higher frequency superimposed on a much lower frequency. The lower frequency signal was the rigid body motion of the beam and the higher frequency signal resulted from the vibration mode in question. The two were differentiated in the frequency-domain so that the dynamic mechanical properties could be calculated from the resonant frequency of the desired vibration mode. The test was repeated until five frequency values within 1% were obtained and an average was taken. The dynamic Young’s modulus was then obtained from:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311410497">23</xref></sup>

<p>The results for Sitka spruce agreed well with those obtained by Ono and Morimoto.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021998311410497">30</xref></sup> The flax/balsa top plate had comparable internal friction to spruce as well as a high enough apparent flexural modulus. Therefore, the dynamic testing results suggested that the flax/balsa sandwich structure could achieve the necessary mechanical properties deemed important in the literature for a top plate material.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0021998311410497"><title>Design and manufacturing</title>
<p>After the material characterization suggested that the flax-reinforced sandwich structure could successfully act as a top plate, a prototype ukulele was designed and manufactured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410497">Figure 7</xref>). Due to the cost of tooling, it was desired to select a small musical instrument to develop a manufacturing process that could be adapted to string instruments of any size. The smallest instrument of the guitar family was selected, namely, the soprano ukulele. Based on ukulele dimensions that have been developed over the years, a three-dimensional computer model was first created (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410497">Figure 7(a)</xref>). Molding considerations were taken into account and draft angles of 3° were included in the sides of the instrument.
<fig id="fig7-0021998311410497" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Prototype ukulele: (a) CAD model and (b) finished part.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410497-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<sec id="sec12-0021998311410497"><title>Mold design</title>
<p>Based on the computer model, a two-part closed mold with an internal pressure bladder and core was designed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311410497">Figure 8(a)</xref>). Since draft angles had been taken into consideration in the initial CAD model, it was straightforward to define the parting regions. The design flexibility of composite materials allowed for some interesting possibilities that would not have been possible with a wooden construction. In this case, the mold was designed to produce a monocoque string instrument. The mold was CNC machined out of aluminum 6061 followed by sanding and polishing to ensure a good surface finish. The finished mold is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311410497">Figure 8(b)</xref>.
<fig id="fig8-0021998311410497" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Mold design: (a) assembly and (b) completed mold.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410497-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<sec id="sec13-0021998311410497"><title>Internal pressure bladder</title>
<p>Designing the internal bladder was an important part of the mold design. Several factors were considered: cost, reusability, compatibility, and strength. In the development of the pressure bladder, both silicone and latex bladders were experimented with.</p>
<p>It was initially desired to make bladders with the existing two-part closed mold in order to reduce prototyping time and also to eliminate the need for a core in the neck and head sections. This was achieved using Air Tech® MultiBag liquid silicone that was designed to create a flexible reusable vacuum bag on a one-sided mold. In this study, it was attempted to coat the surfaces of a two-part closed mold to produce an internal bladder. To make the bladders, three layers of the liquid silicone were first applied to both mold halves and allowed to fully cure. A large bead of the liquid silicone was then placed around the parting line and the mold was closed. The closed mold was then inverted so that the liquid silicone would flow and connect the two mold halves. The silicone bladder created by this method is shown inside of the mold in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311410497">Figure 9(a)</xref>.
<fig id="fig9-0021998311410497" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Internal pressure bladders: (a) silicone inside of mold and (b) latex with dipping mandrel.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410497-fig9.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The silicone bladder had a few advantages including low cost, no need for additional tooling, and rapid production time. One significant problem was that the final size of the silicone bladder was too large. Ideally, a bladder should be slightly smaller than the tool so that when it expands, no resin ridges are produced. The silicone bladder produced by this method was the same size as the mold cavity and left large resin ridges on the inside of the prototype. Furthermore, it had a tendency to break at weak points which was a serious problem during manufacturing of the prototypes. For these two reasons (size problem and sensitivity to failure under pressure), this bladder was deemed not acceptable.</p>
<p>Based on the work of Ghiasi et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021998311410497">31</xref></sup> pressure bladders out of latex were also experimented with. This type of bladder is made by dipping a tool into a mixture of hotwater and latex to form a bladder based on the tool geometry. The dipping process is carried out by Piercan USA Inc., a company that specializes in custom latex bladders. The material selected for the dipping tool must be able to withstand temperatures above 115°C and be impervious to water. The dipping tool must also be designed with a large enough opening so that the bladder can be stretched off. The manufacturer recommends limiting this stretching to around 500% but stretching up to 700% can be accommodated. Due to the stretching limitation, it was not possible to make a latex bladder with the entire part geometry. Consequently, another method of applying internal pressure concurrently was devised. A latex bladder was selected for the body section and a lightweight foam core was machined with a scale factor of 94% for the neck and head sections. This scaling factor was small enough so that the cores could be easily inserted during the lay-up but also large enough so that sufficient pressure was applied and a good surface finish was obtained. The dipping tool was machined from RenShape® 473, a polyurethane tooling board, and is shown with the latex bladder in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311410497">Figure 9(b)</xref>. For heavier production, a metallic material is recommended for the dipping mandrel but for prototype work, this tooling material proved to be adequate.</p>
<p>To seal the bladder, a custom device was developed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311410497">Figure 10</xref>. This device was attached to a tapered hole in the mold so that it would further seal the inlet when pressure was applied. It was located at the existing hole in the top plate so that it would not leave a mark on the finished part.
<fig id="fig10-0021998311410497" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p>Lay-up illustrating bonding tabs, pressure bladder, and core.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410497-fig10.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In summary, the latex bladder proved to be much more durable and also better in terms of size flexibility. They did however have a tendency to stick to the cured part. However, if sufficient care was taken in removal, it was possible to reuse them.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0021998311410497"><title>Lay-up</title>
<p>After the two-part mold was completed, a manual handlay-up process was developed with the prepreg materials. A total of six parts were manufactured and improvements were made to the process along the way.The most significant aspect of the process that needed adjustment was the definition of the preforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311410497">Figure 11</xref>). The preforms were initially based on flat pattern features of the CAD model. These proved to be inadequate due to the unique draping requirements of the material system. Consequently, adjustments were made to them after each prototype. The final preforms ressembled the shapes that are cut out of wood when producing a string instrument in a traditional manner. They also produced the same grain orientations as those on wooden musical instruments to further help mimic the frequency response.
<fig id="fig11-0021998311410497" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><p>Fiber preforms.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410497-fig11.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Due to the monocoque structure of the instrument, a method was devised to connect the two mold halves. This was achieved by adding tabs to the lower half preforms so that they could be folded over the foam core and bladder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311410497">Figure 10</xref>). When internal pressure was applied, these tabs bonded to the material in the upper half of the mold. This method could also be adapted to mold other hollow monocoque structures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0021998311410497"><title>Cure cycle</title>
<p>It was acknowledged that the large size of the aluminum mold would lead to a heating lag in the convection oven. To gain more insight into the thermal behavior of the mold, an experiment was carried out with the empty two-part mould. A thermocouple was placed inside of the empty mold and another was placed in the air of the oven while the whole setup was subjected to a cure cycle. The thermocouple was fed through the bladder-sealing device and attached to the bottom of the cavity, where the greatest temperature lag would likely occur. The thermocouples were connected to a data acquisition system and a general cure cycle of ramps, holds, and overshoots was run to simulate all possible features that could be added to the cure cycle. The heating and cooling rates were selected based on the specifications of the material. The results are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311410497">Figure 12</xref>.
<fig id="fig12-0021998311410497" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><p>Air and mold temperature during cure cycle.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410497-fig12.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It can be seen that the internal mold temperature lagged dramatically behind the air temperature of the oven. It took the mold approximately an extra 2.5 h to reach the initial hold of 80°C and a further extra 2.5 h to reach the final cure temperature of 140°C. The overshoots proved to be a good method of reducing the time for the mold to reach the requested temperatures. Based on these data, the cure cycle hold time was increased to 5.5 h and an overshoot of 20°C was added to the heating ramp.</p>
<p>After curing of the prototype, the bladder and sealing device were removed and the components of the string instrument were installed. The ukulele was finally ready to play (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410497">Figure 7(b)</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0021998311410497"><title>Prototype evaluation</title>
<p>The prototypes were qualitatively assessed by professional performers along with a Hawaiian koa ukuleleof known high quality (Kamaka HF-1). Qualitative results suggest that the sound quality is comparable but some distinct differences are apparent. Most notably, the natural fiber string instruments tended to have a reduced lower frequency response. This was potentially a result of the Helmholtz resonance, which largely governs thelower frequency response of the instrument, being improperly ‘tuned.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021998311410497">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>To evaluate string instruments, it is common practice to compare frequency response curves such as the driving-point admittance at the bridge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410497">10</xref></sup> However, this was not carried out in this case due to inherent differences in response due to the monocoque structure. A string instrument can be seen as a coupled system of vibrating elements and a monocoque structure would likely result in different boundary conditions and would thus influence the overall frequency response. The effect of this structural variation on the frequency response was beyond the scope of this study but could be an interesting topic of future work.</p>

<sec id="sec17-0021998311410497" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Due to the broad nature of this study, a few conclusions can be drawn from the various stages. First, the static material characterization indicated that a flax, epoxy, and balsa sandwich structure could attain the required bending stiffness of a string instrument top plate without exceeding the areal density of those typically made from Sitka spruce. It also indicated that the studied flax/epoxy materials had a similar specific modulus to E-glass/epoxy and could therefore replace it in stiffness-driven application. However, it had a much lower specific strength. Therefore, it was not suitable for replacing E-glass in strength-driven applications. The results of the dynamic testing confirmed that the sandwich structure had a sufficiently high bending stiffness and a low enough areal density as well as comparable internal friction to Sitka spruce. Therefore, the flax-reinforced sandwich structure was deemed to be a suitable top plate material since it achieved all the required mechanical properties that have been previously shown to be important.</p>
<p>Based on the results of the material characterization, a hand lay-up manufacturing method in conjunction with an internal pressure bladder and core was successfully developed and a total of six prototype ukuleles were made. Latex bladders were shown to be superior to silicone bladders made from the existing mold in terms of durability and reusability.</p>
<p>Finally, as a result of the interdisciplinary nature of this part of the study, two unique contributions were made:
<list id="list1-0021998311410497" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Innovative manufacturing process for composite string instruments – A start-to-finish manufacturing process was developed to produce repeatable monocoque composite string instruments. At the time ofwriting of this article, no other string instrumentscould be found that were made in such a way from either wood or composite. This type of structurewould be advantageous in reducing assembly time during the production of string instruments made from composite materials.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dynamic testing – The use of dynamic testing was also an important contribution. Static testing methods are very common for characterizing composite materials but the use of dynamic testing is limited. This study shows that the results of static and dynamic testings are in good agreement up to a frequency of about 2 kHz.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>It is hoped that the results of this research will assist future efforts in using flax and other bast fibers in string instruments as well as other novel applications.</p>
