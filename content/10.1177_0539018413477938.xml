<p>This paper is a review of the work of four scholars who have made substantial new developments in our understanding of animal mind and animal–human interactions. Dominique Lestel indicates that culture is rooted in the animal realm and draws upon ethology and ethnography to study animal worlds. Vinciane Despret pays heed to complex animal–human sociality and combines critical psychology and ethology to take account of animal mind. Roberto Marchesini argues that animal influence on humans is widespread and is foundational to culture; he uses anthropology and ethology to expand the field of animal–human interactions. Giorgio Celli holds that ethology permeates the spaces of everyday life and that animals such as cats demonstrate complex problem-solving and social behavior.</p>

<body>
<p>Recent decades have seen a veritable flowering of new approaches and important advances in the cognitive science of animals. Cognitive ethology and critical interpretations of the ethological tradition have revealed many ways in which the study of animal behavior had fallen prey to narrow, limiting and inadequate models that in turn severely limited research results and published findings. At the same time, the rapid development of cognitive science has called into question a number of the traits that might formerly have been claimed to be unique to humans, and indicated that animals partake in many of the complex thought and reasoning processes that humans do (or indeed that there are instances where animals surpass humans or demonstrate unique and advantageous adaptations). Both branches of these developments, critical ethology and cognitive science, have been informed by evolution and recent advances in evolutionary theory. Taken together, they disclose a field of new observations and interpretations of animal behavior and animal mind, and point the way towards an ongoing renaissance within every discipline – scientific, social scientific and humanities alike – vis-à-vis the status of human–animal relations.</p>
<p>Here I would like to give an overview of the work of four important contributors to this area: Dominique Lestel, Vinciane Despret, Roberto Marchesini and Giorgio Celli. Each has made important contributions and generated key concepts, but each also remains almost entirely untranslated into English. As a result, Anglophone researchers working on these questions are denied the possibility of consulting an invaluable body of literature. This paper is at least a partial step towards rectifying that lack, in the hope that bridges will continue to be built.</p>
<p>Each of these four scholars uses a combination of both natural science and social scientific or humanities approaches to produce a broader field of inquiry within which animal mind and animal behavior can be more accurately interpreted. All of them are thoroughly versed in evolutionary theory and share a strong interest in ethology. All of them also demonstrate an engagement with important aspects of the philosophical tradition that helps them to figure and refigure questions of animal mind. Giorgio Celli was one of the most noted ethologists of his generation and a prominent figure in entomology. Roberto Marchesini is the primary exponent of zooanthropology in Italy, and responsible for developing new ways of studying animal–human interaction predicated around rich concepts of mind and signification. Vinciane Despret, who sometimes describes herself as conducting an ‘ethology of ethologists’, has devoted considerable attention to, among other problems, the issue of what questions animals are <italic>really</italic> responding to in the experimental setups that humans subject them to (almost invariably, the questions are quite different from those the human experimenters believe they are responding to). Dominique Lestel combines a detailed knowledge of ethology and field observation with critical philosophical analysis to indicate that culture and complex problem-solving are rooted in the animal realm, rather than being distinctive aspects of an elevated humanity. Taken together, these four significantly reconfigure the ground of ethological analysis and human–animal interaction studies, and in so doing they open significant new ground for study and interpretation.</p>
<p>In this necessarily brief overview, I strive to give an exposition of a few of the most provocative and useful concepts that each of these authors has proposed and elaborated. I choose four concepts from each, describe them in a succinct fashion, and discuss the ways in which they prove useful in challenging outdated ideas and providing research frameworks for ongoing investigation in the area of animal cognitive science and human–animal interactions. It is my hope that, though brief, this overview of some main concepts will provide researchers with tools in the area and catalyze further interest in the impressive bodies of work of each of these four key thinkers. While a full account of the breadth and sophistication of each of their approaches cannot be given here, at least some initial points of interest and dialogue can be established.</p>
<p>It also bears noting that these scholars engage with one another’s work. Despret and Lestel have an ongoing conversation in print as well as a long friendship. They frequently draw concepts from one another and engage with some of the same questions and approaches. The fact that both of them draw upon social scientific, philosophical and natural-scientific data and methods makes for significant crossover in their work. In addition, they have co-written a text on the great apes, along with Pascal Picq and Chris Herzfeld. Celli and Marchesini also engaged with one another’s writings and had a long friendship. Celli was something of a mentor to Marchesini in studies of ethology and animal mind, and he wrote the introduction to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0539018413477938">Marchesini’s 1996</xref> <italic>Natura e pedagogia</italic>. Celli’s emphasis on transversal ethology, in which humans and other animals are treated as equally significant social and mental agents in the world, had a deep influence on Marchesini, as can be seen for instance in the latter’s concepts of multiple intelligences and multiple interfaces. Marchesini and Lestel know each other’s works, and have recently begun to correspond.</p>

<title>Dominique Lestel</title>
<p>A founding member of the Cognitive Science Department at the Ecole Normale Supérieure, Dominique Lestel is a Professor of Philosophy there. He is also the co-director of the program in Eco-Ethology and Cognitive Ethology (Etho-Ethnography and Ethno-Ethology) at the Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle and the Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS). Since the early 1990s, he has been following a sustained trajectory concerning the study of animals, and in particular the scientific and philosophical analysis of human and animal interactions. Like the other thinkers presented here, he makes rigorous use of the natural sciences, humanities and social sciences in order to address particular empirical and theoretical problems concerning animality. To give as comprehensive an account of his work as possible in this brief introduction, his concepts of animality, culture, friendship and ethno-ethology (or etho-ethnography) are presented here.</p>
<sec id="section2-0539018413477938">
<title>Animality</title>
<p>Lestel’s account is strongly informed by evolution and evolutionary theory, and he opposes the separation of human and animal life in the myriad forms this distinction assumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0539018413477938">Lestel, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0539018413477938">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0539018413477938">2010</xref>). However, he points out that the realization of this continuity is neither simple nor straightforward. Forms range from a hierarchical ladder of evolved living beings that maintains a clear superiority for humans (as seen for instance in Pierre Teilhard de Chardin) to a blithe notion of humans as animals that shows no regard for the specificity of different types of animals and different types of phylogenetic development. As such, for him, the understanding of ‘animality’ is paramount to a robust understanding of evolutionary continuity and its cultural implications. Through making evolutionary continuity certain, Darwin and Darwinism have rendered the concept and meaning of animality simultaneously more important and more difficult.</p>
<p>Animality cannot be effectively understood through either simple anthropomorphism or theriomorphism. Purely and directly attributing human traits to animals (anthropomorphism), and casting humans as animals in the debased and degraded sense in which we have often understood them (theriomorphism), do not help to give any greater insight into the complicated identity and relations they share. More sophisticated types of anthropomorphism and theriomorphism are required, as is a serious ongoing mediation about animality in terms of its implications for all animals, including humans. As should be evident, a central pivot of Lestel’s understanding is a rejection of the usual position of the human as over-against the animal.</p>
<p>Given his reframing of the question of animality, Lestel revisits debates about humanization. In light of evolutionary continuity, he sees this as an <italic>ongoing</italic> performative practice rather than an historical threshold that was crossed long ago (such as with tool use, language or some other development). Given the lack of any real separation of humans from animals, various aspects of human behavior are mobilized to claim and prop up a distinction. Humans must stridently try to prove the impossible claim that they are not animals. From the other direction, he notes that many animals also cross this threshold in meaningful respects by either satisfying the criteria for humanization or producing social identities of their own in interactions with each other or with humans.</p>
<p>Furthering this inquiry about humanization, Lestel argues that it is based on retaining and intensifying animal characteristics rather than leaving them behind. Thus the much-ballyhooed development of the opposable thumb, valuable as it is, is highly structurally and functionally reminiscent of the pincer of a crab. Language, too, rather than being a distinct human characteristic (we now know conclusively that it is not), is an extension of sounding and signifying practices present in numerous animals.</p>
<p>Any reconsideration of animality also directly entails critical confrontation with a landmark, recurring concept in French thought: that of the <italic>propre de l’homme</italic>, or that which is ‘proper to the human’ (unique or peculiar to humans). This concept has a range of associations, from its explicit anthropocentrism that aims to set humans apart, to the denotations of owned property that are not incidental in this area (recall the Book of Genesis, among other sources). If animality pertains to humans, and if forms of humanization and socialization pertain to other animals, that which is proper to humans is a dwindling category.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0539018413477938">
<title>Culture</title>
<p>One of the most important sustained aspects of analysis in Lestel’s work is the repudiation of the so-called nature–culture divide as a meaningful difference between humans and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0539018413477938">Lestel, 2001</xref>). Via the trajectory of evolutionary continuity and animality, he indicates the natural aspects of humans, and in a number of cases drawn from the ethological literature, he argues persuasively that culture is abundantly present among animals, and indeed that the development of culture in humans is part of this particular aspect of evolutionary continuity.</p>
<p>The very etymology of culture, as Raymond Williams reminds us, has to do with the cultivation of plants in agriculture. As such, it is perhaps not surprising that Lestel treats several instances in different types of animals of the cultivation of plants or fungi as an example of culture in the deepest sense. One of the most striking examples is that of ants who cultivate mushroom-like fungi within their colonies for food, devoting careful attention to specific, characteristic needs of the fungi for growth and robustness. The fact that the ants regularly take part in this activity, thus producing a component of their foodstuff in a manner very similar to farming by humans, is in itself remarkable. It represents a planned, future-oriented use of resources and labor in order to produce an outcome that is beneficial for the colony. Making space for and using their resources on the fungi would seem wasteful in the short term; the payoff comes only when they mature and are ready to be eaten. This cultivation also shows a particular type of coexistence and interspecies interaction, in which the ants ‘tame’ wild mushroom strains and build up a complex relationship with them.</p>
<p>An astonishing aspect of ant cultivation of fungus that underscores its importance as an instance of culture is that the particular strains of fungus cultivated vary by ant colony, such that colonies of the same species of ant in close physical proximity cultivate different fungi, or that unrelated ant species may cultivate the same species of fungus. For Lestel, the fact that each nest cultivates a particular mushroom, and that the cultivation is passed down within the colony and learned by new generations of workers, is a strong indication that this is an instance of culture worthy of the name, as opposed to the simple carrying out of an instinct or a particular symbiosis between a given species of ant and a given species of fungus.</p>
<p>Lestel also examines tool use among chimpanzees, which again evidences a future-horizon of planning in the design and gathering of materials for the construction of tools that will then be used for another task. The fact that the tool designs and the materials used vary considerably between different groups of chimps, and that some designs and techniques are taught and passed down within given groups (sometimes disappearing altogether from the chimpanzee knowledge repertoire when a discrete group with its own practices dies out), means for Lestel that this is another instance of cultural practices among animals.</p>
<p>Lestel further considers an array of examples that show distinct types of cultural practice in animals. Birdsong, far from being only and simply an expression of instinct programmed within the birds, demonstrates formidable aspects of improvisation and cooperation. It is a communicative medium used to describe the surrounding world, and it is flexible enough to draw in and figure sounds, including human speech, as part of its fabric. Japanese macaques demonstrate unique practices of crab-catching within discrete groups, and they also take baths in hot springs, an activity that they teach their young as they raise them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0539018413477938">1</xref></sup> Given the extent of various types of cultural practices among animals, Lestel argues that there is no logical or scientific basis for claiming that culture is a distinctively human achievement, or that a particular (human) kind of mind or mental development is necessary to it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0539018413477938">
<title>Friendship</title>
<p>In his book <italic>Les Amis de Mes Amis</italic> (<italic>The Friends of My Friends</italic>), Lestel broaches the question of whether or not animals can form friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0539018413477938">Lestel, 2007</xref>). He considers a number of accounts of friendship from philosophy to ethology, film, music and literature to arrive at a conclusive affirmation of animal friendship. However, the concept of friendship itself is at issue in this very understanding; this is not the ‘Benji- model’ of animal friendship based largely on human terms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0539018413477938">2</xref></sup> By examining thinkers such as Aristotle, Cicero and Mencius, Lestel demonstrates that the question of friendship is hardly a new one, and indeed that considerations about animals have always hovered around figurations of friendship. He draws especially on the philosophy of Henri Bergson and his concept of <italic>durée</italic>, or duration, in developing an account of friendship around the mutual sharing of time and space, a geographic understanding of friendship that he opposes to the psychological model dominant in the literature.</p>
<p>By examining the territories of friendship and the extension of self and co-identity that take place in them, Lestel considers examples of friendship between animals and between humans and animals. Drawing on examples such as Shirley Strum’s research with baboons, he argues for the importance of sharing territory. He points in particular to Strum’s discovery of the importance of <italic>doing nothing</italic> together as an indication of friendship, just hanging out as we might say. He also considers other types of relationships such as those between parrots and humans. Drawing on the research of Irene Pepperberg and others, he shows how human relationships with such birds are predicated on the birds’ consent and participation. If the birds don’t wish to stay by their own volition, they either escape or demonstrate a range of serious psychological maladies. The extent of human cohabitation and cooperation with parrots is also a longstanding and fascinating intertwining that could serve as another instance of companion species as analyzed by Donna Haraway.</p>
<p>As part of this consideration of animal friendship, and the model of shared space and time in duration, Lestel holds that we need to develop an ethnography of animals that inhabit ‘human’ spaces. He points out that many types of animals readily adapt to and make use of human environments and objects that the animals themselves did not build, and that they don’t use according to their ‘human’ purposes or functions (such as cats and dogs inhabiting ‘human’ households or monkeys using ‘human’ temples, buildings, bridges, etc.); but they make use of these spaces and objects nonetheless, developing their own inhabitation and usages. If we are to pay heed to the ways that animals and humans share spaces and experiences with one another, surely it is necessary to better account for these complicated dynamics of habitation, rather than defaulting to a mode that implicitly or explicitly favors human intentionality and purposes. A fundamental aspect of Lestel’s theory of friendship is that there are no pre-existing subjects, human or animal, that then come to occupy a container of Cartesian space. Rather, subjectivities are formed and influenced by the process of mutual habitation and sharing of territory – indeed, territory is cast not so much as abstract physical space as an extension of the subjectivity and being of a given creature (in a manner reminiscent of von Uexküll’s <italic>Umwelt</italic>). Accounting for friendship, and accounting for the shared habitation and production of space, would be a major avenue to taking account of human–animal relations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0539018413477938">
<title>Ethnography–ethology articulation</title>
<p>As indicated in the previous section on friendship, Lestel maintains that the methods of ethnography are an invaluable resource for studying animal behavior and human–animal interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0539018413477938">Lestel, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0539018413477938">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0539018413477938">2010</xref>). He calls explicitly for the use of the careful observation and attention to space that comes from within the ethnographic tradition. However, he also notes that ethnography necessitates some elaboration and critical development in order to be best placed for paying heed to animal life. As I have noted previously, ethnography is, in its etymology and tradition, almost exclusively focused on <italic>human</italic> animals (and sometimes partakes of an intellectual tradition that distances humans from animals by focusing on the supposed distinctiveness of human culture). <italic>Ethnos</italic> in Greek refers specifically to human beings or human groups, and indeed almost all ethnography has been concerned with humans as the lynchpin. As Lestel notes, while there has been some attention to human–animal relations within the ethnographic tradition, for instance in Claude Lévi-Strauss’s attention to the animal familiars and companions of Amazonian Indians, these animals have been viewed strictly through the lens of their seemingly subordinate relations with humans. According to Lestel, ethnography’s explicit human bias must be addressed in refocusing its observational and interactional resources on a better accounting of animal life and human–animal interactions.</p>
<p>By the same token, Lestel also takes a keen interest in ethology and the ethological literature. He is intimately familiar with studies in ethology ranging from ants to chimpanzees to aquatic mammals, and he has conducted his own field observations on several sites. Lestel finds ethology, like ethnography, to be a tradition that has valuable resources of close observation. However, he is troubled by the systemic biases, largely in the forms of Cartesianism and behaviorism, that have often hampered institutional ethology from taking account of the most important and most perplexing aspects of animal life. (As a result he is interested both in published writings, policed by the review system, and in personal banter and conversation among ethologists.) He has maintained a resolute critique of the animal-machine model stemming from Descartes and Malebranche that has both foreclosed on possibilities for animal subjectivity and legitimized the cruel treatment of animals. Behaviorism, as the 20th-century model of the animal-machine, reduced animal behavior to a simple matter of instinct and stimulus and response, again seriously limiting the horizon for animal mind and initiative. Lestel is more interested in cognitive ethology as an approach that takes animal mind and subjectivity seriously – and that, in contrast to the limitations of the animal-machine, expects to be surprised by the actions and thoughts of the animal.</p>
<p>While both ethnography and ethology present invaluable resources for studying animal life, animal behavior and animal–human interactions (as well as significant pitfalls that curtail this pursuit), Lestel believes that a critical articulation of these two disciplines is both necessary and salutary for continued understanding in this area. Such an approach parallels the types of mixed-methods approaches used across the disciplinary spectrum, where particular empirical questions require the use and cultivation of the best tools available, even if they come from disciplines that are ordinarily treated as distinct in terms of university-department organization, funding and the like. Here Lestel maintains that the combined analytical resources of the sciences and the social sciences are necessary to any satisfactory and insightful account of animal life. In addition, the explicit opening of the social and cultural envelope to animals and the realization of the ethological aspects of understanding human behavior and human–animal interactions serve to aid the critical methodological correctives within each discipline that he has argued for, and substantially increase our understanding of evolutionary continuity. In this model of etho-ethnography, or ethno-ethology, Lestel attempts to take account of these varied methodological and observational strains in order to open up a better understanding of shared human–animal life.</p>

<title>Vinciane Despret</title>
<p>A psychologist and philosopher, Vinciane Despret teaches in the Philosophy Department at the Université de Liège in Belgium. She has extensively drawn on the ethological literature to look at a number of questions in animal mindedness and social behavior. She has also sometimes specified part of her project as ‘an ethology of ethologists’. Despret poses both psychological and philosophical questions to various aspects of ethology and animal research. From a psychological point of view, she believes that many human researchers have failed to take account of the situation in which they place animals, and as a result the animals have often been responding to questions that are very different from what the researchers believe them to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0539018413477938">Despret, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0539018413477938">2009</xref>). She has also focused on the types of interactions that take place between animals and humans in research, and how experiments and observational design shape both human researchers and animal participants. On the basis that most ethology and animal science has foreclosed rather than investigated animal mind and animal action, she argues for more open types of research design that leave greater initiative to animals in determining topics of research and interpretations. From a philosophical point of view she is interested in the ways that prevailing attitudes in human culture affect the scientific research of the time, in the role of invention in research, and in developing an ontology that accounts for the ways that humans and animals are changed over time through mutual interactions. Here her concepts of the ethology of ethologists, asking the right questions, animals recruiting humans in socialization/research, and ongoing change in humans and animals are presented.</p>
<sec id="section7-0539018413477938">
<title>Ethology of ethologists</title>
<p>If ethology is the study of animal behavior, and evolution and Darwinism have indicated that humans are thoroughly and completely part of animality, then it is quite germane, indeed crucial, to study the human animals who have engaged in interaction with other animals through structured research in ethology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0539018413477938">Despret, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0539018413477938">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0539018413477938">2009</xref>). Absent this, ethology has frequently fallen into the epistemological error of assuming the role of unmarked scientific observer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018413477938">Despret et al., 2005</xref>) – and this is all the more peculiar because as a matter of course working ethologists know a great deal about the particular kinds of social interactions and dimensions unique to a human–animal interface. By looking at a particular line of research and its influence, Despret shows how a particular ‘fact’ held sway for several decades concerning baboon hostility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0539018413477938">Despret, 2002</xref>). She examines the conditions of studies by Solly Zuckerman at the London Zoo in the 1920s. Since the population of baboons in those studies had been forcibly transported to London and were living in harsh, unfamiliar and crowded conditions at the zoo, Zuckerman was studying more the existential and social conditions of the baboons than their ‘natural’ behavior. Add to this that the colony in the zoo was overwhelmingly male, far out of proportion to conditions usually found, and the conditions at the zoo took on more of the character of an absurd science-fiction experiment than of serious biological research.</p>
<p>In Zuckerman’s study the male chimps demonstrated brutal violence toward one another and toward the females. On this basis, Zuckerman concluded that baboons (all baboons rather than this particular type, and perhaps all primates) are extremely violent, living in a brutal state of nature as imagined by Hobbes, and that all female baboons are constantly sexually receptive. Despite the artificial conditions, which also included only one heated room in their habitation area so that overcrowding was guaranteed there on cold days, this research became influential in the literature. This was so much the case that when Irven De Vore went to Kenya to observe baboons, his background formation and his observations were influenced by Zuckerman’s research. Despite the markedly different setting, De Vore confirmed the tendency to fight and the competitive violence of baboon society. Later, other researchers realized that his technique of throwing peanuts to the baboons as a means of trying to approach them produced a competitive situation that gave rise to the violence he observed. Subsequent research, such as that by Shirley Strum, who was deeply attentive to her social role among them, showed that baboons are not inherently violent and that they display remarkable capacities for friendship.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0539018413477938">
<title>Asking the right questions</title>
<p>Interpreting a vast range of ethological literature with a psychological lens, Despret focuses on the role of the questions asked in scientific research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0539018413477938">Despret, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0539018413477938">2012</xref>). She maintains that animals are certainly responding to questions in ethological and psychological research. However, she believes that the question answered is often somewhat different from the one the human researchers <italic>think</italic> they are answering. Overly reductive experimental dispositives and frames of research that supposedly produce distinct choices or action paths for animals do not do justice to animal thought, and often measure boredom, fear or anger in the animals instead.</p>
<p>Despret crystallizes this line of thought in her book <italic>Thinking Like a Rat</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0539018413477938">2009</xref>). There she draws on cognitive science to develop a more nuanced sensibility of how animals think about experimental setups and human research. Due to a lack of informed thinking about the minds and capabilities of the animals involved, she believes that human researchers are often ignorant of what questions animals are responding to – indeed that a lack of courtesy about what to expect from animals has blocked even looking at different thoughts and responses. She wonders how rats respond to mazes, as in what they take to be the question and the stakes at hand. She also imagines forms of study in which the researchers are kind to the animals, thereby transforming the type of rationalization usually mobilized.</p>
<p>Despret also thinks that cat-behavior researcher Leyhausen failed to realize the type of situation or ‘stimulation’ he was setting up for cats in experiments. Using a behaviorist dispositive in which cats were meant to depress levers to dispense food, the cats rapidly caught on then lost interest in the levers. Some would even starve rather than depress the levers again. The cats were deemed stupid, stubborn or unsuitable for scientific research, but deeper issues about will, agency and freedom were overlooked. For Despret, the boredom and the unwillingness to operate the lever are significant psychological facts that point to a particular kind of mental and comportmental response to the situation – can we even call this a form of feline civil disobedience?</p>
<p>A better sense of how animals see the world and respond to questions gives rise to the possibility of asking better questions in research. Indeed, Despret’s most recent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0539018413477938">2012</xref>) book is called <italic>Que Diraient les Animaux, Si On Leur Posait les Bonnes Questions?</italic> [What Would Animals Say if We Asked Them the Right Questions?].</p>

<title>Animals ‘recruiting’ humans in research/interaction</title>
<p>In tandem with her attention to the ethology of ethologists, and awareness of the social and subjective interactions of human animals with nonhuman animals in research, Despret has also described processes in which animals ‘recruit’ researchers into their social dynamics, giving access to behaviors and interactions that otherwise might not be seen or experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0539018413477938">Despret, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0539018413477938">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0539018413477938">Despret &amp; Porcher, 2007</xref>). This recruiting is also important because it demonstrates social agency in animals by means of their initiatives to create a degree of openness with humans.</p>
<p>Despret emphasizes the centrality of <italic>politeness</italic> in the process of becoming acquainted. Drawing on Isabelle Stengers, she points to work that gives animals the ‘power of not submitting to the human researcher’s interpretation’. She is interested in work such as that of Bernd Heinrich on ravens, which left a wide range of initiative to the ravens in defining questions and behaviors to be investigated. The politeness she argues for operates on at least two levels: an ethical one of not harassing animals in research through elaborate devices of ‘torture’, and an epistemological one of being privy to types of animal action that are occluded by simple and invasive mechanisms of research. Heinrich’s practice was exemplary for demonstrating respect to the ravens he interacted with and leaving them substantial latitude. Ultimately, as a result, he was partly recruited into their fold and gained insights into behaviors that had long puzzled him. As Despret notes, his approach was effective especially in contrast to those of earlier behaviorists who put ravens into Skinner boxes. Although certainly intelligent enough to understand and perform the tests primed by the box, ravens would instead more commonly destroy the buttons and dismantle the box – a behavior akin to cats refusing to depress the levers for Leyhausen. In felines and corvids, the reductive experimental mechanisms were perceived by the animals as undue limitations and as insults to their conspicuous intelligence and agency.</p>
<p>Despret argues for a principle of courtesy, according to which researchers expect the most from animals rather than limiting them to simple experimental decisions or theoretical frames of interpretation that diminish animal mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0539018413477938">Despret, 2002</xref>). As Bernd Heinrich commented, he wasn’t at all able to discern the important questions of research, much less answers to or conjectures around them, without an open-ended framework that allowed for observation of a considerable range of initially baffling raven behavior. Despret also writes that behaviorist researchers have been dumbed down by the severe constraints of their experiments. She says it is the devices and designs that submit animals and researchers alike to austere simplification that limit the mental expression of each. In this respect many more complex animal behaviors are ignored or lost from sight. Likewise, issues of interaction and mutual influence between animals and humans are overlooked. Despret interprets the work of Martha McKenna, whose expanded- territory experimental setups revealed dramatically different rat mating behavior than was at the time the accepted view. McKenna showed that small, confining cages produced more male aggression and initiative, whereas this situation was largely transformed by bigger environments for interaction between the rats. McKenna opines that the earlier experiments in cramped cages were analogous to studying ‘swimming in a sink’, a space impossibly small for the range of actions observed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0539018413477938">
<title>Animals and humans changing through interaction over time</title>
<p>Despret has repeatedly noted that animals, like humans, change over time, and that animals too have a history (humans are not alone or distinctive in having a history). Building on this, she argues that humans and other animals change each other over time in interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0539018413477938">Despret, 2007</xref>). Bernd Heinrich’s research on ravens also shows that the behaviors engaged in and the types of cross-species relationships formed by the birds vary widely between different human settlements. In some places, such as the north of Canada, the ravens are much more at ease with humans, displaying much less guarded behavior and frequently ‘clowning around’ in front of humans, for instance by sliding on roofs. In other places, such as much of North America and Europe, ravens are much warier of humans and unlikely to let down their guard. There ravens maintain more of a distance from humans and seem much more suspicious. For Despret, these are indications of markedly different types of social relationships between humans and ravens. Human disposition seems to mirror that of the ravens: in the places where ravens are more at ease, humans see them as regular presences and, it doesn’t seem like a stretch to say it, social partners. This is sometimes set against a background of mythological traditions that attribute substantially different characteristics and actions to ravens, casting them as deities or as the instantiation of thought or mind. Heinrich observes that myths are ‘esoteric histories’ that often inform ethology.</p>
<p>Since experiments shape both animals and human researchers, Despret notes that the prevailing wisdom about different groups of animals has changed as observational designs and elements of human culture have modified. The courtesy shown in the more expansive research designs of Heinrich, McKenna, Shirley Strum and Amotz Zahavi have modified both what humans think about ravens, rats, baboons and Arabian babbler birds, and the types of research action and research questions ethology engages with. In a fascinating interpretation of the influence of human cultural ideals on the construal of evolution, Despret interprets Sigmund Freud and Charles Darwin’s treatment of the relationship between apes and humanity in light of prevalent notions of so-called ‘primitive’ human societies and of primatology at the time of their writing. Freud builds his account of totemism, and the primal murder at hand in humanization, on a particular notion of the violent, jealous baboon not far removed from Zuckerman’s. Darwin, by contrast, assigns a more peaceful demeanor to apes, but sees the ‘savage’ humans who were at the forefront of the colonial Victorian English imagination as an almost evolutionary regression in their embrace of violence.</p>
<p>Taking the notion of <italic>invention</italic> seriously, as analyzed by Isabelle Stengers, Bruno Latour and others, Despret advances the idea that it is the active creation of the possibilities of existence, and that humans and other animals are modified over time by a number of factors of interaction. Humans pose questions drawn from human practices, belief systems and representations, but the animals involved, and indeed the world more broadly, are not mute and docile. If indeed we can speak of inventions as being part of ‘our’ (human) history, animals have been enrolled in myriad ways in <italic>making</italic> this history together through concrete types of interaction.</p>

<title>Roberto Marchesini</title>
<p>An ethologist, cognitive scientist and philosopher, Roberto Marchesini is the founder and director of the <italic>Scuola di Interazione Uomo–Animale</italic> in Bologna, Italy. He has developed a relational technique of animal training that is based on mindedness and signification in animals, rather than on behaviorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0539018413477938">Marchesini, 2007</xref>). Like the other thinkers represented in this piece, he has also devoted a sustained analysis to human–animal interactions in a series of books addressing various aspects of the issue. Also like the other thinkers here, he combines philosophical, scientific and social scientific resources to address specific empirical and theoretical problems regarding animality. Marchesini also makes an ongoing critique of Cartesianism and its deleterious effects on the understanding of animals through mechanism and behaviorism. His approach indicates that animals should be seen as partners rather than objects in research, that all animals are endowed with a form of mind, and that all animals make and interpret meaning in the world and make sense of things.</p>
<sec id="section12-0539018413477938">
<title>Zooantropologia</title>
<p>Marchesini has developed and elucidated the approach and method that he calls <italic>zooantropologia</italic>, or ‘zooanthropology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0539018413477938">Marchesini, 2005</xref>). Though he sees this as having important points of contact with the ‘anthrozoology’ within the Anglo-American tradition, it is also distinct in important respects. Like Lestel, Marchesini points to the way that anthropology has chronicled the presence and role of many types of animals in a variety of different human cultures. Classical and cultural anthropology raised the question of human–animal interactions and brought us to its threshold, but, as it has been primarily concerned with the primacy and specificity of human culture, for the most part swerved away from exploring it. In this respect, Marchesini explains that zooanthropology draws important elements of understanding from ethology, particularly zoosemiotics and human ethology, both of which he says have contributed to the understanding of systems of inter-specific communication.</p>
<p>On the one hand, zooanthropology is deeply interested in human–animal interactions and how to develop a better understanding of them. On the other hand, it is another way of understanding evolutionary continuity and the lack of a definite or hermetic distinction between humans and animals. In fact, at a deeper level, Marchesini believes that culture is itself an animal phenomenon, and that culture is the result of the inclusion and continued practice of a host of animal practices. Rather than seeing culture as a distinctive human trait, zooanthropology maintains that culture is the surest indication of evolutionary continuity and the lack of any certain nature/culture split. Animal characteristics are necessary for the realization of the human person and the definition of the concept of the human being, as well as having universal presence at the heart of cultural systems. In the way that biological evolution indicated the genetic ties between humans and animals, <italic>zooantropologia</italic> points to an equally strong continuity, an ontological one, between all animal species, including humans.</p>
<p>The fact that zooanthropology places such an emphasis on animal–human interactions and communications indicates that it also considers mind and signification to be shared human–animal practices rather than exclusively human ones. In this respect, it casts animals as constructive partners in interaction and building signification, building especially on insights from Konrad Lorenz, James Serpell, Jean-Pierre Digard, Hubert Montagner and Paul Shepard. But zooanthropology goes further than other sciences and approaches that have explored human–animal relations by foregrounding the human–nonhuman pairing as an indivisible reality in continuous evolution and transformation giving rise to processes of cultural expression.</p>

<sec id="section13-0539018413477938">
<title>Multiple intelligences</title>
<p>Drawing on research in evolutionary biology, cognitive science, animal interactions and philosophy, Marchesini has developed a model of animal cognition that he calls <italic>intelligenze plurime</italic> or ‘multiple intelligences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0539018413477938">Marchesini, 2008</xref>). Following currents of evolutionary biology, he holds that every animal has a form of cognition and intelligence. Each species and individual is endowed with a cognition that results from its particular evolutionary niche and the set of ontogenic experiences that have influenced it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0539018413477938">Marchesini, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, he holds that it is impossible and futile to establish a hierarchy of such intelligences, in terms of superior mental development, brain size, etc. On strictly evolutionary grounds, it is wrong to privilege human thinking/mental development over that of other animals, as each type of thinking is best suited to a particular niche and behavior. Rather, taking the plurality of evolution in a serious way, with a strong challenge to teleology, he holds that other animals possess thinking and sensori-nervous capacities that are better adapted than human ones to a range of settings.</p>
<p>Multiplicities of cognitions and ‘responses’ emerge from one’s evolutionary background, ontogenic experiences, volition, mood, etc. Marchesini emphasizes that the thinking of a particular being is made up of a complex interaction of phylogenetic evolution and ontogenetic experiences that have formed its intelligence. This complex set of interactions yields a multiplicity, Marchesini says an infinity, of types of thinking and cognition. He further extends the model of multiple intelligences by turning to interactions between different actors and different types of intelligence. The model is not just an idealistic philosophical or abstract notion, it is also a scientific and practical basis on which to approach interactions between different animals: both the different ‘types’ or species of animals and different individuals (even within the same species) who have distinctive types of cognition formed by phylogenetic and ontogenetic factors. All actions, mental states, etc., act on the mind and cognition of the individual, meaning that it is an entity, or coherence of factors, constantly changing in feedback and interaction. This is a model that is opposed to mechanistic, behaviorist stimulus–response and to cybernetic models of interaction.</p>
<p>Marchesini further charts ‘multiple interfaces’ between the multiple intelligences that are produced through complex combinations of phylogenetic and ontogenetic factors. Each species and each individual have their intelligences, which in turn combine in these multiple, again infinite, interfaces. Since the cognition of each mind or each individual is constantly acted upon and modified by its own actions and environment, including the actions of and interactions with other individuals, the number of possible interactions is indeed infinite.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0539018413477938">
<title>Theriomorphism</title>
<p>In contradistinction to the careworn objections to anthropomorphism that have frequently blocked ethology and comparative psychology from arriving at a more satisfactory reckoning of the thinking of animals, Marchesini has engaged in an in-depth analysis of <italic>theriomorphism</italic>, or the attribution and incorporation of animal traits and factors into human being and human culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0539018413477938">Marchesini, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0539018413477938">Marchesini &amp; Andersen, 2003</xref>). To begin with, it is apropos to wonder why the transmission of such traits should proceed only one way, from humans to other animals. Marchesini, in parallel to his account of multiple intelligences, sees a much more complex field of interactions and influences; in fact he sees the role of theriomorphism as being far more profound and extensive than that of anthropomorphism. As such, theriomorphism is an antidote or conceptual alternative to excessive claims of anthropomorphism that still maintain the presumption and centrality of the human.</p>
<p>Marchesini argues that theriomorphism is deeply interwoven with the myriad levels of human culture, practice and representations. In fact culture cannot be understood or accounted for separately from this dense field of influences, foundations, practices and references. Phenomena like language, signification and kinship are for him fundamentally predicated on, indeed the active continuation of, animal practices and animal references. There are myriad examples of this in the human iconography of many different cultures and contexts. To take but one such instance, the landscape painting of Joachim Patiner depicts the ‘monsters’ who imperil St Jerome as hybrid human figures, a motif that is echoed throughout many types of mythology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0539018413477938">3</xref></sup> Marchesini argues that human practices like yoga and tai chi were developed through the extensive and detailed influence of the behavior of various animals on humans, and reflect a detailed ethology among humans dating back into prehistory. They may also indicate that such observation was more meticulous and sophisticated in ancient human cultures than it is in modern animal sciences. Movement practices like those show evidence not only of continuity in the animal realm (including humans) but of a valorization of animal ways of being and moving as elements that actively inform and extend human possibilities. As such, the concept of theriomorphism serves as a way of bridging or thinking through the supposed human–animal divide. In addition to showing that practices such as art are rooted in the realm of animals, and incomprehensible without animal references, theriomorphism makes a larger argument that supposedly distinctive human culture is literally built on and thoroughly imbricated with myriad animal practices. As with Lestel, Despret and Celli, culture for Marchesini ceases to be a hallmark of humanity, but is instead the primary site of interface demonstrating continuity between humans and other animals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0539018413477938">
<title>Post-humanism</title>
<p>Roberto Marchesini is also the primary exponent and theorist of post-humanism in Italy. However, in stark contrast to several strains of post-humanism popular in the Anglophone world that are predicated on utopian, technophilic or dystopian concerns, his concept of post-humanism is centered around the continuity and relations between humans and other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0539018413477938">Marchesini, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0539018413477938">2009</xref>). By his account, post-humanism is less the entering of a new, futuristic phase of humanity than it is the ebbing of the centuries-long intoxication through which humans have tried stridently to convince themselves that they are separate from and superior to other animals. Focusing on figures such as Pico della Mirandola and religious accounts, Marchesini analyzes the traditions that most sought to introduce and solidify a divide within the animal sphere between humans and other animals. The main implication of Darwinism and evolutionary biology is the realization that such a divide is no longer tenable. In this respect, post-humanism is a strong undermining of human exceptionalism, rather than its latest aspect.</p>
<p>To say that evolutionary continuity has undermined humanism, however, is only part of the story. We might say that this is an ‘unfinished project’, since the multiple folds of humanism reach into many aspects of life and practice. Marchesini’s post-humanism is an ongoing effort to analyze the implications associated with the realization that humans are, indeed, animals. He examines ontological, epistemological and ethical forms of anthropocentrism in terms of how they both crudely and subtly distort efforts to comprehend human–animal relations. Marchesini is less interested in aspects like consciousness downloading or leaving the earth, which further enshrine human consciousness as distinct and superior. Rather, the human–nonhuman interface is the central concept for him. With the biosemiotic realization that animals make and interpret meaning, post-humanism increases the possibility for meaningful interactions between animals and humans. His concepts of multiple intelligences and of post-behaviorist animal training and interactions are based on this realization of <italic>new</italic> types of relation and signification across species to which we as humans are now more attentive due to the realization that we are part of the animal realm and only one among myriad species possessed of mind and thought.</p>
<p>Under Marchesini’s rubric, post-humanism is not simply a return of the repressed or, certainly, a regression, but productive in two strong senses. First, that humanism has led humans to sell other animals short and overlook many instances of animal mind, tool use, language and the like. Second, the strident human efforts to define humans as over and against other animals have progressively narrowed the human psyche and impoverished the human relationship with nature. Post-humanism opens a number of new dimensions for human relations with animals and with nature, and thus presents the possibility of both better models for the cognition of animals and a fuller sense of human cognition as part of, and in continual relation to, animal psyches.</p>

<title>Giorgio Celli</title>
<p>A prominent Italian ethologist and entomologist, Giorgio Celli directed the Laboratory of Entomology at the University of Bologna for many years. In professional biology circles, Celli was known and respected as an authority on bees, and he conducted extensive research on bee visual perception and bee learning. He also was one of the first researchers to study bees from an ecological perspective, treating them as possible indicators for the amount of pollution and lead in the environment – this approach seems particularly apropos nowadays, when bees have been threatened by Colony Collapse Disorder. Celli’s intellectual interests were wide-ranging. He was interested in the foundations and reach of the ethological tradition more broadly, and he continually reflected on the promises and limitations of the research area. He wrote an insightful book on Konrad Lorenz (<italic>Konrad Lorenz and His Phantasms</italic>) in which he evaluated the research contributions and the personal motivations and psyche of the influential Nobel Prize-winning ethologist. In it he attempts to account for Lorenz’ sympathy with Nazism as part of his critical exposition.</p>
<p>Beyond accounting historically and methodologically for the contours of ethology, Celli actively developed and elaborated the approaches of that discipline in directions that are very much resonant with the approaches of Lestel, Despret and Marchesini. Celli wrote a seminal book on <italic>The Ethology of Everyday Life</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0539018413477938">1992</xref>), and he strove to adumbrate a method for such an ethology and a related ‘ethology of the household’. Dissatisfied with the dry and staid confines of academic and institutional ethology (although he functioned successfully within it), Celli strove to expand the science to include a myriad of ongoing animal–human interactions routinely, and resiliently, avoided by the science. He was one of the first biologists to write on homosexuality in animals, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0539018413477938">1969</xref>, and he saw it as a natural aspect of evolution. In addition to ethology, Celli also wrote extensively in fiction, even winning the prestigious Pirandello Prize for a work of theater. He was a member of the ‘63 Group’ in Italy alongside Umberto Eco, and wrote novels, plays and poetry, often drawing on animal characters or animal points of view as literary devices. He was also an occasional film actor and television personality, widely recognized by the Italian public, as for instance Carl Sagan was in the United States, for his nature programs.</p>
<sec id="section17-0539018413477938">
<title>Ethology of everyday life and ethology of the household</title>
<p>While Celli was an accepted expert among professional ethologists, the rather strict confines of the discipline ran up against his sensibilities about some of the most important dimensions of animal behavior and animal mindedness. As Celli expressed it, he might spend at most a few hours per day wearing his lab coat and conducting formal experiments with bees. In contrast with this, he spent a good many more hours <italic>every day and night</italic> with his cats. While he might have hung up his lab coat at the laboratory door, he didn’t suspend his ethological training or stop being a biological observer at home. On these grounds, he held that everyday interactions between other animals and humans were often more important than the specifically disciplined and controlled types of observations allowed in the laboratory or in the field under the auspices of accepted ethological research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0539018413477938">Celli, 1992</xref>). Small wonder that these same contexts of everyday interactions between humans and animals were entirely and systematically overlooked by the discipline. Celli saw this as a major shortcoming and fundamental flaw of ethology, and he argued for (and provided a model of) going beyond the excessively rigid confines of the science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0539018413477938">Celli, 1983</xref>). For one thing, he reminded us, the foundational work of Lorenz upon which a great deal of subsequent ethology is based was conducted in the context of his home and of his everyday and ongoing interactions with several different types of animals.</p>
<p>Like Lestel, Despret and Marchesini, Celli saw hyper-developed objections against anthropomorphism as doing a great disservice to ethology in blinding it to whole swathes of the most important contexts and issues of animal behavior and human–animal interactions. The great fear of attributing human characteristics to animals, or of animals being ‘contaminated’ by human interaction and thus becoming poor indicators of ‘natural’ behavior, reinforced old prejudices of animal mechanism and simplistic stimulus–response models, causing ethologists to ignore wholesale and overlook many instances of mind, signification and communication in animals. Like the other researchers presented in this article, we might say that Celli was more interested in a ‘social science of animals’, or in the myriad forms of human–animal interactions, rather than the artificially defined and inaccurate treatment of a ‘nature’ represented by animals that had been epistemologically constrained and stripped down through a number of simplifying mechanisms. Even his work on bees from an ecological angle shows that he was interested in how they took part in a much wider field of interactions rather than treating them as separate and distinct entities almost outside of the real world and everyday interaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0539018413477938">
<title>Ethology of friendship</title>
<p>As part of his interest in the ethology of everyday life and an ethology of the household, Celli was also deeply fascinated with developing an ethology of friendship between different types of animals. For his purposes, he focused primarily on friendships between domestic felines and humans, and he devoted a number of writings to the topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0539018413477938">Celli, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0539018413477938">1997</xref>). For him, the relations between humans and felines were more than just a simple cohabitation or a one-way domestication. He thought that the mutually conditioning concept of friendship was much more appropriate to the task of understanding this relationship. Celli began by charting the possible trajectories by which felines and humans came to constitute part of the same social unit. Although at the time of his writing he was not yet aware of the newer archaeological discoveries from Crete indicating feline–human cohabitation on intimate terms at least 10,000 years ago (perhaps extending back to 30,000 years ago), Celli discusses the conditions of such cohabitation, namely the advent and spread of grain agriculture among humans leading to the symbiotic relationship in which cats would protect grain stores from rodents (and gain a steady food supply themselves). Celli even considers the fascinating (if perhaps disturbing) eventuality that the ‘domestication’ of felines grew out of human consumption of cats for food. Despite well-known instances of such human eating of cats, including into the modern Italy of Celli’s recollection, he does not hold such a trajectory as a likely vector for domestication, in large part due to cats’ position near the top of the chain of predation, and thus their relative inefficiency as sources of protein and energy.</p>
<p>Beyond the accounts of the prehistory of feline–human relations, Celli is interested in the everyday and ongoing friendships and interactions between felines and humans. He is aware of the likely scorn or skepticism from professional ethological colleagues about such an area of inquiry, and he frequently addresses their concerns in asides in which he points to the centrality of such everyday interactions for understanding animal and human behavior and being. Based on a lifetime of interacting and living with a number of cats, Celli draws on an array of questions and stories to illustrate many dimensions of ‘natural’ behavior and interactions at play (and, like other cutting-edge researchers in the area such as Deborah Bird Rose and Donna Haraway, he refutes the notion that ‘anecdotes’ or such everyday stories should be disqualified from meaningful inclusion in ethological research). Like even the most reductive and scientistic of feline biology researchers (a group in which he is certainly not included, despite his scientific credentials), he insists on the tremendous personality variation among individual felines that makes it almost impossible to generalize about them and their behavior. Celli is fascinated with the unique interactions between individual humans and individual felines, and with the ways in which group dynamics take shape among felines and humans. For instance, he relates an account of a strong male stray cat who came into his house and became a ‘guest’ to his smaller female cats – he insists that the male seemed to understand his status as a guest and the necessary ‘politesse’ required to maintain that position (he uses the same concept as Despret). One day his building’s cleaner unintentionally and temporarily upset the social order by yelling at the ‘lead’ female cat in the household for getting in the way of the floor-mopping: this led to a challenge by the ‘guest’ cat before the restoring of the ‘host–guest’ dynamic by Celli’s intervention. Such a seemingly simple or simplistic account is in fact an extremely complex instance of inter-species social dynamics, in which the lines of association and authority are not as evident as they might seem.</p>

<sec id="section19-0539018413477938">
<title>The secret life of animals (and of cats)</title>
<p>Giorgio Celli was obsessed with what he called ‘the secret life of animals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0539018413477938">Celli, 1999</xref>). He presented a television show by that name and wrote a book on ‘the secret life of cats’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0539018413477938">Celli, 1994</xref>). On the one hand, by this concept he means drawing on ethological and evolutionary knowledge to explain animal actions and behaviors that may baffle lay viewers. An example of this is the interpretation of the meaning of cat tail movements. Some humans may be more familiar with or accustomed to dogs, and interpret tail-wagging as a sign of joy and welcome. In cats, however, it is a sign of anger or possible attack (as some humans new to cat interaction have learned through being scratched). On the other hand, though, Celli also means something more fundamental and philosophical, namely that animal minds and societies are complex and often hidden from human observation, frequently by the social effects produced by a human observer and interactor. While there are many means of communication and empathetic identification across species, there are also realms of cat life that remain perplexing for their human inter-subjects. Celli knows, for instance, that the behavior of his cats when he is gone during the day, and they are free from his supervision and interaction, can vary dramatically from their behavior in his presence. He reports that this difference of behavior is so stark as to include many cats from the garden behind his house (in common with the block of houses around his) ‘visiting’ the cats that reside at his house, so that the cat population of his house surges during the day. Such a behavior fascinates and delights Celli. He can almost account for it in terms of cats’ general propensity to alter their behavior drastically when by themselves and without human presence – like ravens, cats know when they are being watched. In addition to that, he posits a cultural behavior of host and guest, in which the visitors display deference and respect to the host, who in turn welcomes the visitor in the space.</p>
<p>Specifying carefully that he is not exaggerating, Celli says that cats have a ‘Socratic function’. Recalling his cat Giuditta, one of the cats that evacuated from Bologna for the countryside with his family during the Second World War, Celli explains both how seeing Giuditta explore the sylvan setting helped to accustom him to it and how learning there that she was a mammal had a profound influence on him. Once he found out that she was a mammal, he realized that he was, too. He says that she ‘introduced him to the mysteries of the world’, and that it was then and there that he became captivated with studying ethology. He doubts that he would have been interested in studying biology without this influence.</p>

<title>Animals as instructors in ethology</title>
<p>Like each of the researchers discussed in this article, Celli rejected an anthropocentric model that privileges human being and human thought above that of animals. In fact, in decisive respects each of these thinkers holds to an opposite account, according to which animals inform humans in significant and profound ways about the natural and social world. Once one has accepted other animals as minded participants in making meaning in the world and interpreting it, the conceit according to which humans should have an exclusive or central position in this process is impossible to maintain. Beyond that, just as Despret emphasizes the idea that different types of animals ‘recruit’ humans into association and research in ways that inform human knowledge (often revealing questions and dimensions that would otherwise be inaccessible), Celli too pays heed to the ways in which animals serve as instructors to humans in ethology. Indeed, it seems to him that such a notion is the only way to truly pay heed to the best insights of Lorenz, Tinbergen or, most certainly, von Uexküll.</p>
<p>Celli was fond of saying that cats were his most significant teachers of ethology. Over and above his university education and the bewildering number of authors and scientists that he draws on as sources, he insisted that cats themselves were his ‘<italic>maestri</italic> of ethology’. He says that they were ‘<italic>maestri</italic> without words but with clear gestures; and I, little by little, became their admirer and their accomplice’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0539018413477938">4</xref></sup> He isn’t joking or being wry here, he indicates in a number of places that it was only through a sustained tutelage, and through paying careful heed to their behavior and ways of being, that Celli was able to come, little by little over time, to understand aspects of cat behavior (this is reminiscent of Despret’s idea that animals ‘recruit’ humans into interaction). At the most direct empirical level, his adage makes sense as an ethological guide: any understanding a human researcher hopes to gain of an animal requires treating that animal as a teacher and continual source of reference. Some of the worst excesses of comparative psychology and ethology have arisen precisely from human researchers failing to do this, and from taking nonhuman animals as simple machines that demonstrate behavior common to the entire species or (nonhuman) animal realm. Just as Lorenz immersed himself in relations with geese and other animals, Celli too immersed himself in such relations of learning with cats (and, to a different extent, bees).</p>
<p>By placing himself in a relation of tutelage to animals, Celli bypassed many of the pitfalls associated with presuming a human mental–social superiority from the outset and an associated over-confident observation and interpretation of various animal behaviors. Although he advances interpretations of the actions of cats and other animals, he also at other times expresses ignorance or uncertainty about complex behaviors and signaling, or indicates that only after long observation and puzzling did he arrive at satisfactory accounts or put aside earlier missteps. While all animal researchers would presumably say that they <italic>learn from</italic> animals in the sense that they study and report on different aspects of animals’ lives, few go so far as to see animals as veritable mentors in the process.</p>
<p>Celli comments on research carried out by other ethologists in which cats rearranged objects to be able to get at food. The cats were presented with meat hanging beyond jumping range above their heads, but with articles such as boxes nearby that they could use to access the food. Describing carefully the observation and thought process of the cats in this study, who sized up the problem and moved boxes to be able to reach the food, Celli says that, while there may be a difference in degree, there is no difference in principle between Galilei observing the pendulums or the apple falling on Newton’s head. Such a claim may strike many readers as preposterous, and Celli certainly wishes it to be controversial. However, he also intends the claim seriously and defends it: by pointing to two of the most celebrated human ‘geniuses’ and then comparing their interpretational and problem-solving behavior to that of cats, he decisively sets aside human exceptionalism and situates human thinking instead within the animal realm by taking evolutionary continuity seriously.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The four thinkers considered here, Dominique Lestel, Vinciane Despret, Roberto Marchesini and Giorgio Celli, share similarities of approach and method that are valuable for contemporary considerations of animal mind and animal behavior. Each of them straddles the ‘two-cultures’ divide between the sciences and the humanities, not least because they are fascinated with empirical questions in animal behavior and human–animal interactions that require taking tools from both traditions. All of them draw seriously from the natural sciences, especially biology and ethology, but also criticize the excesses that have prevented better empirical consideration of animals in scientific literature. Likewise, they draw on relevant currents in the humanities, especially philosophy, but remain wary of humanistic and theological discourses that have also served to occlude important questions about animality. Each also draws on or refigures social science in noteworthy ways: Despret on psychology, Lestel and Marchesini on anthropology, and Celli on an expanded form of ethology that necessarily draws in ethnographic approaches. Because of this, each thinker is in their own way elucidating methods that Lestel calls ‘etho-ethnographic’ or ‘ethno-ethological’. From the standpoint of science studies and the history of the ‘science wars’, these thinkers are noteworthy because they do not criticize natural science wholesale, but seek to hybridize it with other approaches and techniques necessary to better address the empirical topics that they study. By the same token, they indicate that the careful usage of philosophical analysis and critique plays a vital role in strengthening understanding of animality and animal–human relations.</p>

<p>Incidentally, Paul Rozin claimed that taking hot baths, like eating chilli peppers, was an innately aversive activity that all animals except humans avoided due to a distinct human capacity for ‘benign masochism’ in learning to enjoy initially-painful experiences.</p>
