<p>The Criminal Justice Alliance has produced a collection of essays entitled <italic>Delivering Justice: The Role of the Public, Private and Voluntary Sectors in Prisons and Probation</italic>. This is such a current subject and the essays are both informative and accessible, making them an approachable read for anyone wanting to learn more about the on-going competition debate, its history and origins.</p>
<p>The collection consists of eight essays which have been written by some of the most influential people working within and researching the Criminal Justice System. There has been a clear determination to represent all sides of the debate and the authors are very persuasive; challenging the reader to evaluate their own views and perspectives of privatization. There is a heavier focus on the prison service due to their more extensive involvement in private sector bids and management, however throughout efforts are made to highlight the lessons learnt from this process, both positive and negative and to apply these to the burgeoning presence of privatization within the probation service.</p>
<p>Vicki Helyar-Cardell, Director of the Criminal Justice Alliance, opens and closes this collection and sets the tone for the rest of the publication with a succinct introduction to the themes and contributors. She highlights four stages that have indicated the private sectors’ influence within and upon criminal justice increase. The first has been the operation of privately run prisons and we are offered both theoretical and practice orientated essays on this topic from Alison Liebling, Ben Crewe and Susie Hulley at the Prisons Research Centre at the University of Cambridge and Gary Sturgess, former Executive Director of the Serco Institute. The second stage highlights the structural and ideological changes that occurred as a result of the creation of the National Offender Management Service, the conclusions of the Carter Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0264550513481141">Carter, 2003</xref>) and the introduction of the notion of contestability. Helen Edwards, Director General of the Justice Policy Group at the Ministry of Justice, starts the debate as to the relative benefits of the role of competition within criminal justice and cements its place firmly at the heart of its operation. Michael Teague, a criminologist based at Teeside University with a history of working within and conducting research into the culture of the Probation Service, questions the ethics of making the operation of justice a profitable venture. The third step reflects the role of charities and the third sector in bidding for prison contracts, particularly in partnership with the private sector. The concluding chapter of this collection offers an opportunity to see the this vision in action with a discussion of the Catch22 project in operation at HMP Doncaster, provided by Chris Wright, the organization’s Chief Executive. Those readers currently employed within the probation service may be left wondering exactly what distinguishes this ‘new’ approach from the NOMS Offender Management Model and the work they are currently undertaking with offenders. The final stage focuses on the impending changes to the probation service and the polarized nature of opinions has been well captured. Whilst there is without doubt some support for the competition of public services, Jonathan Ledger (General Secretary of Napo) offers a rousing defence of the ‘public’ probation service and the inherent dangers he perceives in involving the private sector. His argument is not least that it fails to achieve the Government’s stated objectives of quality and efficiency, rather that it inhibits creativity and innovation and promotes tensions and demoralizes employees. With an obvious attempt at balance, this essay is immediately followed by the Chief Executive of London Probation Trust, Heather Munro’s contribution which could not be further from the perspective of Jonathan Ledger. Munro is a strong proponent of competition within probation and sees the benefits of Trusts operating as the local commissioners of services. She also stresses the value that can be gained from competition; striving for greater efficiency and stronger performance. Given what we know about the privatization of sections of the prison service and the current Government’s agenda, this is perhaps the more common sense, pragmatic perspective; to accept that this type of change is inevitable and face it head on with a determination to get the best possible outcome from a situation that few in the public sector may have chosen.</p>
<p>A quote from Ben Crewe and Alison Liebling’s account of ‘Insider views of private sector competition’ seems to encapsulate this selection of essays and features the recollections of a senior prison service manager who recalls, ‘apparently Lord Longford, who was of the opinion that private prisons were wrong in principle … visited Blakenhurst and is reputed to have written in the visitor’s book “if I was not a man of principle I’d have to admit this as a good prison!”’ (p.25). This represents one of the key debates surrounding the removal of the public sector monopoly within the Criminal Justice System, specifically the moral objections to private sector involvement which have (in some cases) been eroded somewhat by some strong levels of performance within privately run prisons. It also indicates to the reader that this is a collection of essays that, whilst undoubtedly being both relevant and academic, are also enjoyable to read and sometimes even amusing!</p>
