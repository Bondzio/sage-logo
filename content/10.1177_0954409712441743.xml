<abstract>
<p>This paper presents a reliability assessment of railway track buckling during extreme heatwave events. Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate the probability of track buckling. The effects of important predictor parameters such as the effective buckling length and buckling modes of the rails, as well as the rail temperatures at the time of their installation and during the heatwave are taken into account in the simulation. The results show that the probability of the buckling of tracks during an extreme heatwave similar to the event that took place in Melbourne in January 2009 is about 2/100,000 on average, which is a good estimate of the number of the track segments that were actually observed to have buckled in the Melbourne railway network. This assessment demonstrates a science-based approach to reliability assessment for track buckling during heatwaves.</p>

<p>Railway networks are an essential component of the transportation infrastructure of Australian cities. The buckling of railway tracks due to the extreme temperatures experienced during a heatwave is becoming a major cause of service disruption on these networks. Such an event was observed in the heatwave that occurred in January 2009 in Melbourne, Australia, during which the daily maximum temperature exceeded 43 °C for three consecutive days. In addition, climate change research indicates a future for Australia that contains more frequent and more extreme heatwaves. Thus, an assessment of the hazard a heatwave can pose in terms of track buckling is needed for future planning and management of railway network services.</p>
<p>This paper presents a reliability assessment of track buckling under an extreme heatwave similar to the event that occurred in January 2009 in Melbourne, Australia. The probability for track buckling is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation approach in which the effects of the effective buckling length and buckling modes of the rails, as well as the rail temperatures at the time of their installation and during the heatwave are taken into account. The aim of this study is to establish a science-based approach, i.e. through numerical simulation, for the assessment of the risk of track buckling during a heatwave. The results can inform the discussion on the planning and management of railway network services to cope with the effects of climate change.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0954409712441743"><title>The buckling of steel rails</title>
<p>An extreme heatwave of long duration may cause the structural failure of railway tracks. A recent example was the buckling of railways in Melbourne during the extreme heatwave event in January 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409712441743">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409712441743">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The buckling of the tracks occurs as a result of an excessive thermal stress in the tracks. As the temperature increases, thermal expansion occurs, resulting in the elongation of the tracks. There may be thermal expansion joints between adjacent tracks to accommodate this thermal expansion. However, when the temperature increases to a level higher than that which the expansion joints can accommodate or, even worse, the tracks are fully connected by welding, compressive stress starts to build-up along the tracks. As a consequence, buckling of the track occurs when the compressive stress exceeds the critical buckling load, which depends on the track material, effective buckling length, cross-sectional geometry and configuration of the rails.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0954409712441743"><title>Reliability assessment</title>
<p>This section discusses how to assess the probability for the buckling of rail segments installed in the Melbourne railway network under a heatwave similar to the one that occurred in January 2009, during which there was a stretch of three days in which the maximum temperature exceeding 43 °C.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0954409712441743"><title>Assumptions</title>
<p>From observations of the rail system and the rail buckling, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409712441743">Figure 1</xref>, the following parameters are assumed.
<list id="list1-0954409712441743" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The rails are of 50 kg type, these are commonly used for branch rail lines. From AS 1085.1 the geometric properties of the rail cross section are<sup>3</sup>: an area of <italic>A</italic> = 6.45 × 10<sup>–3</sup> m<sup>2</sup> and a cross-sectional moment of inertia about the weak axis (vertical) of <italic>I</italic> = 3.26 × 10<sup>–6</sup> m<sup>4</sup>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The rails are continuous; i.e. no thermal joints between adjacent tracks. The rails therefore have fixed along-the-length constraints at both ends. This is based on the fact that the tracks are interconnected by welding in the Melbourne railway network.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The rail material is steel with a Young’s modulus of <italic>E</italic> = 2 × 10<sup>11 </sup>N/m<sup>2</sup>. The thermal expansion coefficient is α = 12 × 10<sup>–6</sup> m/m °C.</p></list-item>
</list>
<fig id="fig1-0954409712441743" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Buckling of a railway track during the January 2009 heatwave in Melbourne (Joe Armao/Fairfax Syndication).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409712441743-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The Monte Carlo simulation technique is used for failure probability estimation. The probability distributions for the temperature change Δ<italic>T</italic> is estimated as follows.
<list id="list2-0954409712441743" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>During the heatwave, at the maximum air temperature of 43.6 °C, it is assumed that the rail temperature reaches between 61 and 66 °C. This is based on an estimate that the rail temperature is 17 °C higher than the air temperature or 1.5 times the air temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409712441743">4</xref></sup> The rail temperature is higher than the air temperature due to the high thermal conductivity and diffusivity of the steel used in the rail. It is therefore assumed that the rail temperature during the heatwave follows a normal distribution with a mean value of 63 °C and a standard deviation of 1 °C.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At the time of construction, the rails were laid at the rail neutral temperature and constrained to prevent buckling. The neutral temperature is a temperature between the expected hot and cold maximum values of the region. It is generally selected either at 75% of the expected maximum temperature of the region or 22 °C less than the maximum expected rail temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409712441743">4</xref></sup> The expected maximum temperature of the Melbourne region is 45 °C. The neutral temperature is therefore in the range between 33 and 44 °C. It is therefore assumed that the rail neutral temperature follows a normal distribution with a mean value of 38 °C and a standard deviation of 2 °C.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The temperature change Δ<italic>T</italic> is the difference between the rail temperature and the neutral temperature. As the rail temperature and neutral temperature are normally distributed, the temperature change Δ<italic>T</italic> also follows a normal distribution with a mean value of (63 – 38) = 25 °C and a standard deviation of (2<sup>2 </sup>+ 1<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2 </sup>= 2.2 °C.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>For the type of buckling observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409712441743">Figure 1</xref>, the probability distributions for the buckling length L, and the effective length factor k are estimated as follows.
<list id="list3-0954409712441743" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The mean rail length subject to single-buckling mode is 2.5 m. It is thus assumed that the rail length <italic>L</italic> follows a normal distribution with a mean of 2.5 m and a standard deviation of 0.4 m.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The form of the rail buckling suggests that the effective length factor <italic>k</italic> may vary between 0.5 and 1.0. It is thus assumed that <italic>k</italic> follows a normal distribution with a mean of 0.8 and a standard deviation of 0.1.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0954409712441743"><title>Numerical results</title>
<p>Since no existing probability models describe the distribution of the extent of the buckling expressed in equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0954409712441743">3</xref>), the probability of a rail failure due to buckling can only be estimated accurately using Monte Carlo simulation. For this purpose, a railway network assumed to contain 1,000,000 segments of steel rail tracks was investigated. The track lengths and temperature changes were distributed probabilistically as discussed in the previous section. For each of the rail segments, the occurrence of buckling was determined using equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0954409712441743">4</xref>). A Monte Carlo simulation program in MATLAB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409712441743">5</xref></sup> was developed using the library-functions available in its Statistics Toolbox. The computing time required to run the simulation on a PC with a 2.7-GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 8 GB of RAM was less than 40 s. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409712441743">Figure 2</xref> presents a histogram of the simulated compressive load and the extent of buckling.
<fig id="fig2-0954409712441743" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Histogram of compressive load and the extent of buckling estimated for Melbourne railways during the heatwave of January 2009.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409712441743-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>To obtain the distribution of the number of failed rail segments in the 1,000,000 segments, a total of 1000 simulation runs, each with 1,000,000 segments, were performed. The result is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409712441743">Figure 3</xref>. It was found that the number of buckled segments ranges from seven to 40, with an average of about 23. The distribution of the number of buckled segments can be reasonably modelled by a binomial distribution with a mean of 22.8 and variance of 22.3, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409712441743">Figure 3</xref>. This result is in-line with the theory of a simulation-based reliability method described in Ayyub and Mccuen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409712441743">6</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig3-0954409712441743" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Probability density of the number of buckled rail segments out of the 1,000,000 simulated segments and the distribution fit.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409712441743-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It is therefore estimated that the probability of the type of buckling observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409712441743">Figure 1</xref> occurring in a 2.5 m steel rail segment during a heatwave such as the one that occurred in Melbourne in January 2009, is about 23/1,000,000, i.e. approximately equivalent to 2/100,000. The Melbourne railway network has a total length of about 270 km, which can be divided into more than 100,000 rail segments of length 2.5 m. With a buckling failure probability of 2/100,000, it is therefore anticipated that the number of buckled rail segments similar to that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409712441743">Figure 1</xref> is around two. This agrees with the number of buckled segments observed in the Melbourne railway network in the January 2009 heatwave: one case was reported between Jolimont and Flinders Street Stations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409712441743">Figure 1</xref>), and another at Holmesglen on the Glen Waverley train line.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409712441743">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954409712441743">7</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0954409712441743" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In addition to the previously discussed assumptions and in order to both improve the ease of computation and compensate for the lack of data for some parameters the following further assumptions were applied in this study.
<list id="list4-0954409712441743" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The effects of solar radiation and heat build-up in the rails during the long hot spell were neglected. The rail temperature could be even higher and unevenly distributed due to these factors. These could cause an increase of the compressive load and a reduction in the extent of buckling in rails.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Likely deficiencies in local track structure conditions were neglected; for example, drainage may cause weakening of rail foundations, and ballast strength may vary along the rail route.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The rail’s critical buckling load was computed by assuming the rail to be a straight and axially loaded bar. In reality, some curved rails are laid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409712441743">Figure 1</xref>), and local track misalignments may exist that induce eccentric loads on the rails. These rails would therefore be subjected to bending moments, resulting in a decrease in the critical buckling load.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For a buckled rail section as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409712441743">Figure 1</xref>, it is assumed that the lateral constraints of the rail (usually in the form of spikes or clips located at about every 0.5 m along the rail) had failed due to degradation of the rail fastening system, such as deterioration of old timber sleepers, corrosion of rail spikes, etc.; and/or poor maintenance practice.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the need to review the design and construction of railway tracks to adapt to changing climate conditions is clearly highlighted in this work and the following recommendations are suggested.
<list id="list5-0954409712441743" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Reviewing and revising the rail construction procedure in which the rails are laid at the ‘neutral temperature’, to cope with increasing average, and larger variability, of temperature in the projected changing climate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reviewing and improving rail performance by improved or new construction configurations or designs of rail joints to accommodate the thermal expansion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Emphasizing the importance of proper maintenance for railway tracks, and the use of more durable materials for sleepers, spikes, etc.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Using new materials for rails, which are less sensitive to changes in temperature. Premium materials should be used in consideration of wheel and rail contact mechanics in relation to wear and fatigue properties of the current rail steel. This use may result in significantly higher construction or replacement costs. However, a better performance of the rail network would be a beneficial trade-off in the long term, in particular with more intensive and more frequent heatwave events being projected for the region as a result of climate change.</p></list-item>

<sec id="sec7-0954409712441743" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Extreme heatwaves can cause serious problems for railway networks for a number of reasons, including the buckling of rail tracks, as observed in Melbourne, Australia during the heatwave of January 2009. A reliability assessment of track buckling under extreme heatwave events has been undertaken using Monte Carlo simulation. Uncertainties about the effective buckling lengths, the buckling modes, rail temperature at the time of its installation and the rail temperature during the heatwave have been taken into account. The probability for the buckling of railway tracks in Melbourne determined in this study agrees with the number of buckled segments observed during the heatwave of January 2009. This agreement is an important proof of concept for this approach. The assessment has therefore demonstrated a reliability-based assessment approach for railway track buckling failures during a heatwave, which can be further developed into a framework to assist railway authorities in planning and management of railway network services.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this study made use of a number of assumptions that were made due to insufficient knowledge of the railway track conditions and lack of performance data. While the number of buckled segments in the analysis agrees with observations, it is preferable that more predictor variables be included so as to create a more realistic rail network model. It is also noted that only the buckling mode shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409712441743">Figure 1</xref> was assessed. Other modes of buckling may also occur in the railway network during a heatwave. Improvement of the results in this study and the proposal of adaptation strategies for railway networks during heatwaves will be possible when relevant data becomes available from the railway industry/authorities, such as the variability of track geometry and track strength, and they are integrated into the model to refine its predictive capability.</p>
