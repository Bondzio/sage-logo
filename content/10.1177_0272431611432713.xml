<abstract>
<p>Specific behavioral problems appear during early adolescence, and they become more pronounced. Although these problems are universal in many aspects, cultural differences are also conspicuous. The author, in addition to analyzing the five studies in the Special Issue, addresses questions concerning the cross-cultural context. The analysis reveals that today the cross-cultural analysis of the causal relationships concerning problem behavior is at the forefront, surpassing the international comparative studies characterized by analyzing only prevalence data. The author analyzes the phenomena of mass media globalization and cultural migration, which are believed to play an important role in the cross-cultural convergence of numerous problematic phenomena. Cultural heterogeneity, however, has to be considered as well, often even within one single country. It has to be emphasized that in case of intercultural transmission of preventive and treatment interventions, cultural differences have to be considered.</p>

<p>Although during the past decades the biopsychosocial approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431611432713">Engel, 1977</xref>) concerning mental and behavioral problems, and in general, human behavior, has become widely accepted, it is common to emphasize this approach even outside of scientific community; in fact, this complex approach did not always prevail in research. One reason for this is undoubtedly the intensive specification characteristic of all fields of research, which in the end often contributes to an exclusive approach instead of an open and interdisciplinary work. Another reason is the presence of methodological difficulties, since the integration of different types of factors and different levels of variables in one model challenges statistical methods and requires a significant development of the field. Last, this approach requires not only scientific and intellectual openness, but also human tolerance, which is indispensable for constructive collaboration with researchers who might represent different specific approaches. Successful resolution of these obstacles leads to excellent results and improvements in scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>Research integrating all three aspects—biological, psychological, and sociocultural—is quite scarce; however, research today has frequently integrated two of the three aspects. This special issue offers an outstanding selection of works that combine psychological and sociocultural approaches and focus specifically on the phenomena related to early adolescence.</p>
<p>All of the five studies analyze data of multinational research. Four studies analyzed data obtained by the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC) survey, and the fifth study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611432713">Schwarz et al., 2012</xref>) analyzed the database of the Value of Children and Relations (VOC) research project. These works, however, are not simple international comparative studies. International comparison of various prevalence values has become less interesting today, and the importance of present studies lies exactly in that they exceed the level of cross-national comparison of prevalence or characteristics of specific phenomena. Instead, recent studies have focused on cross-national or cross-cultural comparisons of the relationships and background dynamics. Thus, several levels of explanatory factors—individual, microcontextual (i.e., family and peer relationships), and macrocontextual (i.e., social, cultural, or economic)—can be included in the analyses simultaneously, and the analysis of their interactions and mutual moderating effects can be the focus of research. In this manner, the results are indeed much more than simple comparisons.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272431611432713">Farhat et al. (2012)</xref>, for example, showed that although there is an association between perceived peer drinking and the adolescent alcohol use in all cultures, strength of the association depends on cultural norms. For example, in Greece, where the consumption of alcohol is traditionally more accepted, this association is weaker than in countries where alcohol use of adolescents is considered as more deviant. The study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611432713">Schwarz et al. 2012</xref>) highlighted a similar phenomenon, pointing out that culturally determined family values modify the effect of peer relationships on life satisfaction. More precisely, they reported lower positive effect of peer acceptance on adolescents’ life satisfaction in countries characterized by higher family value. The study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431611432713">Ottova et al. (2012)</xref> indicated not only that countries with higher HDI (Human Development Index) are characterized by better health of adolescents but also that value of HDI moderates the association between psychosomatic health and other factors, such as age or media use. The results of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431611432713">de Looze et al.’s (2012)</xref> study are interesting because they revealed that although the number of early risk behaviors as well as the occurrence of injury at age 15 show significant variance across cultures, the positive association between the two factors is culturally consistent. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431611432713">Tabak et al.’s (2012)</xref> study called attention to cultural alikeness, specifically converging trends concerning characteristics of parent–child communication.</p>
<p>Even such a brief presentation of results indicate that although cross-national or cross-cultural research had for a long time been restricted to simple comparisons between different cultures, the focus has shifted toward revealing potential causes of these differences. Studies published in this special issue reflect this novel focus.</p>
<p>When analyzing cultural aspects, we also have to be aware that such an intensive interaction of cultures that is experienced these days had never been experienced before. Mainly because of the extremely dynamic development and spread of communication technologies, we can hardly talk about isolated cultures anymore, as the media influences most parts of the world. This media globalization effect is moreover intensively combined with actual migration. Temporary (tourism, jobs abroad) and permanent (migration) mixing of cultures is present to an extent never seen before, which makes the examination of cultural characteristics especially exciting and important. These facts, in addition to the abovementioned issues, might contribute to the convergent processes indicated by several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431611432713">Kuntsche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431611432713">Tabak et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, these changes imply methodological consequences. Traditionally, especially survey research tended to treat national and cultural concerns equally, which carries some risks. All European as well as non-European countries are multicultural; hence, national data by no means cover a homogeneous culture. In addition to the traditional heterogeneity (e.g., minority ethnic groups) existing for centuries in the countries around the world, the migration of different ethnic groups occurring during the past years or decades appears to carry considerably different cultural elements. Regarding traditional ethnic minorities, a number of studies conducted in Europe have focused on the Roma culture, and it has become clear that, for example, their patterns of substance use are consistently different from those of the non-Roma population (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272431611432713">Gerevich, Bacskai, Czobor, &amp; Szabo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272431611432713">Kolarcik, Geckova, Orosova, van Dijk, &amp; Reijneveld, 2010</xref>). Similarly, in the case of migrant groups experiencing high mobility due to the accelerated European migration that characterizes the last decades of the 20th century, several studies have indicated the presence of varied health behavior characteristics and substance use habits that are different from those of the host countries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431611432713">Donath et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431611432713">Ferron, Haour-Knipe, Tschumper, Narring, &amp; Michaud, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431611432713">Harrison, Sutton, &amp; Gardiner, 1997</xref>). We have to consider these phenomena by paying more attention during sampling and data collection in the future.</p>
<p>At the same time, the mechanisms mentioned here might fuel interesting future research that would integrate various cultural aspects. Present studies deal with different effects of different types of cultures (individualistic/collectivistic; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431611432713">Tabak et al., 2012</xref>) and examine the roles of traditional and family values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611432713">Schwarz et al., 2012</xref>) concerning specific phenomena. Other interesting research foci might involve issues of changing one’s culture, migration, or dual cultural attachment, as well as changes in the above mentioned characteristics. Studies on these issues have a special importance because changes in the cultural background presume a specific sensitive state that carries elevated risks concerning behavior disorders and health problems.</p>
<p>Besides the development of methodology and the integrative research approach incorporating new aspects, it is worth mentioning that the findings presented in this special issue might have also essential practical (prevention and/or treatment) implications. They shed light on the associations that can be applied in preventive interventions and help define the focus of these programs more precisely. On the other hand, however, the analysis of the cultural aspect also warns us to be careful when moving programs from one culture to another. On an international scale, and especially within the European Union, there are fortunately a growing number of professional collaborations. Numerous prevention and harm reduction programs are being elaborated due to the cooperation between several countries (see, for example, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hnt-info.eu/">http://www.hnt-info.eu/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272431611432713">Corazza et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, many programs are also available on the Internet with the aim of more effective dissemination (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/best-practice">http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/best-practice</ext-link>). Nevertheless, besides the accumulated experiences, the results also implicate the necessity to consider the feasibility of programs in different cultures, as the possible effects of programs conducted within a specific cultural context on the internal logic and methodology of the specific intervention must be considered and examined carefully in terms of their applicability to other cultures.</p>
