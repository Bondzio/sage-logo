<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study is to examine, through a longitudinal analysis, the priorities and beliefs that American newspaper editors hold toward foreign news reporting. Using the theory of cultural values as the framework, the study seeks to compare how American newspaper editors assessed the importance of factors in their selection of foreign news over time. The results show that the priorities of journalistic values in foreign news reporting remain fundamentally unchanged in the United States. More importantly, the factor structure of foreign news values was invariant between 1988 and 2008. The persistence of such values strongly indicates a shared professional culture that appears to cultivate a common worldview through journalistic practices in the newsroom.</p>

<p>Since the 1980s, the state of foreign news in the United States has often been considered to be on the decline. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748048512439822">Emery’s (1989)</xref> empirical study tends to be cited as irrevocable evidence of the significant quantitative drop of foreign news over the past decades. Such a verdict of the declining foreign news amount in the newspapers is further echoed by the internationalists of media practitioners, particularly those of TV broadcast journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048512439822">Fenton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1748048512439822">Utley, 1997</xref>) who have lamented that foreign news is increasingly becoming extinct in the United States. Coupled with the general perception of disappearing foreign news is the concern that the meager amount of what is left suffers from an absence of contextual reporting: there is little connection between the spotty news that pops up here and there in different parts of the world. The occasional reports from abroad nevertheless appear to create an illusion that American news media still watch over the horizons beyond US borders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748048512439822">Seib, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the plea for more foreign news in the US media is compelling, the plight of its coverage is not necessarily as dire as that depicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748048512439822">Emery (1989</xref>), who called the international newshole ‘an endangered species.’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748048512439822">Emery (1995</xref>: x, emphasis added) blamed it largely on ‘those home-desk editors and broadcast producers who short-circuited stories because <italic>they were ignorant of a rapidly changing world</italic>.’ Some recent studies, however, have not shown a decrease in the amount of foreign news as sharp as Emery indicated. For example, in a longitudinal study from 1927 to 1997, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748048512439822">Allen (2005</xref>: 98) found that while foreign news in the United States ‘did decline from 1947 to 1997, the 1997 amount of coverage was still higher’ than that in 1927 when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1748048512439822">Woodward (1930</xref>) pioneered a quantitative content analysis of foreign news coverage. The pattern leads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748048512439822">Hamilton (2009</xref>) to call it ’Woodward’s Law for Foreign News,’ suggesting that the amount of foreign news coverage in the United States would remain low at probably around 5 or 6% unless when the country is at war. While not directly comparable to foreign news studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048512439822">Barnhurst and Mutz (1997</xref>: 35) reported that from 1894 to 1994, specific locations of event-centered stories (street addresses) decreased significantly whereas ‘the broadest locations, international settings, increased,’ implying to some extent an increase in news coverage with a foreign locality.</p>
<p>Whether real or perceived, the shrinking space of foreign news coverage in the United States is generally attributed to Americans’ indifference to events taking place overseas and moribund foreign correspondents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048512439822">Fenton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748048512439822">Hoge, 1997</xref>). A perusal of news reporting texts would indicate that audience interests are a major entry that makes up the menu of newsworthiness. While it is true that the crop of traditional foreign correspondents for major US newspapers and TV networks has dwindled since the early 1990s, it is also true that they have been replaced by a new breed of foreign correspondents, such as those of CNN and Bloomberg, and local stringers as well as freelancers. Many factors at various levels contribute to the predicament of foreign news in American mass media, ranging from the individual to the organizational to the governmental. Less known, but equally influential, is the group of journalists who are strategically positioned to determine the flow and content of foreign news into the United States. What are the perspectives of American editors toward the world that lies beyond the reach of most people? How do their news values change over time? What underscores their journalistic practices in foreign news reporting? Answers to these questions should add knowledge and insights to the editorial decisions that collectively shape the ways US readers may come to see the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is twofold: first, to examine, through a replication and a longitudinal analysis, the priorities and beliefs of American newspaper editors toward foreign news reporting; and second, to test the invariance of the factor structure of determinants of foreign news coverage across two groups of editors over time. Specifically, informed by the sociology of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748048512439822">Mannheim, 1936</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1748048512439822">Park, 1955</xref>) and using the theory of cultural values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748048512439822">Schwartz, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1748048512439822">2006</xref>) as the framework, this study seeks to compare how American newspaper editors evaluate the importance of a number of factors in their selection of foreign news between 1988 and 2008. Given that the world’s geopolitical landscape has changed significantly since the 1980s, a comparison of journalistic values has theoretical and epistemological implications for a deeper understanding of the processes and structure of foreign news reporting in the United States.</p>
<p>Theoretically, the ways American news media cover the world cannot be better understood without taking into account the views of those gatekeepers in terms of their conceptualization and articulation of foreign news values. Epistemologically, the determinants of foreign news coverage cannot be adequately assessed without including those who make the final decision in the equation. Simply looking at the actual patterns of news coverage does not help to explain why the pattern occurs. As such, use of content analysis to identify the determinants of international news flow (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748048512439822">Chang et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748048512439822">Golan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1748048512439822">Wu, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1748048512439822">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1748048512439822">2007</xref>) is at best an indirect measure of such variables and at worst appears superficial, failing to recognize the impact of collective beliefs and received knowledge of a special occupational group on their daily work. As a set of values, they guide organizational decision-making in news selection. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748048512439822">Hjarvard (2002</xref>: 95) pointed out in his criticism of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748048512439822">Galtung and Ruge’s</xref> influential study on the structure of foreign news (1965), ‘the editorial policy of the specific newspapers in question may account for a high degree of variation in the news.’</p>
<sec id="section1-1748048512439822">
<title>Newspaper editors as an occupational group</title>
<p>Against the backdrop of the sociology of knowledge perspective, individuals and groups follow certain modes of thinking to collect, sustain, reformulate, and distribute their intellectual heritage, ideas, and views in society; these modes of thinking are closely connected to the social conditions in which they operate (Wirth, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748048512439822">Mannheim, 1936</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048512439822">Berger and Luckmann, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1748048512439822">Stark, 1958</xref>). Newspaper editors constitute what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748048512439822">Mannheim (1936</xref>) called an occupational group. First, as the final arbiters over the inclusion or exclusion of news, editors are located at the highest echelon of the newsroom decision-making hierarchy. Whether cognizant or not, they hold unique epistemological interest in social reality and pay special attention to how the selection and presentation of social reality in the news may be related to the concerns and experiences of readers in their everyday life.</p>
<p>Second, because they are particularly protected by the First Amendment, American news media occupy unrivaled social positions not accorded to other industries. Constitutional protections aside, newspapers often take pride in their unique status in American democracy and relish their historical significance in the American Revolution. The specific location of the press in US society is best captured in Reston’s unequivocal statement that ‘The United States had a press before it had a foreign policy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1748048512439822">1967</xref>: 5). Given their professional authority in the newsroom and social position in the larger society, American newspaper editors therefore wield substantial power in deciding what the general public may read in the news on a daily basis. How they come to view the world and consider part of it as news and what underpins their editorial judgment, however, is not necessarily random. Through social control in the newsroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748048512439822">Breed, 1955</xref>), a media company’s editorial line or political ideology is guaranteed to be known in some way to its entire staff. In the age of the Internet, however, the jurisdiction and content of newspapers, like those of other traditional media, have increasingly been challenged by the emerging citizen journalists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048512439822">Domingo and Heinonen, 2008</xref>). Not only has the domination of news agencies in foreign news been undermined by the ubiquitous online journalism, the claim of journalistic standards, values, and expert knowledge as well as skills has also been weakened professionally in the US and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748048512439822">Phillips et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1748048512439822">Witschge and Nygren, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the perspective of sociology of knowledge, foreign news reporting in the United States is not simply a matter of presentation of events as they are; it represents a journalistic point of view, the American perspective on how foreign news should be covered. Such a practice based on a particular perspective in foreign news reporting is in fact common in countries around the world (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1748048512439822">Roberts and Bantimaroudis, 1997</xref>). Since the study of Mr Gates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1748048512439822">White, 1950</xref>), it has been well documented in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048512439822">Chang and Lee, 1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748048512439822">1992b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748048512439822">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748048512439822">Gans, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1748048512439822">Tuchman, 1978</xref>) that newspaper editors harbor a set of common standards in their selection of events and issues deemed newsworthy and to be included as news. It is practically impossible for any newspaper to cover all the incidents that happen from country to country. Editors must find ways to select a subset of it to fill the available space.</p>
<p>Conceptually, not everything is fit to print on the news pages. Editors must take into consideration how the news may play out to meet the minimum threshold in the context of technological imperatives, organizational constraints, audience tastes and preferences, editorial policies, and social norms. In contextual reporting, values are always embedded in the news selection process and those who make the choices must weigh the merit of individual values and determine their priority for placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748048512439822">Gans, 1979</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748048512439822">Lippmann and Merz (1920</xref>: 3, emphasis added) had long recognized in their study of coverage of the 1917 Russian Revolution in <italic>The New York Times</italic>, ‘The news as a whole is dominated by <italic>the hopes of the men who composed the news organization</italic>,’ suggesting that the news ‘is a case of seeing not what was, but what men wished to see.’ Wishes are what one values the most.</p>

<title>Culture values, journalistic orientation, and news work</title>
<p>Editors are members of ‘symbolic analytical services’ workforce; part of their tasks in news reporting is first problem-identifying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748048512439822">Hardt and Negri, 2000</xref>: 291) and then selecting the problems that are worthy of time and space in news coverage. From foreign correspondents on the frontline to the editors in the newsroom, in the long process of international communication something always gets filtered out from one stage to another. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748048512439822">Shoemaker and Reese (1996</xref>) proposed five sets of factors that may influence the content of mass media, ranging from the individual to the ideological level. As part of the larger media content, coverage of foreign news is especially affected by organizational and financial considerations as well as the ways journalists approach their work within the general parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1748048512439822">Said, 1997</xref>). For example, it has been documented that journalists embrace certain political affiliations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748048512439822">Herman and Chomsky, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748048512439822">Lichter et al., 1986</xref>). Whether liberal or conservative, such affiliations are embedded in news judgment and establish the boundaries of facts-gathering and define the range of stories that can be reported within the confines of time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048512439822">Gitlin, 1980</xref>). They become received belief or background knowledge that is enduring.</p>
<p>The journalistic values<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1748048512439822">1</xref></sup> ‘are enduring,’ as Gans put it, ‘in large part because the basic considerations that underlie news judgment do not change significantly over time – or, at least, <italic>have not changed over the last several decades</italic>’ (1979: 197, emphasis added). Regardless of foreign or domestic news, enduring values are not detached from the media industry’s ‘structural fundamentals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048512439822">Fenton, 2005</xref>: 46), in that the conceptual views of foreign news in the larger media landscape are molded by their daily practices. When diminishing empathy – reducing empathy toward others as we move from our own local community, to the country, to the region, and to the world – is involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748048512439822">Bhagwati, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748048512439822">Hanusch, 2008</xref>), the range of journalistic vision tends to be relatively narrow, focusing on how the news may be related to the audience as consumers back home, not necessarily on what they may need as informed citizens. It is part of ‘the globalization of the world economy’ that ‘is reinforcing this tendency to turn inward’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748048512439822">Moisy, 1997</xref>: 84). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748048512439822">Moisy (1997</xref>: 84, emphasis added), former chairman and general manager of Agence France-Presse, observed, ‘In the United States, as in many other countries, the news horizon is tending to draw closer – <italic>from the international to the national and from the national to the local</italic>.’ As such, it takes a tremendous magnitude for foreign events to become news, such as ‘wars, diseases and earthquakes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748048512439822">Rosenblum, 1981</xref>). These general conceptions become part of the cultural framework that delimits how editors select foreign news.</p>
<p>Journalistic perspectives play an important role in foreign news reporting because different locations, both physical and social, lead to different observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1748048512439822">Tuchman, 1978</xref>). When they are stationed abroad, American correspondents are first and foremost <italic>American</italic> reporters, covering events and issues from a journalistic orientation to serve the American audience, even though they may be competing with their counterparts abroad to report on the day’s news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1748048512439822">Said, 1997</xref>). Journalists of course are aware of the importance of domestic, rather than foreign, perspectives in news reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048512439822">Palmer and Fontan, 2007</xref>). As Craig Lord (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748048512439822">Bernstein, 2000</xref>: 361) made clear, ‘You can’t ignore <italic>The Times</italic> is a British paper. . . You have to consider that the people reading the paper will want to know what happened to “our boy” or “our girl”’ at the Olympics. As such, domestication of foreign news is often the norm, not the exception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748048512439822">Cohen et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In a broad sense, the combination of news values and journalistic orientation as a practice constitutes what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748048512439822">Schwartz (1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1748048512439822">2006</xref>) calls cultural values, whose priorities tend to have influences on the meaning of work of individuals in their everyday life. Schwartz defined cultural values ‘as <italic>conceptions of the desirable</italic> that guide the way social actors (e.g., organizational leaders, policy-makers, individual persons) select actions, evaluate people and events, and explain their actions and evaluations’ (1999: 24–25, emphasis added). In news selection, conceptions of the desirable are what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748048512439822">Lippmann and Merz (1920</xref>) called hopes or wishes of those who are in a position to do so. Schwartz maintained that cultural values ‘are trans-situational criteria. . . <italic>ordered by importance</italic> as guiding principles in life’ and the priorities of cultural values ‘<italic>are shared</italic>’ by members of society through both formal and informal socialization (1999: 25, emphasis added).</p>
<p>To paraphrase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748048512439822">Hardt and Negri (2000</xref>), American editors have long embraced certain values in foreign news reporting that function on the basis of resemblance, not on the basis of differences. The prevalence of news values and their order of importance should therefore be persistent as they underscore the journalistic beliefs and practices of US editors. Against the backdrop of Schwartz’s priorities of ‘basic values’ in guiding action (2006: 143) and Gans’s ‘basic considerations’ in journalistic practices (1979: 197), a key proposition of this study is that <italic>the priorities of journalistic values in news decision-making are likely to be enduring and thus do not vary significantly over time</italic>. Specifically, using the data collected in 1988 and 2008 respectively, the study postulates the following two hypotheses:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>H1:</italic> The priorities of values of US editors in foreign news reporting in 2008 will be positively related to those of their counterparts in 1988.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>H2:</italic> The beliefs of US editors toward foreign news practices in 2008 will be positively related to those of their counterparts in 1988.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Underlying the steady values in foreign news reporting is the assumption of a fundamental factor structure that involves some theoretical constructs considered to be invariant across the two groups of American newspaper editors over time. Conceptually, a number of variables, such as proximity, strength of country involved, and properties of events, have been identified to affect how foreign events are covered in the US news (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048512439822">Chang, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748048512439822">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048512439822">Chang and Lee, 1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748048512439822">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748048512439822">Chang et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748048512439822">Golan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1748048512439822">Wu, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1748048512439822">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1748048512439822">2007</xref>). Based on the extant literature, a baseline model of two-factor structure – a context-oriented factor and an event-oriented factor – and their observed variables in foreign news reporting is proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1748048512439822">Figure 1</xref>. It should be pointed out that loadings on these two latent factors are limited only to those variables under examination. They are not exhaustive because it is impossible once and for all ‘to isolate a definite number of factors that determine the way foreign news is structured in the (Western) world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748048512439822">Hjarvard, 2002</xref>: 94). Notwithstanding, additional variables could still be classified into either context-oriented or event-oriented.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1748048512439822">Figure 1</xref>, the latent dimension <italic>context-oriented factor </italic>refers to those manifest variables at both the national and international levels in foreign news reporting. These variables tend to be related to the larger national or international settings in which the event occurs, including physical distance, involvement, cultural relevance, level of country’s economic development, military strength of the country involved, trade relations between countries, and threat to a specific country or the world. A good example is terrorist activities or armed conflicts that directly or indirectly pose threats to the US interest or world peace. The other latent dimension <italic>event-oriented factor </italic>identifies the attributes of events themselves (i.e., unusualness, novelty, or calamities) as determinants of foreign news coverage: audience interest, timeliness, human interest, and loss of lives and property. The intrinsic properties of the events are likely to invoke curiosity, urgency, or sympathy on the part of recipients. As indicated by the covariance linkage, these two factors are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Although there has been a plethora of discussion of these variables, this two-factor structure has never been empirically tested before. The hypothesized model of the underlying theoretical structure, as manifested by the observed variables in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1748048512439822">Figure 1</xref>, is specified to be equivalent across the two groups of American newspaper editors over time.

<title>Methods</title>
<p>To ascertain change or stability of journalistic values in foreign news reporting over time, this study replicated a national survey of American newspaper editors by Chang and Lee in the late 1980s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1748048512439822">2</xref></sup> Their survey was conducted from mid-December 1987 to early March 1988. The three mailings yielded 279 respondents, with a cooperation rate of 51.7%. The present study was part of a larger national survey of newspaper editors and TV news directors. Proportionate to either newspaper circulation size or TV designated market area, the sample was randomly selected from the 2006 <italic>Editor and Publisher International Year Book</italic> and the 2007 <italic>Broadcasting and Cable Yearbook</italic>. The mail survey was conducted between mid-December 2007 and early March 2008. The similar timeframe was designed to eliminate seasonal differences as potential confounding factors affecting how journalists might respond to surveys. The three mailings and an online option generated a total of 337 respondents for a response rate of 38.5%. With 15 refusals, the cooperation rate was 36.8%. Of the 322 respondents, 224 were daily newspaper editors. The drop in response rate appears to be part of the national trend.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1748048512439822">
<italic>The Washington Post</italic> (2003</xref>), ‘accumulated evidence indicates that response rates are indeed falling over time’ among the American public. Although no such evidence is available for the annual survey of newspaper editors and TV news directors, a general trend in consumer surveys should be indicative of what is likely to happen to a specialized population whose members are highly busy in their everyday practices and hence difficult to reach. As reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048512439822">Curtin et al. (2005</xref>), the overall response rate of the University of Michigan’s Survey of Consumer Attitudes has deteriorated from 60% in 1996 to only 48% in 2003, with an average decline of 1.5 percentage points a year. It stands to reason that the response rate for newspaper editors and TV news directors should be expected to decline over time.</p>
<p>Similar to the first survey, a questionnaire composed mostly of multiple-choice items was mailed to the top editor of each newspaper (either editor or managing editor). The questionnaire asked editors to rate<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1748048512439822">3</xref></sup> the importance of each of the following factors that they take into account in their selection of foreign news: physical distance of the event from the US, US involvement in the event, cultural relevance of the event to the US, US trade relations with the country in which the event occurs, audience interest in the event, timeliness of the event, threat of the event to the US, threat of the event to world peace, human interest of the event, level of economic development of the country in which the event occurs, military strength of the country in which the event occurs, and loss of lives and property.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1748048512439822">4</xref></sup> Editors were asked to rate each factor based on a five-point scale, ranging from 1 (‘not at all important’) to 5 (‘very important’). For comparative purpose, this study replicated the 12 factors surveyed in 1988.</p>
<p>Some of these values are specifically related to the context in which the event takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748048512439822">Novais, 2007</xref>) while others are more connected to the properties of the event itself. For example, US involvement in the event certainly is context-oriented whereas timeliness is rather event-oriented. The former refers to the events and issues explicitly or implicitly linked to either national or international context (cultural relevance to the US, economic development of the country involved, US trade relations, and threat to the US). The latter focuses more on the inherent attributes of the events that might invoke public interest or fear because of their abnormal, consequential, or tragic implications (loss of lives and property).</p>
<p>To determine editors’ positions and beliefs toward foreign news practices in the US newspapers, Chang and Lee asked them to indicate the extent they agreed with six major issues that accentuated the NWICO debate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1748048512439822">5</xref></sup> In this study, one issue was dropped from the original list because of the demise of the NWICO movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1748048512439822">6</xref></sup> The remaining five issues were retained due to their relevance to US foreign news reporting in the contemporary international context. These items focused primarily on the specific criticisms toward the practices and performance of American news media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1748048512439822">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In foreign media circles and academic research communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1748048512439822">Roach, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748048512439822">Roser and Brown, 1986</xref>), these five statements often represent the main arguments against US news media regarding the content and the form of their international news coverage. Although the NWICO issues seldom seeped below the national level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748048512439822">Raskin, 1981</xref>) during the heyday of the debate, challenges to American media’s foreign news practices continue to linger even after its demise. It is therefore important, both theoretically and practically, to discover whether newspaper editors have taken different positions over time. Editors were asked, based on a five-point scale, whether they agreed or disagreed with each statement, with 1 representing ‘strongly disagree’ and 5 meaning ‘strongly agree.’ In the analysis, however, the values were reversed to correspond to the original ratings used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748048512439822">Chang and Lee’s (1993)</xref> study in which 1 was ‘strongly agree’ and 5 ‘strongly disagree.’</p>
<p>Because the question order ‘can affect the responses as well as the overall data collection activity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048512439822">Babbie, 1973</xref>: 147), a question could be raised that editors’ ratings of the importance of each of 12 journalistic values might be affected by the order in which they were asked to judge. The analysis of rank-order correlation between the question order and the two sets of ratings shows no evidence that editors’ responses to the importance of journalistic values were affected by the order in which they appeared in the questionnaire.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1748048512439822">Table 1</xref> compares how editors rated the importance of the 12 journalistic values in foreign news reporting between the two study periods. From 1988 to 2008, there were changes in importance of seven of the values: audience interest, threat to the United States, threat to the world peace, US involvement, cultural relevance to the United States, US trade relations, and military strength of the country involved. While the importance of audience interest (<italic>M</italic> = 4.35 vs <italic>M</italic> = 4.50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and cultural relevance (<italic>M</italic> = 3.41 vs <italic>M</italic> = 3.87, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) increased significantly, the importance of threat to US (<italic>M</italic> = 4.51 vs<italic> M</italic> = 4.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), threat to world peace (<italic>M</italic> = 4.38 vs <italic>M</italic> = 4.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), US involvement (<italic>M</italic> = 4.29 vs <italic>M</italic> = 4.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), US trade relations (<italic>M</italic> = 3.01 vs <italic>M</italic> = 2.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and military strength of the country involved (<italic>M</italic> = 2.41 vs <italic>M</italic> = 2.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) decreased significantly. For the importance of other five values (timeliness, loss of lives/property, human interest, physical distance, and economic development of the country involved), editors did not rate them differently, showing a striking consistency over time.</p>

<title>Evidence for Hypothesis 1</title>
<p>Over time, although there were variations regarding the importance of seven individual values, the priorities of these values as a whole based on their mean ratings remain remarkably unchanged. The rank-order correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>
<sub>s</sub> = .937, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) between the two surveys of journalistic values in terms of their decreasing importance showed a significant relationship. From 1988 to 2008, the importance of the 12 values in editors’ selection of foreign news did not vary at all, exhibiting a set of shared values. Hypothesis 1 proposed that the priorities of values of US editors in foreign news reporting in 2008 would be positively related to those of their counterparts in 1988. As ordered by their importance, the consistent pattern of value priorities among newspaper editors supports the hypothesis.</p>
<p>In addition to what is newsworthy in foreign news reporting, existing literature suggests that during the 1980s major newspapers in the United States did not see any merit in UNESCO and, by implication, the main issues involved in the NWICO debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748048512439822">Giffard, 1989</xref>). Moreover, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748048512439822">Chang and Lee (1993</xref>: 313–314, emphasis in original) indicated, a large number of US newspaper editors ‘firmly opposed’ the major NWICO issues, centering ‘mostly around the demands that might fundamentally alter the <italic>free</italic> flow structure of news traffic among countries, or that would severely compromise the <italic>independence</italic> and <italic>autonomy</italic> of the US press in the international communication theater.’ Twenty years later, editors continued to voice their objection to the criticisms that challenged the performance and practices of US media in foreign news reporting.</p>

<sec id="section6-1748048512439822">
<title>Evidence for Hypothesis 2</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1748048512439822">Table 2</xref>, editors in 2008 again rejected, like their counterparts in 1988, the idea of using more news stories supplied by foreign news agencies (<italic>M</italic> = 3.31 vs <italic>M</italic> = 3.40, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), rejected overplaying negative news about other countries (<italic>M</italic> = 3.30 vs <italic>M</italic> = 3.30, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), disputed the argument of inadequate training of American foreign correspondents (<italic>M</italic> = 3.23 vs <italic>M</italic> = 3.05, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), and rebuffed the demand for an equal and balanced flow of news between developed and developing/underdeveloped countries (<italic>M</italic> = 3.09 vs <italic>M</italic> = 3.25, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). While editors appeared to be more receptive to the assertion of stereotypical coverage of other countries in US foreign news reporting in both surveys (<italic>M</italic> = 2.94 vs <italic>M</italic> = 3.00, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), the pattern stayed the same over time. From 1988 to 2008, editors’ beliefs about these five issues were similar, displaying a common mindset. Hypothesis 2 postulated that the beliefs of US editors toward foreign news practices in 2008 would be positively related to those of their counterparts in 1988. The evidence in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1748048512439822">Table 2</xref> supports the hypothesis.</p>

<p>The fact that the importance of certain journalistic values increased while the importance of other values decreased over time suggests a shift of individual concerns among newspaper editors from the emphasis of <italic>foreign</italic> properties of events or countries involved to <italic>domestic</italic> audience orientation. The propensity for locally minded values, and by implication local news, is probably a market strategy to retain readers in the face of stiff competition from other news media, especially online journalism. Although indirect, part of the domestication of foreign news reporting could be determined by examining American newspapers’ subscription to international new agencies – AP, AFP, and Reuters<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1748048512439822">8</xref></sup> – over time. While the three agencies have become global, each is based in different media capitals and has its own unique clients and territories to serve.</p>
<p>In the 2008 survey, nearly every newspaper (99.6%) in the United States subscribed to the New York-based AP, representing a significant increase from 92.5% in 1988. The opposite is true for the two non-US news agencies: AFP and Reuters. For the Paris-based AFP, the proportion of American newspaper subscribers dropped considerably from 5.4% in 1988 to 0.9% in 2008. The French news agency appears to have lost its relevance to newspapers in the United States. For the formerly London-based Reuters, the decrease in US newspaper subscribers from 1988 to 2008 (12.2% vs 8.0%) was not as sharp as that of AFP. Nevertheless, the trend suggests a decline of Reuters as a source of news reporting for American newspapers. Because subscription to the three global news agencies is not mutually exclusive, further examination of the unique position of AP as a source of foreign news reporting would be illuminating. The results indicate an increasing importance of the home-based AP in wire services as opposed to foreign-owned news agencies (χ<sub>2</sub> = 6.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1748048512439822">9</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The common pattern between the two groups of editors – their priorities of news values and convergence on a home-based news service – strongly suggests that from 1988 to 2008 there is a fundamental conceptual structure in foreign news reporting. As specified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1748048512439822">Figure 1</xref>, a two-factor structure and their factor loadings could be identified and tested according to existing theoretical formulation and empirical evidence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1748048512439822">
<title>Evidence for Hypothesis 3</title>
<p>Hypothesis 3 requires a multi-group comparison to determine whether the two-dimensional factors of determinants of foreign news values, as measured by the two sets of items, are equivalent across newspaper editors in 1988 and those in 2008. As noted earlier, the proposed two-factor structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1748048512439822">Figure 1</xref> is a baseline model that is conceptually derived from empirical studies in the literature. Using AMOS 17.0, a two-group confirmatory factor analysis was run to verify the invariance of factor loadings between the two data sets. For the confirmatory factor analysis, the cases (32) with missing data on any measure were deleted listwise, reducing the sample size from 495 to 463.</p>
<p>According to the recommended cutoff criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748048512439822">Hu and Bentler, 1999</xref>), with a relatively large sample size (more than 250), a comparative fit index (CFI) of .95 and a root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) close to .06 indicate a very good fit. In this analysis, when all factor loadings were constrained to be equal between the two groups of newspapers editors, the model fits the data well. Both the CFI and RMSEA meet the threshold (CFI = .97, RMSEA = .05, χ<sup>2</sup> = 83.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1748048512439822">10</xref></sup> The CFI shows that 97% of the covariance in the observed data can be reproduced by the hypothesized model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1748048512439822">Figure 1</xref>, indicating equivalence across groups. The evidence supports Hypothesis 3, suggesting that the values of US editors in foreign news reporting in 2008 had the same factor structure as that of their counterparts in 1988.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>In the age of the Internet and digital technologies, the world has been shifting fast. If ‘changes in communications alter cultures – expanding, changing, and destroying them,’ as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748048512439822">Greig (2002</xref>: 225) contended, then it is theoretically and practically significant to re-examine how the evolving landscape might have affected the way American media look at the world. Both journalistic accounts and academic studies suggest that traditional news media in the United States have changed over time in their coverage of the world at large by not only ditching foreign bureaus, but also reducing time and space devoted to international news coverage. Implicit in such retreats is a set of journalistic values and practices that have steered American journalists in foreign news reporting as to what counts as newsworthiness and how best to respond to international challenges to US media practices.</p>
<p>Informed by Schwartz’s theory of cultural value priorities, this study seeks to uncover the longitudinal patterns of views, beliefs, and journalistic practices among American newspaper editors over a time span of 20 years. Using identical questionnaire items, it represents the first replication of its kind that provides comparative, and compelling, evidence regarding how newspaper editors as an occupational group in the United States come to consider the world out there through their collective judgments in foreign news reporting. Several conclusions can be drawn from these results.</p>
<p>First, the priorities of journalistic values in foreign news reporting appear unchanged in the United States during the past two decades. It is significant that the factor structure of foreign news values remains invariant over time. The persistence of such a value system indicates a shared professional culture or an occupational stability that cultivates a common worldview in the newsrooms across the United States. The homogenization of values and views involving how foreign news is to be reported among American newspaper editors means that the world as presented to the US audiences is bound to be different from that reported overseas. Given the decreasing amount of foreign news space and time, these journalistic values may further perpetuate a US-centric news propensity that is incompatible with the world at large. From a long-term point of view, the sporadic reporting may reinforce the notion that the world tends to be seen through the eyes of America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748048512439822">Hardt, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, there is a considerable tilt of beliefs among American newspaper editors toward domestication of foreign news. Although the overall priorities of journalistic values persist over time, there is evidence that US newspaper editors today have retreated from the positions taken by their counterparts in the 1980s in that the attributes of foreign events and issues (e.g., properties of countries involved) become less relevant in news reporting, as opposed to domestic concerns. At a time when it requires more effort and resources for the news media to bring the world back home to the American people, newspapers editors have consistently demonstrated their preferences for what is desirable in foreign news reporting: to contextualize stories with the domestic audience in mind. This aligns with recent studies and a general impression that find concentration of local stories in the news media. In connection to contextual reporting, newspaper editors have also displayed a collective disposition that underscores their distrust of international efforts and challenges that may undermine their work as independent and autonomous news workers in the United States.</p>
<p>Third, in its analysis of two decades of American news preferences, the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press reported that ‘foreign news has consistently been at, or near, the bottom of the index for 21 years’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748048512439822">2007</xref>: 4). For whatever reasons, the continued emphasis on foreign news as a site solely of disaster and international threat to the United States represents an intriguing oversight and a missed opportunity. Consider the low prioritization of reporting on foreign economic circumstances. From 1988 to 2008, newspapers editors saw the economic dimension of countries involved as essentially unimportant in foreign news coverage. If the view results in how countries might be covered in foreign news reporting, the absence of such background information could have contributed to the fact that many Americans are ill-prepared to comprehend the rise of economic powers such as China and India or their lack of understanding of the interconnectedness and interdependence of the world’s economies.</p>
<p>The amount of foreign news reporting is not necessarily a zero-sum question in that an increase in domestic news has to come at the expense of the former. The persistent values and practices in foreign news reporting among American newspaper editors over time raise conceptual and practical implications for both civilians and policy-makers alike. On the one hand, their spotty knowledge of the world is likely to be hampered by the lack of foreign news coverage. On the other hand, the role of news media in foreign policy decision-making has long been recognized as crucial. The CNN or the Al Jazeera effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1748048512439822">Seib, 2008</xref>) highlight the contemporary impact of foreign news on international politics. The form and content of foreign news are closely linked to the mentality of groupthink among American newspaper editors. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1748048512439822">Peterson (1979</xref>: 116) suggested, ‘If newsmen share a pattern of preferences as to what is newsworthy, and that pattern does not represent reality, they will present a distorted image of the world which may contribute inappropriate decisions and policies.’ For better or for worse, the enduring values in foreign news reporting in the United States deserve closer scrutiny and their repercussions should be further explored.</p>

<p>The journalistic values identified in the present study are mostly different from those in Gans’s research. Gans classified the <italic>enduring values in the news</italic> into eight categories: ethnocentrism, altruistic democracy, responsible capitalism, small-town pastoralism, individualism, moderatism, social order, and national leadership (1979: 42–64). These values are based on content analysis of the news. For lack of a better term, we borrowed the notion of enduring values to refer to the persistent journalistic values held by American newspaper editors in their selection of foreign news. Given the fast changing media landscape, Gans’s enduring values are open to re-examination. No intention is attempted here to equate the news values determined through content analysis with the values newspaper editors expressed in the survey.</p>

<p>Because of the theoretical focus of the priorities of journalistic values, it might be argued that ranking, instead of rating, should be the most appropriate technique to map the overall conceptual domain. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748048512439822">Alwin and Krosnick (1989</xref>: 137), however, ‘ratings and rankings produced similar results in terms of ordering the relative importance of value choices in the aggregate.’ They also indicated that ‘rating scales are easy to present to respondents’ (1989: 125).</p>

<p>In January 1985, the United States withdrew from the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to protest its politicized policies, following years of heated debates over the New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO) at the international body.
