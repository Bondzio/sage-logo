<p>Towards the end of the 19th century, the founder of the modern Olympic Games, Pierre de Coubertin, was researching his international sporting project and writing scholarly work on the philosophy of Olympism seeking broadly to espouse the virtues of links between sport, culture and education. Coubertin’s collaborator, Carl Diem, too was writing widely and presenting in academic circles about the Olympic movement and its philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506813484239">Chatziefstathiou and Henry, 2012</xref>). Since then, the Olympic and Paralympic Games have generated considerable academic interest and spawned a plethora of print and electronic publications. Indeed, the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games have provided an opportunity for an intense proliferation of academic conferences, seminars, lectures, books, journal papers and special issues in the field of Olympic Studies not to mention the media and political outpouring of opinion on the relationships between the Olympic and Paralympic Games and society. Kath Woodward’s contribution to the field in <italic>Sex, Power and the Games</italic>, then, is timely and in the title at least significant in bringing the topic of sex gender relations to Olympic Studies in a single text.</p>
<p>Woodward (p. 1) seeks broadly to explore ‘how power operates in the Olympic Games’ and asks ‘whether an interrogation of the systems and processes through which power operates is sufficient to explain the endurance of inequalities notably those which are based on the binary logic of sex gender’. To her credit she includes throughout her discussion case studies of the Paralympic Games as well as those from the Olympic Games but I would have preferred that the Paralympics were named throughout where relevant to highlight developments in Paralympic elite sport alongside those in the Olympic events which are so central to the embodied relations of power that Woodward seeks to explore. Her expertise in the field of feminist scholarship, most recently in <italic>Why Feminism Matters</italic>, provides a theoretical backdrop for unpacking the sex gender inequalities that characterize the history, structures, processes and experiences of the Olympic and Paralympic movement. We are introduced to the theoretical framework of the book on pp. 3–8 in the section on ‘The Olympics: power and sex’. Here ‘sex gender’ is presented as a lens for understanding ‘inequalities, contradictions, social cohesion, exclusion and, in particular, the politics of the Olympics’ (p. 5). Illustrating an attention to embodied complexities in the power relations Woodward is emphasizing in the book, she identifies the significance of intersectional aspects of gender, sexuality, class, disability and age as ‘mobilised’ and ‘transformed’ in the Olympics (p. 6).</p>
<p>I broadly agree with Woodward’s introductory comments. Sex, sexuality and gender are embodied in and through the practice of sport and constructed and reconstructed in Olympic and Paralympic sport in complex and contradictory ways. The ‘Regulatory Frameworks’ of Olympic/Paralympic governance identified in Chapter 1 (p. 17) along with the classification and verification of sex gender for women in Olympic/Paralympic codes of practice, and a search for certainty and authenticity in sex gender definitions through scientific assessment discussed in Chapter 2 together provide a historical guide to the development of sex gender politics and highlight the complex intersections of bodies/gender/sex/power in a range of examples from boxing and athletics in both Olympic and Paralympic contexts. And it is these two chapters that deploy the ‘feminist critiques of sex and gender’ that Woodward alludes to in her introductory discussion (p. 6). Indeed, there is an insightful account of Deleuzian approaches to understanding corporeal signification that underpins a more detailed account of the practice of gender verification using the case of the South African runner Caster Semenya. I might have preferred the detail of Woodward’s position on sex, gender and sexuality on pp. 62–70 a little earlier since the application of critical feminist scholarship in Olympic Studies is somewhat lacking and readers of this text may have benefitted from some earlier sensitizing to the conceptual framework. It may also have helped to avoid an unfortunate typographical error on p. 8 where there is a reference to ‘ex and gender’ and a lack of conceptual clarity where references are made to sex and gender (instead of the sex gender formulation without hyphen or forward slash but with a space between words as used at the start of the book) and references to only sex or only gender (see for example last line of p. 16). While I can see that sport may not have been ‘a prime empirical concern of feminist theories’ I am surprised at and have to disagree with Woodward’s claim that ‘How power underpins ex [<italic>sic</italic>] and gender has, of course, been central to feminist debate, but much less to the sociology of sport.’ There are over 40 years of feminist scholarship on gender in the sociology of sport focusing variously on gender relations of power and making a significant contribution to understanding sex/gender relations in a range of sporting spheres.</p>
<p>As the book advances into Chapter 4 (‘Nations, host cities and opportunities’), Chapter 5 (‘Spectacles and spectators’), Chapter 6 (‘The art of sport’) and Chapter 7 (‘Contradictions, controversies and disruptions’), Woodward’s initial emphasis on using sex gender as a lens for understanding how power operates in Olympic and Paralympic contexts lessens in favour of a more generalized account of the way that bidding for and hosting the Games (Chapter 4), watching the Games (Chapter 5), representing the Games (Chapter 6) and protesting through the Games (Chapter 7) underpin unequal relations of local–global power dynamics as well as framing possibilities for social inclusion. Chapters 4–7 are certainly informed by well-researched examples. Some are drawn from already established research in the field of Olympic Studies. Some other examples, such as those explored in the ‘Art of sport’ chapter, present accounts of some novel primary research exploring the relationships between sport, painting and sculpture that offer a significant intellectual contribution to discussions of sport, art and cultural difference and diversity. We are not bought back to the primary aim of the book until the final Chapter 8, ‘Conclusion’. Woodward summarizes her arguments in the book, explaining that ‘sex gender has been deployed to provide explanations of the processes and systems and the enfleshed engagements through which the games are constituted’ (p. 178) and that ‘the book has argued for a materialist understanding of the practices of inclusion and exclusion that also permit political activism and change’ (p. 180). I think Woodward has achieved both these ends at various points in the text but I am left wondering whether the title of the book does not quite capture both of these ends in their entirety. While there can be no argument with Woodward’s final comments that Olympic and Paralympic sport is ‘part of a wider social terrain of transformation and opportunities as well as the endurance and reinstatement of social inequalities’ (p. 190), I would have expected a more punchy and theoretically insightful conclusion connected to the introductory claims for harnessing sex gender in <italic>furthering</italic> an understanding of unequal relations of power in Olympic and Paralympic sport. Still, for those students, academic staff and researchers seeking a broad overview of some aspects of the sex gender character of Olympic/Paralympic sport informed by critical feminist scholarship and a range of key examples then <italic>Sex, Power and the Games</italic> would be a useful starting point.</p>
