            <p>Cystic fibrosis is one of the most common autosomal recessive genetic disorders in caucasians of Northern European descent, affecting approximately 30 000 children and adults living in the United States, today. Complications of this chronic disease result in deterioration of lung function and development of pancreatic abnormalities requiring pharmacological therapy and may include patients seeking complementary and alternative option for treatment. Health care professionals should be knowledgeable of these therapies to effectively provide education and drug therapy management. This article offers an overview of the most common complementary therapies in cystic fibrosis such as vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, omega 3 fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), garlic, ginseng, and curcumin.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common autosomal homozygous recessive genetic disorders in caucasians of Northern European descent; affected individuals inherit a copy of the defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (<italic>CTFR</italic>) gene from each parent. CF affects approximately 30 000 children and adults living in the United States and as many as one in 20 caucasians in the United States are suspected to be a symptom-free carrier. On average, close to 1000 new patients are diagnosed with CF every year, with a median survival age of around 35 years.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012466043">1</xref>
            </sup> Detection of CF is now more prevalent because a majority of the US states require newborns to be tested allowing earlier treatment.</p>
         <p>CF primarily affects function of the patient’s lungs and digestive system.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012466043">2</xref>
            </sup> Abnormally thick mucus, a hallmark of CF, accumulates in the bronchi resulting in numerous infections of the airways. Chronic infections lead to the development of inflammatory responses which eventually cause a decline in respiratory function. This decline is a result of progressive lung damage due to inflammatory oxidative stress. Approximately 85% of CF patients will also experience gastrointestinal complications, in particular, pancreatic function abnormalities, which can vary in severity ranging from problems with intestinal absorption to diabetes mellitus. Inadequate production of pancreatic enzymes often leads to malabsorption of fats and proteins frequently causing abdominal pain, steatorrhea, and constipation. Pancreatic insufficiency in children leads to poor growth and nutritional status, and often an overall failure to thrive. Adult CF patients are also often underweight and exhibit nutritional deficiencies.</p>
         <p>Many parents of children with CF, as well as adult CF patients, use or are interested in exploring complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatment options. In the study exploring the use of CAM among pediatric CF patients from 2008, it was determined that 75% of patients used CAM in addition to their regular treatment.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012466043">3</xref>
            </sup> In order for a health care professional to work in tandem with the patient, it is important to be familiar with these treatment options.</p>
         <sec id="section2-0897190012466043">
            <title>Antioxidants in CF</title>
            <p>Patients with CF often exhibit signs of oxidative stress, especially in their respiratory system, potentially due to the chronic process of inflammation as well as recurrent respiratory infections. Additionally, poor absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, especially vitamins A and E, which are known to be powerful antioxidants, provides strong rationale to supplement with these agents. Many studies have investigated the effect of antioxidants in the past 5 years, especially with focus on vitamins A (including beta carotene), C, and E, as well as the trace element zinc, in connection with CF.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012466043">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012466043">5</xref>
               </sup>
            </p>
            <p>Vitamin A and beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A) have been thought to play an important role in the immune response.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012466043">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012466043">5</xref>
               </sup> In a 2001 study by Renner et al, CF patients received 1 mg/kg/d (up to 50 mg/d) of beta carotene for 3 months, followed by 10 mg/d of beta carotene for an additional 3-month period.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012466043">6</xref>
               </sup> During the entire length of the study (during the therapeutic intervention), changes in patients’ plasma beta carotene levels were monitored. The antioxidant levels increased as hypothesized, and a statistically significant decrease in the number of days of treatment with systemic antibiotics was noted in the group receiving 1 mg/kg/d of beta carotene supplementation. This study showed clinical benefit to the use of beta carotene and vitamin A in CF patients.</p>
            <p>In a study performed by Wood et al, biomarkers of oxidative stress as well as respiratory performance were used to measure the outcomes of patient interventions.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012466043">7</xref>
               </sup> To produce a baseline, each patient in the study went through a 4-week washout period utilizing low-dose supplements containing 500 mcg of vitamin A and 10 mg of vitamin E. Half of the study group then received high-dose supplements of vitamin E (200 mg/d), vitamin C (300 mg/d), and vitamin A (500 mcg/d) for 8 weeks. The other half continued receiving the low-dose supplementation (from the baseline study portion) described above for 8 weeks. No changes in oxidative stress levels were found; however, the patients’ overall lung function showed slight improvement. Therefore, direct correlation between the levels of antioxidants and respiratory performance test result trends could not be made.</p>
            <p>Sagel et al examined the use of the antioxidant-rich multivitamin supplement AquADEK<sup>TM</sup> in pediatric CF patients.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012466043">8</xref>
               </sup> This product contains high amounts of a variety of antioxidants (including vitamins A, C, E, and zinc) as well as other micronutrients. The results of the study showed increased levels of circulating antioxidants and modest improvements in patients’ pulmonary function. Weight increase was also noted. There was no statistically significant decrease in oxidative stress.</p>
            <p>In 2007, a small study explored the use of zinc supplements in 25 CF pediatric patients.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012466043">9</xref>
               </sup> The results showed a reduction in the average days of oral antibiotic usage in patients who received 30 mg/d of zinc supplementation and those who were showing inadequate zinc levels prior to the study.</p>
            <p>Overall, the results of the studies examining the impact of antioxidant supplements on CF patients’ health vary. A wide range of outcome measures were used to evaluate the effects of antioxidant therapy in CF patients, ranging from monitoring levels of inflammatory stress indicators and circulating antioxidant levels to clinical outcomes, such as number of days of antibiotic consumption, lung function performance, and mortality. Randomization techniques and blinding were not adequate in many of the experiments introducing potential bias. Some minor improvements in pulmonary function were noted but they were modest at best. Of note, large doses of fat-soluble vitamins raise concerns with toxicity. If the patient decides to use high-potency supplements, it is imperative to monitor them for signs and symptoms of toxicity and educate the patient appropriately. Currently there is no evidence that would support the use of antioxidants as an effective way of managing the disease.</p>

            <title>Nutrition in CF</title>
            <p>Nutrition in patients with CF is of utmost importance because of an increased risk for malnutrition. CF causes an increase in the thickness of the mucus with devastating effects on the pulmonary and gastrointestinal systems.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012466043">10</xref>
               </sup> Mucus plugs obstruct the pancreatic ducts leading to destruction of the acinar pancreatic tissue. The resulting pancreatic insufficiency causes a decrease in the ability of the pancreas to secrete pancreatic enzymes and bicarbonate into the duodenum.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012466043">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190012466043">12</xref>
               </sup> Malabsorption of nutrients, especially fats, and inadequate nutritional intake lead to malnutrition that correlates with pulmonary progression of the disease and premature morbidity in patients with CF.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012466043">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012466043">14</xref>
               </sup>
            </p>
            <p>CF patients should consume 120% to 150% of the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for energy expenditure, with 40% coming from fat.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012466043">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012466043">15</xref>
               </sup> Patients should be instructed to eat 3 meals and 2 high-fat snacks daily. Several studies have shown that children with CF fail to meet the dietary recommendations for energy and fat content, therefore patients should be educated on appropriate caloric intake and goals, affording the patient the opportunity to be an active participant in their nutritional therapy.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012466043">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012466043">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012466043">16</xref>

            </p>
            <p>Nutritional supplements such as omega 3 fatty acids have been integrated into the treatment of some CF patients since essential fatty acid deficiency may play an important role in the pulmonary and gastrointestinal symptoms and progression of CF.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012466043">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190012466043">19</xref>
               </sup> In 2006, Lloyd-Still et al performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 20 CF patients to investigate the potential role of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega 3 fatty acid, and fatty acid imbalances in CF.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190012466043">20</xref>
               </sup> The study investigated the bioavailability and safety of a large dose of DHA and its effects on lung function. Patients were given 50 mg/kg of DHA or placebo for 6 months. A significant increase in plasma, erythrocyte, and rectal DHA levels was reported (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), along with a decrease in arachidonic acid (AA). No effect on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was identified in these patients. The natural algal triacylglycerol DHA was well tolerated, with no significant adverse effects.</p>
            <p>Van Biervliet et al performed a long-term, double-blind, prospective trial to study the effects of DHA supplementation on the clinical outcome of CF.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190012466043">21</xref>
               </sup> Patients were randomized to receive either an oil-rich algal DHA supplement or sunflower oil (plant for omega 3 and 6) for 1 year. Forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1, anthropometrics, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and serum phospholipid fatty acid status were periodically evaluated throughout the study period. Patients in the DHA treatment group had a statistically significant increase in DHA and EPA in serum phospholipids as compared to patients in the control group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .02). No significant differences were noted with regard to anthropometrics, FVC, FEV1, ESR, or IgG; and 2 patients reported a fishy aftertaste in the DHA group.</p>
            <p>Since chronic inflammation plays a major role in lung deterioration in CF patients, Olveira et al undertook a 1 year observational study to assess the changes in respiratory, inflammatory, and nutritional parameters after a 1 year course of fatty acid supplementation.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190012466043">22</xref>
               </sup> Seventeen patients with CF received daily fatty acid supplements which included eicosapentaenoic (EPA; 54 mg), DHA (36 mg), linoleic acid (LA; 80 mg), gamma LA (43 mg), and vitamin E (10 mg). A significant increase in both FEV1 and FVC with a total decrease in pulmonary exacerbation (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) was seen at the study conclusion. Statistically significant differences were also noted in lean body mass and arm muscle circumference as compared to baseline (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Other study findings included an increase in DHA (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .012) and LA (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .021) along with a decrease in AA (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .01) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .003). No significant adverse effects were reported.</p>
            <p>Results from available published clinical trials of omega fatty acids varied greatly, necessitating the need for larger multicenter trials as confirmed by the 2010 Cochrane Database review of omega 3 fatty acids from fish oils for CF.<sup>

         <title>Herbal Remedies in CF</title>
         <p>The popularity of herbal medications requires appraisal of published literature to discern benefit in CF patients. Herb use in CF is based upon the belief of their antioxidant and/or antimicrobial activity, with garlic, ginseng, and curcumin being the most frequently reviewed in the literature.<sup>

            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Garlic has been known for its medicinal properties throughout history.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0897190012466043">24</xref>
            </sup> Allicin, the main medically active ingredient of garlic, is also believed to have antibacterial effect. Even Louis Pasteur, the founding father of microbiology, examined and documented the antibacterial effects of garlic in the mid-1800s. About 60% of CF patients have chronic infections caused by <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, resulting in frequent acute outbreaks of chronic pulmonary infection…. Smyth et al examined the effects of garlic on FEV<sub>1</sub> in CF patients having chronic <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> infection. CF patients who received garlic capsules showed marginal improvement in lung function, but the study group was too small (26 patients) to show any statistical significance of the data.</p>
         <p>Ginseng is thought to have an antioxidant effect, antimicrobial and immune modulating effects. The antimicrobial activity of ginseng was examined by Alipour et al in their recent study examining in vitro ginseng effects on <italic>P aeruginosa</italic>.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0897190012466043">25</xref>
            </sup> The results showed that aqueous extract of ginseng was effective in inhibiting growth of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic>, including strains that were antibiotic resistant. Limitations of the study include no reporting of in vivo concentrations needed to be effective and other published literature is limited to animal studies.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0897190012466043">26</xref>
            </sup> Therefore, ginsengs clinical utility remains unclear.</p>
         <p>Curcumin belongs to the family of Indian turmeric spice and is part of the ginger family. Its antioxidant properties have just recently been examined.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0897190012466043">27</xref>
            </sup> Controversial data suggest curcumin playing a role in increasing CFTR-regulated channel activity in patients with CF. CFTR is a protein responsible for ion transfer across the epithelial cellular membrane. Its dysfunction (due to genetic mutation in CF) leads to the development of CF symptoms. A study in 2005 found that curcumin-stimulated CFTR, suggesting its therapeutic use in the treatment of CF. However, further studies are needed to further explore this proposed mechanism of curcumin and its role in CF treatment.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>CF is a genetic disease that affects the pulmonary and gastrointestinal systems. This progressive disease results in chronic lung infections, lung function deterioration, pancreatic insufficiency, malabsorption, and malnutrition. Complementary and alternative therapies, such as antioxidants, omega 3 fatty acids, and herbal products have been used by CF patients in the management of their disease. These patients should be educated on these treatments and monitored for any potential side effects. Further multicenter trials are needed to determine the efficacy of nutritional supplements and herbal products in CF patients.</p>
