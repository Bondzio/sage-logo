<p><italic>Background</italic>. Ankle fractures in diabetics are challenging to treat, and only generalized clinical guidelines specific to their treatment exist. As such, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) membership was polled regarding the management of different types of ankle fractures in this patient population. <italic>Methods</italic>. We developed a multiple-choice survey with 3 clinical scenarios involving diabetic ankle fractures that was sent via e-mail to the 895 active members of the AOFAS. In addition to providing demographic information, respondents identified their preferred stabilization method, the need for supplemental fixation, and each patient’s weight-bearing status. <italic>Results</italic>. Respondents’ number of years in practice, number of ankle fractures treated monthly, and type of fellowship training did not correlate with management strategies. Enhanced fixation with syndesmotic screws was advocated in the setting of displaced fractures without syndesmotic injury, while casting was selected as the treatment for those that were nondisplaced. Prolonged periods of non–weight bearing were chosen by survey participants in all cases. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. We identified several treatment trends among AOFAS membership regarding ankle fractures in diabetics. However, it is pivotal that further investigation evaluate both optimal fixation strategies and the factors that influence surgeon decision making in the setting of diabetic ankle fractures, as the orthopaedic surgeon is encountering such patients more than ever before.</p>

<p>The incidence of diabetes mellitus continues to rise, with up to 1 in 3 American adults predicted to have diabetes by 2050.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640013477132">1</xref></sup> Currently, approximately 21 million Americans (1 in 10 American adults) are afflicted with the disease and another 54 million adults and children are on the verge of being diagnosed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640013477132">2</xref></sup> Additionally, the management of diabetes is projected to account for 10% of total health care spending, or approximately $500 billion annually by 2020.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640013477132">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The systemic complications of diabetes are vast and include blindness, dialysis-dependent kidney disease, stroke, and heart disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640013477132">4</xref></sup> Diabetes also complicates the treatment of other conditions and injuries that occur independently of uncontrolled hyperglycemia, such as ankle fractures.</p>
<p>Diabetic patients with ankle fractures have been found to have significantly higher rates of in-hospital mortality, postoperative complication rates, and length of stay as compared with those without diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640013477132">4</xref></sup> The perioperative complications are well described and include impaired wound healing, infection, malunion, delayed union, nonunion, and Charcot arthropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640013477132">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640013477132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640013477132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640013477132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640013477132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640013477132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640013477132"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640013477132">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite extensive orthopaedic literature pertaining to the diabetic foot and ankle, only generalized clinical guidelines specific to the treatment of diabetic ankle fractures exist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640013477132">13</xref></sup> As such, we polled members of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) regarding their preferred management of different types of ankle fractures in this patient population. The goal of this study was to use the experience and practice methods of the AOFAS membership as that of an expert panel, hoping to identify any trends in treatment.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>We developed a multiple-choice survey that was ultimately approved by our hospital’s institutional review board. The 895 active members of the AOFAS were then notified of the study by e-mail. This e-mail included a link to the survey, which was accessible online through the SurveyMonkey Web site. Two e-mail reminders were sent to ensure the greatest possible response rate.</p>
<p>Survey recipients answered demographic questions pertaining to their number of years in practice, type of fellowship training, and number of ankle fractures treated monthly. Three clinical scenarios with associated questions followed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640013477132">Figure 1</xref>). All cases involved diabetics with ankle fractures. The questions pertained to preferred stabilization methods, the need for supplemental fixation, and the patient’s weight-bearing status. Responses were entered automatically and anonymously into an online database maintained by SurveyMonkey.</p>

<p>Questions regarding the treatment of each ankle fracture were assessed with the survey. Twelve primary stabilization options were presented to the participants. These choices were then subdivided into more generalized groups: nonoperative treatment, standard open reduction internal fixation (ORIF), and enhanced fixation (ORIF &amp;0x002B; syndesmotic fixation; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1938640013477132">Table 2</xref>). Choices regarding the duration of non–weight bearing following stabilization were 4 to 8 weeks, 8 to 12 weeks, 4 to 6 months, and more than 6 months. When asked about the use of supplemental fixation, survey participants chose between ankle spanning external fixation, tibio-talar Steinman pins, and none necessary.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The effective management of the diabetic ankle fracture can be a challenging task, as these injuries are susceptible to complications. The clinical recommendations, set forth by Wukich and Kline,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640013477132">13</xref></sup> state that there is fair evidence supporting the treatment of unstable fractures with standard open reduction and internal fixation techniques, insufficient evidence to advocate for or against supplemental fixation in diabetics with neuropathy, and fair evidence to advocate for a prolonged period of non-weight bearing postoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640013477132">12</xref></sup> Unfortunately, these recommendations are noncommittal, a function of the conflicting orthopaedic literature on this topic.</p>
<p>Although some advocate for nonoperative management of diabetic ankle fractures, others are strong supporters of early and aggressive surgical intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640013477132">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640013477132">10</xref></sup> In a study by McCormack and Leith<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640013477132">10</xref></sup> comparing nonoperative and operative treatment of ankle fractures in diabetic patients, 47% of the surgically treated patients developed complications, versus none in the conservatively treated group. The authors concluded that surgical intervention in this setting, particularly if the individuals are low demand and elderly, leads to poor outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640013477132">10</xref></sup> Diabetic ankle fractures were also studied by Kristiansen, who reported a 60% surgical infection rate in such patients treated by open reduction and internal fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640013477132">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Conversely, Connolly and Csencsitz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640013477132">8</xref></sup> described significant complications, such as infection resulting in amputation, malunion, and Charcot neuropathy, in diabetic ankle fractures treated with casting. These authors thus advocate early surgical intervention in patients with diabetes and ankle fractures. Schon and Marks also support operative management of displaced ankle fractures in diabetics, as all displaced fractures treated with closed reduction and casting in their study went on to either a nonunion or malunion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640013477132">15</xref></sup> This recommendation was made despite the authors experiencing complications in their surgical cohort as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640013477132">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The suboptimal outcomes and complications seen with all treatment modalities cannot be refuted and have prevented the development of any one reference or consensus statement that provides a concise and evidence-based treatment algorithm supporting nonsurgical or surgical intervention in diabetic ankle fractures. It is this great ambiguity in treatment recommendations that facilitated the development of a survey evaluating the management practices of AOFAS members in regard to diabetic ankle fractures, as based on patient and fracture characteristics, as well as specific demographic data.</p>
<p>Responses to the survey provided significant information and stimulated further questions for future study. Given how conflicting the literature is on diabetic ankle fractures, it was surprising to observe a consensus among the majority of respondents pertaining to management strategies, especially fixation choice. Admittedly, we expected respondents to select a longer period of non–weight bearing for these patients, as this is one management component in which the literature is fairly consistent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640013477132">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640013477132">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The treatment of nondisplaced ankle fractures in diabetics is controversial, particularly when these patients have concomitant neuropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640013477132">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640013477132">14</xref></sup> Charcot arthropathy can develop following even nondisplaced fractures, and those with preexisting neuropathy at an increased risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640013477132">16</xref></sup> It was therefore unexpected that 79% would select to treat the patient in case 1 with only a cast.</p>
<p>Enhanced fixation was selected by the majority of respondents in cases 2 and 3, despite no evidence of a syndesmotic injury (59% and 79%, respectively). In case 2, no consensus existed among respondents regarding the type of fibular plate to use with the enhanced fixation. However, in case 3, the small fragment locking plate was selected by 56% of survey participants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1938640013477132">Table 4</xref>). This is likely due to the case 3 patient’s neuropathy and presumed poor bone quality, factors that would support the use of a locked construct. Because osteopenia and osteoporosis are concerns when dealing with diabetic patients, enhanced fixation with fibula-tibia syndesmotic screws has become increasingly more popular, just as it has in those without diabetes but poor bone quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640013477132">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>We considered syndesmotic screws in the absence of syndesmotic injury as an enhanced type of open reduction and internal fixation, and it is possibly because of this that the majority of respondents felt that no additional, or supplemental, fixation was required in cases 2 and 3. In studies investigating supplemental fixation, syndesmotic screws are often grouped with external fixation and transarticular fixation with large Steinman pins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640013477132">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938640013477132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938640013477132"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938640013477132">20</xref></sup> Therefore, our survey participants might have only answered our question regarding supplemental fixation as unnecessary because it had already been achieved with syndesmotic screws in our enhanced fixation category. This is one limitation of our study.</p>
<p>We achieved a 23% response rate from AOFAS members. Although this is similar to the response rates reported in other orthopaedic survey studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938640013477132">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938640013477132">22</xref></sup> more respondents would have further ensured that answer selections accurately represent the AOFAS membership.</p>
<p>Because current literature has failed to identify a “gold-standard” approach to the fixation of ankle fractures in diabetics, we attempted to determine management trends among AOFAS membership. Respondents’ number of years in practice, number of ankle fractures treated monthly, and type of fellowship training did not correlate with management strategies. Enhanced fixation with syndesmotic screws was advocated in the setting of displaced fractures, while casting was selected as the treatment for those that were nondisplaced. Prolonged periods of non–weight bearing were chosen by survey participants in all cases. This is a cross-sectional study that identifies several treatment trends among AOFAS membership regarding ankle fractures in diabetics. However, it is pivotal that further investigation evaluate both optimal fixation strategies and the factors that influence surgeon decision making in the setting of diabetic ankle fractures, as the orthopaedic surgeon is encountering such patients more than ever before.</p>
