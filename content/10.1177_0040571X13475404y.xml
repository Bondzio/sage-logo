<p>Fifty years after his death, C. S. Lewis remains a luminary in both the literary and religious firmaments. Lewis had little expectation of being remembered after his death in 1963, and would probably have been somewhat surprised by the new surge of interest in his writings. The fiftieth anniversary of Lewis’s death is certain to lead to a surge of publications celebrating and critiquing Lewis’s achievements. Although there is growing scholarly interest in Lewis’s works of Christian apologetics and literary criticism, recent big-budget movies have ensured that the Chronicles of Narnia remain his best-known and most widely read works.</p>
<p>While preparing my own small contributions to this anniversary (a new biography of Lewis and a series of studies assessing his broader intellectual significance), I came across recordings of three lectures on Narnia given by Rowan Williams, then Archbishop of Canterbury, in Canterbury Cathedral during Holy Week 2011. I had never considered Williams to be an authority on Lewis. As I listened to those addresses, however, I found my own understanding of Lewis illuminated and challenged by someone who clearly knew Lewis, and had thought long and hard about him. Williams brought to his reading of the Chronicles of Narnia the language of a poet and the discernment of a professional theologian, offering angles of vision and theological judgements that expanded my vision of Lewis – and, I suspect, that of many who gathered in Canterbury Cathedral in April 2011. Those three lectures, now expanded and revised into six chapters, form the substance of <italic>The Lion’s World</italic>.</p>
<p>Williams does not offer a detailed theological analysis and critique of the Chronicles of Narnia. His concern is to allow Lewis to inspire his readers to discover and experience the ‘simple intensity of feeling about God’ (p. ix) which lies at the heart of Lewis’s literary vision. What does it <italic>feel like</italic> to believe in God? In exploring this question, Williams focuses on three related themes: the exhilaration of an encounter with a transcendent ‘other’; the need to recognize and counter self-delusion; and the sheer delight of discovering God. <italic>The Lion’s World</italic> is best read as one intelligent and reflective reader’s account of what he discovered in Narnia, and an invitation to his readers to go further into its spiritual and moral landscape.</p>
<p>‘I can only confess’, Williams remarked, ‘to being repeatedly humbled and reconverted by Lewis in a way that is true of few other modern Christian writers’ (p. xi). As I read Williams, I found myself both appreciating aspects of Lewis that I had overlooked or failed to appreciate properly and challenged to develop the imaginative vision of my own faith. One of the reasons why I so appreciated this work was its ability to help me to read Lewis in new ways. Williams suggests that Narnia offers us an imaginative recalibration of faith. ‘The point of Narnia is to help us rinse out what is stale in our thinking about Christianity – which is almost everything’ (p. 28). To read Lewis – especially through the eyes of such a skilled theological and literary guide – is to recapture the vibrancy and potency of faith.</p>
<p>Lewis, of course, is a controversial figure. As Williams slyly remarked, ‘not every reader has been charmed’ (p. 1) by Narnia. While offering his own rich and visionary interpretation of Lewis, Williams also engages with Lewis’s critics, particularly Philip Pullman’s somewhat formulaic concerns about Lewis’s sexism and racism. Some readers will feel that there is a slackening of narrative pace at this point in Williams’s discussion that may leave them impatient to get on with the exploration of Narnia’s themes. However, Williams needs to be heard at this point. He rightly concedes that there are unquestionably genuine concerns about Lewis’s cultural attitudes which require to be addressed, particularly concerning his attitudes towards women. Yet Williams also points out how Lewis, while inevitably being shaped by the views of his own age, nevertheless ‘qualifies or undercuts them’ in response to ‘a spiritual imperative’ (p. 46).</p>
<p>While many will welcome this work as a rich and rewarding interpretation of Lewis, its most significant achievement may well be to subvert the contempt in which Lewis has been held by many professional theologians. Williams confirms what many have long suspected – that Lewis’s writings are open to serious and rewarding theological analysis. Fifty years after his death, Lewis is finally being taken seriously as a theologian. The outcome of this development can only be positive.</p>
