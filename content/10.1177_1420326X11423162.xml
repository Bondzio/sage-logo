<abstract>
<p>Over the past 30 years, Korea has adopted structural frames with bearings for apartment buildings. The unit planning flexibility of such a structural system is inadequate, when compared to the column-beam system. The system would allow renovation easily and would provide various other legal benefits to constructors in Korea. For this reason, a column-beam system, named by green frame (GF), implemented with composite precast concrete (PC) members was previously developed. However, since the scheme would require a performance improvement to increase its economic effects and constructability, a further improved system has been developed. In the case of structural construction, it is a construction process that emits the most CO<sub>2</sub>. Along with the constructability and economic feasibility of a construction system, a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> is also critical. The purpose of this paper was to analyze the CO<sub>2</sub>-reduction effect of the improved system constructed with enhanced composite PC members. The improved system would greatly contribute to CO<sub>2</sub> reduction with an average of 25.0% as compared with the bearing wall structure; and 2.8% compared to the existing GF.</p></abstract>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11423162" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The construction sector in Korea accounts for 30% of the total CO<sub>2</sub> emission, which is one of the major greenhouse gases that could be contributing to the climate change. In the construction industry, structural construction is the process with the highest emission of CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11423162">1</xref>]. Many countries have increased efforts to reduce greenhouse gases. Such efforts have led to the construction of green buildings throughout the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11423162">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11423162">5</xref>]. In Korea, an energy performance score calculated based on the “Housing Performance Rating System” is regarded as an unexpected expense when considering apartment sales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11423162">6</xref>]. The country is actively seeking to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by introducing “Act of the construction and performance evaluation of environment-friendly apartment buildings” and arranging “Clause of the energy saving design and construction criteria of apartment buildings”.</p>
<p>The domestic construction industry has been constructing buildings with bearing wall structures to apartment buildings for the past 30 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11423162">1</xref>]. Since the bearing wall structure lacks unit changeability, a significant amount of dismantling or reinforcing of structures must be performed when a building requires renovation due to deterioration and a change in lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11423162">2</xref>]. As a result, most residents would prefer rebuilding to renovation. Rebuilding would generate a significant amount of waste since all the structural frames are demolished. Rebuilding could also waste a tremendous amount of resources. It is expected that 70% of all construction wastes generated in 2020 will be due to rebuilding. To resolve this problem, a flat plate structure that would enable the rebuilding of apartment buildings has been developed over the past few years and this has been reflected in various designs of recent Korean housing. However, the earthquake-resistant performance of the flat plate structure is generally weak and would generate a significant amount of CO<sub>2</sub> and embodied energy cost due to an increase in the quantity of rebar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11423162">1</xref>].</p>
<p>To solve the above problem, the government has enforced an incentive system that would allow builders to increase the height and volume of a building by using a column-beam structure; a structure that would allow a changeable unit configuration is now widely applied to the underground parking lot of apartment buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11423162">7</xref>]. The column-beam structure is advantageous due to its changeable unit configuration, constructability and quality assurance but the system would increase the floor height and construction cost under the condition of keeping the same ceiling height [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11423162">1</xref>]. To address the disadvantages of the column-beam structure, a study on developing the column-beam structure with composite precast concrete (PC) members was carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11423162">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11423162">8</xref>]. The developed green frame (GF) was an improvement on the bearing wall and flat plate structures. Through testing and simulation, the GF has been proven to be beneficial in terms of structural safety, constructability and economic feasibility. In addition, construction using the GF technology could lead to a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to a decrease in the input of resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11423162">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11423162">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Regarding the GF, issues related to the complex joint between the column and the beam, and the rebar of the beam that penetrates the steel columns must be solved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11423162">11</xref>]. A system that addresses GF-related problems must be developed and an enhanced structural system should be devised with an adequate consideration to economic feasibility, constructability and environmental friendliness. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the CO<sub>2</sub>-reduction effect of an enhanced GF, a column-beam structure that comprised of the enhanced composite PC members. Structural construction with enhanced GFs can be applied to all general buildings but the focus of this study was on apartment buildings, which comprise most of the domestic construction sector. This study has emphasized the technology needed to reduce the effects of global warming resulting from CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The enhanced GF is expected to be a key technology contributing towards low-carbon and green growth that would encourage energy reduction in Korea, where 50,000 apartment buildings are built annually.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X11423162"><title>Comparison of Structure Types</title>
<p>Currently, the structural systems used in apartment buildings in Korea are bearing wall and flat plate structures. However, a change in the structural system of apartment buildings is inevitable due to the various technical, economic and environmental advantages of composite PC members. An analysis of the advantages/disadvantages of various structural systems is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11423162">Table 1</xref>.

</p>
<p>The bearing wall structure consists of a bearing wall and a slab. In terms of quantity of resources, the bearing wall structure uses more materials that compose the frame when compared to other structural systems. It needs 4.9 m<sup>2</sup> of form, 57.2 kg of rebar and 0.62 m<sup>3</sup> of concrete per unit floor area as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11423162">Table 1</xref>. This leads to a high emission of CO<sub>2</sub> due to the use of more resources than other structural systems. The construction time per floor would be at least 7 days, and more noise and vibration between floors would be generated. In addition, since the space is not changeable, the life of the structure cannot be fully utilized. However, the bearing wall structure has some advantages in that it is a verified technology with technical and structural stability based on 30 years of construction usage.</p>
<p>The flat plate structure consists of a column, slab and non-bearing walls. In terms of quantity of resources, the flat plate structure is similar to the bearing wall structure. It needs 3.93 m<sup>2</sup> of form, 63.5 kg of rebar and 0.58 m<sup>3</sup> of concrete per unit floor area as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11423162">Table 1</xref>. The construction time per floor based on this structure would be at least 6 days, and the floor height can be reduced when compared to the column-beam structure. The spacing of the flat plate structure is changeable in comparison to the bearing wall structure. However, the flat plate structure would require a large quantity of rebar due to the increase in the slab thickness and lower earthquake-resistance performance without sufficient steel reinforcement. This structural system is called the effect of weak column and strong beam, when compared to the bearing wall structure. The flat plate structure also requires the reinforcement of punching shear near the capital of columns.</p>
<p>The column-beam structure with composite PC members consists of a column, beam and slab. The structure would require less resources, 0.12 m<sup>2</sup> of form, 41.7 kg of rebar and 0.47 m<sup>3</sup> of concrete per unit floor area, than the other structures described above. A summary of the structures is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11423162">Table 1</xref>. The incorporation of composite PC members can lead to cost savings of about 2 ∼ 10% of structural work when compared to the cost for a bearing wall structure. The construction time per floor would be 3 or 4 days depending on the in situ reinforced concrete (RC) work of core area adopted for the apartment building. When assuming a 20-floor construction project, about 40 ∼ 60 days can be saved and overhead costs (e.g., construction management cost and project finance expense) can be reduced. In terms of spatial division, it is easy to adjust the column intervals with PC members and flexible unit planning would be possible. With the adoption of column-beam structure, the volume and height limits of buildings are legally 20% alleviated. The constructability and quality would be assured with the use of PC, and 20–30% of CO<sub>2</sub> emission and more than 80% of construction wastes would be reduced when compared to other structural systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11423162">11</xref>].</p>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X11423162"><title>Green Frame</title>
<p>A GF is a combination of a RC structure and a steel structure. It is manufactured using PC so as to improve quality and productivity. Diagrams showing the concept of GF are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11423162">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11423162">2</xref>. In the case of a green beam (GB), the upper flange that contributes less to the bending moment based on a preliminary study of H-Shape Steel is removed. This would reduce the steel quantity and ensures the efficiency of materials. The GB system is superior in terms of a reduction in material quantity, construction cost and CO<sub>2</sub> emission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11423162">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11423162">10</xref>]. When a GB is applied on the ground, the floor height can be reduced. The application of a GB underground would reduce the amount of excavation needed. Furthermore, a GB can be used not only with a green column (GC) but also with steel and RC columns.
<fig id="fig1-1420326X11423162" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Concept of a green beam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11423162">2</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11423162-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig2-1420326X11423162" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Concept of a green column [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11423162">10</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11423162-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>A GC is a composite PC column where a joint is made between a 1 ∼ 3 story RC column and steel. When a GC is connected to a GB, the top rebar of the GB penetrates the steel joint of the column to join the RC frame and the lower steel can be joined to the steel frame via fastening with bolts and welding. Thus, when a GB and GC are applied together for a joint, structural stability is ensured, constructability is enhanced and the construction time is reduced.</p>
<p>When a GF is applied to apartment buildings, it can maintain both the flexible spatial division and the lower floor height, which are the characteristics of the structure. The constructability can be improved by adopting the hybrid coupling method. In addition, the use of composite PC members can minimize the forming process, which reduces manpower and construction time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11423162">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11423162">Figure 3</xref> are three types of GC connection methods: sleeve type, column-pre-installation coupler type and column-post-installation coupler type. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11423162">Table 2</xref>, it is difficult to adjust the verticality and in the case of the column-pre-installation method, the safety issue would be compromised. In the case of the coupler type, there are difficulties pertaining to the joint part and would prolong the installation time. Furthermore, if there are construction errors occurring, the problem would not be able to be solved on site. In the case of the sleeve-type method, the column is installed and then compressed mortar is used to connect the upper column hole and the lower column rebar. Such a process would increase the cost, yet due to the PC is produced in a factory, quality can be assured.

<p>Bolts and welding are used for GB coupling. One issue that arises when installing a GB is that it would require a hole in the steel column in order to receive the top rebar to be connected to the steel columns at the other side of the material. The hole is made so as to be wider than the diameter of the rebar when considering the deformed rebar shape. However, the constructability is reduced during the installation. Some of the areas for improvement in the GF are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X11423162">Table 3</xref>. An enhanced GF is developed to solve these problems.

<sec id="sec4-1420326X11423162"><title>Enhanced Green Frame</title>
<p>The concept of an enhanced GF is the same as that of a GF. An enhanced GF consists of an enhanced GB and an enhanced GC. An enhanced GB having different section and arrangement of steel from the existing GF is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11423162">Figure 4</xref>. The beam end is the column joint part and the beam end’s negative moment section is arranged with T-shaped steel so as to optimize the bolt joints and the joint load transfer mechanism. Shape steel is removed from the centre of the beam, which is instead organized with lower rebar and concrete. This would thus minimize the use of steel, which in turn would lead to a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emission. There are a total of 12 types of enhanced GB compositions combined with 4 shape steels for arranging the end’s negative moment section and 3 shape steels for arranging the central moment section. In this study, the T.T type of enhanced GB was examined.
<fig id="fig4-1420326X11423162" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Typical type of enhanced green beam.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11423162-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The composition of an enhanced GC is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11423162">Figure 5</xref>. The column is composed of three floors and one story, in which the structural mechanism is the same as in the GC. The materials are installed by fastening bolts. When installing and joining an enhanced GC, the main bar of the lower column is connected to the upper column using a manufactured screw thread. This would not only ensure construction speed and convenience but would also reduce the time of using lifting equipment, resulting in a reduction in energy and CO<sub>2</sub> emission.
<fig id="fig5-1420326X11423162" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Type of enhanced green column [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11423162">11</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11423162-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The installation of an enhanced GF is as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11423162">Figure 6</xref>. A bolt connecting method is used to enhance the convenience of connecting the coupler-joined column part, which is reflected in the design. A comparison of the advantages/disadvantages of the enhanced GF and GF is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1420326X11423162">Table 4</xref>. Since the enhanced GF is temporarily installed by connecting bolts and the verticality could be adjusted for connection, there would be no effect on the installation and an easier adjustment of the frame angle is ensured. The column post-installation method is chosen so as to ensure constructability and safety. When installing the column upper bolt-type joint part, the plate holes can be adjusted to handle construction error, improving the construction precision and reducing the installation time. The quality of GCs is ensured with the enhanced GF through the use of PC manufactured in a factory.

<sec id="sec5-1420326X11423162"><title>Case Study</title>
<p>The purpose of this case study was to calculate the quantity of main materials used in the bearing wall structure and compare this with the amount used in the enhanced GF structure. To compare under equal condition of both structures, an apartment building was designed by the bearing wall and enhanced GF structure, respectively, and the material quantity of the typical floor of each structure was estimated. Based on the calculated quantities, the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emission that could be generated from each construction material was calculated so as to determine and compare the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that could be generated by the two structural systems.</p>
<p>The preconditions for calculating the material quantities were as follows:<list id="list1-1420326X11423162" list-type="order"><list-item><p>As there are little difference in materials used for construction of building foundation and underground structure, such as car-parking structure and community facilities, in both types of structure these were excluded for consideration. Only the quantity of ground materials was included for calculation for comparison and analysis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The quantity of building core structure comprising staircase, lift box, and corridor that is installed in the same manner is excluded from the calculation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The surface finishes of building elements, such as wall and floor are placed in the same manner in each structural type being considered and therefore not included in the calculation. As such, only the main materials of structural construction including the concrete, rebar, steel, form and wall partition were considered in the material quantity calculations.</p></list-item></list></p>
<sec id="sec6-1420326X11423162"><title>Calculation of Material Quantity</title>
<p>The material quantities calculated based on the design drawing are compared in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1420326X11423162">Table 5</xref>. In order to compare the concrete quantity, the structural materials were divided into those used for the wall, floor slab, column and beam. The quantity of wall concrete would be 157.78 m<sup>3</sup> for the bearing wall structure and 18.69 m<sup>3</sup> for the enhanced GF. The bearing wall structure would compose of bearing walls and would require about eight times more wall concrete than for the enhanced GF system, which only use concrete in the walls separating the households and the core. The quantity of concrete needed for the floor slab would be 139.93 m<sup>3</sup> and 81.21 m<sup>3</sup> for the bearing wall structure and the enhanced GF, respectively. About 1.7 times more concrete would be needed for the slab for the bearing wall structure than would be for the enhanced GF. The reason for the difference was that according to the Korean Government’s Act [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11423162">13</xref>], the bearing wall structure would require at least a 210 mm thick slab, whereas the enhanced GF would require only a 150 mm thick slab to satisfy the standard. The concrete quantity of column and beam would only require in the enhanced GF, so the total concrete quantity would be 297.71 m<sup>3</sup> for the bearing wall structure and 145.31 m<sup>3</sup> for the enhanced GF. Compared to the bearing wall structure, the use of enhanced GF system would allow builders to reduce material usage by about 51%.

</table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
<p>The quantity of rebar and steel frame in the structural types was calculated. Both the bearing wall structure and the enhanced GF would use 10 mm, 13 mm, 16 mm, 19 mm and 22 mm in diameter for the rebar. The quantity of rebar used in the typical floor of the bearing wall structure would be 23.131 tons, while 14.911 tons of rebar would be required for the typical floor by using the enhanced GF system. In the enhanced GF, steel frames would be used at the column and beam coupling part in order to realize efficient composite members. Thus, while there would be a reduction in the use of rebar in the enhanced GF to about 36% of that would be used in the bearing wall structure, however, 3.132 tons of steel frames would be needed for the enhanced GF. In total, 23.131 tons of steel products would be needed for the bearing wall structure and 18.043 tons in the enhanced GF. Therefore, a 22% reduction in the steel quantity would be realized when the enhanced GF is applied for the renovation in comparison to the bearing wall structure.</p>
<p>The quantities of materials used for the form and wall partitions were also compared. In the case of the bearing wall structure, a system form would be used. For the enhanced GF, a joint form at the column-beam joint part would be employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11423162">14</xref>]. The quantity of form would be 2033 m<sup>2</sup> for the bearing wall structure and 462 m<sup>2</sup> for the enhanced GF. In case of the enhanced GF, the internal wall would be installed by light weight partitions instead of forming in situ concrete. Thus, when using the enhanced GF, 77% of the form quantity would be reduced when compared to the bearing wall structure, however, an additional 343 m<sup>2</sup> of wall partition (gypsum board) would be required.</p>
<p>The overall quantity of concrete required would be reduced by about 51% when the enhanced GF was used. The thickness of the slab could be reduced to 150 mm with the enhanced GF due to the excellent anti-noise characteristics of column-beam structure, which would further reduce the dead load of the structure. Thus with a spiral effect, further reduction of the column and beam sizes would reduce the over-consumption of construction resources. Composite materials would be effectively applied in the enhanced GF, which would lead to about a 22% reduction in the quantity of rebar and steel frame. The reduction in the quantity of form in the enhanced GF would contribute to a reduction in both the construction time and manpower required for frame and carpentry works.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1420326X11423162"><title>Calculation of CO<sub>2</sub> Emission</title>
<p>The basic units of CO<sub>2</sub> emission per main material used when constructing apartment buildings are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1420326X11423162">Table 6</xref>. The main materials that would greatly contribute to CO<sub>2</sub> emission include the concrete, rebar, steel frame, form and wall partition (gypsum board).</p>
<p>The potential CO<sub>2</sub> emission of apartment buildings per structure was calculated based on the design drawing and is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1420326X11423162">Table 7</xref>. The CO<sub>2</sub> emission per unit area based on the use of concrete would be 99.5 kg-CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> for the bearing wall structure and 48.6 kg-CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> for the enhanced GF. The CO<sub>2</sub> emission per unit area would be reduced to less than 50% if enhanced GF was used. This was due to a reduction in the thickness of the floor slab since the columns and beams would be thinner and the noise-proof performance would be improved. This has illustrated the structural efficiency of the enhanced GF.</p>
<p>The calculation of CO<sub>2</sub> emission per unit area was based on the use of rebar and steel frame and this would be 220.4 kg-CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> for the bearing wall structure and 168.9 kg-CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> for the enhanced GF, showing a reduction by 23% of CO<sub>2</sub> emission when using the enhanced GF, due to the efficient arrangement of steel shapes.</p>
<p>The calculation of CO<sub>2</sub> emission per unit area based on the use of forms would be 18.5 kg-CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> for the bearing wall structure and 4.2 kg-CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> for the enhanced GF; illustrating a 77% reduction in the CO<sub>2</sub> emission when using the enhanced GF. Such a reduction was due to the use of PC manufactured in a factory, not concrete poured on site, and the use of wall partitions instead of a concrete walls (the wet construction method) to divide internal spaces. However, in case of the enhanced GF, wall partitions would be used for the internal space division of households, which could resulted in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 55.0 kg-CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> due to the gypsum board.

<p>In case of the GF, H-shaped steel (Type 1) and reverse T-shaped steel (Type 2) were used in the study. As a result, a higher quantity of structural steel would be used in the Type 1 GF than Type 2, generating more CO<sub>2</sub>, while the less quantity of rebar is used due to more steel flange. The opposite situation occurred for the Type 2 that has less quantity of structural steel and more rebar instead than Type 1. When considering this situation, the CO<sub>2</sub> emission per unit area of the Type 1 GF would be 302.9 kg-CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>−2</sup>, while that of the Type 2 GF would be 284.6 kg-CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>−2</sup>, about 82.6% and 77.10%, respectively, of the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted from the bearing wall structure.</p>
<p>In this study, the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emission per unit area of the bearing wall structure was found to be 366.1 kg-CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>−2</sup>. If this is compared with the 369.1 kg-CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> given by Hong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11423162">10</xref>], the error range would be within 1%, illustrating a reliable result. However, there is a significant difference in the CO<sub>2</sub> emission from each material, such as from the concrete and the rebar. This is because CO<sub>2</sub> would be emitted in an interaction with the concrete and the rebar, so the CO<sub>2</sub> emission of the entire structure, not merely a single material, should be considered.</p>
<p>If the CO<sub>2</sub> emission of the enhanced GF and that of the bearing wall structure are compared per materials composing the structure, a higher CO<sub>2</sub> emission of the enhanced GF would be expected due to the use of steel frame and wall partitions. However, with the enhanced GF, there would be a decrease in the use of concrete, rebar, form and the temporary material with a high basic unit; leading to a 24.4% reduction in the CO<sub>2</sub> emission when compared to the bearing wall structure.</p>
<p>When compared to the GF with the same structural concept, the enhanced GF system would require less quantity of concrete and the enhanced GB’s central part moment would be stabilised by the rebar arrangement, increasing the rebar quantity per unit area. Yet, the total amount of steel frame would be reduced, decreasing the overall use of steel. Compared with the GF, a reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2.8% could be achieved by using the enhanced GF, improving the constructability and economic feasibility of the renovation.</p></sec></sec>

<p>The column-beam structure would allow flexible planning of buildings and future renovation and refurbishment or alteration and would enhance constructability and quality. Yet, there are disadvantages due to a higher floor height and expensive construction cost. To solve these problems, a GF system constructed with the composite PC members has been developed and the usefulness of the system has been demonstrated. However, a new requirement to improve the safety and constructability has led to the development of the enhanced GF. The new structural system should be verified not only in terms of its economic feasibility and constructability but also its environmental friendliness. Thus, this study was undertaken to illustrate the CO<sub>2</sub> emission of the bearing wall structure and the enhanced GF.</p>
<p>The field-production technology of composite PC members could enable an additional reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emission due to a decrease in delivery costs since PC manufactured in a factory would not need to be transported, and would also ameliorate the use of temporary materials and reduces management costs. Furthermore, the enhancement in the constructability of the joint part of PC members would lead to less equipment usage when installing materials, resulting in a safer environment and further reduction in the use of temporary materials. While these advantages are expected to contribute to an additional CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, further analysis is required. In terms of production and installation, the application of enhanced GF would greatly contribute to CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. Some of the analyzed improvements due to the use of enhanced GF are as follows:<list id="list1-1420326X11423162" list-type="order"><list-item><p>When compared with the bearing wall structure, which is mostly used today, the enhanced GF would lead to an average CO<sub>2</sub> reduction of 25.0%.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When compared to the CO<sub>2</sub> emission per unit area of the existing GF, the use of enhanced GF would reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2.8%.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>If the enhanced GF was applied to apartment buildings, this would allow flexibility for renovation or alteration of the apartment and would extend the life of the structure. Also, when considering both the waste materials generated during the rebuilding of existing apartment buildings and the resource use, the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to the application of the enhanced GF would be greater than expected.</p></sec>
