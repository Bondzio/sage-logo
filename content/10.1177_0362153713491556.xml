<p>Presenting this new edition as a practical guide, the McLeods pleasantly surprised me by beginning the book with their clear, in-depth vision of the core of counseling as the foundation for all the varied aspects of the field. They work out in the rest of this useful and extensive book for counselors at all levels in many contexts the ideas of counseling as complementary (called <italic>embedded counseling</italic>) or primary (called <italic>specialist counseling</italic>). The authors explore what makes it possible for practitioners to be important in the lives of the people with whom they work as they seek “to explain some of the fundamental elements of their craft” (p. 2). By offering “a framework for understanding the skill of counselling” and “not the skill itself” (p. 9), they walk their talk in the way they describe the assumptions and ideas underlying their model of counseling.</p>
<p>Taking the social instead of psychological perspective—that is, seeing people as social coconstructive beings—the authors highlight the connectedness and solidarity between people and the cultural traditions within which they live. Their assumption is that the problem is not in the person’s mind, and therefore counseling is “not a matter of addressing deficits…or repairing or fixing a faulty mechanism within the self or psyche of the person” (p. 13) but a “business of working with the person to deal with real difficulties in the social world in which they live, and to locate the resources from within that world that they can use to make a difference” (p. 13).</p>
<p>Another basic assumption of this book is the idea of human agency: “the capacity of people to be intentional and active in constructing (in concert with others) the reality in which they live” (p. 14). This implies that individuals seeking help are active and purposeful in trying to resolve their problems so they can live a more satisfying life.</p>
<p>The McLeods choose a broadly narrative approach to illustrate how counseling helps people to remind themselves of their qualities and to emphasize these qualities in their thinking and practice. By using a narrative perspective, they underscore the importance of working with script: “A different way of talking can open up new possibilities for feeling and action…[thus] developing a more positive story about the self” (p. 5).</p>
<p>I like the way this book presents what the heart or central purpose of counseling is by explaining the words of the meaningful sentence “making a space to talk it through” (p. 5). The authors use this phrase throughout the book as a touchstone and reminder of the real role of counseling. “Making” implies that counseling is an intentional, purposeful, cocreative activity. “A space” stresses that counseling begins with an emotional safe haven and a space in the relationship between the counselor and counselee that has boundaries but “within [which]…there is nothing” (p. 7). “To talk” emphasizes that counseling is essentially about talking and that putting something into words can be meaning making and healing; exploring, naming, and mapping of the often vague “it” leads to “getting a handle on it” (Adult control) as well as to relief and options for problem solving and creativity. Last, but not least, to talk “it through” involves “being in a permissive space to talk” and invokes “a sense of movement through a landscape to arrive at another place” (p. 7). This meaningful sentence represents for me a relational as well as a spiritual understanding of counseling and emphasizes the existence of a relationship within which such a place can be created.</p>
<p>There is so much more in this book: perspectives on counseling skills and models, the importance of the organizational context and organizational issues in counseling, ethical principals and examples of ethical dilemmas, different theoretical frameworks and their perspectives on the counseling relationship, making sense of problematic reactions and resolving difficult emotions and situations, the counseling menu of goals/tasks/methods, working with cultural diversity, bereavement work, and much more, including a chapter on “The Transactional Analysis (TA) Approach to Making Sense of Relationship.”</p>
<p>To round out this review, I want to mention a few key characteristics the authors attribute to effective counselors: “Good counsellors are not made by training courses—they are made by life” (p. 16), and an important element for preparing someone for the counseling role is developing “sensitivity to the huge range of beliefs that exist about learning, change and healing” (p. 17). They also write that “sensitivity to the person’s helping belief system lies at the heart of competence in working with difference” (p. 18).</p>
<p>John and Julia McLeod do not present themselves as transactional analysis professionals, only explicitly use a small amount of TA to make sense of what happens in relationships, and poorly reference transactional analysis sources. However, the underlying assumptions, chosen perspectives, counseling skills, and menu of goals/tasks/methods in their model of counseling overlap considerably with TA’s definition and core competencies of counseling as well as with TA’s ethical principles.</p>
<p>By integrating many approaches, theories, and methods, the McLeods’ work transcends any school or modality and offers enormous possibilities for enrichment to all counselors and helping professionals, including trainees, trainers, and supervisors.</p>
