<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), perhaps more than any other, has generated a storm of controversy. This unprecedented reaction to the proposed changes to the DSM has curtailed some modifications while leaving others unaffected. One of the main arguments against the latest version of the DSM has been its expansion of categories and the potential increased medicalization of routine human experience. While arguments such as this are important, a more fundamental issue has been given much less attention. It is the DSM system of nosology that is critically flawed, rather than the specifics of any of its categories. The DSM approach to classifying mental disorders is simply the wrong way to understand human misery and distress, and calls have been made to abandon this method of categorization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213491994">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mental disorders are not like physical disorders and should be understood differently. Unlike physical disorders, a particular set of symptoms is not indicative of an underlying pathology that needs to be corrected in order to improve mental health and wellbeing. Symptom patterns are not informative on their own, but need to be considered within the context of the distress that is experienced. It is now well established that even symptoms of serious mental illness such as visual and auditory hallucinations may be experienced by people in the general population who do not have a mental disorder. Some people hear voices, for example, but are not distressed by them. It is, therefore, distress, not symptoms, that is defining of mental disorder.</p>
<p>The effect of the DSM conceptualization has been pervasive. Many current measures of mental health disorders assess the extent to which various symptoms are present (to what extent have you felt irritable over the last week, how much nervous energy have you had, etc) but do not clarify the degree to which these symptoms are problematic for the individual. For mental disorders, it is the meaning of the symptoms, rather than the symptoms themselves, that is crucial for accurate understanding and effective treatment. Currently, distress is only dealt with indirectly, as both assessment and treatment procedures focus on presenting symptoms and how to reduce these. Distress needs to be a much more explicit and direct target of our research and treatment efforts.</p>
<p>Insel claims that the current DSM diagnostic system has been one of the major obstacles to progress in understanding and treating mental disorders more effectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213491994">2</xref></sup> He describes promising lines of research for gaining a greater understanding of the neurobiology of mental disorders. However, unless this research integrates molecular and genetic investigations with efforts to understand the co-occurring psychological distress, it is difficult to see substantial progress being made. Developing an accurate and precise understanding of the neurobiology of auditory hallucinations, for example, will not explain why some people are debilitatingly distressed by these experiences while others are inspired and motivated by them.</p>
<p>The neurobiology of mental disorders cannot be divorced from the psychology of mental disorders or the environment of mental disorders. Understanding brain activity will not improve the conceptualization and treatment of mental disorders without recognizing how this activity changes and is changed by the environment within which the brain is situated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213491994">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The various mental disorders that are currently depicted are manifestations of psychological distress. As such, they are inescapably bio-psycho-social entities. Conceptualizing mental disorders in this way provides possibilities for collaboration in research and optimism for treatment. It is important to understand issues such as vulnerability to distress as well as thresholds of distress tolerance. The task for clinicians is not to remove symptoms, but to assist people in reducing whatever distress accompanies the symptoms. Distress can, therefore, be targeted more directly. This will also make treatment more effective for more people. For example, rather than eliminating cultural explanations of distress in favor of the DSM version, these explanations could help to inform treatment.</p>
<p>Focusing on distress rather than symptoms will enable more people to be helped more effectively more of the time. Reducing distress rather than removing symptoms will allow people to live lives of meaning and purpose by participating in communities and societies in ways they value.</p>
