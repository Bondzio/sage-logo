<abstract>
<p>We extend the <italic>deontic model of justice</italic> (Folger, 1998, 2001) by arguing that not all employees respond to third-party injustices by experiencing an eye-for-an-eye retributive response; rather, some employees respond in ways that are higher in moral acceptance (e.g. increasing turnover intentions, engaging in constructive resistance). We predict that the positive relationship between supervisor abuse of customers and organizational deviance is <italic>weaker</italic> when employees are high in moral identity. In contrast, we hypothesize that the relationships between supervisor abuse of customers and turnover intentions and constructive resistance are more <italic>strongly</italic> positive when employees are high in moral identity. Regression results from two field studies (<italic>N</italic> = 222 and <italic>N</italic> = 199, respectively) provide general support for our theoretical model.</p>

<p>A growing body of research suggests that third-party observers respond unfavorably to the mistreatment of others, even if the observer is not personally affected by the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726713482992">Bies and Greenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726713482992">Houshmand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726713482992">O’Reilly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726713482992">Rupp and Bell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0018726713482992">Skarlicki and Rupp, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0018726713482992">Skarlicki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0018726713482992">Turillo et al., 2002</xref>). Extant research demonstrates that third parties often react to the mistreatment of others by engaging in retributive justice that serves to punish the offending party. The implications of studying third-party reactions to the mistreatment of others loom large given that any one victim of mistreatment may be accompanied by a much larger pool of third-party observers who may seek vengeance against the at-fault party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0018726713482992">Skarlicki and Kulik, 2005</xref>). Although empirical progress has been made in solidifying the notion that third parties do indeed care about the mistreatment of others, little is known about third-party reactions that do not entail an eye-for-an-eye retributive response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726713482992">Rupp and Bell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0018726713482992">Skarlicki and Rupp, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The deontic model of justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726713482992">Folger, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726713482992">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726713482992">Folger et al., 2005</xref>) has served as a theoretical lens for understanding why third parties react unfavorably to the mistreatment of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726713482992">O’Reilly and Aquino, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726713482992">O’Reilly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726713482992">Rupp and Bell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0018726713482992">Skarlicki and Rupp, 2010</xref>). People respond unfavorably to third-party injustices because the perpetrator fails to uphold widely held principles of morality that dictate how people should treat one another to maintain a just social order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726713482992">Folger, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726713482992">2001</xref>). When a perpetrator infringes on what is rightfully owed to another person, observers experience <italic>deontic reactions</italic> that they are motivated to manage by redressing the wrongdoing. Research on the deontic model of justice has primarily focused on retributive justice in the form of punishment. Retributive justice has traditionally adopted a just desert philosophy, whereby offenders deserve to be punished and punishment serves to restore justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726713482992">Darley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0018726713482992">Okimoto et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, some researchers have suggested that not all third parties respond to observed injustices by engaging in retribution in the form of punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726713482992">Rupp and Bell, 2010</xref>). Yet, extant research on the deontic model of justice provides seemingly conflicting findings, with some studies reporting that people who self-regulate their moral behavior do not respond to observed injustices by punishing the at-fault party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726713482992">Rupp and Bell, 2010</xref>), and other studies suggesting that people who are high in moral identity are more likely to respond to observed injustices by punishing the offending party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726713482992">O’Reilly et al., 2012</xref>). We argue that these conflicting findings are due in part to the fact that people who tend to regulate their moral behavior do indeed have retributive tendencies, but their actual retributive responses are higher in moral acceptance. It could be that O’Reilly et al. found that those high in moral identity were more likely to respond to observed injustices by engaging in punishment because they operationalized punishment as “not doing business with a company,” which may be construed as a morally acceptable form of retribution.</p>
<p>In line with this notion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0018726713482992">Skarlicki and Rupp (2010)</xref> argued that multiple forms of retribution should be examined, including forms that move beyond an eye-for-an-eye punishment reaction. Retribution can include behaviors that attempt to restore a moral social order or serve to reduce the misbehavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0018726713482992">Tripp et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0018726713482992">Turillo et al. (2002)</xref> found that reactions to observed injustices may not always include a willingness to punish the wrongdoer. Specifically, the authors found that study participants were unwilling to punish a wrongdoer if it made the participant seem greedy. Accordingly, observers of injustices may find it unacceptable to right a wrong with equally egregious behaviors, such that “two wrongs don’t make a right” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0018726713482992">Turillo et al., 2002</xref>: 850).</p>
<p>We expand on this line of inquiry by testing the idea that people respond differently to observed injustices based on their level of moral identity. A person’s moral identity is a self-schema that is organized around a set of moral traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726713482992">Aquino and Reed, 2002</xref>). When people strongly uphold a moral identity, they may have a weaker tendency to respond to observed injustices by engaging in retribution that is equally egregious as the offending behavior (i.e. engaging in organizational deviance), but they may have a stronger tendency to engage in retribution that is construed as morally acceptable (i.e. having higher turnover intentions, constructively resisting their supervisors’ downward influence attempts).</p>
<p>Thus, we attempt to extend the deontic model of justice by demonstrating that moral people do indeed respond to observed injustices; however, their retributive reactions tend to be morally acceptable. Accordingly, we aim to resolve the inconsistencies between prior studies that have questioned whether people who uphold morality are more or less likely to respond to observed injustices by engaging in retribution in the form of punishment. We also contribute to the literature by focusing on customers as third-party victims of mistreatment. We focus on customers as victims of mistreatment because employees, as third-party observers, have more social distance from customers and are perhaps less personally affected by justice violations directed towards customers than if the victim were a coworker. To date, little empirical research has focused on injustices that are directed towards targets who are external to the organization (for an exception, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726713482992">Dunford et al., 2010</xref>). A focus on customer (mis)treatment is worthwhile given that customers are important organizational stakeholders who affect the overall success of organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726713482992">Bowen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0018726713482992">Schneider and Bowen, 1995</xref>). This is particularly true in a service-based economy that requires frequent interactions between managers, employees, and customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726713482992">Grizzle et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Deontic model of justice</title>
<p>Deontological ethics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726713482992">Broad, 1930</xref>) largely originated from work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726713482992">Immanuel Kant (1948)</xref>, which states that the morality of behavior is based on adherence to rules or duties. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726713482992">Folger (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726713482992">2001</xref>) used deontological ethics as a theoretical basis to bridge organizational justice and morality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726713482992">Folger et al., 2005</xref>). Deontic (i.e. binding or obligatory) justice arguments contend that upholding fairness is a moral obligation, and thus people care about fairness for its own sake. Accordingly, people hold each other accountable based on normative standards of how people “ought” to behave in terms of fairness.</p>
<p>Deontic justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726713482992">Folger, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726713482992">2001</xref>) arguments further contend that third-party observers may respond unfavorably if another person fails to uphold basic moral tenets that dictate how people should treat one another. To function within society, people constrain their own behavior and live in accordance with widely held principles of morality that serve to create a level playing field for all. Widely held principles of morality are derived from value-based systems that may emanate from societal expectations, religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726713482992">Cropanzano et al., 2003</xref>), or from evolutionary behaviors for handling problems that occur because people must live among one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726713482992">Folger and Skarlicki, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726713482992">Folger et al., 2005</xref>). Because people constrain their own behaviors to live by a set social order, they expect others to abide by the same principles.</p>
<p>When an individual observes another person failing to abide by widely held principles of morality, the observer responds with indignation or moral outrage, even though s/he is not directly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726713482992">Cropanzano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726713482992">Folger, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726713482992">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726713482992">Folger et al., 2005</xref>). The observer is aroused by moral considerations because the transgressor’s actions have challenged a just social order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726713482992">Folger, 2001</xref>). The observer’s arousal and subsequent responses are thought of as deontic reactions whereby people experience a sense of tension or discomfort in response to observed injustices, which they are motivated to reduce by restoring justice.</p>

<title>Supervisor abuse of customers and employee organizational deviance</title>
<p>In line with deontic justice arguments, we suggest that employees respond unfavorably to supervisor abuse of customers because supervisors are failing to abide by principles of morality that govern how people should treat one another. We adapt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0018726713482992">Tepper’s (2000)</xref> definition of abusive supervision to define <italic>supervisor abuse of customers</italic> as subordinates’ perceptions that their supervisors engage in hostile verbal and nonverbal behaviors towards customers, excluding physical contact. It should be noted that unlike Tepper’s definition of abuse, supervisor abuse of customers does not entail the sustained display of hostile verbal and nonverbal behavior towards a single customer. Rather, supervisor abuse of customers can be directed at any customer.</p>
<p>We argue that when supervisors fail to treat customers with dignity and respect, they are perceived by others as believing they are above social laws that govern appropriate interpersonal conduct. Employees respond to supervisor abuse of customers by experiencing tension or discomfort that they are motivated to reduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726713482992">Folger, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726713482992">2001</xref>). These “deontic” or obligatory responses encourage employees to redress the injustices for which their supervisors are responsible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726713482992">Folger and Cropanzano, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726713482992">Folger et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726713482992">O’Reilly and Aquino (2011)</xref> argued that employees may be more likely to respond to observed injustices by using indirect forms of retribution. Because employees are typically in lower positions of power compared to supervisors, they may choose to engage in these more covert forms of retribution.</p>
<p>Organizational deviance may serve as an indirect way of getting back at the supervisor for abusing customers. Organizational deviance is defined as “voluntary [employee] behavior that violates significant organizational norms and in so doing threatens the well-being of an organization, its members, or both” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0018726713482992">Robinson and Bennett, 1995</xref>: 556). Employees may engage in organizational deviance as a more covert, indirect form of retribution than actually engaging in deviance toward the supervisor, making it less risky in terms of potentially experiencing retaliation from supervisors. Employees may also respond to supervisor abuse of customers by engaging in organizational deviance because they view the supervisor and organization as embodying the same entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0018726713482992">Treviño and Nelson, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The notion that supervisors serve as the face of the organization is supported by related management literatures whereby supervisors have been construed as organizational “contract makers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0018726713482992">Rousseau, 1989</xref>) or as the embodiment of organizational support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726713482992">Eisenberger et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0018726713482992">Rhoades and Eisenberger, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726713482992">Levinson (1965)</xref>, too, noted that organizations are morally responsible for the actions of their agents. When a supervisor fails to be well-behaved by abusing customers, the organization has also failed to uphold its moral responsibility. In turn, employees may find it reasonable to engage in retribution that indirectly punishes the supervisor (and thereby reduces the potential for supervisor retaliation), but more directly punishes the organization for presumably endorsing immoral conduct on the part of its agents. Indeed, extant research has found that employees respond to abusive supervision by engaging in organizational deviance as an indirect form of retribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0018726713482992">Mitchell and Ambrose, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0018726713482992">Tepper et al., 2009</xref>). Drawing on these and previous deontic justice arguments, we predict that employees also respond to observed injustices, in the form of supervisor abuse of customers, by engaging in organizational deviance, even when controlling for the employee’s own mistreatment from the supervisor in the form of abusive supervision.</p>

<title>Employee moral identity as a moderator</title>
<p>Although a considerable amount of research has demonstrated that people respond to their own mistreatment by engaging in organizational deviance as a form of retribution (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726713482992">Holtz and Harold, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0018726713482992">Mitchell and Ambrose, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0018726713482992">Tepper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0018726713482992">Thau and Mitchell, 2010</xref>), some people may find it immoral to respond to third-party mistreatment by engaging in deviant behaviors. In particular, people who are high in moral identity may have weaker tendencies to respond to observed abuse by engaging in organizational deviance—a behavior that may cause aversive effects that are on par with abusing others. The more a person embraces morality as a central component of their self-conceptions, the easier it is for them to access this part of their identity for the sake of making moral judgments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726713482992">Aquino and Reed, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726713482992">Blasi, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726713482992">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726713482992">Lapsley and Lasky, 2001</xref>). In turn, the strength of a person’s moral identity has been shown to affect the way a person responds to and interprets ethical choices (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0018726713482992">Shao et al., 2008</xref>), which may have implications for the way s/he responds to observed injustices.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726713482992">Blasi (1984)</xref> argued that people who strongly embrace a moral identity desire to maintain a sense of self-consistency between what they believe to be correct and their own behavior. To engage in behaviors that are equally egregious as an offending behavior would presumably cause a person who is high in moral identity to feel inauthentic. Furthermore, Aquino and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726713482992">Aquino and Freeman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726713482992">Aquino and Reed, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726713482992">Aquino et al., 2009</xref>) argued that people who are high in moral identity are more likely to utilize self-regulatory mechanisms in guiding moral behavior. These self-regulatory mechanisms prompt people to consider “what is the right thing to do” in response to moral dilemmas and to reason that organizational deviance is an inappropriate form of retribution. Examples of deviant behaviors include spreading rumors about the organization, leaving work for someone else to do, putting little effort into work, and neglecting to follow supervisors’ instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726713482992">Bennett and Robinson, 2000</xref>). An employee who witnesses supervisor abuse of customers, and who is also high in moral identity, may conclude that organizational deviance is just as offensive as the abusive behavior s/he witnessed.</p>
<p>Employees high in moral identity may be more likely to conclude that organizational deviance is an inappropriate response because it (i) causes harm to another entity, (ii) may cause additional adverse effects that magnify the underlying problem, and (iii) may be construed as equally unfair as the offending act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726713482992">Rupp and Bell, 2010</xref>). Thus, even though someone high in moral identity may have stronger moral reactions to supervisor abuse of customers, their desire to maintain moral self-consistency, and their use of moral self-regulatory mechanisms, is expected to weaken their tendency to engage in organizational deviance as a way of redressing their supervisors’ wrongdoing. Accordingly, we hypothesize as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Employee moral identity moderates the relationship between supervisor abuse of customers and employee organizational deviance such that the positive relationship between supervisor abuse of customers and employee organizational deviance is weaker among employees higher in moral identity.</p>

<p>Although employees high in moral identity may have weaker tendencies to respond to supervisor abuse of customers by engaging in deviant behavior, we still expect these employees to experience deontic reactions, or strong feelings of tension and discomfort that they are motivated to reduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726713482992">Cropanzano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726713482992">Folger et al., 2005</xref>). It could be that these employees respond in ways that allow them to reduce tension and discomfort without causing overt harm to the organization. In particular, employees high in moral identity (as opposed to low) may respond to supervisor abuse of customers by experiencing stronger deontic reactions that are managed by increasing turnover intentions. Indeed, research that examines evolutionary forms of retribution has shown that some people respond to injustices by distancing themselves from the source of mistreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726713482992">Folger and Skarlicki, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Turnover intentions represent employees’ intentional willingness and desire to leave the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0018726713482992">Tett and Meyer, 1993</xref>). Given that employee turnover is an inevitable part of organizational life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726713482992">Abelson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726713482992">Dalton et al., 1981</xref>), those high in moral identity may find it morally acceptable to respond to supervisor abuse of customers with intentions to turnover. Remaining with, or intending to leave, an organization represents employees’ freewill in choosing their place of employment. Thus, although employees may eventually cause harm to the organization by intending to leave (e.g. causing the organization to spend time and money to rehire and train new employees; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726713482992">Glebbeek and Bax, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726713482992">Kacmar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0018726713482992">Shaw et al., 2005</xref>), these intentions are unlikely to be construed as harmful, or potentially immoral, in the same way that deviant behaviors may cause deliberate and direct harm to the organization.</p>
<p>Extant research suggests that when people associate with morally dissimilar others, it can challenge their understanding of themselves as moral people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726713482992">Skitka, 2002</xref>). These people may distance themselves psychologically from those with opposing moral values to reduce feelings of inauthenticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726713482992">Skitka, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0018726713482992">Skitka et al., 2005</xref>). This may be particularly true of people with high moral identities. To counterbalance their obligatory need to uphold morality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726713482992">Aquino and Reed, 2002</xref>), and to stabilize their desire to see themselves as moral people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726713482992">Blasi, 1984</xref>), employees who are high in moral identity are expected to have stronger responses to supervisor abuse of customers that involves distancing themselves from the source of injustice by intending to leave the organization—a potential form of retribution that may be construed as morally acceptable. Thus, we hypothesize the following:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Employee moral identity moderates the relationship between supervisor abuse of customers and employee turnover intentions such that the relationship between supervisor abuse of customers and employee turnover intentions is more strongly positive among employees with higher moral identities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Employees high in moral identity may also respond to supervisor abuse of customers by constructively resisting the supervisor’s downward influence attempts. Downward influence attempts capture the extent to which supervisors try to exercise social control over subordinates, with the goal of shaping subordinate’s perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0018726713482992">Tepper et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0018726713482992">Tepper et al. (2001)</xref> noted that subordinates may respond to supervisors’ immoral behaviors (i.e. abusive supervision) by engaging in retribution that involves resisting the supervisor’s downward influence tactics or, more specifically, by resisting the supervisor’s requests. Subordinates may choose to engage in resistance strategies as a form of retribution because the intent of such resistance is normally unclear to supervisors. Supervisors may find their subordinates’ resistance frustrating, but they may be unaware that such resistance stems from the subordinate’s desire to redress the supervisor’s immoral behavior. Accordingly, the supervisor may be less likely to respond to subordinates’ resistance tactics by engaging in retaliation, making this form of retribution more attractive to subordinates.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0018726713482992">Tepper et al. (2006)</xref> argued that supervisors generally do not like it when subordinates resist their requests, regardless of whether the resistance strategies are dysfunctional (i.e. behaviors that hinder workflow and/or undermine the supervisor) or constructive. Nevertheless, <italic>constructive</italic> resistance strategies may be construed as a morally acceptable form of retribution. Constructive resistance occurs when employees attempt to resist their supervisors’ requests in non-hostile ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0018726713482992">Tepper et al., 2001</xref>), usually by instigating a meaningful dialogue with the supervisor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0018726713482992">Tepper et al., 2006</xref>). Employees who engage in constructive resistance send the message that they are unwilling to accept and conform to their supervisors’ requests, but they also express genuine interest in maintaining relational stability with the supervisor. Employees engage in constructive resistance by directly communicating their concerns to supervisors. In doing so, they attempt to resolve disagreements without instigating further harm between parties. They also ask supervisors to clarify their behavior and/or expectations with the goal of helping, rather than hurting, third-parties who may be affected by the supervisor’s requests.</p>
<p>Constructive resistance allows employees to respond to the supervisor’s misbehavior in both contentious and non-contentious ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726713482992">Brett et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0018726713482992">Tepper et al., 2001</xref>). Constructive resistance is contentious in that employees do not simply ignore their supervisor’s immoral behaviors; instead, they engage in retribution specifically by sending the message that they are unwilling to conform to the supervisor’s expectations and desires. However, in doing so, they are also non-contentious in that they try not to instigate any further harm or conflict between parties. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0018726713482992">Tepper et al. (2001)</xref>, constructive resistance is likely to serve as an effective means of redressing a supervisor’s wrongdoing, while maintaining one’s self image as being a dependable, responsible, and trustworthy person. In this vein, employees high in moral identity are expected to have stronger tendencies to respond to supervisor abuse of customers by engaging in constructive resistance because it serves as a form of retribution, but also allows them to uphold their identities by not causing further harm and preventing incivility from spiraling out of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726713482992">Andersson and Pearson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0018726713482992">Tepper et al., 2001</xref>). Based on these and proceeding arguments, we hypothesize the following:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: Employee moral identity moderates the relationship between supervisor abuse of customers and employee constructive resistance such that the relationship between supervisor abuse of customers and employee constructive resistance is more strongly positive among employees with higher moral identities.</p>

<title>Sample and procedure</title>
<p>We collected data from 222 focal respondents and their immediate supervisors from a variety of organizations in the Midwestern United States. We administered surveys via the internet. Students served as organizational contacts in exchange for extra credit. Students recruited a working adult (working 20 hours per week or more) who was willing to serve as a focal employee. The focal employee then asked his or her supervisor to fill out the supervisor survey. The focal employee created a random eight-digit ID number that was required to submit the survey. The focal employee also gave this number to his/her supervisor. The purpose of using the ID numbers was to provide a way to link the focal employee and supervisor surveys without using participant names and thus ensuring anonymity.</p>
<p>In line with researchers who have used similar approaches to collecting data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726713482992">Grant and Mayer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726713482992">Judge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0018726713482992">Lee and Allen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726713482992">Morgeson and Humphrey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0018726713482992">Piccolo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726713482992">Skarlicki and Folger, 1997</xref>), we took a number of steps to ensure that the surveys were completed by the correct sources. In introducing the study, we emphasized the importance of integrity in the scientific process. We told participants that it was essential for the focal and supervisor respondents to fill out the correct surveys. When participants submitted their online surveys, time stamps and IP addresses were recorded to ensure that surveys were submitted at different times, with different IP addresses. We invited 677 students to serve as organizational contacts. We received responses from 263 focal employees and 227 supervisors. These responses created usable data from 222 subordinate−supervisor dyads for a response rate of 32.79 per cent.</p>
<p>Focal employee respondents were 55.2 per cent male and 63 per cent Caucasian. The employees had an average age of 23.86 years and an average of 2.41 years of experience with their organization. The supervisor respondents were 59 per cent male and 74 per cent Caucasian. The supervisors’ average age was 37.6 years, with an average of 8.1 years of experience with their organization.</p>
<p>The focal employee survey contained measures of supervisor abuse of customers, employee moral identity, abusive supervision (as a control), and demographics. The supervisor survey contained measures of the focal respondent’s deviant behaviors and demographics.</p>

<sec id="section13-0018726713482992">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>To take into account employees’ reactions that may stem from their own mistreatment, we controlled for abuse directed at the subordinate.

<p>The results provide support for Hypothesis 1; supervisor abuse of customers is related positively to employee organizational deviance, even when controlling for abusive supervision. We found support for Hypothesis 2; moral identity of the focal employee moderates the relationship between supervisor abuse of customers and employee organizational deviance such that the relationship is weaker when moral identity is high than when it is low. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018726713482992">Figure 1</xref> shows that the relationship between supervisor abuse of customers and employee organizational deviance is not only weaker when moral identity is high versus low, but it is also in the negative direction.</p>

<p>We found support for Hypothesis 1; supervisor abuse of customers is positively related to employee deviance, even when controlling for abusive supervision. We found support for Hypothesis 2; moral identity moderates the relationship between supervisor abuse of customers and employee deviance, such that the positive relationship is weaker when employees are higher in moral identity. We found support for Hypotheses 3 and 4; moral identity moderates the relationship between supervisor abuse of customers and turnover intentions (Hypothesis 3) and constructive resistance (Hypothesis 4) such these relationships are more strongly positive when moral identity is high as opposed to low.</p>
<p>To further examine the nature of these interactions, we conducted simple slopes analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726713482992">Aiken and West, 1991</xref>).

<title>Implications for theory</title>
<p>Our results extend the deontic model of justice by suggesting that people have different deontic reactions depending on how strongly they internalize morality as part of their identities. A number of experimental studies have demonstrated that people respond to observed injustices by engaging in retribution that serves to punish the at-fault party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726713482992">O’Reilly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0018726713482992">Turillo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0018726713482992">Umphress et al., 2012</xref>). Yet, our findings suggest that people high in moral identity may be unwilling to engage in forms of retribution that may be construed as morally unacceptable. Although organizational deviance is often examined as a form of retaliation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0018726713482992">Mitchell and Ambrose, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0018726713482992">Tepper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0018726713482992">Thau and Mitchell, 2010</xref>), our results suggest that employees high in moral identity are less inclined to engage in organizational deviance as a way of getting back at supervisors for abusing customers. Presumably, those high in moral identity do not engage in organizational deviance because it may cause harm that is equally egregious as the offending behavior. Our findings align with recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726713482992">Rupp and Bell (2010)</xref>, who found that people who are able to self-regulate their moral behavior are less likely to respond to third-party injustices by engaging in retribution that is equally as offensive as the initiating act. Rather, Rupp and Bell’s findings suggest that these people respond by doing nothing (i.e. by not punishing the perpetrator).</p>
<p>Notably, our findings extend <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726713482992">Rupp and Bell’s (2010)</xref> work by demonstrating that employees high in moral identity do indeed respond to supervisor abuse of customers; yet, their reactions tend to be more morally acceptable. In particular, our results suggest that employees high in moral identity have stronger reactions to supervisor abuse of customers in the form of higher turnover intentions and increased levels of constructive resistance. Theoretically, it makes sense for employees high in moral identity to respond unfavorably to supervisor abuse of customers because of their commitment to upholding morality as part of their identities. At the same time, employees high in moral identity seek consistency between their moral beliefs and moral actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726713482992">Aquino and Reed, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726713482992">Blasi, 1984</xref>); thus, they should find ways to alleviate negative feelings associated with observed injustices by attempting to redress the wrongdoing through less harmful and potentially constructive means. It could be that those high in moral identity do not have an eye-for-an-eye mentality, whereby offended parties restore justice with equitable retribution. Instead, these employees may relieve the tension and discomfort they are experiencing in response to supervisor abuse of customers by having reactions that also serve to maintain their sense of self as moral people.</p>
<p>Recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726713482992">O’Reilly et al. (2012)</xref> demonstrated that customers high in moral identity are more likely to respond to observed organizational injustices by engaging in retribution. Yet, O’Reilly et al. operationalized retribution as having intentions of not doing business with an organization that mistreats employees. It could be that refraining from doing business with an unfair organization is considered a morally acceptable form of retribution. Future research would benefit from classifying retributive actions according to those that are equally egregious as the offending behavior, as in an eye-for-an-eye retributive response, to those that are akin to turning the other cheek. As implied by our research, not all reactions to observed injustices entail a retributive response that is parallel to the initiating behavior.</p>
<p>We should also draw attention to an interesting finding of the results for the interactive effects of supervisor abuse of customers and employee moral identity on employee organizational deviance found in Study 1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018726713482992">Figure 1</xref>). These results indicated that individuals higher in moral identity may engage in higher levels of organizational deviance when supervisor abuse is low. Although this finding was not specifically hypothesized, we believe it is consistent with our theorizing. As we mentioned in our theoretical rationale for the moderating effect of employee moral identity, witnessing supervisor abuse of customers may lead employees high in moral identity to use moral self-regulatory mechanisms, which may reduce the likelihood that the employee will respond to the supervisor’s abuse with equally egregious behaviors, such as organizational deviance. Thus, when supervisor abuse of customers is present, employees who are higher on moral identity are less likely to engage in organizational deviance because they are more morally aware and are more likely to use moral self-regulation in guiding their actions. Under conditions of low abuse, it could be that there is not a moral event to prime one’s use of moral self-regulation, perhaps making employees less likely to pay attention to the moral implications of deviant behavior. We offer these suggestions in a speculative manner, with the hope that future research will further investigate these possibilities.</p>
<p>Our study also contributes to the literature by examining supervisor abuse of customers. To date, abusive supervision research has primarily focused on employees’ reactions to their own abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0018726713482992">Tepper, 2007</xref>), with little consideration given to how employees respond when their supervisors mistreat third parties. Although organizational justice scholars have examined a number of studies on third-party mistreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726713482992">Ambrose and Kulik, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726713482992">Ambrose et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726713482992">Colquitt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726713482992">De Cremer and Van Hiel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726713482992">Degoey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726713482992">Duffy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726713482992">Jones and Skarlicki, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0018726713482992">Lamertz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726713482992">Lind et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0018726713482992">Skarlicki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0018726713482992">Umphress et al., 2003</xref>), these studies have not taken into account injustices that are directed towards sources that are external to the organization. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726713482992">Dunford et al. (2010)</xref>, an organization’s (mis)treatment of external parties (e.g. customers) may provide important information that employees use to shape their attitudes and behavior towards the organization; yet, little to no empirical research has explored this possibility. We further contribute to this literature by demonstrating that employees care about the mistreatment of customers and may respond in ways that are unfavorable to the organization.</p>
<p>A focus on customers also contributes to the literature in that customers are important organizational stakeholders that have yet to receive ample attention in the organizational justice literature. Research that has considered the customer has primarily focused on customers mistreating employees (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0018726713482992">Rupp et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0018726713482992">Rupp and Spencer, 2006</xref>), with little consideration given to organizational members mistreating customers. As our economy becomes increasingly service-oriented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726713482992">Grizzle et al., 2009</xref>), it becomes more important to consider the (mis)treatment of customers, which likely affects organizational success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726713482992">Bowen et al., 1999</xref>).</p>

<p>Practically, we find our research to be useful in that organizations and their representatives should not only monitor how they behave towards their employees, but how they behave more generally to other organizational stakeholders. As our results suggest, employees can have unfavorable reactions to observed mistreatment, which could have dire consequences for the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0018726713482992">Skarlicki and Kulik, 2005</xref>). Some managers may disregard what appear to be relatively minor immoral behaviors because the harm associated with them is not obvious. However, these behaviors may generate hidden costs in that subordinates respond unfavorably to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726713482992">Cialdini et al., 2004</xref>), even if they are not the target of the immoral act.</p>
<p>Additionally, our research is practically important in that people may respond to third-party injustices in a variety of ways. Some people may strive to restore justice by engaging in retribution in the form of organizational deviance, whereas others may respond by intending to leave the organization or by constructively resisting the supervisor’s requests. Organizations would benefit from focusing on constructive means of restoring justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726713482992">Bradfield and Aquino, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726713482992">Kidder, 2007</xref>). Organizations may offer training and guidance on how to tactfully approach those who engage in immoral behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726713482992">Lieber, 2010</xref>). We suggest training should include learning about policies and codes of conduct that clearly define types of misconduct in organizations. Organizations may also consider providing additional incentives, such as rewards, to encourage constructive responses to others’ injustices. These tactics should encourage employees to engage in positive actions after witnessing immoral behavior.</p>
<p>Furthermore, training tactics can help shape a work environment that encourages individuals to confront superiors after observing mistreatment. Scholars studying upward communication tactics agree that training can help create a workplace that encourages and supports approach behaviors to raise organizational concerns (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726713482992">Dutton and Ashforth, 1993</xref>). A work environment that promotes moral standards and norms may raise employees’ moral awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726713482992">Graham, 1986</xref>). Furthermore, employees who operate in a psychologically safe environment, feeling free to express themselves at work, may be more likely to voice organizational concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726713482992">Detert and Burris, 2007</xref>). Both the promotion of moral standards and a sense of psychological safety may contribute to a work environment that encourages employees to engage in constructive behaviors after witnessing immoral behavior.</p>
<p>Finally, organizations should be aware that employees who are high in moral identity may be more likely to respond to supervisor abuse of customers by eventually leaving the organization. At the same time, employees who have lower moral identities may engage in similarly egregious acts, which could cause incivility to spiral and further contaminate the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726713482992">Andersson and Pearson, 1999</xref>). Thus, it would behoove organizations to monitor immoral behavior to prevent the erosion of moral standards.</p>

<title>Limitations and future directions</title>
<p>As with any research, our studies are not without limitations. We argued that some employees may respond to supervisor abuse of customers by engaging in deviance as a way of redressing their supervisor’s immoral behavior. Although deontic justice research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0018726713482992">Turillo et al., 2002</xref>) and other retributive justice research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726713482992">Fisher and Baron, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726713482992">Greenberg, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0018726713482992">Mitchell and Ambrose, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726713482992">Skarlicki and Folger, 1997</xref>) contends that deviant or retaliatory behaviors do serve to punish at-fault parties, it is also plausible that some employees engage in these behaviors because they are role-modeling their supervisors’ deviant behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0018726713482992">Robinson and O’Leary-Kelly, 1998</xref>). Future research would benefit from examining the mediating roles of intent to punish and/or role modeling to address this limitation.</p>
<p>Another limitation of our research is that we primarily examined forms of retribution that indirectly affect the perpetrator, with a focus on responses that presumably vary in terms of moral acceptance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726713482992">O’Reilly and Aquino (2011)</xref> argue that people are likely to respond to third-party mistreatment by (a) doing nothing, (b) punishing the perpetrator directly, (c) punishing the perpetrator indirectly, or (d) aiding the victim. Our research does not thoroughly explore why employees may be more likely to engage in indirect forms of retribution rather than aiding the victim or directly approaching the supervisor regarding his/her immoral conduct. It could be that employees experience a lack of resource power or time constraints (i.e. owing to short customer interactions) that prevent them from aiding a customer who has been abused by a supervisor. Accordingly, the employee’s failure to aid the victim could create a lasting state of dissonance and/or anger that is eventually resolved through indirect forms of retribution. As our previous theorizing implies, employees may be more apt to engage in indirect forms of retribution, as opposed to direct forms, because of the fear of supervisor retaliation.</p>
<p>Future research would benefit from examining multiple third-party reactions, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726713482992">O’Reilly and Aquino (2011)</xref>, with particular attention given to the mediating processes that explain why one reaction may be chosen over another. In this regard, it would also be interesting to examine whether some reactions are more effective in actually reducing the misbehavior. It could be that under certain conditions (e.g. when the supervisor is accepting of criticism), directly approaching the supervisor is the best way to curb the misbehavior. Alternatively, some supervisors may be more inclined to engage in misbehavior if they suspect that subordinates are trying to punish their misdeeds. This possibility aligns with extant research that suggests that people are actually less cooperative when sanctions are in place to support or prevent certain behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726713482992">Chen et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Another potential limitation of our research is that we drew primarily on deontic justice arguments to support our hypotheses; however, a central aspect of deontic justice is that people respond to observed injustices by experiencing an uncomfortable psychological state (i.e. dissonance; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726713482992">Festinger, 1957</xref>) that they are motivated to reduce by redressing the wrongdoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726713482992">Folger, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726713482992">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726713482992">Folger et al., 2005</xref>). The primary purpose of our research was to test whether some people have different attitudinal and behavioral reactions to observed injustices; thus, we did not measure uncomfortable psychological states in our research. Even so, future research on the deontic model of justice would benefit from examining the mediating role of discrete emotions mentioned by Folger and colleagues (e.g. hostility, resentment), as well as dissonance arousal. Given that deontic emotions and dissonance arousal are construed as automatic and instinctive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726713482992">Cropanzano et al., 2003</xref>), laboratory experiments may be particularly useful for investigating these effects (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726713482992">O’Reilly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726713482992">Porath and Erez, 2009</xref>). Future research would also benefit from examining whether moral emotions truly exist to support altruistic, unselfish reactions, or whether the root of all reactions, moral or otherwise, emanate from self-serving desires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726713482992">Folger and Salvador, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>We draw on Aquino and colleagues’ moral identity research and theorizing when describing the impact subordinates’ moral identities have on retributive behavior after witnessing immoral action. Our study showed that moral identity is an important moderator of the relationship between supervisor abuse of customers and subsequent employee behaviors. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726713482992">Hannah et al. (2011)</xref> expanded moral identity theorizing by proposing that moral identity is multifaceted in nature, consisting of self-knowledge (what are my core beliefs?) and evaluative components (do I act upon those beliefs?). The authors state that different moral identity facets become salient depending on different situational stimuli or the different social roles people possess. Employees’ core beliefs, such as honesty, integrity, or compassion, may be more prominent in certain social roles or positions than others. Hence, the role of moral identity in our and future research may be more complex than depicted in our studies. Employees who have a strong moral identification with their organizations, but find their direct supervisors’ behavior morally reprehensible, may be less likely to respond to supervisors’ unjust behaviors by engaging in deviance and may be more likely to engage in constructive resistance. Teasing apart the multi-faceted aspects of moral identity offers rich grounds for future research.</p>
<p>Our data are cross-sectional; therefore, we cannot infer causality. Additionally, our results may be subject to common method variance. It would be beneficial to test our model using multiple methods, such as longitudinal studies, to help provide causal support for our predictions. Although we eliminated some same source bias by having supervisors rate employees’ deviant and constructive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0018726713482992">Podsakoff et al., 2003</xref>), and same source bias is less of a concern when testing interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726713482992">Evans, 1985</xref>), one of the criterion variables was measured using self-reports (namely, turnover intentions). However, turnover intentions are perceptual and/or attitudinal and are therefore best measured using self-reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0018726713482992">Spector, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that results in support of our main effect hypothesis (i.e. a positive relationship between supervisor abuse of customers and employee deviance) should be interpreted in light of the statistically significant, superseding interaction term, whereby the interaction term qualifies the main effect findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726713482992">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, it is perhaps more appropriate to conclude that the positive relationship between supervisor abuse of customers and employee deviance only holds when employee moral identity is low and not high. Future experimental studies would be helpful in drawing firmer conclusions regarding this point.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In line with deontic justice arguments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726713482992">Cropanzano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726713482992">Folger, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726713482992">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726713482992">Folger et al., 2005</xref>), our results provide evidence that employees respond unfavorably to third-party mistreatment, even when controlling for employees’ own mistreatment. We investigate an extension and caveat to the work of Folger and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726713482992">Folger, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726713482992">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726713482992">Folger and Cropanzano, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726713482992">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726713482992">Folger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0018726713482992">Turillo et al., 2002</xref>). Folger et al. argue that people respond unfavorably when others fail to abide by moral obligations, which then leads to retributive justice. Although it may be true that third parties react unfavorably to others’ mistreatment, our results suggest that not everyone will respond to others’ injustices by engaging in retribution in the form of punishment, or at least not punishment that is also morally offensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726713482992">Rupp and Bell, 2010</xref>). We find our results encouraging in that deontic reactions may lead to morally neutral or even constructive forms of retribution.</p>
