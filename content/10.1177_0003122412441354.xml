<abstract>
<p>Why did the transition from socialism to capitalism result in improved growth in some countries and significant economic decline in others? Scholars have advanced three main arguments: (1) successful countries rapidly implemented neoliberal policies; (2) failures were not due to policies but to poor institutional environments; and (3) policies were counterproductive because they damaged the state. We present a state-centered theory and empirically demonstrate for the first time one of several possible mechanisms linking neoliberal policies to poor economic performance: mass privatization programs, where implemented, created a massive fiscal shock for post-communist governments, thereby undermining the development of private-sector governance institutions and severely exacerbating the transformational recession. We performed cross-national panel regressions for a sample of 25 post-communist countries between 1990 and 2000 and found that mass privatization programs negatively affected economic growth, state capacity, and property rights protection. We further tested these findings with firm-level data from a representative survey of managers in 3,550 companies operating in 24 post-communist countries. Within countries that implemented mass-privatized programs, newly privatized firms were substantially less likely to engage in industrial restructuring but considerably more likely to use barter and accumulate tax arrears than their state-owned counterparts.</p>

<p>Between 1989 and 1991, the Soviet empire disintegrated. Western-trained neoliberal economists provided the blueprint for constructing capitalism amid the ruins of state socialism. They advocated shock therapy: rapid privatization, liberalization of prices and trade, and fiscal and monetary austerity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0003122412441354">United Nations Development Programme 1999</xref>). Although sociologists and economists critiqued these policies and their pace (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003122412441354">Burawoy and Krotov 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122412441354">Kornai 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0003122412441354">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0003122412441354">Stark 1992</xref>), a group of neoclassical economists at Harvard and MIT believed they were necessary; this perspective was also dominant among economists working for international financial institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122412441354">Cohen 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0003122412441354">Wedel 2001</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0003122412441354">1</xref></sup> As Lawrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0003122412441354">Summers (1994</xref>:252−53) put it, “Despite economists’ reputation for never being able to agree on anything, there is a striking degree of unanimity in the advice that has been provided to the nations of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. . . . [P]rivatization, stabilization, and liberalization . . . must all be completed as soon as possible.” Most post-communist countries implemented versions of the shock therapy package. Of the three major policies, privatization proved to be the most difficult to implement and yielded the greatest variance in outcomes.</p>
<p>Despite initial optimism, economic performance was disastrous in most post-communist countries, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003122412441354">Figure 1</xref> shows. Between 1990 and 1996, per capita income in Russia and most of the former Soviet Union (FSU) fell by over 30 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0003122412441354">Rosefielde 2001</xref>)—slightly less than the decline in the United States during the Great Depression (see Part A in the online supplement for a graphic comparison [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://asr.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://asr.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>]).</p>
<p>Yet, not all countries fared as poorly. Estonia’s economy, which recorded an initial 20.2 percent drop in GDP between 1990 and 1994, fully recovered by 1997 and, by 2000, had achieved 29.3 percent higher per capita income levels than in 1990. Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Slovenia experienced the lowest declines in per capita incomes, bottoming out at roughly 10 percent in 1992. By 1994, these countries surpassed pre-transition income levels, and for the next six years they experienced balanced growth (recording a 39.8 percent increase in per capita income between 1990 and 2000).</p>

<title>Initial Theories of Economic Transition</title>
<p>Neoliberal policy recommendations were grounded in the notion that economic development could be achieved by relying on the power of market forces and private property, unleashed by a radical curtailment of the state. Neoliberals argued that rapid liberalization of prices and trade, alongside privatization and macroeconomic stabilization, would set free economic restructuring, leading to growth and convergence with the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0003122412441354">Sachs 1994</xref>). The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s (EBRD) 1999 <italic>Transition Report</italic> summarizes the consensus of foreign advisors and post-communist elites at the start of the transition: “Private ownership would ensure profit-oriented corporate governance, while liberalization of trade and prices would set free the competitive market forces that reward profitable activities. Firms would have therefore both internal and external incentives to restructure” (p. 167).</p>
<p>Economically, proponents expected neoliberal reforms to combine the advantage of “true prices” with “a fully private incentive structure,” thus promoting enterprise restructuring (EBRD 1999:167; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003122412441354">Blanchard et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003122412441354">Carlin, van Reenen, and Wolfe 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003122412441354">Fischer and Gelb 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0003122412441354">Frydman, Gray, and Rapaczynski 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0003122412441354">Kosolowski 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003122412441354">Lipton and Sachs 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0003122412441354">Sachs 1992a</xref>, 1996). Neoliberals also advanced a rationale of political expediency: they believed that a period of “extraordinary politics” following the collapse of communism gave elites a brief window of opportunity to implement reforms, after which managers and workers of state-owned enterprises might seek to halt, or even roll back, privatization and liberalization efforts in order to prevent layoffs and other social costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0003122412441354">Lipton and Sachs 1990b</xref>:298; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003122412441354">Blanchard et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003122412441354">Frydman, Rapaczynski, and Turkowitz 1997</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0003122412441354">Sachs (1992b</xref>:71) noted at the time, “The need to accelerate privatization is the paramount economic policy issue facing Eastern Europe. If there is no breakthrough in the privatization of large enterprises in the near future, the entire process could be stalled for years to come. Privatization is urgent and politically vulnerable.” Similarly, Ira Lieberman, a senior official at the World Bank’s mass privatization advisory program, stated that “there was a concern by Russian reformers, above all, that the communists might soon take control again; their desire, therefore was to move as rapidly as possible, i.e., to create ‘facts on the ground’ that made a market economy irreversible” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0003122412441354">Lieberman, Kessides, and Gobbo 2008</xref>:61).</p>
<p>The need for rapid privatization posed considerable challenges. While economists and policymakers had long understood how to stabilize and liberalize economies (by raising interest rates, limiting monetary emissions, freeing prices, and opening up trade), the attempt to privatize an entire economy within a few years was unprecedented, and doing so without an existing class of private investors seemed almost impossible. According to three senior World Bank bureaucrats involved in the implementation of mass privatization, “It quickly became apparent that the ‘Classical privatisation’ model practiced in the UK and New Zealand and emulated by other countries such as Mexico and Argentina would simply not work in the region. . . . [T]here were too many state-owned companies . . . that needed to be privatised rapidly. Implementing privatisation on a case-by-case basis over many years risked missing the ‘window of opportunity’ for real structural change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0003122412441354">Lieberman et al. 2008</xref>:12).</p>
<p>One attractive option was privatization to foreign owners. Policymakers soon determined, however, that many local elites would reject foreign capital due to economic nationalism, and foreigners would not purchase vast swaths of unprofitable and technologically obsolete Soviet firms. Employee share ownership programs—another quick method of privatization—concentrated individual employee-owned shares and protected them from takeover attempts by outside investors, but they were considered unacceptable because entrenched labor interests might discourage foreign investment and prevent restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003122412441354">Ellerman 2003</xref>). Management and employee buyouts could be equally fast but were rejected as a stand-alone option. To be viable from a neoliberal policy standpoint, individual shares would have to be transferable, and sale to outside owners encouraged, so that capital markets could develop.</p>
<p>With foreign investment unlikely and exclusive insider ownership undesirable, policymakers decided on <italic>mass privatization</italic>, which would give firm insiders and citizens vouchers redeemable for shares at nominal cost (or in many cases, free of charge). Whole sectors of the economy could be rapidly privatized using these vouchers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0003122412441354">2</xref></sup> While most countries adopted several different privatization strategies, as described in Part B of the online supplement, mass privatization was by far the most innovative method and was implemented by approximately half of the post-communist world to varying degrees (see Table C1 in the online supplement).</p>
<p>Would privatization, implemented prior to restructuring and in the absence of capitalist institutions, be adequate to generate growth? Or would there be governance problems, information deficits, and potential market failures? The neoliberal answer resembled a political Coase theorem: “Privatization . . . offers an enormous political benefit for the creation of institutions supporting private property because it creates the very private owners who then begin lobbying the government . . . to create market-supporting institutions. . . . [Such] <italic>institutions would follow private property rather than the other way around</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0003122412441354">Shleifer and Vishny 1998</xref>:10–11; emphasis added).</p>
<p>Although neoliberal ideas dominated transition policy formation, they were criticized from the beginning by gradualist voices emphasizing the importance of state-guided institutional reform (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003122412441354">Burawoy and Krotov 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0003122412441354">Murrell 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0003122412441354">Stark 1992</xref>). The gradualist position held that <italic>in the absence of a supportive institutional environment</italic>, radical reforms would be damaging: privatization might lead to asset-stripping rather than investment, and rapid reforms might create economic winners who would subsequently engage in predatory behavior. China’s trajectory was frequently cited as evidence for the benefits of gradual reform (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003122412441354">Burawoy 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Shock therapy advocates won the policy debate in most countries. However, instead of improved performance throughout the post-communist region, there ensued great economic decline followed by considerable divergence in subsequent recovery. How did scholars explain this variation in outcomes?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0003122412441354">
<title>Postmortem Literature: Main Explanations of Post-communist Economic Performance</title>
<p>Gradualists and shock therapy advocates both claimed that the facts vindicated their original positions. Shock therapists, however, made one important concession: institutions and other initial conditions mattered more than they had previously acknowledged. As the economist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003122412441354">Milton Friedman (2002</xref>:xviii) put it when reflecting on post-communist Russia, “It turns out that the rule of law is probably more basic than privatization. Privatization is meaningless if you don’t have the rule of law. What does it mean to privatize if you do not have security of property, if you can’t use your property as you want to?” Shock therapy advocates now agreed with gradualists that various initial conditions played a role in explaining the variation in economic performance. That is, some countries were predisposed to restructure their economies more effectively and achieve competitiveness in globalized markets because of their particular historical and cultural legacies.</p>
<sec id="section3-0003122412441354">
<title>Proposition 1: Faster and More Extensive Privatization Led to Better Performance</title>
<p>Despite this concession, shock therapists continued to assert that faster and more extensive reforms lead to better performance. They therefore claimed their initial theories were not in need of fundamental revision. Instead, they argued that variation in performance could be explained by a combination of initial conditions and insufficient implementation of reforms. The seminal statement of this position can be found in the EBRD’s 1999 <italic>Transition Report: Ten Years of Transition</italic>, which became part of a growing body of empirical studies supporting these claims (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003122412441354">De Melo, Denizer, and Gelb 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003122412441354">De Melo et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003122412441354">De Melo and Gelb 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0003122412441354">Sachs 1996</xref>). This view emphasized corruption as a key factor in undermining reforms, especially in the case of Russia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003122412441354">Åslund 1999</xref>). Although proponents acknowledged that “the benefits of privatization are larger in countries with an effective legal framework and secure property rights” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003122412441354">International Monetary Fund 2000</xref>:105), shock therapists never considered mass privatization detrimental and argued that countries are “better off after the flawed privatizations they carried out than they would have been had they avoided or delayed divestiture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0003122412441354">Nellis 2008</xref>:81). Supporting this position, two econometric analyses claim that voucher privatization has been beneficial to growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003122412441354">Bennett et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003122412441354">Bennett, Estrin, and Urga 2007</xref>). In summary, the original proponents of shock therapy would advocate the same strategy again: “No country has suffered from too radical reforms. Things have gone wrong because the move to the market was not radical enough” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003122412441354">Åslund 2002</xref>:445).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0003122412441354">
<title>Proposition 2: Privatization Failed to Create Necessary Governance Institutions</title>
<p>Gradualist scholars felt equally vindicated. Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz’s seminal paper “Whither Reform? Ten Years of the Transition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0003122412441354">2000</xref>), for example, argued that prioritizing privatization over establishing a proper institutional framework promoted widespread corruption. Due to information asymmetries and lack of an effective governance framework, the new private owners had incentive and opportunity to pursue rent-seeking and asset-stripping. Stiglitz claimed these tendencies were exacerbated by the liberalization of capital accounts, which facilitated transferring money abroad. Strict monetary policy further encouraged predatory behavior, as high interest rates prevented new firm owners from attracting capital needed for restructuring. Unless accompanied by adequate institutional reforms, privatization would therefore lead to lower economic growth.</p>
<p>Other gradualists claimed that rapid liberalization generated supply shocks in industries that were subject to “pre-transition distortions” in the form of subsidies and trade protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0003122412441354">Popov 2007</xref>:1). Rapidly eliminating subsidies and deregulating prices left firms in these sectors with insufficient time to restructure, driving them out of business or into the barter economy. Because some investment capital would have been generated by the savings of these noncompetitive firms had they remained protected, overall investment levels plummeted. Slower liberalization would have limited this decline, thus mitigating the severity of the economic downturn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0003122412441354">Popov 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Several sociologists have advanced similar arguments, substituting the term state for institutions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003122412441354">Burawoy (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0003122412441354">Nee (2000)</xref> argued that the state’s bureaucratic capacity was a crucial factor in determining economic success or failure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003122412441354">Burawoy (1996)</xref>, in a seminal article comparing China’s and Russia’s transitions, argued that Russia performed poorly because neoliberal reforms damaged the state right when the economy was being privatized, thereby creating the perverse combination of private property with soft budget constraints. This resulted in “economic involution” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003122412441354">Burawoy 1996</xref>:1105), a process in which firm managers failed to utilize state subsidies to increase production, opting instead to pursue asset-stripping and transfer wealth out of the economy. In China, conversely, the state was able to decentralize property relations to the local administrative level, thereby hardening budget constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0003122412441354">Walder 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0003122412441354">Nee (2000)</xref> advances the broader argument that China’s evolutionary transition strategy permitted reformers to utilize preexisting state structures to build a market economy, whereas Russia’s attempt to simultaneously reform economic and political institutions deprived policymakers of their governance tools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0003122412441354">
<title>Proposition 3: Initial Conditions, Rather Than Reform Paths, Were Main Determinants of Economic Outcomes</title>
<p>One group of authors claimed that the only relevant factor in explaining performance was different countries’ respective starting points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122412441354">Ganev 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0003122412441354">Popov 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0003122412441354">Stuart and Panayotopoulos 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0003122412441354">Popov (2000)</xref>, for example, argued that democracy without the rule of law creates massive opportunities for corruption, thereby undermining subsequent reform efforts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003122412441354">Fish (2005)</xref> contended that Russia’s natural resource wealth, coupled with its weak legislature and delayed economic reforms, further spurred corruption and prevented the emergence of viable governance institutions. Other scholars have emphasized the importance of social structural factors, particularly the power of the former <italic>nomenklatura</italic>. In countries where the <italic>nomenklatura</italic> were sufficiently powerful, they were able to convert their social and political capital into private economic wealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122412441354">Eyal, Szelényi, and Townsley 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122412441354">King 2003</xref>); in the process, they deliberately destroyed the institutions that prevent economic crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122412441354">Ganev 2007</xref>). The outcome was a form of capitalism driven by agents with an inappropriate habitus: because their wealth had largely been obtained by illegal means and might be subject to future dispossession, former <italic>nomenklatura</italic> were incentivized to transfer capital abroad instead of investing in their enterprises.</p>
<p>A variant of the social structural perspective stresses the importance of alliances between firm managers and foreign capital in facilitating successful firm restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0003122412441354">King 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0003122412441354">2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003122412441354">2001b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122412441354">2002</xref>). Countries that managed to attract sufficient foreign direct investment (FDI) were able to compensate for the depressive effects of shock therapy. Subsequent work combined this assessment with the view that neoliberal policies were detrimental, arguing that countries in which the <italic>nomenklatura</italic> struck a bargain with enterprise managers (e.g., Russia) effectively discouraged FDI and ultimately experienced deindustrialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122412441354">King 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122412441354">King and Szelényi 2005</xref>). In other countries (mostly in Central Europe), an alliance of technocrats and dissidents was able to block the <italic>nomenklatura</italic>’s bid to gain ownership of the means of production and instead created the political and social conditions for large-scale foreign investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122412441354">King 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122412441354">King and Szelényi 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003122412441354">King and Sznajder 2006</xref>). This perspective argues that FDI, combined with state-guided enterprise restructuring, accounts for the success stories of post-communist development. While these social structural explanations have substantial merit, they cannot account for differences in performance among countries with <italic>similar</italic> social structural conditions.

<title>A State-Centered Theory of Transition</title>
<p>In this article, we advance a neo-Weberian theory of post-communist economic collapse that focuses on the bureaucratic character and capacity of the state. For Weber, modern rational capitalism is characterized not only by capitalist property relations (private ownership of the major means of production), but also by the presence of a <italic>strong bureaucratic state</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0003122412441354">Weber 1958a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0003122412441354">1958b</xref>). In this view, modern states hold monopolies on legitimate violence within their territories, issuing money, and taxing the population. Modern states’ bureaucratic nature is created by separation of the office from the officeholder and use of formal rules in decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0003122412441354">Weber 1978</xref>). The rights of the office as well as the material goods it commands thus cannot be used at the discretion of the officeholder, especially not for personal gain. Weber believed that bureaucracies function well when they have an educated staff with an <italic>esprit de corps</italic> and sufficient material resources. When we speak of a “strong” state in this article, we mean a state that has what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0003122412441354">Mann (1986)</xref> termed <italic>infrastructural power</italic>: the ability to penetrate society and realize its objectives.</p>
<p>A bureaucratic state is essential to modern capitalism because in its absence, individual capitalists might resort to <italic>political capitalism</italic>—the use of personal relationships with state officials to create extra-market opportunities for profitable activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0003122412441354">Weber 1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0003122412441354">1978</xref>). In this scenario, sustained innovation and specialization are neglected, as capitalists circumvent market competition by pursuing political accumulation and strengthening their ties to government officials instead of carrying out productive investments. In addition, Weber recognized the essential role of strong nation-states in supporting capitalist growth by protecting and nurturing infant industries. Many other authors have emphasized the importance of states in providing fertile conditions for economic growth through the creation and maintenance of institutions, including adequate legal and regulatory frameworks, counter-cyclical demand stimulation, reliable information diffusion, a skilled and healthy workforce, and new technology development (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003122412441354">Block and Evans 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Our theoretical account is directly at odds with neoliberal explanations, because we argue that the closer a given country’s policies approximated the neoliberal goal of mass privatization, the worse its subsequent economic performance. This explanation is consistent with institutionalist and corruption-centered perspectives but goes beyond them by arguing that mass privatization <italic>itself</italic> damaged existing state institutions and increased corruption. We contribute to the (sociological) statist and social structural accounts by identifying an important mechanism responsible for the deleterious outcomes experienced by many transition societies: mass privatization leading to declining state revenues.</p>
<p>Countries that pursued mass privatization severely damaged their state capacity in two ways. First, privatization eliminated the profits of state-owned enterprises as a source of state revenue. Second, it created enterprises lacking strategic owners, which prompted severe agency problems, increasing the risk of firm failure, recourse to the nonmonetary economy, and nonpayment of taxes. The combined impact on the state’s budget led to a fiscal crisis, which weakened development of the very institutions needed for governing the private sector and undermined morale among the post-Soviet bureaucracy. Declining state capacity—fiscally and bureaucratically—promoted corruption and weak institutions, both of which contributed significantly to poor economic outcomes. The result was a vicious cycle of mutual reinforcement between a failing state and a failing economy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0003122412441354">Figures 2</xref> contrasts this theoretical logic with the neoliberal account.</p>

<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>Our theoretical framework suggests that mass privatization programs exert direct and indirect effects on post-communist state capacity. In the following section, we develop specific hypotheses concerning each causal pathway and contrast them with competing predictions.</p>
<sec id="section8-0003122412441354">
<title>Direct Effects of Mass Privatization on State Capacity</title>
<p>We argue that a post-socialist country’s choice to rapidly privatize its enterprise holdings immediately reduced that state’s financial capacity, due to high budgetary dependence on the earnings of state-owned firms. Advocates of neoliberal policies did not expect this fiscal shock to be particularly devastating for two reasons. First, proponents believed socialist states had been engaging in value-subtracting behavior by expending vast amounts of resources to prop up inefficient firms producing unneeded goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003122412441354">Gaddy and Ickes 2002</xref>). Radical privatization therefore had the potential to generate huge savings for the state. Second, they expected rising tax revenues from the superior growth of <italic>de novo</italic> private firms and the improving performance of privatized state enterprises to compensate for revenue shortfalls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0003122412441354">
<title>Indirect Effects of Mass Privatization on State Capacity</title>
<p>To avoid a state fiscal crisis as a result of mass privatization, the enterprise sector would have to grow and be taxed effectively. We argue that mass privatization accomplished precisely the opposite: worse enterprise performance coupled with the state’s declining capacity to tax firms.</p>
<p>Mass privatization programs, by design, led to greatly dispersed firm ownership. The new owners had only limited incentive to monitor firms, and more important, they lacked the capacity to exercise control over managers and employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122412441354">Ellerman 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0003122412441354">McDermott (2002)</xref> demonstrated that in the Czech Republic mass privatization greatly complicated corporate governance, causing assets to go unutilized because of ambiguous ownership situations that discouraged foreigners from investing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0003122412441354">3</xref></sup> Well-functioning regulatory and credit rating agencies or an independent business press might have mitigated the violation of shareholder rights, yet these institutions did not exist.</p>
<p>In most cases, newly mass privatized firms were cut off from state subsidies. Unlike firms privatized to strategic owners, however, they did not have access to resources such as investment capital, new managerial talent, or marketing networks, which would have been crucial for restructuring overstaffed and inefficient Soviet-era factories into globally competitive firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122412441354">King 2003</xref>). Faced with this situation, owners, managers, and workers, unable to work cooperatively for the betterment of their firms, tended to pursue short-term parasitic strategies to accumulate wealth, such as asset-stripping. Technologically obsolete firms now faced substantial external shocks and major internal problems.</p>
<p>Some firms responded to these multiple crises by reviving the practice of barter, which had evolved under the planning system to rectify deficiencies in the central allocation of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0003122412441354">Kornai 1980</xref>). Failing post-communist firms retreated to nonmarket mechanisms of exchange. They bartered and tolerated arrears from their customers, in turn failing to pay their suppliers and creating chains of inter-enterprise debt. Firms produced goods for the black market to avoid taxation and often fell behind on tax payments for legally produced goods. Some firms even started using nonofficial money printed by local governments. In effect, firms began to flout the government’s monopoly on creation of money and taxation of the economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0003122412441354">Woodruff 1999</xref>). We refer to these micro-strategies as <italic>nonmarket</italic> restructuring, which we distinguish from market-oriented strategies of developing new product lines, gaining quality accreditations, and increasing sales. These latter strategies are typical of firms in Western capitalism and generate more economic value for future taxation than do nonmarket activities. Furthermore, nonmarket transactions are much harder to tax than are normal monetary transactions. Firm-level responses to mass privatization thus further strained the state’s resources.</p>
<p>The resulting fiscal crisis meant the state was increasingly unable to pay its own staff. Undercompensated government bureaucrats were easily corrupted and provided favors and advantages to businessmen in exchange for bribes or other unofficial payments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0003122412441354">Pappe 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0003122412441354">Reddaway and Glinski 2001</xref>). In <italic>patrimonial capitalism</italic>, as Szelényi and his collaborators call it, personal ties between economic and political actors replace bureaucratic organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003122412441354">Eyal et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122412441354">King 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122412441354">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122412441354">King and Szelényi 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these considerations, we specify the following hypotheses:</p>
<list list-type="simple">

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Mass privatization reduces economic growth.</p></list-item>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Our analysis uses a multilevel approach, incorporating country- and firm-level data. This enables us to address fallacies that could arise from analysis of national-level data (overlooking mechanisms) or individual-level data (overlooking systemwide processes). Simultaneously, it allows us to model the causal mechanisms by which effects of privatization on firms affect the state, and effects of privatization on the state affect firms.</p>
<sec id="section11-0003122412441354">
<title>Cross-national data</title>
<p>On the national level, we report time-series and cross-sectional models using data on the social, economic, and political development of 25 post-communist countries, drawn from the World Bank World Development Indicators Database (2008 edition). In addition, we generated a novel measure of mass privatization based on historical records, including reports from the <italic>Transition Report</italic> series (EBRD 1994–2005). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003122412441354">Table 1</xref> summarizes the variables used in the cross-national models. We first analyze the entire sample of countries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0003122412441354">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0003122412441354">4</xref>). However, given historical differences between FSU satellite countries and core republics, we also provide separate analyses for the non-FSU and FSU blocks of countries (see Part E in the online supplement). We restricted our study to the period between 1990 and 2000. The starting point is justifiable in view of missing data for many countries in 1989 (moreover, several post-Soviet countries did not yet exist). By the late 1990s, the transitional recession was over in all countries of the post-communist world, and a new set of political and economic dynamics had emerged to create what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0003122412441354">Szelényi and Wilk (2010)</xref> term the Second Transition (involving the reform of social institutions such as the education and health sectors). While this region’s economic trajectories have displayed significant path-dependence, this dependence is not absolute. Political and economic developments are increasingly driven by other factors—for instance, the change in relative prices following Russia’s sovereign debt default and devaluation in 1998, the strong rise in oil and other commodity prices from the late 1990s onward, or the most recent global financial meltdown, which affected post-communist economies very unevenly. We therefore end our time series in 2000 (although extending it does not affect our statistical findings).</p>

<p>Two variables require further discussion: our measures of privatization and state capacity. Almost all existing analyses of privatization in the post-communist world use the EBRD’s indices of privatization progress. Our results are robust to use of these variables, but the EBRD measures are of limited analytic value because they do not distinguish between different privatization methods. Moreover, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0003122412441354">Stuckler, King, and Patton (2009)</xref> demonstrate, the residuals of a regression of these indicators on growth are nonrandom and are predicted by prior economic growth (implying that EBRD bureaucrats coded economically successful countries as being more effective privatizers than they actually were).</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to investigating the commonly used EBRD indices, we constructed a measure to reflect as accurately as possible the actual implementation of large-scale mass privatization programs. To do so, we specified whether a given country implemented a mass privatization program covering at least 25 percent of its large enterprise sector.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0003122412441354">4</xref></sup> Ideally, we would have used data on the rate of privatization for each country, as the number of existing firms (denominator) and the number of privatized firms (numerator) were changing. However, inconsistencies in government reporting of privatization and firm data to the international financial institutions made calculation of such a rate impossible for many countries. According to staff members at the EBRD, texts of its <italic>Transition Report</italic> series provide the entirety of the organization’s data on privatization, reporting public- and private-sector shares in several different ways: total assets of firms, total number of firms, and percent of total employment. All of these measures have advantages and disadvantages, but they are not commensurate. Table C1 in the online supplement reports our own best estimates of post-communist privatization, along with our coding decisions for each country. We confirmed the coding of our variable with the senior official overseeing mass privatization implementation at the World Bank, Ira Lieberman; he agreed with our coding of countries’ privatization programs, with the possible exception of Romania.</p>
<p>Constructing valid and reliable measures of the bureaucratic nature of the state or of state capacity is notoriously difficult. We used a variety of subjective measures of state capacity aggregated from firm-level survey data (perception of government efficiency, property rights enforcement and contract security, and prevalence of corruption), as well as an objective measure for the time-series analysis (total government spending). Comparative studies frequently measure state capacity by expressing government spending as a percentage of GDP. This is sensible, but it assumes there are no significant changes in the denominator during the period under investigation; given the significant economic contraction experienced by most countries in the post-communist world, this approach is not reasonable for the purpose of our study. In Russia, for instance, changes in the ratio of government spending to GDP were driven partially by deliberate attempts to reduce the size of government, but primarily by the rise of the shadow economy and the state’s inability to collect taxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0003122412441354">Popov 2004</xref>). Given these complications, we followed existing literature in measuring state fiscal capacity by considering changes in total government spending over the course of the transition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0003122412441354">
<title>Firm-level data</title>
<p>Our firm-level data are from the World Bank/EBRD Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) of 4,106 large and medium firms in 26 transition economies. Conducted between 1999 and 2000, the survey examines key aspects of governance and institutional support provided by the state, including business regulation and taxation, the legal and judicial system, infrastructure, and financial services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0003122412441354">World Bank and EBRD 2011</xref>). Specifically, BEEPS assesses how “the growth of firms, including their decisions to invest and to innovate, and the growth of firms’ revenues and productivity are affected by the functioning of government institutions, financial markets, and physical infrastructure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0003122412441354">World Bank and EBRD 2011</xref>). The survey is based on face-to-face interviews with firm managers and owners. It was designed to generate comparative measurements in areas such as corruption, state capture, lobbying, and quality of the business environment and reports a series of specific firm characteristics and performance measures. One strength of the survey in measuring corruption is its emphasis on the experience of service-users and managers, rather than experts’ and households’ perceptions. (Research finds the latter two generate a significant positive growth bias in studies of economic performance [see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0003122412441354">Knack 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0003122412441354">Kurtz and Schrank 2007</xref>]). The survey includes about 125 randomly sampled firms from each country, with larger samples for Poland and Ukraine (more than 200 firms), and an even larger sample for Russia (more than 500). Of the firms surveyed, 16 percent were privatized, 14 percent were state-owned, and the remaining 70 percent were new private firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0003122412441354">World Bank and EBRD 2011</xref>). We excluded Serbia and Turkey from our study, leaving a sample of 3,891 firms, of which 3,550 had complete data on the factors of interest.</p>
<p>If a firm was privatized in a country that we coded as having implemented a mass privatization program and this firm reported no foreign investment, we treat it as having been privatized via mass privatization. This creates a conservative bias in the variable, as many such firms were not in fact privatized by this method in mass-privatizing countries (see Parts B and C in the online supplement). Firms privatized by other methods likely suffered much less severe principal-agent problems (e.g., if they were privatized directly to firm insiders), or at least had access to new capital and markets (e.g., if they were acquired by a strategic owner) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003122412441354">King 2001b</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0003122412441354">Table 4</xref> reports regression results for the full sample of countries over time. Countries that underwent mass privatization, <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>, exhibited about 20 percent lower government spending than those that did not (Models 5 and 6). Countries that liberalized prices also displayed substantially lower levels of government spending. Because government spending is a component of GDP, we would expect GDP to decline by the amount attributable to mass privatization multiplied by the fraction of government spending in GDP. We found that mass-privatizing countries experienced, on average, a greater than 16 percent decrease in GDP per capita (Models 8 and 9). Price liberalization had a similar-sized negative effect, corroborating a finding by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0003122412441354">Popov (2007)</xref>. However, these firms would have been exposed to the potential adverse effects of mass privatization on the entire domestic enterprise sector.</p>

<p>Table E1 in the online supplement presents results of our regressions of government spending on mass privatization using the split sample. We found that in FSU countries, mass privatization was associated with a 22.8 percent drop in real government spending per capita from 1992 to 2000 (Model 12). Not surprisingly, oil was linked to greater government spending (capturing the spike in oil prices during the late 1990s). Similarly, greater democratization implied an average increase in government spending per capita of 4.82 percent among FSU countries (<italic>p</italic> = .008) but had no effect among non-FSU countries (<italic>β</italic> = −4.31, <italic>p</italic> = .39). We found no statistically significant effect for mass privatization in non-FSU countries once controls were implemented (Model 15). Price liberalization, however, did have a negative effect in this region. Given that the average increase in the EBRD liberalization score for non-FSU countries was 1.97 (range 0 to 4), this is substantial.</p>
<p>Table E2 in the online supplement presents results of our random-effects regressions of real GDP per capita on mass privatization. We found that privatization was associated with a 13.1 percent drop in real GDP per capita (Model 18), supporting the notion that mass privatization negatively affected growth through a reduction in state fiscal capacity, without a simultaneous compensation in benefits to investment, consumption, or exports. When holding constant trends in government spending, thus effectively blocking the mass privatization–state capacity–growth channel, we found no effect of mass privatization on growth among FSU countries (<italic>β</italic> = −5.01, <italic>p</italic> = .24; full results not reported).</p>

<sec id="section15-0003122412441354">
<title>Robustness Checks</title>
<p>We performed a series of robustness checks on our cross-national findings. First, we removed potential outliers according to a liberal definition of standard deviations in the residuals of greater than |2| (dropping Armenia in 1992, 1993, and 2000; Azerbaijan in 1992; Georgia in 1991 and 1994; and Tajikistan in 1991); we found that coefficients for mass privatization increased (<italic>β</italic> = −17.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Second, we introduced a set of country dummies, which left our coefficients for mass privatization unchanged. Third, we replicated our cross-national results using the EBRD index of privatization, producing results consistent with findings reported in Table F1 in the online supplement. In light of these robustness checks, the cross-national evidence supports our neo-Weberian theory linking mass privatization to declines in state capacity and growth.</p>

<title>Results of Firm-Level Analysis</title>
<p>For the micro-analysis, we adopted the modeling strategy used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003122412441354">King and Sznajder (2006)</xref>. We considered multiple indicators of firm performance and controlled for variables commonly used in firm-level analysis, all of which are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122412441354">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0003122412441354">Table 5</xref> presents our firm-level results. Enterprises privatized to domestic owners in countries that implemented mass privatization programs were 78 percent more likely to engage in barter than state-owned firms (Model 22), and 56 percent more likely to have overdue taxes (Model 30). They were also 41 percent less likely to have invested (Model 24), 36 percent less likely to have increased sales (Model 26), 58 percent less likely to have hired new employees (Model 28), 36 percent less likely to have developed a new product line (Model 32), and 26 percent less likely to have upgraded existing products (Model 34). Conversely, foreign-invested firms were 62 percent less likely to have engaged in barter (Model 22) and 53 percent less likely to have owed taxes (Model 30). Our micro-level findings are thus consistent with results from the cross-national analysis, indicating that adverse outcomes were significantly more prevalent among the firms we treat as having been mass privatized, whereas privatization to foreign owners (likely strategic investors) had positive effects on firm performance.</p>

<title>Political Economy of Mass Privatization and Potential Endogeneity</title>
<p>It is conceivable that our country- and firm-level results are misleading due to a sick-patient effect. That is, countries with weak states might have chosen mass privatization because they lacked the capacity to implement any other method of privatization. If these countries were going to suffer negative consequences regardless of their privatization strategy, the detrimental effects we attribute to mass privatization might simply be the result of an underlying lack of state capacity and thus be unrelated to the method of privatization.</p>
<p>We assessed the possibility of a sick-patient effect by reviewing the existing literature on the political economy of mass privatization. Leading historical accounts of property reform in the post-socialist world, as well as a large body of single-country case-study research, indicate that privatization strategies were politically motivated outcomes of conflicts among elites and, sometimes, other interest groups. Significantly, the choice to mass privatize was not predetermined by a weak state or any other structural feature (for Russia, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0003122412441354">Klebnikov 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0003122412441354">Medvedev 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0003122412441354">Reddaway and Glinski 2001</xref>). A glance at the regional diversity of privatization strategies supports this claim: countries in every region of the post-communist world adopted mass privatization, from the authoritarian states of Central Asia, to the managed democracies of the European FSU, to the liberal democracies of Central Europe.</p>
<p>While space does not permit a detailed discussion of the political economy of mass privatization for all cases, we cite analyses for 10 post-socialist countries that implemented mass privatization programs, which consistently suggest that privatization was driven by political motives (including ethnic, fiscal, anti-Russian, and interest group politics). We also provide a detailed discussion of the Russian case, given that country’s regional importance and former political centrality. These materials can be found in Part G of the online supplement.</p>
<p>The majority of scholars familiar with privatization strategies in the post-communist world agree that mass privatization was chosen not because a state lacked the capacity to implement alternative methods, but because of political motives—in particular, the desire to break the power of anti-reform coalitions and make the transition irreversible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0003122412441354">5</xref></sup> Indeed, it surely would have been easier to leave large enterprises under state ownership indefinitely, until an acceptable strategic owner emerged, as governments did in Belarus, Slovenia, Uzbekistan, and Poland.</p>
<p>Although policy choices partially depend on initial circumstances, notions of historical causality—in which such decisions are strictly determined by structural forces—fell out of sociological favor decades ago. Virtually the entire field of political and historical sociology has strongly rejected structural analysis that has no place for contingency and agency in explaining historical outcomes (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0003122412441354">Moore 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0003122412441354">Zeitlin 1984</xref>; for a review of trends in historical sociology, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122412441354">Clemens 2007</xref>). Therefore, positing that a radical and innovative privatization program that was controversial and fiercely contested was inevitable strikes us as implausible.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we investigated this possibility statistically by testing whether a range of commonly used initial conditions, including four measures of state capacity, were associated with adoption of mass privatization programs (see Table H1 in the online supplement). The only statistically significant finding relates to government transparency and points in the opposite direction (i.e., more transparent states were more likely to adopt mass privatization programs).</p>
<p>Next, we turned to evaluating a series of common hypotheses proposed in the literature to explain underlying causes of why some countries adopted mass privatization but others did not: regional diffusion, ethnic politicking, and pressure from international creditors. As the probit model reproduced in Table H2 of the online supplement shows, countries were more likely to pursue mass privatization if they were members of the FSU (about three times more likely—a regional diffusion effect); displayed greater degrees of ethno-linguistic fractionalization (both undermining civil society resistance and incentivizing domestic elites to use mass privatization to oust ethnic Russians from privileged managerial positions); had greater levels of democratic participation (used to legitimate the new regime and to consolidate democracy); and had borrowed from the International Monetary Fund in the previous year (pressure from external actors).</p>
<p>Overall, these findings are consistent with our understanding of privatization as a political decision, driven by domestic reformers aiming to legitimate new regimes or weaken political opponents, and in part facilitated by foreign actors.</p>
<p>Based on these models, we constructed a new variable assessing the <italic>hazard of implementing mass privatization</italic>. This approach captures observable factors that increased the likelihood of pursuing this policy (described earlier) and unobservable factors (obtained from the error term). In a second step, we added this control to our main equations for estimating the effect of mass privatization on GDP. As Part I in the online supplement shows, the effect we recorded was even larger than our original estimates (−42.7 percent, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), indicating that factors that predisposed countries to implement mass privatization would have been associated with higher GDP if mass privatization had not been implemented.</p>
<p>In summary, we found neither historical nor statistical evidence indicating a greater propensity among weak states to adopt mass privatization as a property reform strategy. Even if this hypothesis were true, our findings would still demonstrate that mass privatization contributed to a further weakening of state capacity via enterprise failure and reduced tax revenue. Even if weak states had been more likely to rely on mass privatization, choosing this method inflicted further damage on their state capacity (as can be inferred from our firm-level findings).</p>

<title>Political Economy of Firm Selection for Privatization</title>
<p>There is also potential for a selection bias acting at the firm-level. Countries implementing mass privatization programs may have selectively privatized weak and underperforming firms. As a result, any effect associated with privatization may simply reflect that bias. To address this possibility, we review evidence showing that (1) valid information on firm performance was unavailable, making firm selection based on performance very unlikely; (2) as a corollary, comparative firm-level data on pre-privatization conditions do not exist across countries; (3) to the extent firm selection may have occurred, there is evidence firms were chosen on a sectorwide basis rather than a firm-specific one; and (4) in the limited cases where within-sector firm selection occurred, better performing firms tended to privatize first.</p>
<p>First, to our knowledge, no firm-level dataset in existence contains the information on pre-privatization conditions needed to address the issue of potential endogeneity of firm selection on a cross-national basis. For the theoretical and empirical reasons described below, we believe it would be very difficult, if not altogether impossible, to construct such a dataset.</p>
<p>In theory, to capture initial firm conditions, one must accurately assess the value of fixed capital for individual firms, which could be used to predict a firm’s competitiveness in a liberalized market. In practice, however, accurate and detailed firm-by-firm data did not exist prior to privatization, as socialist central planners were generally not well-informed about individual enterprises’ resources (for a review of the literature, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0003122412441354">Szelényi, Beckett, and King 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003122412441354">Bauer (1983)</xref> describes the <italic>plan bargain</italic>—a system of organizational arrangements in which managers had economic incentives to stockpile resources and conceal information from central planners (see the seminal work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0003122412441354">Kornai 1980</xref>). In the period leading up to privatization, the partial marketization of the <italic>perestroika</italic> reforms engendered further information asymmetries, as managers began to set up separate corporate vehicles for the purpose of asset-stripping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122412441354">Ganev 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0003122412441354">Medvedev 2000</xref>). In some cases, managers and firm insiders undervalued firms by falsifying records, permitting them to buy the firm via privatization at a bargain price. Given this combination of factors, it is highly unlikely that states would have been able to use detailed information on firm performance as a criterion for firm selection. The Czech Center for Coupon Privatization, for example, published information on firms to be included in mass privatization with the explicit caveat that “much of the data [are] of dubious quality and may not be relevant in a rapidly changing economic situation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0003122412441354">Shafik 1995</xref>:1144).</p>
<p>The greatest obstacle to constructing a suitable dataset, however, is the inherent difficulty in using market economy performance evaluation criteria to measure the performance of firms prior to privatization. Although accounting records of late-socialist state enterprises included metrics of revenues, costs, profit, and productivity, these data cannot be analyzed through the performance lens used to evaluate firms in a free-market economy. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003122412441354">Held and Hill (1989</xref>:31) note in a study of the Soviet economy, “state-owned firms realise a money surplus only when the relation between the state-decreed purchase and sales prices allows for it. They are not free to employ the techniques of competition vis-à-vis sellers and buyers.”</p>
<p>Given these inherent limitations in the available data, few existing firm-level studies have attempted to statistically address potential endogeneity of performance-based selection for privatization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003122412441354">Djankov and Murrell (2002)</xref>, who conducted a meta-analysis of the existing research on privatization and firm restructuring, report that half of the more than 100 studies surveyed do not mention the issue of endogeneity at all. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122412441354">Hanousek, Kočenda, and Svejnar (2007)</xref>—who represent, to our knowledge, the first dataset designed to control for endogeneity, using firm-level initial (pre-privatization) conditions in a study of the Czech Republic—note in their literature review that many studies “have not been able to control adequately for endogeneity of ownership [firms not being selected for privatization at random],” and of those that do, “many treat the issue in a relatively haphazard way” (pp. 2–3).</p>
<p>Because we cannot address firm selection statistically, endogeneity remains a logical possibility, albeit we believe an unlikely one. Mass privatization, by design, did not occur on a case-by-case basis but instead followed a sectoral strategy. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0003122412441354">Lieberman (1997</xref>:2) explains in the introduction to a World Bank volume on the experience of mass privatization in transition economies: “Mass privatization is largely a systems approach to privatization. . . . The programs usually start with a selection process—for example, all medium-size and large enterprises in the tradables sector except very large or ‘strategic’ enterprises.”</p>
<p>Studies evaluating the determinants of privatization confirm that mass privatization was typically carried out on a sectoral basis. In a study of Russian mass privatization, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0003122412441354">Nureev and Runov (2002)</xref> compare lists of enterprises not subject to voucher privatization (by industry) at different points in time and infer from changes in these lists a desire of officials to privatize the most delicate enterprises last (i.e., assets in the oil, energy, chemical and petrochemical, aviation, and nuclear sectors).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0003122412441354">6</xref></sup> To the extent that sequencing occurred, a bias would have operated <italic>across</italic> sectors (e.g., privatizing agriculture early but delaying manufacturing); we are able to control for this in our analysis by using firm-sector dummy variables.</p>
<p>To the extent variation in privatization existed <italic>within sectors</italic>, research indicates that “better” firms were privatized first. That is, some countries selectively delayed privatization of the largest, most interlinked state-owned enterprises (considered “too big to fail”) but rapidly privatized smaller and more dynamic firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0003122412441354">King 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003122412441354">Gupta, Ham, and Svejnar (2008</xref>:204), in a recent analysis of government priorities and firm sequencing in the Czech mass privatization program, report “strong evidence that the Czech government privatized first firms that were more profitable.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0003122412441354">Szentpéteri and Telegdy (2010)</xref> report similar results in a study of Romanian mass privatization, although they note that an overarching objective of the government in selecting firms was employment preservation, which outweighed even potential efficiency gains from privatization. To our knowledge, no existing research or data suggest that firms with the least potential were selectively privatized under mass privatization programs.</p>
<p>As a final robustness check, we used the statistical method of constructing a measure of the hazard of privatization described earlier but applied to the firm-level. Again, we used a two-step procedure: first, we estimated the probability that a firm was privatized based on a set of observed characteristics of the firm, including its performance. Then, we used this model to combine observed and unobserved characteristics into a new variable, the hazard of privatization, and incorporated it into the models assessing the relationship between privatization and firm performance. As Part J in the online supplement shows, none of our earlier results were qualitatively altered; in the case of barter, our results became stronger because we found firms with greater underlying hazard of privatization to have lower risks of negative outcomes. This finding is consistent with existing scholarship on firm selection and further suggests that any unobserved firm-selection bias was in the opposite direction of our hypothesis.</p>

<title>Discussion and Limitations</title>
<p>Based on country- and firm-level evidence, our analysis indicates that mass privatization negatively affected state capacity via two central mechanisms. Mass privatization directly weakened the state’s revenue base, and this decline was not offset by enterprise growth because, as we demonstrated, mass privatization also had negative effects on the business environment. The available data on state capacity are limited, but we employed six different measures in our analysis. Using cross-national longitudinal data, we showed that mass privatization created a fiscal shock to the state that significantly diminished government revenues and spending. Using firm-level data, we determined that mass privatization negatively affected state capacity in three areas: government inefficiency, unofficial payments/bribery, and weakened protection of property rights. Finally, we presented evidence that privatized firms were more likely to rely on barter and accumulate tax arrears, both of which indicate the state’s weakened capacity to maintain control of its own fiscal and monetary system.</p>
<p>These findings contrast with the neoliberal prediction that mass privatization would promote firm restructuring and combat weak corporate governance, ultimately leading to stronger growth. They are, however, consistent with the leading postmortem explanations (by economists and sociologists) insofar as weak institutions and poor governance were major causes of the post-communist economic recession. Our model goes beyond this understanding by showing that the capacity of post-communist states, itself contingent on domestic policy choices, played a crucial role in determining subsequent economic performance. Thus, while we agree with sociological work emphasizing the centrality of the state, we isolate fiscal effects of mass privatization as a key mechanism producing poor economic and political performance.</p>
<p>Our results also support the gradualist and statist critiques of rapid liberalization, as well as social structural analyses emphasizing the importance of FDI. Although not a central focus of this article, in many of our models, the EBRD liberalization index had a large negative effect on both government spending and GDP growth. The micro-data also provide some evidence for the beneficial effects of FDI: foreign-invested firms bartered less and paid their taxes more promptly than did domestic-owned companies. Including FDI as a percent of GDP in the regression models had no effect (results not reported), likely because foreign investment was simply not prevalent enough in mass-privatizing countries to make a difference. Indeed, mass privatization’s designers viewed it as an alternative to waiting for foreign investors, whom they expected to be hesitant to invest in gigantic Soviet-era combines during a time of considerable political and economic uncertainty. The decision to mass privatize was thus also a decision not to rely on FDI.</p>
<p>One limitation of our study is that, while we documented effects of mass privatization on a variety of measures of state capacity at the national and firm levels, we did not model the causal chain to demonstrate the effect of state capacity on economic growth (beyond a direct effect on lower government spending, which, by design, is a substantial component of GDP). However, as noted earlier, social scientists and policymakers have increasingly recognized that state capacity is a crucial determinant of, and precondition for, balanced economic growth—a trend also reflected in recent policy reports of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0003122412441354">World Bank (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0003122412441354">2002</xref>). Additionally, corroborating our firm-level insights, our macro-level path analysis supports the hypothesis that the effect of mass privatization on growth operated principally through a reduction in state capacity (as measured by per capita spending); preliminary evidence from this region also shows that government spending has had economically stimulating effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0003122412441354">7</xref></sup> Although we used six indicators of state capacity, the enterprise- and country-level measures are limited (especially the fiscal indicators). Future studies should attempt to better assess bureaucratic capacity and its variations across countries and over time.</p>
<p>Still, it is conceivable that a potential unobserved third factor accounts for the observed link between mass privatization and weakened state capacity. If this hypothesis were correct, however, this factor would arguably constitute no more than a distant determinant on the causal chain. Given that mass privatization was implemented across subregions with divergent historical trajectories, it is unlikely that a single underlying factor simultaneously affected state capacity and the privatization strategy chosen by different post-socialist governments. Our models and a detailed comparative review of the historical cases indicate that domestic intra-elite competition, ethnic politics, and regional diffusion all played significant roles in determining the method of privatization. At the firm-level, there is also potential for selection based on performance, leading to spurious estimates of effects of privatization. However, just as data were unavailable to policymakers in assessing pre-privatization performance and market values of firms (and thus this was unlikely to have been a major component of selection), so, too, is this information not accessible to researchers today. Where information is available, its validity is dubious, as managers and firm insiders with vested interests made deliberate attempts to falsify records and undervalue firms in order to purchase them at bargain prices. Moreover, mass privatization programs were designed to privatize entire sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0003122412441354">Lieberman 1997</xref>) (which we control for using firm-sector dummy variables); to the extent that within-sector selection occurred, better-performing firms tended to be privatized earlier in the process. Nevertheless, as with nearly any statistical analysis, there is a possibility that both our cross-national time series and our firm-level results are subject to endogeneity—in the former case due to spurious causality (ecological fallacy), and in the latter case due to selection biases. Future research should attempt to refine our understanding of the political economy of mass privatization and, in particular, the issue of firm selection. While we do not suggest mass privatization was the only factor reducing state capacity, we are confident we have demonstrated it was a key factor undermining state capacity and, as a result, economic growth.</p>
<p>Finally, two unusual country cases merit a brief discussion. The most important outlier of the post-communist world, that is, the country that implemented mass privatization according to our definition but nonetheless had good overall performance and managed to attract a large amount of FDI, is the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic was the second-richest country in the region, owed little external debt, had a long and celebrated history of industrial production stemming from its time as the economic powerhouse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, had a ready-made pre-communist legal tradition of contract and property rights, and had a privileged location bordering Germany. Still, by 1999, the Czech Republic recorded the worst scores in Central and Eastern Europe on protection of property rights, government effectiveness, and rate of growth. Moreover, case-study data demonstrate that companies privatized through vouchers experienced substantial governance problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0003122412441354">King 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003122412441354">2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0003122412441354">McDermott 2002</xref>), and many voucher-privatized firms were renationalized before ultimately being sold to foreign investors.</p>
<p>Another, perhaps less obvious, outlier is China. Although some Chinese reformers did consider mass privatization as a policy option in the period leading up to 1989, systematic efforts to privatize the country’s medium- and large-scale state enterprises did not begin until about 1995. We excluded China from our analysis of mass privatization programs, but including it would have invariably strengthened our statistical findings, given our coding method and the fact that China has been the fastest-growing economy in the world and is widely acknowledged to have a better-performing state than most other post-Soviet countries (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003122412441354">Burawoy 1996</xref>). Nonetheless, we include a brief overview of Chinese privatization in Part G of the online supplement, as we believe it constitutes an illustrative comparative case.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>As our findings show, mass privatization programs directly undermined state fiscal capability. They also damaged the enterprise sector, and thus indirectly contributed to a further weakening of the state’s bureaucratic capacity and its ability to support the institutions necessary for a functioning capitalist economy. Rather than accelerating the formation of private property and securing a smooth transition to Western-style capitalism, as advocates of mass privatization intended, these programs precipitated state withdrawal and pushed countries in the direction of crony or political capitalism. A large and growing body of empirical evidence shows that a different type of capitalism, emphasizing patron-client ties and a nonbureaucratic state, emerged in parts of the FSU and Eastern Europe. Meanwhile, countries that proceeded more gradually in creating a private sector, such as Poland and Slovenia, are now much closer to the Western capitalist ideal, with a relative separation of politics and economics (for details, see the literature review in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122412441354">King and Szelényi 2005</xref>). To be sure, we are not claiming that mass privatization is the only path to post-communist patrimonialism (Bulgaria, for instance, constitutes a clear case of patrimonial capitalism but did not implement a mass privatization program). Yet by contributing to a fiscal crisis and creating severe governance problems, mass privatization certainly provided a fertile ground for activities conducive to patrimonialism (e.g., funneling assets, official corruption, solicitation of kickbacks, and privatizing the means of administration).</p>
<p>Of course, there was widespread <italic>horizontal</italic> corruption during the Soviet era (e.g., gifts or informal payments made to service providers), which occurred as a rational response to the shortage economy. Prior to privatization, however, it was extremely rare to see <italic>vertical</italic> corruption, such as bribing police officers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0003122412441354">Reddaway and Glinski 2001</xref>). Post-transition, the state and the enterprise sector became riddled with patron-client relationships (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122412441354">Ganev 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122412441354">King and Szelényi 2005</xref>). Furthermore, while reliable comparative data on corruption levels is hard to obtain (given the unobservable nature of successful corruption), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0003122412441354">Popov (2004)</xref> finds that various proxy measures (e.g., unofficial payments, barter, homicide, and crime rates) have recorded dramatic increases since the beginning of the transition. Our analysis begins to explain how this further deterioration in governance occurred.</p>
<p>Our results do not indicate that mass privatization was the only determinant of post-communist economic performance. We are, however, claiming that it explains a substantial amount of the variation in performance. Future analysis might arrive at a more differentiated picture by employing improved measures of other types of transition policies (e.g., price and trade liberalization). Undoubtedly, external factors, such as relative prices, are causally important as well. Finally, as sociologists we never doubted that initial conditions are important, and our Hausman-Taylor tests indicate that we have statistically accounted for the most relevant ones in our models that were disaggregated into former Soviet core and satellite countries.</p>
<p>Our findings have several theoretical and policy implications. For sociological theory, our analysis supports the position that states and markets are not antagonistic entities as maintained by the neoliberal perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003122412441354">Block 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003122412441354">Block and Evans 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003122412441354">Evans 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122412441354">Fligstein 2001</xref>). It also supports the traditional sociological thesis of the importance of a bureaucratic state for successful capitalist development (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003122412441354">Evans 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003122412441354">Evans and Rauch 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0003122412441354">Weber 1978</xref>). Regarding public policy, our analysis suggests that when designing major economic reforms, particularly concerning private-sector development, safe-guarding government revenues and state capacity ought to be a high priority. Counting on a future burst of productivity from a restructured private economy to compensate for declining tax revenues appears a risky proposition, given the post-communist experience.</p>
<p>Our analysis cannot resolve whether neoliberal predictions about privatization in Eastern Europe were logically faulty per se or whether their implementation—the privatization process—crucially modified its outcomes. Two central predictions of the theory of mass privatization as a property reform strategy, that the state’s fiscal shock would be compensated by (1) savings from overcoming inefficient planning and (2) additional revenues raised from the superior growth of <italic>de novo</italic> private firms, are not borne out in available data. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003122412441354">Kogut and Spicer’s (2002)</xref> qualitative study of mass privatization in Russia and the Czech Republic found, privatization had adverse effects on governance and restructuring. Our data corroborate this finding across the region and further show that tax collection was more difficult among newly privatized firms.</p>
<p>Privatization will likely remain a salient issue in coming years. As three senior World Bank officials note in a recent volume on privatization in transition economies, “What still amazes many of us who worked on privatization throughout this period in the transition countries is how quickly the transformation happened. However, there is more to do with respect to privatization in many countries in the region and transition economies elsewhere in the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0003122412441354">Lieberman et al. 2008</xref>:59). As recently as 2008, Egypt considered implementing a mass privatization program, distributing public company shares to some 40 million Egyptian citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0003122412441354">Saif and Choucair 2008</xref>). Morocco and Tunisia contemplated similar policies following the 2011 Arab Spring and invited the EBRD to consult on the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0003122412441354">EBRD 2011</xref>). Whenever such large-scale economic restructurings take place, there is potential for unintended consequences that can fundamentally alter a program’s implementation and outcomes. Only if we carefully measure the economic, political, and social consequences of past reform strategies will we be able to avoid repeating their mistakes in the future.</p>

<p>Two of the principal advisors described the program’s differences from prior (Western) instances of privatization: “We are advocating the rapid conversion of state enterprises into corporate form and the distribution of tranches of shares to various groups in the population, including workers, commercial banks, pension funds, and mutual funds. This strategy differs substantially from the standard methods of privatisation that have been used in the West: the sale of shares in an initial public offering and private placements to investor groups. The free distribution of shares helps to sidestep the difficult, costly, and time-consuming process of enterprise valuation, as well as the scarcity of financial capital in private hands in Eastern Europe. More importantly, corporatization combined with the free distribution of shares can occur quickly. Rapid privatisation is needed to combat the inevitable social, political, and economic problems associated with the lack of corporate governance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0003122412441354">Lipton and Sachs 1990b</xref>:333).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0003122412441354">McDermott (2002)</xref> is part of a small group of scholars who criticized mass privatization for its potential to obstruct governance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122412441354">Ellerman (1998</xref>, 2003) was the first to provide a theoretical argument for expecting a governance disaster following mass privatization due to inevitable principal-agent problems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0003122412441354">Spicer, McDermott, and Kogut (2000)</xref> reported supporting evidence from several sectoral case studies in Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0003122412441354">Kogut and Spicer (2002)</xref> provided extensive elite interview data from the Czech Republic and Russia, showing that mass privatization created governance patterns that inhibited investment due to uncertainty over asset ownership. King provided further case-study evidence for the Czech Republic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003122412441354">2001b</xref>) and Russia (2003), linking firm failure to diffused ownership structures resulting from mass privatization. Our own theory can be seen as an extension of this body of work, offering systematic quantitative support for the basic proposition and extending the theory to emphasize fiscal effects of mass privatization.</p>

<p>For a country to be coded as having implemented a mass privatization program, the government had to have formally declared such a program. Some countries had announcements but the actual program was never implemented, or not implemented among large enterprises (e.g., in the case of Polish mass privatization [see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003122412441354">King and Sznajder 2006</xref>]). In practice, all mass privatization programs that were implemented combined vouchers with different management and employee ownership programs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003122412441354">Hanley, King, and Tóth 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0003122412441354">King 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003122412441354">2001b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122412441354">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122412441354">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003122412441354">King and Sznajder 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>In fact, existing scholarship indicates that state capacity was generally much higher prior to the transition to capitalism. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122412441354">Ganev (2007</xref>:1) points out, “a consensus has coalesced around the viewpoint that the transformative processes . . . precipitated a rapid and radical weakening of state structures.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0003122412441354">Popov (2004)</xref> summarizes the available statistical evidence for Russia, demonstrating that state capacity collapsed during the transition. While there was some variation in state capacity during the late socialist period, we do not believe it can account for the sharp divergence in subsequent performance. To the extent that variation existed, we expect to capture it in our statistical analysis controlling for initial GDP and level of education.</p>

<p>This relationship is best investigated by calculating the Keynesian multiplier (i.e., the additional growth associated with $1 of government spending). Government spending is considered a stimulus when $1 of additional government spending is associated with &gt;$1 of economic growth. When evaluating this relationship cross-nationally using our fixed-effects model, the coefficient describing this relationship is 1.55, indicating that each $1 of government spending is associated with a $1.55 increase in overall growth. In other words, after subtracting government spending from GDP, each $1 of government spending is associated with a $.55 increase in investment, consumption, or net exports.</p>
