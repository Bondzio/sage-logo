<abstract>
<p>Community-based obesity prevention efforts are an essential component of a public health approach to obesity and chronic disease risk reduction. Afterschool programs can participate by providing healthy snacks and regular physical activity. Although efficacious obesity prevention strategies have been identified, they have not been widely implemented. The authors describe the development of A+, a quality improvement (QI) toolkit designed to help YMCA afterschool programs implement healthy eating and physical activity guidelines. YMCA of the USA Health Promotion Standards for afterschool sites specify eliminating sugar-sweetened beverages and trans fats; providing fruits, vegetables, and water; and ensuring at least 30 minutes of physical activity daily. Field tests of A+ indicated that a QI toolkit for community-based afterschool programs can be implemented by a program director across multiple program sites, responds to programmatic needs, appropriately identifies barriers to improvement, and permits development of locally appropriate improvement plans. The QI approach holds promise for public health efforts and for field research to evaluate promising interventions by helping ensure full implementation of health promotion strategies.</p>

<title>Background and Literature Review</title>
<p>Community-based health promotion efforts are an essential component of a public health approach to obesity and chronic disease risk reduction. Although many obesity prevention studies have taken place in schools, the collective impact of these efforts has been modest(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912455644">Brown &amp; Summerbell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839912455644">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524839912455644">Whitlock, O’Conner, Williams, Beil, &amp; Lutz, 2010</xref>), and experts now call for greater involvement by other community programs and primary care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912455644">Gittelsohn &amp; Kumar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839912455644">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2008</xref>). Afterschool programs hold great promise in this regard. Collectively, they serve more than 8 million U.S. children annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912455644">Afterschool Alliance, 2010</xref>), and many are multisite providers with potential economies of scale. Afterschool programs that can translate expert dietary and physical activity recommendations into daily program practices can therefore contribute greatly to obesity and chronic disease prevention efforts.</p>
<p>A substantial scientific basis supports such program-level, or environmental, approaches to health promotion. These contrast with individual-level efforts by reducing or eliminating access to unhealthy options within the program. Social ecological models posit that organizations influence individual behavior through practices and norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912455644">Stokols, 1992</xref>), and empirical research shows that children’s food choices and physical activity are influenced by availability, physical environment, peers, and adult role models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912455644">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839912455644">Nestle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839912455644">Sallis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839912455644">Shepherd, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839912455644">Stroebele &amp; De Castro, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839912455644">Tergerson &amp; King, 2002</xref>). Environmental interventions in afterschool programs have succeeded in improving the eating environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912455644">Mozaffarian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839912455644">Story, Kaphingst, Robinson-O’Brien, &amp; Glanz, 2008</xref>), increasing physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912455644">Dzewaltowski et al., 2010</xref>), and improving students’ body composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912455644">Gutin, Yin, Johnson, &amp; Barbeau, 2008</xref>), and many tools and resources are available to help in this regard (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niost.org/Curricula-and-Toolkits">http://www.niost.org/Curricula-and-Toolkits</ext-link>). In other studies, the quality of afterschool menu and physical activity offerings varies widely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912455644">Beets, Huberty, &amp; Beighle, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912455644">Coleman, Geller, Rosenkranz, &amp; Dzewaltowski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839912455644">Trost, Rosenkranz, &amp; Dzewaltowski, 2008</xref>). Although there is substantial interest in the afterschool field in improving health promoting practices, leaders caution that many community-based programs will require substantial training and support to alter food procurement and physical activity practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524839912455644">Wiecha, Hall, Gannett, &amp; Roth, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>How can we promote high-quality implementation of health promotion policies in the afterschool setting? It is well known that service organizations frequently experience problems translating policies into practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912455644">Glasgow &amp; Emmons, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912455644">Glasgow, Lichtenstein, &amp; Marcus, 2003</xref>). Approaches that incorporate principles from the quality improvement (QI) literature warrant careful consideration in this regard. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912455644">Riley et al. (2010)</xref> define QI in public health as “continuous and ongoing efforts to achieve measurable improvements in . . . indicators of quality in services or processes . . .” (p. 6). QI processes typically assess baseline status, set priorities, plan for improvement, and monitor progress. The improvement process may also include staff training and support, revising plans to reflect new data, celebrating success, and sustaining target behaviors. Although QI approaches need to be context specific to support organizational variation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912455644">Fixsen, Naoom, Blase, Friedman, and Wallace (2005)</xref> identify five generalizable practices that help organizations attain and sustain changes in practice: preservice training, ongoing coaching, staff evaluation, program evaluation, and facilitative administrative supports.</p>
<p>Little work on health promotion QI has taken place in child care or afterschool settings. In the child care field, the major example is the Nutrition and Physical Activity Self-Assessment for Child Care, which follows QI principles and uses an outside consultant to help programs serving 2- to 5-year-olds implement improvement plans in nutrition and physical activity. A randomized trial suggested a modest intervention effect among the subset of intervention sites that completed the program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524839912455644">Ward et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the afterschool setting, YMCAs have engaged in QI efforts for several years. YMCA of the USA adopted evidence-based health promotion standards (HPS; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839912455644">Table 1</xref>) for afterschool programs in 2004 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/prc/ymca/resources.html">http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/prc/ymca/resources.html</ext-link>). The HPS specified healthy eating and physical activity targets based on expert recommendations for reducing risk for obesity and related disorders. They reflected still-current dietary recommendations for reducing or eliminating sugar-sweetened beverages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912455644">Barlow, 2007</xref>); avoiding foods high in trans fats, saturated fats, and sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839912455644">U.S. Department of Agriculture &amp; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010</xref>); and eating at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912455644">Barlow, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839912455644">Stallings, Suitor, &amp; Taylor, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839912455644">U.S. Department of Agriculture &amp; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010</xref>). The HPS also reflected then-current recommendations that children obtain at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily; these guidelines have expanded to include cardiovascular-, muscle-, and bone-strengthening components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839912455644">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008</xref>). The HPS were written to translate such recommendations into feasible afterschool program practices.</p>

<p>A sequence of projects focused on increasing implementation of the HPS among YMCA afterschool programs. Initial projects used learning collaboratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839912455644">Institute for Healthcare Improvement, 2003</xref>) and demonstrated high perceived utility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524839912455644">Wiecha, Nelson, Roth, Glashagel, &amp; Vaughan, 2010</xref>) and significant impact on snack quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912455644">Mozaffarian et al., 2010</xref>). When subsequent efforts demonstrated that the learning collaborative approach was difficult to scale up, we were stimulated to develop an alternative QI model. In the current study, we describe formative and pilot test results of A+, a QI toolkit for health promotion in afterschool programs.</p>

<title>Methods, Strategies, and Intervention Applications</title>
<p>A+ is a QI toolkit originally created for YMCA afterschool programs seeking to improve their health promotion capacity. The design team’s (JLW and CH) goals were to create a toolkit that would be acceptable, useful, and impactful in a field with about 30% annual staff turnover, diverse physical settings and organizational infrastructure, and largely part-time staff unlikely to have extensive experience with a health promotion or QI initiative.</p>
<sec id="section3-1524839912455644">
<title>Toolkit Description</title>
<p>A+ comprises a PowerPoint deck and paper tools addressing Awareness, Assessment, Action Planning, Accountability, and Achievement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839912455644">Figure 1</xref>). The deck explains the HPS, the A+ process, and the responsibilities of site directors (staff that manage one site) and program directors (staff that oversee site directors). The tools are gap and capacity-building assessments and action-planning templates. An A+ coordinator, typically the program director, guides staff through A+.</p>

<title>Awareness</title>
<p>The PowerPoint deck begins with an in-depth explanation of the HPS. Programs with adequate awareness of their health promotion targets can move to the next step, Assessment. A+ provides a framework for building awareness if needed.</p>

<sec id="section5-1524839912455644">
<title>Assessment</title>
<p>Sites assess program practices and identify gaps (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839912455644">Table 2</xref>) using simple program observation tools for physical activity and snacks. Next, they identify causes for low implementation using a list of 59 “capacity-building needs” (CBNs), 30 on the physical activity assessment and 29 on the healthy eating assessment. CBNs are both technical (e.g., “we don’t have a refrigerator”) and nontechnical, related to knowledge, skills, or attitudes.</p>

<title>Action Planning, Accountability, and Achievement</title>
<p>The action-planning tool is a template for site-specific and program-level plans to prioritize, select, and reach HPS goals. Users identify starting gaps and CBNs from their assessments. They then decide where to focus initial efforts and identify incremental action steps, persons responsible, and target dates. Program directors review each site’s assessment and identify common themes to guide this process. The tool need not be used in the form provided, and users are encouraged to adapt it but maintain the basic components.</p>
<p>The Accountability component encourages program directors to monitor progress using the Action Plans as a basis for praise, coaching, and mentoring. As the sites reach their goals, they move into “Achievement,” defined as daily practice of the HPS. A+ encourages programs to use the Assessment steps periodically to monitor sustainability. If sites have reverted to earlier practices, program directors work with staff to refocus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1524839912455644">
<title>Research Strategy</title>
<p>We obtained feedback on toolkit design in three rounds of formative testing and subsequently piloted the final toolkit in a multisite YMCA afterschool program in New Hampshire. The Institutional Review Board at UMass Boston (University of Massachusetts Boston) reviewed and approved the test protocols.</p>
<p>First, to gauge whether A+ duplicated other resources, we obtained feedback from four school and afterschool health promotion leaders from a metropolitan school district, a statewide organization, and two national nonprofit organizations. All individuals reviewed the toolkit on their own and afterward participated in an interview with the project director to obtain preliminary impressions of utility and whether A+ was similar to other instruments. We also conducted additional Internet searches. Neither method yielded a similar afterschool tool that addressed healthy eating and physical activity and included the implementation approach and five components of A+.</p>
<p>In spring 2010, we conducted our second test. We pretested the beta PowerPoint deck, assessment, and planning tools in 1-hour discussion groups among 16 afterschool staff from three YMCAs in three states (Maine, New Hampshire, and Connecticut) to gauge content and visual appeal. Response was positive, with minor recommendations for alterations in flow and content. After revising the materials, we presented A+ to approximately 20 individuals attending a national conference workshop. Participants observed the slide deck, practiced using the tools, and provided input via discussion.</p>
<p>After further modification, in late spring 2010, we conducted a third field test to assess the utility, acceptability, appropriateness, and complexity of A+. The setting was 10 program sites representing four YMCAs, two in Pennsylvania and one each in Georgia and California. Two to four staff from each site participated. In each city, staff attended a 2-hour in-person training by the project director. Sites had 4 weeks to complete the assessment and action-planning process—we assessed actual progress in a separate pilot (below). The research team (JLW and CH) then conducted a 1-hour telephone interview with each site. Interview questions covered four areas. To assess utility, we asked whether the toolkit helped identify strengths, gaps, and opportunities for improvement and whether it could make a difference in program quality. To assess appeal, we asked about appearance, layout, and organization and whether items felt comfortable or threatening. To assess acceptability and fit, we asked if (a) the tool supported the organization’s mission and culture, (b) the amount of time required was acceptable, and (3) it had been feasible to bring others into the process. We also asked about perceived complexity of the tool. Summary comments were also invited. The research team each transcribed comments and compared findings to identify major discrepancies in interpretation (none). Notes were combined into one document and similar comments were grouped together.</p>
<p>Field testers reported that A+ was useful for helping them identify their strengths and weaknesses. Some were pleased with the current quality of their programs, and others identified gaps to address. Participants reported that the tool was comprehensive and made minor suggestions for improvement. The action-planning component effectively resulted in new plans for implementing the HPS. One person described the strength of the process as “If you don’t know . . . then you don’t know how to do it better,” and several identified new information, such as the importance of reading food labels, that they would incorporate into their program practices. Comments indicated A+ would improve program quality, was easy to use, not overly complex, and took a reasonable amount of time. Filling out the forms took anywhere from 1 to 4 hours depending on how teams approached the task. There were requests to add places for children’s input, to provide sample time lines, and to provide “best practice” examples for sites new to the standards. With their feedback, we made further improvements to the instruments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1524839912455644">
<title>Pilot Test</title>
<p>Following the formative tests, between November 2010 and June 2011, we pilot tested A+ at the Southern District YMCA (SD-YMCA) in New Hampshire. The test’s purpose was to assess feasibility and impact using both quantitative and qualitative data. We were interested in both site- and program-level impact.</p>
<p>The SD-YMCA is a mature organization with 25 years of experience operating afterschool programs, which currently serve over 500 children per day in 12 sites. In March 2011, SD-YMCA joined the YMCA of the USA’s Activate America movement, which required adoption of the HPS. Activate America was a national effort by YMCA of the USA to respond to the chronic disease epidemic and has segued into the current YMCA focus area on healthy living. SD-YMCA entered the A+ project with strong executive support.</p>
<p>Staff from 11 of the 12 sites attended face-to-face training by the A+ project director (KM) in November 2010. The afterschool program director coordinated assessment, action planning, and reassessment. Site staff completed baseline assessments and created action plans as needed in December and January. They were asked to work on the plans and fill out the assessments again in May 2011. Baseline assessments, action plans, and follow-up assessments were collected by the program director and copies were forwarded to UMass Boston for review; assessment data were entered into an Excel spreadsheet. The site that did not attend the training did not participate in subsequent activities.</p>
<p>To assess individual sites’ progress on action plans, we compared the baseline and follow-up reports of HPS implementation and examined whether items that sites flagged on their action plans actually improved. On the assessments at baseline and follow-up, sites could identify their status on each of the nine HPS as needing no improvement, “meeting the standard but want to improve,” “close to meeting the standard,” or “not even close.” Unless a site determined that an HPS did not need improvement, we scored other responses as an “improvement opportunity” (IO). With 11 sites and nine HPS, there were 99 potential IO. We tracked overall progress and progress on IO that sites flagged within their action plans. In addition, we tallied the CBNs identified on the assessment by each site.</p>
<p>We obtained program-level data on utility and impact by aggregating assessment data across sites and through written and verbal debriefing with the program director after completing the pilot. Her qualitative feedback was useful for interpreting the quantitative data and providing perspective on utility and impact.</p>

<title>Impact of A+ on Assessment, Action Planning, and Progress</title>
<p>All 11 participating sites submitted baseline A+ assessments; 8 of them developed action plans, and 3 determined that they met the HPS at baseline or only needed to make minor adjustments. In May 2011, 10 of the 11 sites submitted follow-up assessments. We use data from the 11 baseline assessments and 10 follow-ups below.</p>
<p>On visual inspection, action plans appropriately identified at least one target HPS, steps, target dates, and persons responsible. Sites were allowed to select which gaps to focus on, and actual selection varied across sites.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1524839912455644">Table 3</xref> summarizes sites’ activities. Progress toward action plans was evident. At baseline, there were 50 instances of sites meeting HPS, leaving 49 IO among 11 sites. Thirteen of these (9 in healthy eating and 4 in physical activity) were targeted for improvement within action plans at the site level. Among these 13, according to staff report, 6 were fully attained at follow-up, including 4/9 in healthy eating and 2/4 in physical activity. Of the remaining 7 targeted IO, 1 improved (healthy eating), 3 had no change, 1 declined, and we did not receive follow up reports on 2. Examined differently, at baseline there were 50 occurrences of sites meeting standards versus 62 at follow-up (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1524839912455644">Table 3</xref>). Of the 12 HPS attained during the follow-up period, 6 were in healthy eating (4 targeted in action plans) and 6 were in physical activity (2 targeted in action plans). These scores indicate that action plans stimulated progress and that additional mechanisms also produced improvement, such as program-wide efforts stimulated by baseline data and described below.</p>

<p>A+ also identified HPS that required attention at the program level across multiple sites. Sites were most likely to report they were meeting the HPS related to not watching television (7 sites), not serving sugar-sweetened beverages (8), and serving only 100% juice when they served juice (10). They were least likely to report that they met the HPS for vigorous activity (3 sites), whole grains/less sugar (3), and reducing saturated/trans fats (4).</p>
<p>The assessment process was successful in identifying themes among the sites’ CBNs at baseline. The assessments list 59 CBNs, 30 for Physical activity and 29 for healthy eating. Nine sites identified at least 1 CBN with a range of 1 to 22 per site. Six sites identified at least one of the 29 Healthy Eating CBNs (range 1-10 per site), and 13 of the Healthy Eating CBNs were selected by at least one site. Seven sites identified at least 1 of the 30 physical activity CBNs (range 1-12), and 15 physical activity CBNs were selected by at least one site.</p>
<p>A+ assessments were able to identify two program-wide CBNs. The CBN items chosen most often mentioned parent engagement practices and physical facilities such as playgrounds and kitchens. Parent engagement–related items were selected 9 times in the healthy eating assessment and 11 times in the physical activity assessment. Concerns about budget accounted for only 4 Healthy Eating CBNs selected and 1 physical activity CBN. Surprisingly, staff turnover was only cited as a challenge twice. Several sites selected the CBN indicating they had previously been unaware of the HPS.</p>

<title>Qualitative Program-Wide Impact</title>
<p>The program director reported that A+ was feasible and useful and stimulated program-wide improvements related to healthy eating, physical activity, use of information for program planning, and infrastructure. She was overall successful in coordinating the process of assessment, action planning, and reassessment across multiple sites. Prior to using A+, the program had not had a means of coordinating or tracking HPS implementation across the 12 sites. With A+, the program obtained aggregable information, and sites could discuss and share challenges and best practices. Several program-wide changes occurred that stemmed from baseline information and discussion and were in addition to site-specific action plans. For example, sites switched to having water at the snack table once the largest site reported implementing this practice, with significant cost and calorie savings across the program. A+ also helped the program identify challenges affecting multiple sites that required higher coordinated action or additional resources. In this regard, it became evident that economies of scale and consistent higher quality could be achieved by centralizing menu planning and shopping. A nutrition coordinator was hired to plan menus, purchase HPS-friendly food in bulk from an appropriate vendor, and sort food items by site. Because many sites did not meet the HPS for physical activity at baseline, the program director was able to obtain funds for training, equipment and a paid coordinator for implementation of the CATCH Kids’ Club (Coordinated Approach To Child Health; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://catchinfo.org/catch-after-school-info/">http://catchinfo.org/catch-after-school-info/</ext-link>). Although these changes were not fully in place until after the follow-up, they were in process, and attention to these issues may have contributed to improvement seen on HPS not targeted in the action plans. Infrastructure changes resulted from A+ as well. Staff job descriptions were altered to include a requirement to know and implement HPS. In addition, the program increased site director planning time for menus and physical activities from monthly to weekly meetings.</p>
<p>SD-YMCA modified the A+ process to meet local needs in two ways. First, although not specified in the A+ materials, the program director increased the time spent coaching and supporting site staff involved in the project. Second, the action plan templates were modified slightly to improve their fit with SD-YMCA’s planning process.</p>

<title>Application</title>
<p>The A+ toolkit can assist with implementing organizational or regulatory policy changes related to community-based obesity prevention efforts. It can help programs coordinate a health promotion improvement process, especially across multiple sites, in an engaging, organized manner. The SD-YMCA program director wrote that “A+ was the impetus for making the organizational changes required to implement HPS in afterschool . . . it gave the YMCA a focus and roadmap to problem solve based on individual program needs and staff capacity building opportunities.”</p>

<sec id="section12-1524839912455644" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Specific characteristics make A+ an appropriate QI tool for afterschool programs, including non-YMCA sites. First, it is uniquely tailored to the afterschool setting, which has regulatory and program structures that are distinct from schools and early child care. It starts with the assumption that the organization has limited time, staff, and resources to focus on health promotion. The toolkit does not require additional staff or outside consultants and builds on internal assets within the group to develop local solutions. Second, it allows programs to prioritize, rather than attempting to fix everything at once, which increases the likelihood of persistence and/or success. Health promotion innovations with multiple components can require significant management inputs (e.g., training and assessment) and infrastructure change that may be difficult to muster. Moreover, high perceived innovation complexity can reduce uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839912455644">Rogers, 2003</xref>), and lack of implementation success can have a negative impact on staff morale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912455644">Greenhalgh, Robert, Macfarlane, Bate, &amp; Kyriakidou, 2004</xref>). Third, the language and format are inviting and nonthreatening, according to results from multiple field tests. This is particularly important within the capacity-building assessment, which goes beyond program practice and focuses on staff knowledge, attitudes, and resources. Finally, A+ does not prescribe specific solutions; instead, as an internally managed process, it encourages users to understand and build on their own unique base.</p>
<p>In summary, in tests of feasibility, acceptability, and reported impact, YMCA test sites found A+ to be both useful and usable. Strengths of this study include extensive field testing to obtain user input and integration of quantitative and qualitative data within the pilot study. Because we conducted multiple field tests in different settings, we believe the A+ tool is acceptable and appropriate for use in community programs. The generalizability of our observations must be carefully considered. The pilot took place in a competent afterschool program with strong organizational infrastructure, whereas programs vary greatly in capacity and infrastructure. We used a single-program, pre–post design because QI by definition is a nonstandardized process, and it is difficult to use experimental designs to examine its impact. Furthermore, our question was not simply whether the toolkit produced effect but whether and in what ways it was useful across a group of nonstandardized sites. These questions are better approached using methods other than randomized controlled trials, which are often insufficient for understanding program utility and impact in public health applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912455644">Glasgow et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912455644">Granger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839912455644">Pawson &amp; Tilley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524839912455644">Victora, Habicht, &amp; Bryce, 2004</xref>). Nonetheless, the pilot design we used has its own limitations. We did not test whether A+ improved progress relative to another method, nor did the research team validate program reports by observation, so we cannot verify the accuracy of staff status reports. We cannot generalize that A+ in particular or QI in general will improve obesity prevention in community-based settings, as much depends on the user. Certainly, additional research on QI in this setting will be informative. Finally, we note that A+ was originally designed to support the YMCA HPS, another potential limitation for generalizability. Nonetheless, YMCAs have considerable reach, with more than 8,500 afterschool programs serving more than 400,000 children per year. The A+ process itself is not YMCA specific; moreover, toolkit content can be tailored to address any set of specific health promotion targets. A subsequent version of A+ that supports implementation of National Afterschool Association Healthy Eating and Physical Activity Quality Standards is available by contacting <email>jean.wiecha@umb.edu</email>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The nation faces the substantial challenge of translating efficacious obesity-preventive diet and physical activity behaviors into practice across a range of community-based, child-serving organizations. Simply adopting evidence-based guidelines or standards will not guarantee implementation. We recommend using QI methods to optimize implementation efforts. We have described an example for afterschool programs that is user-friendly, applicable across multiple program sites, and adaptable to local needs.</p>
