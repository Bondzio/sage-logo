<p>Age, gender, and cross-national differences of children ages 9 through 16 in Pakistan (<italic>n</italic> = 463) and the United States (<italic>n</italic> = 500) are examined on four bipolar temperament styles: Extroversion-introversion, practical-imaginative, thinking-feeling, and organized-flexible. In general, Pakistani children prefer extroverted over introverted, practical over imaginative, and organized over flexible styles. Although their preference for thinking and feeling styles is balanced, gender differences are significant. Males generally prefer a thinking style and females generally prefer a feeling style. Gender and age differences are found on practical-imaginative and organized-flexible styles. Cross-national differences are found on practical-imaginative and organized-flexible styles. In contrast to children in the US, children in Pakistan are more likely to prefer practical and organized styles.</p>

<body>
<p>The concept of temperament refers to stylistic and relatively stable traits that subsume intrinsic tendencies to act and react in somewhat predictable ways to people, events, and stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034311420358">Teglasi, 1988a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143034311420358">1988b</xref>). Temperament traits generally are characterized as predispositions to display behaviors, with no assurance that people, events, and stimuli always will elicit the same temperament behaviors. Temperament traits appear early in life (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311420358">Goldsmith et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143034311420358">Thomas &amp; Chess, 1977</xref>) and thus are assumed to have a biological origin, one tempered both by one's environment as well as personal choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311420358">Bates &amp; Wachs, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311420358">Goldsmith et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143034311420358">Kagan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311420358">Keogh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311420358">Oakland, Glutting, &amp; Horton, 1996</xref>). Age and gender also are assumed to influence temperament.</p>
<p>Children's temperament can have a substantial impact on their behaviors, including their personal motivation, learning styles, peer and family relationships, and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311420358">Bates &amp; Wachs, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311420358">Hofstede, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311420358">Joyce, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034311420358">Keirsey &amp; Bates, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311420358">Keogh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311420358">Lawrence, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311420358">Oakland et al., 1996</xref>). Temperament impacts vocational interests in children as young as 8 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034311420358">Oakland, Stafford, Horton, &amp; Glutting, 2001</xref>) and may help distinguish children who display conduct and oppositional defiant disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143034311420358">Joyce &amp; Oakland, 2005</xref>). Style preferences of sighted and non-sighted children have also been compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311420358">Oakland, Banner, &amp; Livingston, 2000</xref>). Thus, knowledge of children's temperament shows promise for use in understanding the impact of temperament on children's behaviors.</p>
<p>Research in the behavioral sciences increasingly reflects a need for cross-national information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311420358">Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034311420358">Byrne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034311420358">Hall &amp; Altmaier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143034311420358">Wedding &amp; Stevens, 2004</xref>). Such research examines the degree to which psychological traits or behaviors are consistent among people who differ culturally by virtue of their living in countries that differ by culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034311420358">Byrne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034311420358">Strelau &amp; Angleitner, 1994</xref>). An understanding of children's temperament from a cross-national perspective is important in light of international interest in temperament as well as the continuing debate concerning the extent to which temperament constructs are biologically or environmentally rooted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311420358">Achenbach &amp; Rescorla, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034311420358">Hall &amp; Altmaier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311420358">Joyce, 2010</xref>). Cross-national studies of temperament may provide evidence for temperament being biologically rooted and intrinsic to the individual and therefore forms universal human traits. Alternatively, studies may show temperament to be environmentally rooted. Information on temperament qualities in children and youth also may help establish the possible age of onset of these differences.</p>

<p>Research by Oakland and his colleagues has relied on a model of temperament that includes four bipolar styles: Extroversion-introversion (e.g. the primary source of one's energy), practical-imaginative styles (e.g. how one prefers to process information), thinking-feeling (e.g. the basis on which people make decisions), and organized-flexible (e.g. when one prefers to make decisions) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143034311420358">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Emic approaches examine culture-specific traits while etic approaches examine whether traits and behaviors are universal and independent of one or more cultures. Initial research on any trait typically is directed toward describing the trait. Thus, the general purposes of this cross-national research are first to examine commonly displayed temperament traits of children within a country or region and then compare them with children in other countries or regions. This strategy is consistent with cross-national studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311420358">McCrae &amp; Costa (1997)</xref> and others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034311420358">Berry, Poortinga, Segall, &amp; Dasen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311420358">Macdaid, McCaulley, &amp; Kainz, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034311420358">Plomin &amp; Dunn, 1986</xref>) that examine the possible universality of temperament and personality traits.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0143034311420358"><title>Proposes of this study</title>
<p>The purpose of this research is to describe temperament style preferences in a sample of Pakistani students at four ages, to examine possible gender and age differences among them, and to compare their temperament style preferences with children in the US. The following questions are addressed in this study: Do Pakistani children display differences in their preferences for extroversion-introversion, practical-imaginative, thinking-feeling, or organized-flexible styles? Do they display gender and age differences on these temperament styles? Do Pakistani and US children differ in their preferences for these styles? A discussion of temperament preferences among US children, including age and gender differences, is not a primary focus of this study and can be found elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311420358">Bassett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311420358">Bassett &amp; Oakland, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311420358">Oakland et al., 1996</xref>). Data on US children are included to provide a direct cross-national comparison.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0143034311420358" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>A sample of 463 Pakistani children was drawn from various private schools in three major cities of Pakistan: Karachi, Islamabad, and Quetta. Pakistan's national language is Urdu, and public school students typically are fluent only in their native language. Although public school students receive instruction in both English and Urdu, their minimal level of English language proficiency precludes the use of the SSQ—a measure typically administered in English. In contrast, private school students receive instruction mainly in English and thus are sufficiently fluent in English to complete the Student Styles Questionnaire (SSQ). Four age groups were formed: 9-year-olds (<italic>n</italic> = 126), 11-year-olds (<italic>n</italic> = 118), 13-year-olds (<italic>n</italic> = 111), and 15-year-olds (<italic>n</italic> = 108). Approximately 50% were males in each age group. All children came from upper middle socio-economic class families.</p>
<p>A sample of 500 US children was drawn from the US Student Style Questionnaire's standardization sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311420358">Oakland et al., 1996</xref>). The sample formed the following four age groups with approximately 50% males in each group: 9- to 10-year-olds (<italic>n</italic> = 112), 11- to 12-year-olds (<italic>n</italic> = 164), 13- to 14-year-olds (<italic>n</italic> = 149), and 15- to 16-year-olds (<italic>n</italic> = 75). The US standardization data were designed to reflect 1990 US Bureau of the Census data. Thus, the US sample is stratified on five variables: Age, gender, race/ethnicity, geographic region, and school type. The subject pool of 7,902 public and private school children ranged in ages 8 through 17. Three racial/ethnic groups (Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics) were represented proportionately; approximately 50% were males in each racial-ethnic group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0143034311420358"><title>Instrument</title>
<p>The Student Styles Questionnaire (SSQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311420358">Oakland et al., 1996</xref>) is patterned after the Jungian constructs popularized by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034311420358">Myers &amp; McCaulley, 1985</xref>). The SSQ, a self-report paper and pencil group administered measure of temperament type for children ages 8 through 17, is completed within approximately 20 minutes. Each of its 69 forced-choice items has two alternatives that provide for an assessment of preferred behaviors associated with one of four bipolar traits: Extroversion (E) or introversion (I), practical (P) or imaginative (M), thinking (T) or feeling (F), and organized (O) or flexible (L). An example of an item assessing extroversion-introversion follows: ‘After school, I most prefer to spend time with others or spend time alone’. The EI scale has 23 items, the PM scale has 16 items, the TF scale has ten items, and the OL scale has 26 items. Additionally, six items provide information simultaneously on two scales.</p>
<p>Test–retest reliability coefficients, derived over an eight-month period, are 0.80, 0.67, 0.70, and 0.78 for EI, PM, TF, and OL respectively. Results of factor analyses studies indicate the SSQ's factor structure is consistent and stable for US children who differ by age, gender, and racial-ethnic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311420358">Stafford &amp; Oakland 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034311420358">1996b</xref>). Factor analytic studies of data from children from seven countries generally found a stable factor structure and thus support the use of the SSQ internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311420358">Benson, Oakland, &amp; Shermis, 2009</xref>). External validity, using contrasted groups, convergent validity, and divergent validity, provides additional strong support for the SSQ's validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311420358">Oakland et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0143034311420358" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title>
<p>Educational institutions in Pakistan include public and private schools. The sample for this study was drawn from private schools that use English as the medium of instruction. This selection was designed to ensure children had sufficient English language proficiency to complete the SSQ. School administrators were informed about the purpose of the study and their willingness to cooperate was determined. They were provided a statement of the purposes of the study, forms on which parents could provide their consent and record demographic data, along with a copy of the Student Styles Questionnaire. Students for whom parent consent was obtained were tested in groups no larger than ten.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0143034311420358"><title>Data analyses</title>
<p>Temperament typically is considered to be a type rather than a continuous quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311420358">Bassett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311420358">Bassett &amp; Oakland, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143034311420358">Buss &amp; Plomin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034311420358">Hall &amp; Lindzey, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143034311420358">Jung, 1921/1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311420358">Lawrence, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311420358">Macdaid et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034311420358">Plomin &amp; Dunn, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034311420358">Rothbart &amp; Jones, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143034311420358">Teglasi, 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143034311420358">Thomas &amp; Chess, 1977</xref>). Personality also can be and often is viewed in its type form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311420358">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1997</xref>). This belief guided the data interpretation methods</p>
<p>The frequency of Pakistani and US children expressing a preference for each of the eight types was determined in the following fashion. Individual responses on each of the 69 items were examined to determine whether a child selected more options from one of the two bipolar types. For example, among the 23 extroversion-introversion items, children who selected more extroverted than introverted options were classified extroverted. Conversely, children who selected more introverted options were classified introverted. Children who selected an equal number of options on a scale (e.g. extroversion-introversion) displayed no discernable preference on that bipolar type and thus were dropped from subsequent analyses on that scale. Fewer than 5% of the sample was excluded from one of the four bipolar types due to their experiencing an equal number of item preferences on one of the four scales.</p>
<p>Preliminary analysis involved the use of the chi-square (χ<sup>2</sup>) test to determine whether the frequency of Pakistani children who preferred either extroversion or introversion, practical or imaginative, thinking or feeling, and organized or flexible styles differ significantly in reference to total group. Logistic regression was used to examine the influence of age, sex, and country in differentiating the preferences of children in the four bipolar temperament traits. Logistic regression is deemed appropriate when the purpose is to predict categorical group membership (e.g. extroverted versus introverted styles) based on variables that are either continuous or discrete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143034311420358">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2006</xref>). Logistic regression analyses were conducted separately for each of the temperament traits to assess the extent to which gender and age influence the temperament style preferences of Pakistani children. Similarly, sequential logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess cross-national differences in temperamental style preferences, with gender and age as moderating variables. Odds ratios (OR) were used to assess the likelihood of preferences for a temperament style based on the explanatory variables of gender, age, and country. A 0.05 significance level was set for all analyses.</p>

<sec id="sec19-0143034311420358" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="sec20-0143034311420358"><title>Temperament preferences among children in Pakistan</title>
<p>Pakistani children show discernable preferences for three of the four bipolar styles: Extroverted over introverted, practical over imaginative, and organized over flexible styles. Thus, one may characterize their prevailing temperament preferences as conveying a tendency to acquire energy more from others than themselves, to look at life more practically than imaginatively, and to prefer an organized life rather than one that has considerable freedom and flexibility. Although these style preferences are statistically supported, many—albeit less than 50% of Pakistani children—prefer introverted and imaginative styles. Few prefer a flexible lifestyle. They show a somewhat balanced preference for thinking and feeling styles. However, when making decisions, males are more inclined to prefer a thinking style (i.e. to be objective) while females are more inclined to prefer a feeling style (e.g. to be subjective). Age differences are most noticeable in children's preferences for practical and organized styles. Both are highly preferred at younger ages and decrease as children become older.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-0143034311420358"><title>Cross-national comparisons in temperament preferences––Pakistan and the US</title>
<p>Children from Pakistan and the US do not differ in their preferences for an extroversion style. However, compared to US children, those in Pakistan are more likely to prefer practical and organized styles. For example, the majority of Pakistani children prefer a practical style while the majority of US children prefer an imaginative style.</p>
<p>Pakistani-US cross-national gender similarities are found on one bipolar style: Extroversion-introversion. However, gender differences are apparent on practical-imaginative styles (with the majority of Pakistani females favoring a practical styles in contrast to the majority of US females favoring an imaginative style), thinking-feeling styles (with a higher proportion of Pakistani than US males preferring a feeling style), and organized-flexible styles (with a higher proportion of Pakistani males and females than US males and females preferring an organized style).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-0143034311420358"><title>Preferences of children from Pakistan and 15 other countries</title>
<p>Temperament style preferences displayed by Pakistani children are similar to prevailing qualities displayed by children in many of the 15 countries in which there are similar data. For example, children from 11 of the 15 countries also show a general preference for an extroverted style: Australia, Costa Rica, Greece, India, Japan, People's Republic of China, Romania, South Korea, United States, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. Children from 11 countries also show a general preference for a practical style: Gaza, Greece, Hungary, India, Japan, Nigeria, People's Republic of China, Romania, South Africa, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. Children from 14 countries also show a general preference for an organized style: Australia, Costa Rica, Gaza, Greece, Hungary, India, Japan, Nigeria, People's Republic of China, Romania, South Africa, US, Venezuela, and, Zimbabwe. Additionally, gender differences on thinking-feeling seen in Pakistani males and females also are seen in children from seven countries: Australia, Greece, Japan, Nigeria, People's Republic of China, South Africa, and United States.</p>
<p>Thus, the temperament preferences of children in Pakistan generally are similar to prevailing qualities displayed by children in other countries. Prior research found a stable factor structure and thus support the use of the SSQ internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311420358">Benson et al., 2009</xref>). Cross-national temperament data for children generally as well as for those who differ by age and gender from this and prior studies provide some support for the universality of temperament preferences (i.e. its etic qualities).</p>
<p>The results of this study may be viewed in reference to Pakistani culture as well as individual Pakistani children. A national view of these data should recognize that Pakistan is a collectivist society that emphasizes interdependence and conformity to socialized values and cultural (e.g. religious) norms. Deviation from these values and norms may result in condemnation. Parents and teachers socialize children to conform to society's standards and expectations as well as to maintain the country's and a family's traditions.</p>
<p>The finding that Pakistani children generally prefer practical and organized styles is consistent with this conforming orientation. Persons who display a preference for practical and organized styles typically strongly value engaging in institutions (e.g. families, religious organizations, work units) that provide stability to their country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311420358">Lawrence, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311420358">Oakland et al., 1996</xref>). Their striving to be responsible, honest, dependable, and hard-working, to conform to society's rules and expectations, enjoy traditions, and work to maintain existing institutions and organizations is consistent with this value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311420358">Oakland et al., 1996</xref>, pp. 71–72)</p>
<p>Some people may view these temperament preferences to be due to living in a collectivist society and thus use these data to validate the assumption that culture strongly influences children's temperament styles. However, the belief that Pakistani culture may be due to biologically based temperament preferences, including general preferences for practical and organized styles as well as gender differences in which males generally rely more on their thinking and females on their feelings, also is viable. The view that Pakistanis may need to shape their society consistent with their prevailing temperament preferences rather than be shaped by their society also is viable.</p>
<p>A view of these data in light of individual children should acknowledge the impact temperament styles may have on their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143034311420358">Horton &amp; Oakland, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034311420358">Keirsey &amp; Bates, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311420358">Keogh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311420358">Lawrence, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311420358">Oakland et al., 1996</xref>). Knowledge of a child's temperament styles can help the child, his or her parents and teachers understand the child's behavior, attitudes, preferred learning styles, and their other lifestyle preferences. This acknowledgement requires us to put aside group preferences for extroverted, practical, and organized styles and to focus on a child's individual preferences. Sizable percentages of children prefer styles that differ from prevailing preferences (e.g. 41% prefer introversion and 44% prefer imaginative styles). Children who display imaginative and flexible styles (e.g. those opposite from practical and organized styles) may deserve special attention. Their behaviors may deviate from the country's preferred values and norms and thus be subject to condemnation.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-0143034311420358"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>This is the first known report of temperament among Pakistani children. The availability of data from other temperament studies of Pakistani children and adults would allow us to examine the reliability of these finding and further trace possible age trends. Moreover, Pakistani children living in three major cities may not be representative of the Pakistani children living in rural areas. Additionally, the Pakistani and US samples are likely to differ by social class. The Pakistani children attended private schools and thus are likely to come from middle and upper class families; in contrast, the US children mainly attended public schools and are likely to come from families that reflect a broader income range. Thus, subsequent research that equates family social and economic status among students from the two countries is needed. Finally, temperament scales developed in light of Pakistani culture and standardized on Pakistani children may be preferable to those that are adapted for use in this country.</p>
