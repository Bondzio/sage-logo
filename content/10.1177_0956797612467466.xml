<abstract>
<p>Do men base their self-worth on relationships less than do women? In an assessment of lay beliefs, men and women alike indicated that men are less reliant on relationships as a source of self-worth than are women (Study 1). Yet relationships may make a different important contribution to the self-esteem of men. Men reported basing their self-esteem on their own relationship status (whether or not they were in a relationship) more than did women, and this link was statistically mediated by the perceived importance of relationships as a source of social standing (Studies 1 and 2). Finally, when relationship status was threatened, men displayed increased social-standing concerns, whereas women displayed increased interdependence concerns (Study 3). Together, these findings demonstrate that both men and women rely on relationships for self-worth, but that they derive self-esteem from relationships in different ways.</p>

<p>The research literature leaves little doubt that men tend to be autonomous and independent, whereas women tend to be communal and interdependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612467466">Bakan, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612467466">Eagly, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612467466">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>). Similarly, popular culture maintains that men—relative to women—place little stock in their relationships. Instead, men are thought to invest their self-worth in other domains, such as their careers. Witness, for example, the workaholic husband whose single-minded devotion to his career leads him to compromise his relationship with his family. Despite the pervasiveness of this stereotype, however, some evidence paints a very different picture. Consider that the mental health of men is more strongly linked to relationship status than is the mental health of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612467466">Gove, Hughes, &amp; Style, 1983</xref>), and that when couples encounter difficulties, men cling to their partner even as women head out the door (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797612467466">Kitson, 1982</xref>). In this article, we strive to reconcile these seemingly conflicting lines of research by showing that both men and women value their relationships—but for different reasons. That is, whereas women value relationships as a source of belonging and intimacy, men value relationships as a marker of social standing. To set the stage for our empirical research, we review research on gender differences in self-construal.</p>
<sec id="section1-0956797612467466">
<title>Gender Differences in Self-Construal</title>
<p>Considerable evidence suggests that men are more independent than women and women are more interdependent than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612467466">Cross &amp; Madson, 1997</xref>). For example, men typically view themselves as distinct from other people, whereas women are more inclined to view themselves as embedded in important relationships (i.e., relational interdependence; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612467466">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>). Similarly, men tie their self-worth to separation and independence from other people, and women link their self-worth to connection and interdependence with other people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612467466">Josephs, Markus, &amp; Tafarodi, 1992</xref>). As part of women’s relationally interdependent focus, they are more likely than men to recall emotionally salient, relationship-relevant events, and to provide assistance to people who are close to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612467466">Gabriel &amp; Gardner, 1999</xref>). Similarly, women—more than men—tend to engage in relationship-maintenance behaviors, especially when faced with attractive alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612467466">Lydon, 1999</xref>). Together, these findings contribute to the conclusion that men define themselves by their close relationships less than do women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612467466">Cross &amp; Madson, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some researchers have argued that many people have overemphasized the emotional aspects of relationships (e.g., connection and intimacy), while neglecting the instrumental aspects of relationships (e.g., instrumental help). As a result, cultural images of love have taken on feminine qualities, including tenderness, emotions, and weakness—in essence, <italic>feminizing</italic> love (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612467466">Cancian, 1986</xref>). Likewise, the feminization of love has led researchers to focus more on companionate than on instrumental aspects of relationships, particularly when addressing gender differences in the importance of relationships. The result has been a tendency to overlook the capacity of relationships to serve as a source of social standing or achievement, which can fulfill autonomy needs, particularly for men. This oversight may have hindered researchers in understanding the importance of relationships to the self-construals of men.</p>
<p>Existing scales assessing relationship self-construal focus singularly on connection and identification with the partner (e.g., relationship-interdependent self-construal: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612467466">Cross, Bacon, &amp; Morris, 2000</xref>; relationship-contingent self-esteem: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612467466">Knee, Canevello, Bush, &amp; Cook, 2008</xref>). These scales highlight how internal aspects of relationships (partner identities and relationship quality, respectively) inform self-construals. Nevertheless, a recently developed scale measures the extent to which people base their identities on <italic>relationship status</italic>. The Relationship Contingency of Self-Worth Scale (RELCSW; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612467466">Sanchez &amp; Kwang, 2007</xref>) grew out of the contingencies-of-self-worth (CSW) perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612467466">Crocker &amp; Wolfe, 2001</xref>), which posits that people’s self-worth depends on their success in domains important to them.</p>
<p>The RELCSW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612467466">Sanchez &amp; Kwang, 2007</xref>) extended the previously identified CSW domains to include romantic relationships, specifically, by focusing on the degree to which people base their self-worth on having a relationship. What is unique about this scale, therefore, is that it measures the degree to which respondents base their self-esteem not on unique qualities of the partner or the relationship, but simply on the status of being in a relationship. Because relationship status may serve as a perceivable marker of social standing, the RELCSW should be able to capture the extent to which individuals base their self-worth on the social standing they draw from their relationships. This reasoning suggests that individuals who are prone to emphasize autonomy and social standing (i.e., men) should score higher on this scale than those who emphasize connectedness and interdependence (i.e., women). We tested this and other possibilities in our research.</p>

<sec id="section2-0956797612467466">
<title>Overview of the Studies</title>
<p>In three studies, we aimed to test the notion that, contrary to popular belief, men derive crucial psychological benefits from relationships just as women do. Our studies used correlational, meta-analytical, and experimental designs. We first examined lay theories regarding what men and women derive from relationships and actual gender differences in basing self-worth on relationship status, controlling for gender differences in relationship-interdependent self-construal and relationship-contingent self-esteem (Study 1). We also tested the notion that men, more than women, value relationships as a marker of social standing (Study 1). We then replicated the gender difference in the importance of relationship status for self-worth across multiple, independent samples (Study 2). Finally, we tested whether threats to relationship status would increase concerns regarding social standing for men and concerns regarding connection for women (Study 3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0956797612467466">
<title>Study 1</title>
<p>In Study 1, we solicited participants’ stereotypes regarding the degree to which men and women base their self-worth on relationships, as well as the extent to which men and women rely on their relationship status as a source of self-esteem. We hypothesized that lay beliefs would suggest that men base their self-worth on relationships less than do women, but that men would report basing self-esteem on relationship status more than would women, even when we controlled for gender differences in relationship-interdependent self-construal and relationship-contingent self-esteem. Furthermore, we explored whether men, compared with women, would rate social standing as a more important factor in deciding whether to stay in or leave their current relationship, and whether the perceived importance of relationship status as a marker of social standing would statistically mediate the link between gender and basing self-worth on relationship status.</p>
<sec id="section4-0956797612467466">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0956797612467466">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, we recruited 285 participants (114 men, 171 women) who were currently in relationships. We paid each person $0.25 for participating. The sample’s mean age was 30.8 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.96). About half (59.3%) of the participants were in dating relationships; the rest (40.7%) were married.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0956797612467466">
<title>Measures of lay beliefs</title>
<p>To measure lay beliefs, we asked participants to rate the degree to which they believe men base their self-worth on various aspects of relationships and the degree to which they believe women base their self-worth on various aspects of relationships. Responses were made on 7-point Likert scales (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 7 = <italic>very much so</italic>). Two items focused on basing self-esteem on relationship status (“In general, how much do you think men and women base their self-esteem on being in a relationship?”; “In general how much do you think men and women base their self-esteem on the ability to attract a romantic partner?”). Two additional items focused on basing self-esteem on relationship quality and connection (“In general, how much do you think men and women base their self-esteem on the quality of their relationships?”; “In general, how much do you think men and women base their self-esteem on the connection and intimacy experienced in their relationships?”). Each pair of items was closely associated (αs = .64 and .75, respectively), so we were justified in combining the first pair into a status scale and the second pair into a connection scale.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0956797612467466">
<title>Measures of self-construal</title>
<p>Participants then completed the RELCSW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612467466">Sanchez &amp; Kwang, 2007</xref>). On 7-point Likert scales (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>), they indicated the extent to which they based their self-esteem on relationship status. Items included “When I have a significant other, my self-esteem increases,” and “I feel worthwhile when I have a significant other.” Participants also completed the Relationship Interdependent Self-Construal Scale (RISC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612467466">Cross et al., 2000</xref>), which was adapted to measure how much participants generally included romantic partners in their self-construal (e.g., “I think one of the most important parts of who I am can be captured by looking at my romantic partner and understanding who he or she is”),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0956797612467466">1</xref></sup> and the Relationship-Contingent Self-Esteem Scale (RCSE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612467466">Knee et al., 2008</xref>), which measures how much individuals base their self-worth on the quality of their relationships (e.g., “I feel better about myself when it seems like my partner and I are emotionally connected”).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0956797612467466">
<title>Importance of relationship benefits</title>
<p>To index the degree to which participants valued various relationship benefits, we had them read the following passage:<disp-quote>
<p>Romantic relationships often provide us with different types of benefits. For example, they can alleviate feelings of loneliness, be a source of connection and companionship, increase social standing, or provide validation. Imagine you are considering whether or not to continue your romantic relationship. Please indicate how much each factor or benefit would influence your decision to stay in or leave that relationship.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants then rated the degree to which they believed five factors (loneliness, social standing, societal pressures, connection, and intimacy) would influence their decision to stay in or leave their relationship. Responses were made on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 7 = <italic>very much so</italic>).</p>

<sec id="section17-0956797612467466">
<title>Study 3</title>
<p>Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that men reported basing their self-esteem on relationship status more than did women, despite stereotypic assumptions to the contrary. Study 1 further demonstrated that this link may exist because men, more than women, value relationships as a source of social standing. In Study 3, we tested whether this finding extends beyond self-report evidence. Specifically, we tested whether a perceived threat to relationship status in the form of a breakup will trigger concerns about social standing for men but concerns about being connected to the partner for women. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed language use while participants imagined a relationship-related negative event (a breakup) or a relationship-irrelevant negative event (a dental visit).</p>
<p>Our focus on language analysis was based on the assumption that people’s word choices reflect their priorities, intentions, and thoughts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0956797612467466">Tausczik &amp; Pennebaker, 2010</xref>). A study on the September 11 attacks, for example, revealed that word usage reflected people’s increase in negative emotions and desire for social connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612467466">Cohn, Mehl, &amp; Pennebaker, 2004</xref>). Likewise, we argue that as social standing or connection concerns increase, people’s use of words relating to social standing or connection also will increase. We expected that whereas men contemplating a breakup would be particularly likely to use social-standing words, women contemplating a breakup would be especially inclined to use connection words (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612467466">Cross &amp; Madson, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section19-0956797612467466">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>We recruited 173 heterosexual participants (70 male, 103 female) who were currently in romantic relationships (mean age = 19.5 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.1; mean relationship length = 1.3 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.2, range = 1 month–5 years). Eighteen participants (13 male, 5 female) did not follow instructions (e.g., they wrote about their relationships in the control condition) and were removed from the sample, which left a final sample of 57 men and 98 women.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0956797612467466">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>To control for baseline relationship concerns, we had participants complete the UCLA Loneliness Scale (Version 3) prior to their arrival at the lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612467466">Russell, 1996</xref>). We randomly assigned participants to one of two conditions. In the breakup condition, we primed participants with a relationship-breakup scenario using the following prompt:<disp-quote>
<p>Please imagine how your life would change if you were to break-up with your partner in the near future. For the next five minutes, write about whatever comes to mind. Please do not stop typing until the Experimenter cues you to stop.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the control condition, we primed participants with a negative non-relationship-related scenario using the following prompt:<disp-quote>
<p>Please imagine you have an upcoming appointment to the dentist. For the next five minutes, write about whatever comes to mind. Please do not stop typing until the Experimenter cues you to stop.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants wrote for 5 min following the prompt.</p>

<title>Linguistic analysis strategy</title>
<p>We analyzed each writing sample for words that signified connection, social standing, or, as a manipulation check, negative emotion. To do this, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program (LIWC2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612467466">Pennebaker, Chung, Ireland, Gonzales, &amp; Booth, 2007</xref>). LIWC2007 provides a default dictionary for coding usage of social-standing words (e.g., <italic>earn, achieve, win</italic>) and negative-emotion words (e.g., <italic>hurt, ugly, nasty</italic>). LIWC2007 also provides a dictionary for “we” words (e.g., <italic>we, us, our</italic>), which are widely accepted as a marker of relationship interdependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612467466">Agnew, Van Lange, Rusbult, &amp; Langston, 1998</xref>). An independent-samples <italic>t</italic> test confirmed that usage of negative-emotion words did not differ between the breakup condition (<italic>M</italic> = 2.4, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.6) and the control condition (<italic>M</italic> = 2.5, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.7), <italic>t</italic>(171) = 0.54, <italic>p</italic> = .59, <italic>d</italic> = 0.05.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>To a striking degree, love is currently feminized, a trend that has led researchers and laypersons alike to emphasize interdependent aspects of relationships over instrumental ones. This emphasis presumably explains why participants in Study 1 asserted that men derive their self-worth from relationships to a lesser degree than women. Nevertheless, a very different picture emerged when we asked the same participants from Study 1, as well as multiple samples of participants in Study 2, if they themselves based their self-worth on instrumental aspects of relationships, such as social standing. In particular, men indicated that they based their self-worth on relationship status more than women did, and men viewed relationships as a source of social standing more than women did. Finally, when participants in Study 3 were primed with thoughts of a breakup, their language use suggested that men were concerned with their social standing, whereas women were concerned about the loss of a connection to their former partner.</p>
<p>Our findings may shed some light on why men are less sensitive to marital distress than are women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612467466">Gaelick, Bodenhausen, &amp; Wyer, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612467466">Kiecolt-Glaser &amp; Newton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797612467466">Ross &amp; Holmberg, 1990</xref>), and why men are less likely to voice discontent with their marriages than are women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612467466">Hagestad &amp; Smyer, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612467466">Harvey, Wells, &amp; Alvarez, 1978</xref>). Apparently, for men, being in a relationship communicates social standing regardless of relationship quality, and so men may be less concerned with the emotional tenor of their relationships, and less likely to leave an unsatisfying relationship. Yet, although men may be relatively unconcerned with the quality of the connections they have with their partners, they are concerned with maintaining their relationships status. Indeed, they should be, as there is evidence that being in a stable relationship is beneficial to men. For example, married men are perceived as more competent than single men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612467466">Etaugh &amp; Riley, 1983</xref>), and married men tend to earn higher performance ratings and incomes than their unmarried counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612467466">Akerlof, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612467466">Korenman &amp; Neumark, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Our studies had several strengths in their methodology and design, which enhances our confidence in the results. First, we used correlational, meta-analytical, and experimental data to test our hypothesis. Second, we replicated our findings using participants from diverse groups and regional areas. Finally, we used both self-report and implicit measures to examine important relationship variables.</p>
<p>Despite these strengths, it is possible that the relative youth of our participants (the highest mean age was 36) led us to draw conclusions that are not representative of the larger population. For example, older men tend to command more respect than younger men regardless of their relationship status, so older men may be less concerned with relationships as a source of self-worth. Conversely, older women may derive self-worth from relationship status more than younger women do, as never-married women tend to be viewed with increasing negativity as they age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612467466">DePaulo &amp; Morris, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612467466">Sharp &amp; Ganong, 2011</xref>). Although Study 1 did not find a significant interaction between age and gender, future studies should examine the effects of age using a sample including older participants. Likewise, future studies should focus on nonheterosexual populations and other types of close relationships (e.g., friendships). Finally, to assess whether concerns about social standing were related to relationship status, we used a breakup scenario exclusively. Future studies should explore people’s reasons for entering in a relationship (possibly using a speed-dating paradigm) to assess whether social-standing concerns influence people’s choice to enter in a romantic relationship the same way that such concerns influence people’s reactions to relationship dissolution.</p>
<p>Still, these studies are among the first to investigate how men and women may derive self-worth from their relationships differently. These studies also highlight the importance of examining relationships as a source of social standing, particularly for men. Perhaps men are more likely than women to increase status-striving behaviors either within their relationships (e.g., dominating their partners) or outside their relationships (e.g., working harder for a promotion at work) when faced with relationship threats. Note evidence that individuals who base their self-worth on relationship status tend to report greater obsessive pursuit of their ex-partners after a breakup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612467466">Park et al., 2011</xref>). Likewise, following a breakup, men may engage in more extreme behaviors than women to restore their relationship status. Finally, these patterns may be exaggerated in cultures that greatly emphasize males’ public reputation and social standing (e.g., Southern cultures; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612467466">Cohen &amp; Nisbett, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, our findings suggest that both men and women derive self-worth from their romantic relationships, but through different pathways. That is, just as relationships bolster the self-worth of men by elevating their perception of their status and achievement, relationships bolster the self-worth of women by affording them a sense of companionship and connectedness. Apparently, relationships provide men and women alike with significant benefits in the form of higher self-esteem, but the precise mechanism through which men and women realize these benefits differs dramatically.</p>

<p>The lack of significant gender differences in the previously published studies could have been due to how the RELCSW was administered. In those studies, the scale was broken apart, with individual items administered separately, which can decrease the fidelity of any measure. Although there was not a significant gender difference in those two data sets, the trend was still in the predicted direction.</p>
