<abstract>
<p>Because consistent condom use is an effective strategy in the prevention of sexually transmitted infections and HIV transmission, it is important to examine social cognitive influences of consistent condom use not only among female sex workers (FSWs) but also among their male clients, for whom less is known. Because little is known about how HIV knowledge and condom attitudes affect condom use among male clients of FSWs in the Philippines, the main objective was to determine what characteristics (age, education, HIV knowledge, marital status) as well as attributes taken from protection motivation theory (perceived vulnerability, perceived severity, response efficacy) are significantly associated with consistent condom use among male clients of FSWs. Logistic regression analyses showed that the odds of using condoms consistently with an FSW are 13% higher for those with more years of education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03, 1.23), higher versus lower perception of severity of HIV/AIDS (AOR = 1.97; 95% CI = 1.04, 3.73), and had a higher score for response efficacy of condoms (AOR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.27). Future HIV/AIDS prevention interventions that address condom use among male clients should promote educational attainment and focus on awareness of the enduring negative health consequences of acquiring HIV/AIDS, as well as cultivate positive attitudes toward the efficacy of condom use, using creative social marketing strategies.</p>

<p>According to UNAIDS, there were 8,700 adults and children living with HIV/AIDS in the Philippines at the end of 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198112446809">UNAIDS, 2010</xref>). Rates of increase can be described as “low and slow,” with a stable estimate of HIV prevalence at &lt;0.1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198112446809">UNAIDS, 2010</xref>). Among groups the Philippines government considers most at risk for HIV (injection drug users, female sex workers [FSWs], overseas contract workers, and men who have sex with men), the HIV prevalence is approximately 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198112446809">Philippine Health Department, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198112446809">Philippines National AIDS Council, 2010</xref>). However, in some regions of the country, the prevalence among high-risk groups is slightly higher at 1% to 2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198112446809">Ghys, Jenkins, &amp; Pisani, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198112446809">Mateo, Sarol, &amp; Poblete, 2004</xref>). Although the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is currently low in the Philippines, the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is high. Prevalence of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> has been reported to be between 21% and 36% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1090198112446809">World Health Organization—Western Pacific Region [WHO-WPR], 2002</xref>) and as high as 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1090198112446809">UNAIDS, 2004</xref>) among FSWs. Additionally, prevalence ranges between 15% and 31% for gonorrhea and between 1% and 7% for syphilis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1090198112446809">WHO-WPR, 2002</xref>). Prevalence of STIs is also reported as high among the general population, with a prevalence of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> of 5.6% among women attending antenatal clinics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1090198112446809">UNAIDS, 2004</xref>) and between 4% and 9% among the general population. Rates of gonorrhea and syphilis in the general population are low (0.7% to 1.7% and 0.2%, respectively) but still causes alarm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1090198112446809">WHO-WPR, 2002</xref>). The high rates of STIs are of concern since the presence of STIs increases the efficiency of HIV transmission. Because of high STI rates, and unsafe sex practices, public health officials are concerned that the current low HIV/AIDS prevalence rates will continue to rise if prevention efforts are not tailored for those at highest risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1090198112446809">Wi et al., 2006</xref>). It is clear that the potential for an increase in HIV/AIDS prevalence exists, and therefore the promotion of condom use by FSWs and their male partners has been one strategy of the government to prevent a burgeoning epidemic from occurring in the Philippines as it has in other parts of the region.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, HIV is predominantly acquired via heterosexual intercourse and among men who have sex with men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198112446809">UNAIDS, 2010</xref>). The commercial sex work industry is considered to contribute significantly to the rates of heterosexual transmission of HIV with FSWs and their male clients serving as “bridges” to the spread of HIV/AIDS to the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198112446809">Potterat, Rothenberg, &amp; Bross, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198112446809">Remple, Patrick, Johnston, Tyndall, &amp; Jolly, 2007</xref>). In the Philippines, although prostitution is illegal, some female employees of entertainment establishments such as bars, beer gardens, nightclubs, karaoke halls, and massage parlors often engage in clandestine sexual relations with clients who frequent these establishments. A network of Sexual Health Clinics provide STI screening and prescriptions for registered female “entertainment workers” in more than 140 cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1090198112446809">Wi et al., 2006</xref>). Structural interventions such as policies mandating condom use within entertainment establishments have also been a strategy aimed to increase condom use and decrease new HIV/STI infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198112446809">Rojanapithayakorn, 2006</xref>). Research has suggested that mandatory STI screening as well as the presence of management support for establishment-based condom policy is significantly associated with higher rates of condom use by FSWs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198112446809">Amadora-Nolasco, Alburo, Aguilar, &amp; Trevathan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198112446809">Morisky, Peña, Tiglao, &amp; Liu, 2002</xref>). However, not all establishments have a mandatory condom use policy, and enforcement of existing policies is often challenging. Therefore, despite the presence of these policies barriers to consistent condom use exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198112446809">Amadora-Nolasco et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Since consistent condom use is an effective strategy of STI prevention, it is important to examine social cognitive influences of consistent condom use not only among FSWs but also among their male clients, for whom less is known. Because little is known about the factors associated with condom use among male clients of FSWs in the Philippines, our main objective is to determine what attributes are significantly associated with consistent condom use among male clients of FSWs.</p>
<p>In the current study, constructs from Protection Motivation Theory (PMT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198112446809">Rogers, 1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198112446809">1983</xref>) guide our examination of male attributes. PMT expands on other models of behavior change, including the Health Belief Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1090198112446809">Rosenstock, 1974</xref>); Information, Motivation, and Behavior Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198112446809">Fisher &amp; Fisher, 1992</xref>); and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198112446809">Bandura’s (1977)</xref> Social Cognitive Theory. According to PMT, an individual’s motivation to protect oneself from a threat depends on several factors: (a) the perceived severity of the event (in the current study, the “event” is the possible acquisition of an STI or infection with HIV during an episode of unprotected sex), (b) the perceived vulnerability (probability) of the occurrence of the event, and (c) the perceived efficacy of the recommended preventive behavior (e.g., condom use). Perception of HIV/AIDS <italic>severity and vulnerability</italic> are purported to be associated with more consistent condom use by increasing perceptions of the benefits of condom use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1090198112446809">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, although it has long been acknowledged that knowledge alone is necessary but not sufficient for behavior change to occur, HIV/AIDS knowledge as well as positive attitudes and beliefs about condoms and their utility in preventing infections have been associated with condom use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198112446809">Thomsen, Stalker, &amp; Toroitich-Ruto, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1090198112446809">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Understanding which attributes of male clients are related to consistent condom use may inform intervention strategies that address the prevention of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV in the Philippines. The current study attempted to answer the primary research question: Which characteristics (age, education, HIV knowledge, and marital status) and attributes taken from PMT (perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, and/or perceived efficacy of condom use) are related to consistent condom use among male clients in the Philippines?</p>

<title>Source of Data</title>
<p>This study is a secondary analysis of data gathered for a larger study. Data for this study are from a longitudinal study designed to improve knowledge, attitudes, and practices concerning STI/HIV among FSWs, potential male clients (military, police and firemen, factory workers, drivers associations, and community residents), and establishment in six different geographic regions of the southern Philippines, namely, Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue City in Metropolitan Cebu, Legaspi and Daraga in the Bicol Region, and Cagayan de Oro City in Mindanao and Cavite City in the southern Tagalog Region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198112446809">Morisky, Ang, Coly, &amp; Tiglao, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198112446809">Morisky, Nguyen, Ang, &amp; Tiglao, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198112446809">Morisky &amp; Tiglao, 2010</xref>). A cross-lagged panel study design was implemented in four sites in southern Philippines. Formative research indicated that these groups were a large source of clients for FSWs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198112446809">Morisky et al., 2005</xref>). In all, 18 organizations participated in the study in which all men were surveyed at baseline. Through the assistance of the City Health Officer and physician from the Social Hygiene Clinic, as well as the mayors, city officials, and participating nongovernmental organizations, men from these organizations were approached and asked to participate in the study. A total of 3,118 males participated in the longitudinal intervention parent study. Details of this parent study have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198112446809">Morisky et al., 2004</xref>). This study uses data from the baseline interview of 405 men who reported ever paying for vaginal sex with an FSW. Data were excluded for 19 (4.7%) of these participants because of incomplete information on study variables, leaving a sample of 386 men.</p>

<sec id="section3-1090198112446809">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Participants completed the questionnaire in their language of choice (Tagalog, Cebuano, Bicol, or English). The questionnaire collected data on individual’s demographic characteristics including age, marital status, and education. The instrument also contained items that captured HIV/AIDS knowledge, as well as condom use behaviors and attitudes toward condom use. The measures presented in this study were derived from male survey items from the larger parent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198112446809">Morisky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1090198112446809">Tiglao, Morisky, Tempongko, Baltazar, &amp; Detels, 1996</xref>). The study received approval from the institutional review boards of the University of the Philippines and the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-1090198112446809">
<title>Consistency of condom use with sex worker</title>
<p>Participants who acknowledged ever having vaginal sex with an FSW from an entertainment establishment were asked how often they used a condom when they had vaginal sex. Overall frequency of condom use was coded as 1 = <italic>every time</italic>, reflecting consistent condom use, and 0 = <italic>not every time</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1090198112446809">
<title>Perceived severity</title>
<p>As perceived severity of HIV/AIDS was measured by a single item that asked participants if they believed that “a person with HIV/AIDS can be cured?” Responses were coded “1” = <italic>no</italic>, reflecting a higher perception of severity, and “0” = <italic>yes</italic>, reflecting a lower perception of severity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1090198112446809">
<title>Perceived vulnerability</title>
<p>Perceived vulnerability was measured by a single item that asked, “How worried are you about getting AIDS?” Responses ranged from “0” = <italic>not worried at all</italic> to “4” = <italic>extremely worried</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1090198112446809">
<title>Response efficacy</title>
<p>Response efficacy was measured with a scale derived from four questionnaire items similar to those developed in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198112446809">Li et al., 2004</xref>). Respondents were asked to report the degree to which they agreed or disagreed to four statements: “Condoms are good at preventing pregnancy,” “Condoms can prevent sexually transmitted diseases if used properly,” “ If my partner asked me to I would use a condom,” and “Condoms are appropriate for use with casual partners.” Responses were on a Likert-type scale: 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 2 = <italic>disagree</italic>, 3 = <italic>neutral/no opinion/don’t know</italic>, 4 = <italic>agree</italic>, and 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. A continuous score was created by summing responses to the four items. The internal consistency reliability was α = .55.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1090198112446809">
<title>HIV/AIDS knowledge</title>
<p>HIV/AIDS knowledge was measured by eight “yes/no” items developed and piloted in the parent study and used in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198112446809">Morisky et al., 1998</xref>). These items assess knowledge and understanding of possible transmission routes. Respondents were asked whether they thought a person could get infected with HIV via (a) blood transfusion, (b) sexual intercourse, (c) drug use/sharing needles, (d) kissing, (e) breathing air infected with HIV, (f) mosquitoes, (g) toilet seats, or (h) from mother to baby (α = .70). Participants received a code of “1” for each correct response and “0” for incorrect responses. Responses of <italic>don’t know</italic> were coded as “0.” Correct responses were summed to create an index where higher items were indicative of higher HIV/AIDS knowledge. HIV/AIDS knowledge ranged from 0 to 8.</p>

<sec id="section11-1090198112446809">
<title>Analytic Methods</title>
<p>First, descriptive statistics were used to examine the mean standard deviation, ranges, or percentages for all variables in the analysis. Bivariate logistic regression was then conducted to evaluate the relationships between the independent variables and the outcome variable. Subsequently, an adjusted multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted. Variables that were significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10 were selected for inclusion in the final adjusted multivariate model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198112446809">Hosmer &amp; Lemeshow, 1989</xref>).

<title>Demographic Characteristics, HIV Knowledge, and Condom Use Behaviors</title>
<p>The description of the study population and variables included in the analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090198112446809">Table 1</xref>. Consistency of condom use was reported as either “every time” (<italic>n</italic> = 86; 22.3%) or “not every time” (<italic>n</italic> = 300; 77.7%). Overall, the mean age was about 35 years, with a mean of 11 years of education. HIV/AIDS knowledge was not very high among these men, with the mean score on the HIV knowledge items being just more than 5 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.74; range = 0-8). The majority (63.5%) of men were married. The responses of the participants reflected somewhat higher rather than lower perceptions of vulnerability (<italic>M</italic> = 2.76; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.36; range = 0-4). However, more than 25% of the men reported that HIV/AIDS was a curable illness, reflecting lowered perception of severity of this disease. The men’s response efficacy toward condom use were positive overall (<italic>M</italic> = 15; <italic>SD</italic> = 2.56; range = 5-20), reflecting their attitudes that condoms are efficacious in preventing infections. A descriptive comparison between consistent condom users and inconsistent condom users revealed that consistent condom users were slightly younger and more educated than inconsistent condom users. Although some differences were small, consistent condom users reflected a group with a lower proportion of married men, higher HIV/AIDS knowledge, higher perception of HIV/AIDS severity, and slightly lower perception of vulnerability and higher response efficacy of condom use than their counterparts.</p>

<p>Overall, the multivariate logistic regression model remained consistent with the bivariate associations. Educational attainment, perceived vulnerability, and response efficacy of condoms were each significant predictors of consistent condom use among the male clients of FSWs in this study. For each additional year of education, the odds of using condoms consistently increases by 13% (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.23). For those with a high versus low perception of severity of HIV/AIDS, the odds of consistent condom use is almost twice as great (AOR = 1.97; 95% CI = 1.04, 3.73). Finally, for each unit increase in score for response efficacy of condoms, the odds of consistent condom use increased by 14% (AOR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.27).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is one of few that have examined condom use among male clients of FSWs in the Philippines. Consistent condom use was found to be quite low in the current study. Although data on consistent condom use among male clients of FSWs in the Philippines is scant, one survey reported that among high-risk groups (FSWs, MSM, and IDUs), consistent condom use reported for the prior week was less than 35% overall. Therefore, the results of the current study are in line with the overall low trend in condom use reported among other high-risk groups in the Philippines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1090198112446809">WHO-WPR, 2002</xref>). The current analysis revealed that significant factors of consistent condom use among male clients of FSWs included educational attainment, perception of HIV/AIDS severity, and response efficacy toward condoms. These findings are consistent with previous studies and with the tenants of PMT and may inform intervention efforts to increase condom use among male clients of FSWs in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The significant association between education and condom use is consistent with findings from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198112446809">Bankole, Ahmed, Neema, Ouedraogo, &amp; Konyani, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1090198112446809">Zellner, 2003</xref>). It may be that education provides individuals with tools to understand the complexities of HIV/AIDS as well as understand the benefits of preventive behaviors. A higher versus lower perception of HIV/AIDS severity was associated with an increase in almost twice the odds of consistent condom use. This implies that perception of severity plays a large role in consistent condom use among this sample of male clients. This would lead us to suggest that attempts to increase awareness of the severity of an HIV/AIDS diagnosis may translate into increased condom use among male clients of FSWs.</p>
<p>This study showed that men with higher perceptions that condoms can be beneficial and effective in STI/HIV prevention (response efficacy) were more likely to use condoms consistently. This provides support for interventions aimed at promoting condom use by emphasizing the benefits of condom use. Future studies should determine whether and how the framing of condom use messages affects condom use among Filipino men.</p>
<p>Several factors in our study were not found to be significantly associated with consistent condom use. Age, HIV/AIDS knowledge, marital status, or perceived vulnerability were not significantly associated with condom use in the current study. Although not significant in the current study, older age has been reported as a significant predictor of condom use in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198112446809">Belza et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1090198112446809">Yang, Latkin, Luan, &amp; Nelson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1090198112446809">Zellner, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The finding that HIV knowledge was not associated with condom use in the current study was expected and is consistent with previous literature, as well as with the conclusions of a study conducted with FSWs in the Philippines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198112446809">Amadora-Nolasco et al., 2001</xref>). It has been reported that HIV knowledge alone is not sufficient to change behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1090198112446809">Rosenstock, Strecher, &amp; Becker, 1994</xref>). Evidence that supports the role of HIV knowledge in encouraging preventive behaviors may be best within a comprehensive view of HIV/AIDS education and prevention that addresses multiple factors simultaneously.</p>
<p>Marital status has also been shown to be a predictor of condom use in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1090198112446809">Zellner, 2003</xref>) but not in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198112446809">Belza et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1090198112446809">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). The fact that marital status was not significantly associated with condom use in the bivariate analysis conducted in the current study is troubling. This is because condom use is low overall, and the percentage of men who are married is high, suggesting that some wives may be exposed to infections that might be acquired when their husbands have unprotected intercourse with FSWs.</p>
<p>It has been posited that a perception of vulnerability to illness/infection is essential to health behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198112446809">Janz &amp; Becker, 1984</xref>). However, research has returned mixed results regarding the significance of this construct to HIV prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198112446809">Montgomery, Joseph, Becker, &amp; Ostrow, 1989</xref>). The current study did not find a significant association between perceived vulnerability of HIV/AIDS and condom use, which is consistent with a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1090198112446809">Volk and Koopman (2001)</xref>, who found no association between perceived vulnerability and condom use among male and female participants. However, our findings are inconsistent with a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1090198112446809">Yang et al. (2010)</xref>, who reported that a high perception of HIV/AIDS vulnerability was associated with consistent condom use among male clients of FSWs. This difference in study findings could be because of measurement or cultural differences between populations studied. However, it has been suggested that perception of severity and vulnerability to STI or HIV infection may decrease as relationships progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198112446809">Fortenberry, Tu, Harezlak, Katz, &amp; Orr, 2002</xref>). Therefore, if male clients frequent the same sex establishments and/or engage in sexual relations with familiar sex workers, their perceptions of risk may decrease over time, resulting in less condom use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198112446809">Cooper, Shapiro, &amp; Powers, 1998</xref>). Further study is needed to further elucidate the relationship between perceptions of vulnerability and condom use among male clients of FSWs.</p>
<sec id="section16-1090198112446809">
<title>Limitations and Strengths</title>
<p>Several limitations should be taken into account when interpreting this study. First, data collected for this study were assessed at one point in time and thus limiting the ability to make conclusions regarding causality. Although the data were collected from different geographic regions of the Philippines, this study was limited to a subsample of men who reported being clients of FSWs. It is possible that other men were reluctant to disclose their sexual relationships with FSWs for a variety of reasons and were therefore not included, and the findings of this study are not generalizable to all Filipino men. It is also not possible to rule out potential bias because of inaccurate or intentionally misleading responses. Data were not collected on rates of anal sex; therefore, our interpretation of the findings applies only to instances of vaginal intercourse. The PMT scale of response efficacy used in this study was found to have internal consistency reliability. The reliability of .55 found in the current study compares with the reliability of a similar scale developed in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198112446809">Li et al. (2004)</xref>. However, it is acknowledged that future research is warranted so that this construct can be better assessed. Finally, there are other factors not included in this study that contribute to consistent condom use among male clients of FSWs. Some of these factors may preclude focus at the individual level. For instance, although this study did not address the impact of religion, the large presence of Catholics in the Philippines makes it relevant to explore the role of Catholicism and the Catholic Church in future studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198112446809">Human Rights Watch, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Despite its limitations, this study has important implications for the design of interventions aimed at increasing condom use in the context of commercial sex work. This study demonstrated that education, perceived severity of HIV/AIDS, and positive response efficacy toward condoms are significant predictors of condom use among male clients of FSWs. Future HIV/AIDS prevention interventions that address condom use among male clients should promote educational attainment and focus on awareness of the enduring negative health consequences of acquiring HIV/AIDS, as well as cultivate positive attitudes toward the efficacy of condom use, using creative social marketing strategies. Combining these approaches along with environmental–structural approaches, which have been implemented in some countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198112446809">Kerrigan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198112446809">Morisky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198112446809">Morisky &amp; Tiglao, 2010</xref>), may increase the percentage of male clients who use condoms consistently in the Philippines.</p>
