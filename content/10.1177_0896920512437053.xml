<abstract>
<p>The catastrophic earthquake which devastated Haiti on 12 January 2010 revealed the deep socio-economic divides which plague the nation. The vivid scenes of trauma led to a massive influx of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on behalf of the goodwill of the global community. However, more than one year later the reconstruction process has been shown to be a very lucrative undertaking for many private organizations. Haiti remains in ruins, with NGOs benefiting from the extreme privatization of the Haitian state, resulting in a patchwork system of services which are unaccountable to the Haitian people. The Interim Haiti Reconstruction Committee, led by Bill Clinton, seeks to entrench the same neoliberal policies which laid the foundation for much of the pre-earthquake poverty and dependency. Such efforts raise serious questions about the legitimacy of the current reconstruction and whether these organizations are committed to help Haiti, or themselves – and what alternatives exist.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>This essay was inspired through observations made on my trip to Haiti in November 2010 as a freelance journalist, set against the backdrop of the first month of the cholera epidemic and the staging of the illegitimate Presidential election. The patchwork system has resulted in a deadly disconnect between NGOs and the Haitian people they are mandated to serve. It has not been given much attention outside of the work by Dr Mark Schuller. This essay is an attempt to contribute to this important but overlooked episode of Haiti’s modern history, and document the popular grassroots movements which have emerged from the Haitian people’s struggle for self-determination and democracy.</italic></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The majority of people spoil their lives by an unhealthy and exaggerated altruism – are forced, indeed, so to spoil them. They find themselves surrounded by hideous poverty, by hideous ugliness, by hideous starvation. It is inevitable that they should be strongly moved by all this … Accordingly, with admirable, though misguided intentions, they very seriously and sentimentally set themselves to the task of remedying the evils that they see. But their remedies do not cure the disease: they merely prolong it. Indeed their remedies are part of the disease. But this is not the solution: it is an aggravation of the difficulty. The proper aim is to try and reconstruct society on such a basis that poverty will be impossible.

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Before the 12 January 2010 earthquake, Haiti had the most privatized social-service sector in the Americas, with over 80 percent of the country’s basic services provided by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920512437053">Dupuy, 2010</xref>). It is not uncommon for the Haitian people to mockingly refer to their country as the ‘republic of NGOs’. Before the earthquake, there were an estimated 10,000 NGOs operating in Haiti, but since 12 January it has been simply impossible to keep track of the number. More than one year later and with over US$10b in reconstruction funds promised to the Bill Clinton led Interim Haiti Reconstruction Committee, on 1 April 2011, 40 popular Haitian organizations called for the dissolution of the committee. The organizations went on to bluntly state that ‘Our analysis and evidence leads us to conclude that Haitian society continues to be locked into the same traps of exclusion, dependency, and ignorance of our strengths, our resources, our identity … The structures of domination and dependence have been reproduced and reinforced by the constellation of agencies including MINUSTAH (the United Nations), the IHRC and large international NGOs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920512437053">Groupe d’Appui aux Rapatriés et Refugiés, 2011</xref>). This article will argue that the lack of progress in Haiti should not come as a surprise, as the portrayal of a socially conscious and politically neutral NGO led development model in Haiti is a perfect Trojan horse for the entrenchment of the most extreme neoliberal economic restructuring documented to date. The goals, vision and business model of the transnational NGOs are of increased dependency in Haiti, which is diametrically opposed to the goals of the Haitian people who demand a development model which both brings about self-sufficiency and allows for self-determination.</p>

<sec id="section2-0896920512437053">
<title>The Construction of Haiti as a Failed State</title>
<p>The current situation in Haiti cannot be understood without the proper historical context. Before the earthquake, Haiti was routinely referred to as the poorest nation in the Western hemisphere, the prototypical failed state – a little piece of sub-Saharan Africa only 750km off of the Florida coast. In the midst of all of these derogatory references, there has been little to no discussion in the media about how the ‘basket case of the hemisphere’ has been predominately engineered through slavery, colonialism, genocide, economic terrorism, political manipulation and foreign military occupation.</p>
<p>After the success of the Haitian Revolution in 1804, the colonial powers of the time decided that an independent Haiti would pose a threat to the entire system of slavery and colonialism in the Americas. After numerous attempts to recolonize the newly established republic through military force alone were defeated, the international powers of France, the USA, England and Holland put aside their colonial rivalries in a determined effort to destroy the revolution in its infancy by bleeding it to death financially.</p>
<p>Facing extreme isolation, and with a French war fleet sitting offshore, in 1825 Haiti agreed to take out a loan from a designated French bank and pay compensation to the French plantation owners for their ‘loss of property’, including freed slaves and stolen land. In effect Haiti was paying twice for its freedom; first with blood, and second with money. The amount of the debt totalled 150,000,000 francs. Today that amount would equal US$21b dollars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0896920512437053">Schuller, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Haiti may have been the first nation to escape colonialism through revolution, but Haiti also became the first ‘third world’ nation in the traditional sense, as it was poor and overburdened with debt. The Haitian Government could not build schools, hospitals or roads because nearly all of the available money went to pay France. In 1915, for example, 80 percent of government revenues went to debt service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920512437053">Farmer, 2003</xref>). Haiti did not finish paying the loans that financed this odious debt until 1947 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0896920512437053">Regan, 2005</xref>). Over a century after the global slave trade was recognized and eliminated as the evil it was, the Haitians were still paying their ancestors’ masters for their freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0896920512437053">Phillips, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Neoliberalism and the Gutting of a Skeletal State</title>
<p>As Haiti was in a desperate financial position due to economic blackmail, the USA saw it as a potentially dangerous hotspot for ‘communist subversion’. Under the dictatorship of the Duvaliers (1957–86), they provided an investment friendly climate by enacting minimal taxes, violently banning trade unions, preserving starvation wages, and a removal of any restrictions on the movement of capital – what would later be expanded upon in the Caribbean Basin Initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920512437053">Hallward, 2007</xref>: 15). An estimated 60,000 suspected communists, progressives and peasants were murdered by the Macoutes under Duvalier’s reign, with hundreds of thousands more tortured at the infamous Fort Dimanche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920512437053">Aponte, 2010</xref>). Under the rule of ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier, an estimated 80 percent of Haiti’s professional and political class had emigrated to escape the violent oppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920512437053">Bellegarde-Smith, 2004</xref>: 129). When the younger Jean Claude Duvalier was forced into exile in 1986, he reportedly landed in the French Côte d’Azur with a comfortable net worth of US$1.6b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920512437053">Lundahl, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The looting of the Haitian treasury went virtually unopposed by the international community, and Haiti began its second shot at independence broke and isolated. Needing money, the military junta ruling Haiti entered into negotiations with the IMF for development loans. Per usual, access to credit was dependent on the reduction of tariffs, the privatization of remaining state industries, and implementing a sharp reduction in the funding of public goods. The period between 1986 and 1990 was marked by five different governments, each attempting to gain the favor of the international community by putting forward increasingly neoliberal policies.</p>
<p>By the time of the 1990 elections, the IMF and the World Bank were simply not satisfied with starving the Haitian state to death; they wanted to grind the bones to dust. With the democratic election of a populist priest named Jean Bertrand Aristide in Haiti’s first ever free and fair elections in 1990, the Haitian people voted overwhelmingly against neoliberalism and the USA backed candidate, former World Bank staffer, Marc Bazin. Aristide looked to increase tariffs to protect local farmers, guarantee them a market, raise the daily wage to US$5 <italic>per day</italic>, and fund public works, in addition to starting health and educational programs to kick-start the development of the domestic economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920512437053">Hallward, 2007</xref>: 117). Seven months into his term, he was overthrown in a coup d’etat by elements of the old military junta, working in collaboration with the Haitian elite and the USA.</p>
<p>After the coup, the army violently cracked down on the progressive civil society which had brought down the Duvalier regime, and worked so hard to push for elections in 1990. During the brutal military rule, over 5000 Aristide supporters were killed, thousands more tortured, with over 80,000 Haitians fleeing the island by boat to escape from an increasingly predatory regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920512437053">Americas Watch, 1993</xref>). In order to stem the massive flood of ‘boat people’, the USA under Bill Clinton returned Aristide to office on the condition that he implement further rounds of neoliberal policies and enter into a coalition government with the very same elements who had ousted him three years earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920512437053">Ives, 1995</xref>). Upon his return, the most significant action of Aristide’s first presidency was the dissolution of the murderous Haitian army, turning them into a 50-piece marching band.</p>
<p>With the election of Rene Préval and the continuation of Lavalas in power – Haiti not only faced many internal problems, but also once again became a pawn of US politics. As pro-coup, pro-military elements in the Republican Party justified the cutting off of US$50m in aid due to the suspicion that the murder of one of their anti-Lavalas supporters, Mireille Durocher de Bertin, was politically motivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920512437053">Stotsky, 1997</xref>: 270). This event was one of the crucial elements for the passage of the Dole Amendment in 1995 that prevented USAID from providing any direct aid to the Haitian state, and set the trend for other donor states including Canada which now channels its aid to Haiti via the Red Cross, CARE, Médecins du Monde, Save the Children, Oxfam Quebec, the Centre for International Studies and Cooperation (CECI), and World Vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920512437053">Canadian International Development Agency, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0896920512437053">Schuller, 2007</xref>). The Dole Amendment was considered a part of a wider Republican plan which undermined President Clinton’s perceived foreign policy successes, with the Haitian people and state as collateral damage. This policy is best described by Haiti scholar Mark Schuller as the ‘manifestation of a divided U.S. government and the U.S. government’s mistrust of Haiti’s elected governments of Aristide and Préval’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0896920512437053">Schuller, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Several years later, with another landslide electoral victory for Aristide in 2000, the Haitian elite and the international community were outraged at the outcome. Aristide was once again elected upon a platform of stopping the privatization of the remaining state industries, raising the minimum wage, protecting farmers, building schools, hospitals and clinics – in addition to making public demands that France repay the US$21b debt to Haiti. With the 2000 election of Aristide, the intense politicization of aid to Haiti began in concert with the funding of ex-army personnel in the Dominican Republic. This time there would be no negotiation with Aristide.</p>
<p>With his election as a victory for popular democracy, Aristide faced an unprecedented economic and aid embargo by the USA, Canada, the European Union, and financial institutions such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) – eerily reminiscent of the policies faced by Haiti in 1804. In spite of this, under the two Aristide administrations, more schools were built in Haiti than during the period of 1804–1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920512437053">Flynn, 2010</xref>). Aristide and his Lavalas party built 195 new primary schools and 104 new public high schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920512437053">Flynn, 2010</xref>). Aristide began a universal schooling program, devoting 20 percent of the starved Haitian budget to education, starting a school lunch program, and building the country’s first free public medical school with the assistance of the Taiwanese and Cubans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920512437053">Hallward, 2007</xref>: 129). Due to this modest progress under such restrictive economic circumstances, Aristide was increasingly being viewed as a threat to the elite Haitian and American hegemony. On 29 February 2004 he was overthrown once again and exiled to the Central African Republic.</p>

<title>The Politicization of Aid in Haiti</title>
<p>With Aristide’s second electoral victory, the tactics of destabilization had changed in Haiti. While military intervention was the fatal blow, the demise of the Aristide administration had been cultivated through an economic embargo and a deeply politicized aid delivery which created a parallel NGO state in Haiti. The economic embargo worked to limit the ability of Aristide to build any new social services or pay his staff. The economic strangulation led to many disgruntled government workers, unpaid teachers, and poorly supplied hospitals. At the same time, foreign NGOs began springing up all over the country, creating a patchwork and sporadic delivery of basic services to the Haitian people by organizations such as the Red Cross and World Vision.</p>
<p>In addition to the effects of structural adjustment and historic economic exploitation there are three key issues of foreign intervention which have increased the dependency of the Haitian people today:</p>
<list id="list1-0896920512437053" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In 1986, Haiti was self sufficient in food production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920512437053">Center for Human Rights and Global Justice, 2010a</xref>). The lowering of tariffs since liberalization began has led to a situation whereby Haitian farmers cannot compete with cheaply imported, subsidized rice, corn and meat from the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920512437053">Center for Human Rights and Global Justice, 2010a</xref>). Current food aid under the US Public Law 480 eliminates the possibility of domestic agriculture being incorporated as a form of assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920512437053">Center for Human Rights and Global Justice, 2010a</xref>). This has led to increased dependency on imports, leading to a massive exodus of farmers to urban centers, where they compete for starvation wages in garment assembly plants.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In July 1998, the IADB approved a US$54m development loan to improve water delivery and sanitation in Port au Prince starting in 2001(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920512437053">Center for Human Rights and Global Justice, 2010b</xref>). A Freedom of Information Act request revealed that it was blocked by the USA for fear that such a project would increase the popularity of Aristide’s administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920512437053">Center for Human Rights and Global Justice, 2010b</xref>). In light of the cholera epidemic now, where over 5,000 people have been killed, this act has had deadly consequences.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In February 2004, the Aristide administration had completed the country’s first free public medical school with the assistance of the Taiwanese and Cuban governments. It was estimated that the school would produce over 600 doctors during its first 12 years of existence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920512437053">Hallward, 2007</xref>: 129). When the coup occurred three weeks later, the school was shut down and turned into a barracks, first for the US Marines, and later for the United Nations. It has yet to begin training doctors.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Another major, complementary part of the destabilization of Haiti was the funding of an umbrella organization of elite-oriented, anti-Aristide activists and NGOs called the Group of 184. For example, the G-184 was largely financed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, and the International Republican Institute. As Peter Hallward reports in his book <italic>Damming the Flood: Haiti, Aristide and the Politics of Containment</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920512437053">2007</xref>), USAID and other government agencies from Northern countries provide 70 percent of the funding of NGOs in Haiti. The other 30 percent comes from corporate and individual donations. Thus, the label ‘non-governmental’ is a bit of a misnomer.</p>
<p>With the proliferation of NGOs in Haiti, the state has been circumvented, and unelected organizations that are unaccountable to the Haitian people have begun carrying out a determined and well funded program of neoliberal transformation. The relationships between the NGOs and their donors continually undermine the Haitian people’s right to self-determination, while the organizations are at the same time cultivating and profiting from the poverty they are entrusted to fight.</p>
<p>One of the major justifications for the shift from direct state-to-state aid to the NGO model was the perception of endemic corruption in Haiti. The ongoing discussion of corruption is related to the promotion of a new set of ideological disciplining measures based upon good governance and transparency – both code words for increased openness to transnational capital and neoliberal restructuring. Ricardo Seitenfus was recently dismissed from his position as the Organization of American States Special Representative to Haiti for telling the truth about corruption and NGOs. In an interview with BBC Brazil shortly before his dismissal he stated:<disp-quote>
<p>The charges of corruption are part of an ideological discussion. There is no corruption, there is the perception of corruption. Haiti has no way of being corrupt because the state has no resources. What can be questioned is how the resources that the NGOs collect, without accounting for them to anyone, are being administered. That is indeed the big question. I make an exception of the work that was done in the emergency, but there cannot be a permanent policy of substituting the NGOs for the state. Haiti is Haiti, it is not Haiti ‘ong’ [Haiti-NGO]. No country would accept what the Haitians are forced to accept. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920512437053">Peixoto, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The statements by Ricardo Seitenfus echoed the popular sentiments of the Haitian people and the marginalized Haitian government. As reported by the Associated Press less than one cent of each dollar of US earthquake relief is going to the Haitian Government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920512437053">Associated Press, 2010</xref>). The candid interview by Seitenfus, highlighting the hypocritical and self-serving policies being enacted in Haiti was widely ignored by the international media, but went on to earn him the Knight of the Republic Honours, bestowed by the Haitian Government. The issues of hypocrisy, the construction of corruption and Haitian incompetence are endless fuel for the presence and justification of self-serving, undemocratic NGOs in Haiti.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0896920512437053">
<title>The Social Construction of NGOs as Apolitical Actors</title>
<p>The presence of NGOs and development agencies is consciously and systematically constructed as an apolitical phenomenon. The very presence of NGOs in a country is often portrayed as a symbol of transnational humanity in action; in short, NGOs and charity equals good work. The reality is much more complicated and much more self-serving. Their very presence in Haiti is manufactured as a symbol of the fundamental failure of the Haitian people and its culture. While NGOs such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the Red Cross position themselves as advocates of human rights issues, their analysis and field of action is very limited. These NGOs do highlight human rights abuses, but do not link them to the wider structural issues that exist – both domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>The platform of NGOs in Haiti emphasizes that the individual is both the problem and solution to poverty, ignoring structural policies and embedded power relations. This method works to reduce the level of political consciousness and solidarity of the community by placing the people into competition for access to scarce resources and services. NGOs work in very select communities; atomizing the society and eroding the notion that access to healthcare, education or sanitary conditions are a public good, not something to be delivered by privileged outsiders. In a scathing article titled <italic>Imperialism and NGOs in Latin America</italic>, James Petras states that:<disp-quote>
<p>NGOs emphasize projects, not movements; they ‘mobilize’ people to produce at the margins but not to struggle to control the basic means of production and wealth; they focus on technical financial assistance of projects, not on structural conditions that shape the everyday lives of people. The NGOs co-opt the language of the left: ‘popular power’, ‘empowerment’, ‘gender equality’, ‘sustainable development’, ‘bottom-up leadership’. The problem is that this language is linked to a framework of collaboration with donors and government agencies that subordinate practical activity to non-confrontational politics. The local nature of NGO activity means that ‘empowerment’ never goes beyond influencing small areas of social life, with limited resources, and within the conditions permitted by the neoliberal state and macro-economy. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0896920512437053">1997</xref>: 14)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This debate regarding the depoliticizing of such a political issue is something which needs to be discussed, as we must develop a discourse which allows us to move beyond the mere uttering of good intentions. The current shift to and promotion of philanthropy led development further justifies and naturalizes the system which allows an individual to become a multi-billionaire in a world where 80 percent of the world lives on US$10 a day. The focus is on the wrong end of the spectrum. We should not be congratulating the system which created a Bill Gates or Warren Buffet, but rather condemn the system which created the 5 billion desperately poor people.</p>
<p>The debate regarding the structural ineffectiveness of charities and NGOs is difficult for the most part because criticism of charity creates the problematic misconception that an individual is against easing the suffering of others, or the good intention to make the world a better place. This is not true. The problem is the <italic>wider framework within which charity occurs</italic>. As Paulo Freire stated in <italic>The Pedagogy of the Oppressed</italic>, ‘In order to have the continued opportunity to express their generosity, the oppressors must perpetuate injustice as well. An unjust social order is the permanent fount of this generosity, which is nourished by death, despair, and poverty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920512437053">2000</xref>: 44). This was exactly the situation in Haiti where in 2003, for example, Haiti’s debt service was US$57.4m whereas the combined government spending for education, healthcare, environment, and transportation was US$39.21m – for a country of 9 million people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920512437053">Center for Human Rights and Global Justice, 2010b</xref>). The material priorities of such institutions boldly reveal their true interests despite the rhetoric and interviews claiming otherwise.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0896920512437053">
<title>False Consciousness, False Charity</title>
<p>The 12 January earthquake was a tragic event which shattered Haiti, killing 300,000 and turning the homes of 1.3 million people to dust, and unleashed numerous man-made aftershocks which threaten to entrench the neoliberal economic agenda, seriously undermining the ability of the Haitian people to establish a state run in accordance with the demands of the poor majority. As witnessed by the reconstruction effort in Haiti, charity and goodwill has become a commodity. The process of helping to alleviate poverty and destruction has been turned into a business – a business which is predominately accountable to its donors, not to the people it is entrusted to help.</p>
<p>The growth of the development industry – the business of poverty – has led to it becoming a multibillion dollar industry. The top 10 international NGOs made US$8b in income in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920512437053">Caldwell, 2011</xref>). NGOs are simply a reorganization of a kinder, gentler, decentralized imperialism. The reality of NGOs in Haiti and in the developing world in general is along the lines of a twisted, but suitable idiom which states, ‘Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. Allow a man to fish and you ruin a perfectly good business opportunity.’</p>
<p>In order to bring about a development model which can really help reconstruct Haiti, NGOs should all work towards making themselves irrelevant. With the emergency phase of relief over, this means that they should not simply import foreign professionals to do the jobs that locals are capable of, or could be trained to do. Importing teams of Canadian nurses down to Haiti is a tremendous waste of resources considering airfare, accommodation, food, security – when Haitian nurses are sitting unemployed in tent camps because the state hospitals were doubly destroyed by structural adjustment and the earthquake.</p>
<p>In addition, NGOs are in constant competition over resources, both financial and human. Working together to achieve a goal – such as the eradication of cholera – is impossible because it would compromise the very competitive fundraising system in which they operate. NGOs need to differentiate themselves by promoting different projects, in different communities in order to secure funding. If an NGO was to complement the work of another NGO, donors would leapfrog to the primary partner. Local training and capacity building are also seen as competition to their continued existence. Examining the basic mandate and practice of NGOs, James Petras goes on to state:<disp-quote>
<p>The new politics of the NGOs is essentially the politics of compradores: they produce no national products; instead, they link foreign funders with local labor (self-help micro-enterprises) to facilitate the continuation of the neoliberal regime. The managers of NGOs are fundamentally <italic>political</italic> actors whose projects and training workshops do not make any significant <italic>economic</italic> impact in raising workers’ and peasants’ incomes. But their activities do make an impact in diverting people from the class struggle into forms of collaboration with their oppressors.

<p>Those engaged in NGOs should be trying to build democratic, accountable organizations, not the opposite. From the evidence on the ground, this is not their intention. The recently formed Disaster Accountability Project found that of the 197 largest NGOs in Haiti, only 6 provided regular, factual situation reports on their websites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920512437053">Disaster Accountability Project, 2010</xref>). Out of the 197, only 21 offered to even take part in the survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920512437053">Disaster Accountability Project, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>An Anomaly of Foreign Assistance to Haiti</title>
<p>While many of the NGOs are providing essential albeit temporary services to the people of Haiti – specifically in Port au Prince – they are simply a band aid solution, because when these organizations leave, the Haitian people will be more dependent than before. This is where an anomaly of foreign assistance in Haiti is turning the tide of ‘business as usual’ and is actively working to reverse the damage of the international community to develop a self-sufficient and healthy Haitian population (in partnership with those they serve) by complementing Haitian public healthcare service, not replacing it. The work of the Cuban medical brigades in Haiti highlights the possibilities of what can be achieved when operating with the interests of the Haitian people at heart. Despite working on a transnational shoestring budget, the Cubans are working towards building sustainable public infrastructure and training – not a parallel, patchwork and privatized system.</p>
<p>If the international community were serious about helping to build up a sustainable and effective public healthcare system in Haiti they should contract the Cubans to carry out the project. Cuba and Haiti signed a medical cooperation agreement in 1998, as a reaction to the terrible damage Haiti had sustained that year due to several powerful hurricanes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920512437053">Kirk, 2010</xref>). Studies by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) indicated clear improvements in the health profile since this extensive Cuban medical cooperation began.</p>
<p>After the 12 January earthquake Fidel Castro criticized the initial response of the USA sending the Marines to Haiti, stating, ‘We send doctors, not soldiers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920512437053">Castro, 2010</xref>). Due to their presence on the ground long before the 12 January earthquake, the 344 Cuban doctors were the first to react to the unspeakable trauma – entering many communities where other NGOs were afraid to go – such as Cité Soleil, a notorious slum which the United Nations has designated the ‘most dangerous place on Earth’.</p>
<p>To date, a combined total of 930 Cuban health professionals make Cuba’s the largest medical contingent on the ground in Haiti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920512437053">Kirk, 2010</xref>). When the United Nations and US Marines took over the Haitian medical school, all of the doctors were allowed to continue their education in Cuba free of charge. Another batch of 200 doctors from 24 countries in Africa and Latin America trained by Cuba, and a dozen American doctors who graduated from medical schools in Havana, went to Haiti to provide reinforcement to existing Cuban medical teams. By comparison, the internationally renowned Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has approximately 269 health professionals working in Haiti, despite the organization being much better funded and having far more medical supplies and equipment than the Cuban team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920512437053">Kirk, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to their emergency support, at the United Nations Donor Conference on Haiti, Cuba announced a project to rebuild Haiti’s entire public health service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920512437053">Girvan, 2010</xref>). Although this was, arguably, the most ambitious and impressive proposal put forward by any nation at the conference, it was blacklisted from international media coverage. The cost of the ten-year program is US$690.5m, and according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920512437053">Norman Girvan (2010)</xref>, a Research Fellow at the University of the West Indies, Cuba’s contribution, in relation to its GDP, is 152 times that of the USA, which pledged US$1.15b. In contrast to the self serving agendas of many NGOs and donor nations, Cuba has no significant economic interests in Haiti. The Cuban medical teams are simply doing what they have always done – working to provide healthcare to those who need it the most, regardless of their nationality.</p>
<p>This has led to the Norwegians and Brazilians signing agreements to provide aid to Haiti via the sustainable programs put forward by the Cuban medical teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0896920512437053"><italic>People’s Daily</italic>, 2010</xref>). The end result will be a group of Haitian doctors and nurses, not foreign imports, working in real buildings, not tents, and accountable to the local people. While not perfect, this form of aid does work to help Haitians help themselves, and does not increase their dependence. The same cannot be said for other international aid programs which seek to limit the power and potential of the majority of Haitian people.</p>

<p>The 12 January earthquake destroyed many things in Haiti, but it did not shatter the pride, determination, and spirit of resistance within the Haitian people. Those expecting immediate, albeit modest, revolutionary change in Haiti will be disappointed through a shallow analysis of events – but this does not mean that the Haitian people are not organizing and resisting on the ground. If anything it has strengthened their resolve to bring about a stronger, socially just, democratic and sovereign country dedicated to reversing the trend of neoliberal policies and NGO led development.</p>
<p>While the situation of NGOs in Haiti can best be described as one of occasional individual successes amidst a sea of abject failure, there is hope. The very same failure of the NGOs in Haiti has led to an emergence of new, and a strengthening of existing grassroots Haitian organizations which both come from, and are accountable to their communities. These organizations run with hardly any resources, and understand both the history and nature of the problems affecting Haitian society. In addition, there is no ‘Plan B’ or exit strategy for these organizations, because they are looking to improve the lives of the very people within the communities from which they come.</p>
<p>Unlike foreign based NGOs which focus on small community projects, Haitian grassroots organizations form part of a decentralized popular movement, which are focused on providing basic services and providing popular education on issues that shape the everyday lives of people within their communities. It does not stop there, however, as Haitian grassroots organizations make it a priority to educate and politicize members of their communities – focusing on issues related to internal class dynamics, foreign military occupation and the impact of neoliberal policies upon the state – important issues that international NGOs conveniently ignore.</p>
<p>Those that underestimate the ability of grassroots organizing to bring forth revolutionary change in Haiti should look to history. This current development of a popular class consciousness is similar to the emergence of the <italic>organisations populaires</italic> during the <italic>dechoukaj</italic> (uprooting/resistance) movement against the dictatorship of Baby Doc Duvalier in the early 1980s. These <italic>organisations populaires</italic> worked within the communities to arrange basic services which the state was unwilling or unable to provide in addition to mobilizing Haiti’s poor majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920512437053">Hallward, 2007</xref>: 16).</p>
<p>This <italic>dechoukaj</italic> movement grew so powerful that it eventually led to the end of Duvalier’s reign of terror and paved the way for Haiti’s modest social revolution under Aristide. It can be argued that a similar thing is occurring now, albeit in an earlier stage with grassroots organizations providing protection, basic legal, health and education services, pooling community resources, and distributing food and water to some of Haiti’s most marginalized communities.</p>
<p>Yet, despite facing over 20 years of extremely violent political oppression against advocates of popular democracy and members of the Lavalas movement, what Peter Hallward describes as ‘one of the most prolonged and intense periods of counter-revolution anywhere in the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920512437053">Hallward, 2010</xref>), the flourishing of such politically active organizations proves that the roots of democracy in Haiti are indeed very deep. Inspired by this organic emergence of community solidarity, Patrick Elie, a Haitian political activist and former member of the Aristide administration remarked that ‘I put all my money on our ability, at the level of the grassroots movement to remobilize the Haitian people, to make them believe once again that they are the key players in politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920512437053">Hallward, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Groups such as Bri Kouri Novel Gaye – an independent media organization of young people – has began to organize the communities and IDP camps to know their rights, history and reject the further recolonization of Haiti by NGOs. They are advocating the development of a reconstruction partnership with the Haitian people – not apart from them. They are working to document human rights abuses conducted by MINUSTAH and also advocate making sure that Haiti does not become more dependent on NGOs as these make the possibility of Haitians helping Haitians nearly impossible.</p>
<p>The Bureau des Avocats Internationaux is an organization of human rights lawyers who defend the rights of the poor. They have routinely been shot at, and consistently have a price on their head for defending those with nothing against the Haitian elite, the police and the United Nations. Their offices also double as an organizing space for labour activists, women’s groups and local activists. The organization is currently working to bring the United Nations up on charges for introducing cholera into Haiti and engaging in numerous extrajudicial killings. They are also involved in the broader movement to end the occupation by MINUSTAH forces. Their organizing efforts and reports have made significant headway, and were presented to the United Nations International Periodic Review of Human Rights in October 2011.</p>
<p>KOFAVIV, the Commission of Women Victims for Victims is an organization established for and by rape survivors in some of Haiti’s most marginalized communities. The group has created a women’s centre, which acts as a refuge for rape survivors, and provides important counseling, medical and legal services for women and children. In addition, the group also provides services in many of the IDP camps throughout Port au Prince, bringing the same services to women who cannot afford to travel to their centre. In response to the increased levels of sexual violence in the camps – due to the disregard of the issue by Haitian police and MINUSTAH – KOFAVIV has setup citizen patrols in the camps to protect women and children once night falls.</p>
<p>The importance of Haitian grassroots organizations and their ability to mobilize the Haitian people and develop a class consciousness is not something to be taken lightly. It has since been revealed that Canada’s deployment of 2000 troops after the earthquake was not simply for humanitarian purposes, but rather because they feared a popular uprising in Haiti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920512437053">Canadian Press, 2011</xref>). Perhaps some of the most revealing Wikileaks cables on Haiti stated that ‘A premature departure of MINUSTAH would leave the [Haitian] government … vulnerable to … resurgent populist and anti-market economy political forces – reversing gains of the last two years’ – written by US Ambassador Janet Sanderson on 1 October 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920512437053">Herz, 2011</xref>). The same cable revealed that MINUSTAH ‘is an indispensable tool in realizing core USG [US Government] policy interests in Haiti’.</p>
<p>The release of such documents reveals that it is taking the combined effort of the international community and the world’s military and economic superpower to hold back the movement towards popular democracy in Haiti. The US disdain for populism is their disdain for democracy in Haiti, as the interests of the poor majority would be at odds with their own. The outright refusal of the Haitian people and the grassroots organizations to accept the dominance of NGOs, the United Nations occupation, the rigged 2010 elections or the self-serving reconstruction effort has begun to open up many cracks in the imperialist plan for Haiti. Considering the extent and resources of the opposition, this is no small feat.</p>
<p>In August 2011, the Brazilian Defense Minister Celso Amorim announced plans to conclude Brazil’s participation in the infamous United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. The exit of MINUSTAH would be a significant gain for the advocates of popular democracy, as MINUSTAH has routinely been documented murdering pro-democracy forces in post-coup Haiti and introducing cholera into the country.</p>
<p>A second and equally important part is that the current government lacks any popular legitimacy. Once 14 political parties were banned in the 2010 presidential and parliamentary elections, the Haitian people did not turn out for what they called a ‘selection’. President Michel Martelly was elected by the lowest electoral turnout in Latin America since record keeping began over 60 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920512437053">Ives, 2011</xref>). This was not a simple coincidence, but rather part of a widespread political mobilization in response to the banning of the 14 political parties – including Lavalas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920512437053">Beeton, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Martelly’s attempts to introduce his two Prime Ministerial candidates were rejected outright, leading the country into a political paralysis. His recommendations of a far right, neoliberal businessman, and a notorious former coup supporter and human rights abuser both failed. Martelly’s small base of support eroded quickly, and the so-called ‘people’s choice’ for President could no longer walk the streets without getting pelted by bottles or rocks. There are still numerous protests against President Martelly.</p>
<p>Despite all of the hardships that the Haitian people have endured over the past 25 years, they have never stopped fighting, and they have never given up hope. The progressive elements of popular democracy have once again sprung up in Haiti, unafraid to voice their opposition to the UN occupation, failed development aid, cholera and the continuance of fraudulent elections. These organizations are filling the gaps in the development model, organizing communities, taking to the streets, calling for officials to be held accountable, delivering basic services, and are essentially a rebirth of the <italic>organisations populaires.</italic></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The experience of NGOs in Haiti has highlighted their structural limitations, their self-serving interests, and their role in limiting – purposefully or not – the ability of the Haitian people to develop a platform of national reconstruction built upon the principles of self-determination and self-sufficiency. The role of NGOs in providing nearly all of the basic services in Haiti is an extreme example of neoliberalism in action – and it is failing the Haitian people miserably. The continued expansion of NGOs on the ground signals that for some, these are indeed boom times. Without a serious discussion about the nature of the development industry and NGOs, we can only expect the situation in Haiti to happen again elsewhere, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Without changing the wider structure in which these NGOs operate, it is impossible to expect real, sustainable results. Haiti’s failed reconstruction is a beacon that warns us that NGOs cannot replace the state, and that any attempt to do so is destructive and dangerous. The NGOs in Haiti have increased the dependency of the Haitian people through undemocratic and non-transparent projects which serve to entrench the neoliberal ideals of privatized governance, a reduced role for the state, and free mobility of both foreign capital and people – while Haitians stay trapped in the IDP camps. Vast amounts of aid money which could go to support Haitian grassroots organizations, or the Cuban medical missions, are spent on frivolous and superficial expenses for temporary, foreign NGO staffers.</p>
<p>The discussion about whether or not charity can exist within such an inhuman and exploitative capitalist system must be pushed to the forefront. While unpopular, posing the question does force people to look into the true nature and motivations of charity in our current system. A simple donation to an NGO does not erase the crimes of history which have created the divide between the rich and the poor. Haiti has become a microcosm of the problematic power relations between the first and third world. The causes are structural. The causes are deep. The first step should be to work with the Haitian people, listen to their demands and give them control over the reconstruction of their own country. Anything less should be considered another form of colonialism. The demands for the implementation of basic public health and educational systems are not excessive by any means, but are discussed as unreasonable programs. Such systems would marginalize the NGOs’ area of operations. The Haitian people deserve better, yet their oppression has historically generated profits for the rich, either through slavery, cheap labour, debt bondage, or now as a laboratory for NGO led neoliberal development.</p>
<p>In order to understand the problems facing NGOs in Haiti, one must think radically. Not radically in the extremist sense, but in the original sense of the word which means to go to the root, or foundation, of the problem. Haiti will never develop under the auspices of the capitalist system. The promotion of charitable capitalism is the development of a false consciousness because we are feeding the same system which created the inequalities in the first place. However, the emergence of new and the strengthening of old Haitian grassroots organizations in developing class consciousness causes optimism through their open declarations that the poverty and desperation facing Haiti and so many other nations is not natural – it is a social construction. Simply stated, anything that can be built can be taken apart; but the first responsibility of academics, development workers, politicians, policy creators and activists is recognize that ‘unless we agree that the world should not be the way it is … there is no point of contact, because the world that is satisfying to us is the same world which is utterly devastating to them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920512437053">Farmer, 2005</xref>: 157).</p>
