<p>Never judge a book by its cover. Richard Weikart’s study of Hitler’s evolutionary views is a case in point. The woodcut image of lantern-jawed soldiery advancing, swastika flag aloft, towards their destiny does not really suggest scholarly sophistication or nuanced analysis. In fact the book looks like something found in a charity shop, sandwiched between <italic>The Greatest Tank Battles in History</italic> and <italic>Luftwaffe Fighter Aces</italic>. This is not an irrelevant observation, since a book entitled <italic>Hitler’s Ethic</italic> is bound to provoke suspicion. Might this be some sensationalist tract seeking to cash in on the public’s obsession with Nazi criminality? Weikart is clearly aware of those suspicions but does little to allay them in his introduction, which reads like a mixture of a television voiceover and the worst kind of undergraduate essay. Take his opening line, ‘Why was Hitler so evil?’ Most academic readers, unless tasked with reviewing the book, would surely have put it down at this point and never given it a second thought.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate since Weikart’s book is a respectable piece of research. In nine densely referenced chapters, he takes us through Hitler’s guiding philosophy, based on a close reading of the Führer’s recorded utterances. The material examined is impressively comprehensive, ranging from the minor pieces of Hitler’s early years, via the familiar core documents of Nazism, to the transcripts of secret addresses that have surfaced in recent years in Moscow (among the masses of material looted by the Russians after the war). Weikart knows his sources. What he says should therefore carry weight. He contends that Hitler’s pronouncements amount to a coherent, if idiosyncratic ethical system, which guided the Nazi leader throughout his political and genocidal career.</p>
<p>The idea that men, knee-deep in blood, should nevertheless have regarded their murderous actions as ‘ethical’ may not be quite such a new thing. A decade ago or so Michael Burleigh wrote a book entitled <italic>Ethics and Extermination</italic> (a title curiously absent from Weikart’s otherwise substantial bibliography); and the recognition that the Nazis believed in evolution is again not exactly ground-breaking. If the two principal premises of Weikart’s study then are familiar enough, his study still has merit. The merit lies in the way he has combined the two, and backed them up with a systematic trawl of the documents. The result is a persuasive image of Hitler’s personal belief-system: a kind of secular religion, based on a cult of evolutionary progress. As in all religions, there were moral imperatives. Nothing, in Hitler’s universe, should be allowed to interfere with the laws of natural selection. Anything that kept the weak alive threatened to undermine evolutionary progress and was thus morally repugnant because it denied humanity the opportunity of genetic advance. Compassion, for Hitler, was not just perverse, it was <italic>immoral</italic>. Weikart reminds us that Hitler did not merely order the murder of disabled Germans but worried that fighting men, wounded at the front (but still potentially able to procreate), might not find a hospital bed because the wards were clogged up with those earmarked for destruction by Nature itself. There was, in other words, not just method in this murderous madness but moral purpose, albeit one that turned on its head the Christian precepts by which Europe had sought to live for centuries. This is an important finding. We shall have to be more careful in future in describing Hitler’s policies as ‘cynical’ and ‘amoral’. They may deserve that description by any objective standard but, as Weikart has shown, by <italic>subjective</italic> Nazi standards they were not. And those subjective standards are what shaped behaviour in the Third Reich.</p>
<p>This intriguing book has two notable weaknesses. One lies in its focus on Hitler. We are never told if Hitler’s ethics were also Göring’s or Goebbels’, let alone the ethics of ordinary Germans. Weikart does mention at one point that Himmler was more radical than Walther Darré (and that Hitler backed Himmler). What is needed is a clearer sense of how ‘Hitler’s ethics’ were disseminated within the party and at least some inkling of how far they were able to penetrate beyond. For there is a difference between obeying orders and regarding those orders as <italic>morally</italic> motivated.</p>
<p>The book’s second weakness stems from its emphasis on intellectual developments <italic>inside</italic> Germany. Intentionally or not, Weikart plays down the wider ramifications. Yet Nazi racist and eugenic thought was dependent to quite a remarkable extent on Anglo-American antecedents. There was nothing remotely original about the Nazis. That intellectual debt matters because Hitler also repeatedly reminded his listeners that British and American history, in particular, was rich in episodes of mass murder, and that the Anglo-Saxons owed their present pre-eminence to the fact that they had embraced biological evolution, dispossessing the ‘lesser races’ on entire continents, and killing or deporting those ‘natives’ that got in the way. That, above all, is why the cover of Weikart’s book is so unhelpful. It obscures the fact that Hitler had set out to copy what he regarded as the Anglo-American example. If we are to understand ‘Hitler’s ethics’, we need to acknowledge the raw racism that underpinned Western expansion and that was so closely enmeshed with self-exculpatory notions of evolutionary progress. ‘Why was Hitler so evil?’ Because he invariably tried to outdo those he wished to emulate.</p>
