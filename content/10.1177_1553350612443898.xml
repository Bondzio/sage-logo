<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1985,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612443898">1</xref></sup> revolutionary minimally invasive surgery has been developed. In the past decade, laparoendoscopic procedures have been used in various fields for benign and malignant disease. Recently, the most notable of the many advancements to minimally invasive surgery has been natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612443898">2</xref></sup> However, despite the outstanding benefit of scarlessness, NOTES has raised the question of whether the risk of visceral injury is justifiable to improve cosmesis. In addition, NOTES lacks reproducibility because the procedure needs highly elaborate equipment still being developed.</p>
<p>For this reason, single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is drawing attention as an alternative, which has an almost equal cosmetic benefit to NOTES without puncturing a healthy organ. SILS is a relatively new procedure that has been performed in many different areas of surgery, including appendectomy, cholecystectomy, gastrectomy, colectomy, and nephrectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612443898">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612443898"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612443898"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612443898"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612443898"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612443898"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612443898">9</xref></sup> In common procedures such as appendectomy and cholecystectomy, it has been proved that SILS is a feasible approach comparable to conventional laparoscopic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612443898">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612443898">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Splenectomy has changed within this trend of modern surgery. Conventional multiport laparoscopic splenectomy (MLS) is superior to open splenectomy with respect to complication rate, postoperative pain, and recovery; thus, it is already regarded as a standard procedure for normal or slightly enlarged spleens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350612443898">12</xref></sup> Meanwhile, various types of splenectomy using SILS (single-incision laparoscopic splenectomy [SLS]) have been reported recently. However, the feasibility and safety of SLS have not yet been elucidated because most of these studies are case reports for the purpose of introducing new practice, even though we acknowledge the potential advantages of cosmesis and quality of life.</p>
<p>The aims of the current study are to report our experience with SLS and to compare postoperative outcomes between MLS and SLS.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1553350612443898">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>All procedures for patients enrolled in the current study were performed by a single surgeon (JSH) in the Department of Surgery, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine. Laparoscopic splenectomy was not decided by strict indication but performed in patients whose spleen long axis was ≤15cm on preoperative imaging. Patients who underwent combined procedures for extraspleen conditions with MLS or SLS were excluded from the current study. A total of 34 patients were included in the current study. The MLS group was composed of 18 patients who underwent conventional MLS from June 20, 2006, to July 9, 2009. Since July 28, 2009, SLS was mainly performed instead of MLS except in 4 patients who did not want SLS, and they were excluded from the study. Those who formed the SLS group were 16 patients who underwent SLS from July 28, 2009, to November 2, 2010.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1553350612443898">
<title>Operative Techniques</title>
<p>SLS was performed basically in the same way as MLS except for incisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612443898">Figure 1</xref>). The patient was positioned in the right lateral decubitus position with the left arm crossing the chest. The operating table was flexed at the level of the patient’s flank. A 3-cm pararectal skin incision was made. After the fascia was dissected, we used 1 of 2 access methods: (1) a commercially available multiport device, OCTO port (Dalim SurgNET Corp, Seoul, Korea), with two 12-mm ports and one 5-mm port (in 11 patients) or (2) a handmade port devised from a wound retractor and surgical glove (in 5 patients). In the latter access, the inner rim of an Alexis wound retractor (Applied Medical, Rancho, Santa Margarita, CA) was inserted through the incision. A surgical glove was applied onto the outer rim of the retractor, and the two were rolled down together to be tight to the skin. Three holes were made by cutting the first, third, and fifth finger tips of the glove and one 5-mm and two 12-mm trocars were introduced through the finger-tip holes, respectively. All finger tips having a trocar were tied to avoid air leak.</p>

</fig>
<p>Adequate pneumoperitoneum was created by CO<sub>2</sub> gas insufflation. We used the following instruments for our single-incision procedures in addition to commonly used devices in conventional laparoscopic surgery: (1) Autonomy Laparo-Angle Dissector (Cambridge Endo, Framingham, MA) and (2) ENDO GIA ROTICULATOR (endoGIA) 45- to 60-mm length, 2.5-mm staples (Covidien, Mansfield, MA).</p>
<p>The splenocolic ligament was dissected first, and then dissection proceeded medially around the tip of the spleen, where the gastrosplenic ligament containing the short gastric vessels was identified. The short gastric vessels were sequentially divided using an ultrasonic scalpel. After dissection of the gastrosplenic ligament, the splenorenal ligament was dissected. The splenic pedicle was divided using a conventional rigid endoscopic vascular stapler; however, when the angle was not accessible, we used the endoGIA. In some patients whose splenic pedicle was too heavy to be divided at once, it was divided in 2 steps. After the spleen was completely free, a reinforced oversized plastic bag was placed through a 12-mm trocar. The spleen was morcellized in this bag using ring forceps and extracted out of the abdomen. The fascia and skin were closed in the usual manner.</p>

<sec id="section5-1553350612443898">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The following data were investigated retrospectively from the chart and records of patients: sex; age; past medical history; BMI; diagnosis; American Society of Anesthesiologists score; preoperative spleen size on imaging study; number of accessory spleens; whether the operation was converted to MLS or open splenectomy; operative time; estimated blood loss during the operation; amount of perioperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion; weight of the spleen; postoperative hospital stay; duration between operation and gas passing/starting diet; Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS), which was administered on the second postoperative day by asking the patient to verbally estimate pain on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst imaginable pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612443898">13</xref></sup>; amount of postoperative meperidine (Demerol) use; and postoperative complications. We used the length of the splenic long axis as an estimate for the preoperative spleen size. Computerized tomography was used for preoperative imaging. The anesthesiologist estimated intraoperative blood loss using the following formula: Intraoperative blood loss = Postoperative (diluted blood in suction bottle + wet gauze) − Preoperative (washing solution used during operation + dry gauze)</p>

<sec id="section6-1553350612443898">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The above variables were compared between SLS and MLS. All continuous data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. For comparison between the groups, Fisher’s exact test was used for nominal and categorical variables, and the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used for continuous variables. A <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 18.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The mean age of the 34 enrolled patients was 48.6 years; 12 (35.3%) of the patients were male and 22 (64.7%) were female. The mean BMI of the patients was 23.92 ± 3.53 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Of the 34 patients, 20 (58.8%) had refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and 2 (5.9%) had autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The remaining patients each had the following diagnoses; angiosarcoma, simple cyst, pseudocyst, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, hemangioma, histiocytic sarcoma, inflammatory pseudotumor, metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, metastatic clear-cell ovarian carcinoma, sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation, lymphoid follicular hyperplasia associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, and vascular malformation.</p>
<p>Among demographic characteristics, only spleen size differed significantly between the 2 groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350612443898">Table 1</xref>). The spleen size was significantly larger in the SLS group than the MLS group (10.78 ± 1.68 vs 9.62 ± 1.11 cm, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .031). The weight of the spleen was estimated in only 17 patients and did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (132.29 ± 72.84 g in the SLS group and 80.27 ± 38.49 g in the MLS group; <italic>P</italic> = .109).</p>

<p>Postoperative complications developed in 3 of the enrolled patients. Among them, 2 patients belonged to the MLS group. The progress of the 3 patients was as follows: the first one was a 25-year-old man who underwent MLS for refractory ITP. On the first postoperative day, he became hemodynamically unstable and underwent laparotomy and bleeder ligation as a result of hemorrhage from the splenic artery stump; 8 units of packed RBCs were transfused perioperatively, but the patient was uneventfully discharged on the fifth postoperative day. The second one was a 62-year-old female patient who underwent MLS for a vascular malformation of the spleen and developed a complicated fluid collection in the splenic fossa. Percutaneous drainage was performed, and the patient was discharged uneventfully on the 14th postoperative day. The last one was a 55-year-old male patient who underwent SLS for sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation. On the first postoperative day, laparotomy was performed consequent to shock. Intra-abdominal bleeding from small vessels was noted in the splenic fossa. The bleeders were ligated, and 6 units of packed RBCs were transfused. The patient was discharged without any other event on the seventh postoperative day. Among all the enrolled patients, packed RBCs were transfused only to the 2 patients mentioned above. There was no conversion to MLS or open splenectomy in both the SLS and MLS groups.</p>
<p>Operative time reached a plateau of approximately 80 and 85 minutes after the first 7 cases in the MLS and SLS groups, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612443898">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SILS has been referred to by various names: laparoendoscopic single-site surgery, single-port laparoscopy, single-port laparoscopic surgery, and single-port access. Nevertheless, the common basic concept is operation using a single incision. To the best of our knowledge, only 35 SLS cases from 10 different studies have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612443898">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612443898">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612443898"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612443898"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612443898"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612443898"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350612443898"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350612443898"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350612443898"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350612443898">22</xref></sup> All the studies supported the feasibility of SLS. However, they were case reports or small case series; therefore, the current study was designed to compare intraoperative parameters and short-term outcomes after MLS and SLS for patients with a spleen size ≤15 cm.</p>
<p>The current study showed that SLS is comparable to MLS with respect to several intraoperative parameters and postoperative outcomes such as operation time, gas passing/diet-starting period, postoperative meperidine use, and postoperative hospital stay. NRS was even lower in the SLS group than in the MLS group. It is interesting to note that there was no significant difference in postoperative meperidine use between the groups. We do not have a standardized policy for the use of analgesics in splenectomy patients, which could account for this result. Intraoperative estimated blood loss was greater in SLS than MLS in this study. There were 2 technically difficult operations in the SLS group in which blood loss exceeded 400 mL. The difficulties in the operations mainly stemmed from bleeding tendencies and the size of the spleens. The spleen sizes in these cases were 15 and 12 cm. They were both ITP patients with platelet counts of 20 000 and 10 000/µL. Although a more thorough analysis is needed, spleen size may be the main factor contributing to intraoperative blood loss. Poor visualization, bulky connective tissue, and extensive vessels were encountered more frequently with larger spleens than smaller ones. Notably, blood loss had a significant positive correlation with spleen size (Spearman ρ = 0.351; <italic>P</italic> = .042) in the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350612443898">Figure 3</xref>). However, this statistical significance did not adversely affect other clinical outcomes. Unfortunately, we could not compare incision length between the groups because of a lack of records. However, the length of largest skin incisions might not differ between groups because skin incisions were just enough to allow extraction of the specimens in all procedures. Therefore, we had to elongate the scope-trocar incision for specimen extraction in the MLS group.</p>

<p>SILS is reportedly difficult to master.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350612443898">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1553350612443898">23</xref></sup> However, we easily became accustomed to SLS because we already had experience with MLS. After the first 7 SLS cases, the operation time of SLS reached a time similar to that of MLS.</p>
<p>Transumbilical skin incisions have an excellent cosmetic benefit but simultaneously have several shortcomings: too long a distance between the incision and the spleen, an inappropriate angle between the devices and dissection planes, and invisibility of the structures posterior to the spleen such as the splenorenal and phrenosplenic ligaments. Although they may potentially compromise the cosmetic outcome and increase the invasiveness of the operation, certain adjunctive measures such as ancillary 2-mm needlescopic instrument use, using traction suture/tape-manipulated outside abdomen, and extraumbilical access may help facilitate the operative procedures. Some previous reports used one of the methods mentioned above for more convenient operation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350612443898">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350612443898"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350612443898">22</xref></sup> We used a pararectal incision to avoid the technical difficulties associated with the transumbilical incision. The pararectal skin incision enables the surgeon to access any structure around the spleen. In addition, after exposure of the splenic hilum, we can lift the spleen and divide the hilar structures using endoGIA without external traction suture or tape.</p>
<p>Although we used a commercially available multiport device, the OCTO port, in 11 early patients, we preferred the handmade port frequently used by Korean surgeons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1553350612443898">24</xref></sup> This method has several advantages: (1) It is more economical than other multiport-access devices, (2) the motion of working devices and scope was less limited in the wound retractor than in multiport-access devices, and (3) it permits at least 3 trocars. We used a 5-mm and two 12-mm trocars simultaneously. Therefore, we could use a 10-mm scope and endoGIA simultaneously, and we did not need to change the 10-mm scope to a 5-mm scope onerously for using thick devices. However, there was no significant difference between the 2 port groups with respect to demographic characteristics, intraoperative parameters, or postoperative outcomes in this study.</p>
<p>The current study has limitations mostly stemming from its retrospective design and a small sample size with inherent biases. Further extensive studies are expected to determine the indications, optimal surgical techniques, and benefits of SPS.</p>
<p>Taken together, SLS is a procedure comparable to MLS in terms of safety and reproducibility. SLS can be a feasible procedure for patients with spleen sizes ≤15 cm and has clinical outcomes equivalent to MLS.</p>
