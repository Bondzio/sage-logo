<abstract>
<p>Strengthening primary care may improve health outcomes and restrain spending. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model is endorsed as a tool to achieve this. Early evaluations in large group practices demonstrate improvements in some health outcomes. Evidence is lacking from small medical practices that deliver the majority of primary health care. This was a national survey of 200 physicians that explored perceptions of PCMH. There was considerable interest in adoption of the model; however, providing PCMH care was seen as an extension of traditional roles that requires additional reimbursement. No differentiation was made among a variety of payment models to do this. All joint principle components of the model were identified as important: extending access and information technology were the most contentious. There was consensus that PCMH might improve the quality of primary care; however, tension between wider societal benefits and rising costs for individual practices was a challenge to implementation.</p>

<body>
<p>There is evidence that strengthening primary care in the United States will improve health outcomes and may restrain the growth of health care spending, with the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model having been proposed as a means to achieve those ends. The patient-centered primary care collaborative (a collaboration of the specialty medical specialties) identified 7 key elements of this model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612454451">1</xref></sup>: a personal physician for each patient; a physician-directed medical practice, with the use of a team of practitioners; whole person orientation; care coordination or integration across all elements of the health care system (eg, through the use of patient registries); emphasis on quality and safety (eg, the practice of evidence-based medicine); enhanced access to care; and payment systems that recognize and appropriately reimburse the added value of “medical homeness.” The model has been endorsed by a range of stakeholders and received considerable attention in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612454451">2</xref></sup> There are a number of demonstration projects under way at this time, and a number of studies have been able to demonstrate an association between PCMH elements and better quality care for a limited number of medical conditions in particular settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612454451">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612454451"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612454451">5</xref></sup> What is not known is whether the PCMH model has wider applicability, particularly in small medical practices (SMPs) that provide the majority of primary care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612454451">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study, undertaken in 2010, was to explore the potential for SMP implementation of the PCMH model. Specific objectives were to explore physicians’ perceptions of the PCMH model. Physicians are central figures in the delivery of primary care; hence, their understanding and views about the model are crucial to its implementation.</p>
<sec id="section1-1062860612454451">
<title>The Medical Home Index (MHI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612454451">7</xref></sup>)</title>
<p>The MHI measures the degree of medical home infrastructure in place in a primary care medical practice. It captures the use of 4 of the 7 PCMH components (access to care, care coordination, quality, and improved care processes) and selected demographic information (eg, payer mix, number of non–English-speaking adult patients with 4 conditions [congestive cardiac failure, asthma, depression, and diabetes]). The components of interest were divided into 17 domains, and points were awarded for each on a weighted scale. A summary medical home score was then calculated for each practice.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1062860612454451">
<title>Study Population and Sample</title>
<p>The study sample was drawn from 1765 medical groups across the United States that were surveyed as part of the National Study of Small and Medium-Sized Physician Practices (NSSMPP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612454451">8</xref></sup> The NSSMPP study, undertaken in 2007-2009, was a cross-sectional telephone survey of practices with 1 to 19 physicians that examined the correlation between practice group characteristics, including practice size, ownership, and practice organizational culture, along with the implementation of care management processes. SMPs were then categorized as high or low performing based on the degree of care management process use as expressed on the MHI.</p>
<p>For the present study, a sample of the 100 highest and 100 lowest performers were randomly selected by the research team to survey. The lead researcher (LB) was blinded to group performance on these indices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1062860612454451">
<title>Survey Instrument</title>
<p>Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected via a survey tool that incorporated 3 components:</p>
<list id="list1-1062860612454451" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Three questions were designed to collect data from each practice on 4 key SMP group characteristics: group size (as measured by the number of physicians practicing full and part time), ownership (physician vs nonphysician: eg, health maintenance organization [HMO], hospital), the use of a team of practitioners to provide care, and the length of time that a physician had worked in that practice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There were 16 questions that assessed physician perceptions of PCMH. These questions were generated from a review of the literature and through discussions with policy makers, investigators, patient advocacy groups, and practitioners. They incorporated 4 dimensions: awareness of the PCMH model (defined as physician ability to recognize the model), views on payment systems, perspectives on infrastructure components, and beliefs about the potential impact of PCMH on health care cost and quality.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A validated culture rating instrument (available from the authors on request), consisting of 45 items examining 9 dimensions of organizational culture; the results will be reported in a separate article.</p></list-item></list>
<p>There was an opportunity for respondents to enter free-text answers throughout the survey. The complete tool was then piloted with a group of primary care physicians attending a physician leadership conference, and modifications were made to ensure accuracy, comprehension, and ease of use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1062860612454451">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The 200 selected SMPs were telephoned and their contact details validated. In the first instance, attempts were made to reach the lead physician who had originally participated in the NSSMPP. When this was not possible, the office manager or another physician was substituted. Once consent had been obtained, a respondent pack was sent to the lead of each practice. This included a letter of introduction with a unique identifying code, the questionnaire in paper format, and a Web link for online access. Respondents received $50 (US) for their participation on return of the completed questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1062860612454451">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The association between practice size (number of full-time and part-time physicians employed), physician group ownership (HMO, physician, management group, hospital, academic medical center, and nonprofit), and the length of time that the physician had been employed in that practice and the MHI were explored using univariate and multivariate regression analyses in the STATA program (StataCorp, College Station, TX). A <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p>
<p>For the qualitative data, the following 4-stage framework analysis of the participants’ free-text answers was used: detailed familiarization with the text by the researcher and 1 independent researcher, identification of key themes to form a coding frame, indexing material according to the coding frame, and mapping the data.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section8-1062860612454451">
<title>Practice Group Characteristics</title>
<p>A total of 112 physicians from separate SMPs responded out of 200 contacted; 104 of these completed the questionnaire, giving an adjusted response rate of 52%. Of these, 25 respondents replied online, 7 by fax, and the remainder by postal mail.</p>
<p>In this sample, just a little less than a third of respondents were physicians from solo practices, and 42% of all SMPs were physician owned. Two thirds of practices used multidisciplinary teams to provide care (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1062860612454451">Table 1</xref> for practice group characteristics).</p>

<p>Physician awareness of the model was based on the respondents’ ability to recognize the model and identify its core components.

<p>The majority (75%) of respondents were aware of the PCMH model of care, with a little more than 40% reporting that their practices provided care that would meet the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) definition of a medical home,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612454451">9</xref></sup> irrespective of their accreditation status (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1062860612454451">Table 2</xref>).

<p>When asked about what they understood by the concept of the PCMH, comments fell into 4 categories related to (1) the personalization agenda, (2) reimbursement reform, (3) use of information technology (IT), and (4) initiatives to reduce health care spending.</p>
<p>Quotes that typify these include
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>[It’s about] . . . comprehensive care of each patient, [being] responsible for coordinating care among specialists, managing and responding to what other MDs have prescribed and ordered . . . [we are] still working on EHR/data collection to officially qualify.</italic> (Doctor P)</p>
<p><italic>Let’s be honest, this is just disguised capitation.</italic> (Doctor R)</p>
<p><italic>It’s simply more paperwork and grief from those who have never worked in a busy doctor’s office.</italic> (Doctor D)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Among respondents who were not familiar with PCMH, the most common misconception was that the model referred to the provision of medical care in a patient’s home. Respondents identified 2 criteria necessary and sufficient for practices to claim Medical Home status: that patients were registered to the individual physician they saw most often during visits and that the physicians took responsibility for coordinating patient care across specialties and disciplines.</p>

<sec id="section11-1062860612454451">
<title>Views on payment systems</title>
<p>In reference to the method(s) of reimbursement that would best facilitate PCMH model implementation, all respondents agreed that the PCMH model of care as defined by the NCQA would be an extension of their current role and would require additional financial compensation if it were to be implemented (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1062860612454451">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>In reflecting on the specific payment models, participants did not indicate any overall preference, with a little more than half identifying enhanced fee-for-service payment, new procedural codes, and comprehensive payments for medical home activities as the most popular. There was similar support for hybrid models of these components integrated into current payment systems.</p>
<p>An overwhelming concern was the amount of administrative time necessary at present to claim reimbursement from payers. Responses indicated that for new payment models to be widely adopted they must at best reduce and at worst not contribute to this administrative burden. Comments that reflected this included the following:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>I know about these five payment models, but in truth we could do it any number of ways.</italic> (Doctor R)</p>
<p><italic>I don’t think it really matters how we are paid; we have just got to be paid and it has got to be easy.</italic> (Doctor F)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The timing of reimbursement was frequently referred to as being central to the success of implementation; payment at the start of the transition to medical home was often suggested to provide SMPs with the capital required for the transition. The following quote epitomizes this:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Show me the money [upfront], that’s right . . . well, this [PCMH model] sounds great, and it sounds great for patients, but why should I do it if it’s money out of my pocket?</italic> (Doctor D)</p>

<title>Perspectives on infrastructure components</title>

Analysis of free text demonstrated that physicians valued 2 things as key in Medical Home care: the provision of care throughout the life course of the patient and every patient having a primary physician who was their first point of contact.</p>

This meant that for many, at present, there was no sound business case to encourage adoption. As one doctor noted,

<p>This perceived dichotomy between potential rising care costs in the individual doctor’s practice and overall reduced spend within the health care system was frequently attributed to the failure of communication between secondary and primary care and the inability of any efficiency gains that resulted to be shared. As one clinician explained,
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>I don’t have any ability to impact the cost of care or readmission rates, which are horrible, because I don’t get any real-time information or coordination with the hospitals. It doesn’t do me any good to get a discharge summary four weeks later.</italic> (Doctor G)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The mechanisms by which improved communication between primary and secondary care might occur remained elusive in the opinion of many participants. As one doctor commented,
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>We just need to have some understanding of how the medical home doctors are supposed to interact with the non-medical home doctors . . . even that alone would be nice.</italic> (Doctor L)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addressing this, a suggestion that emerged recurrently was the need for the roles played by ambulatory and secondary care to be more clearly delineated:

<title>Quality of care in SMPs following PCMH introduction</title>
<p>There was no clear agreement as to how the implementation of the PCMH model might affect the quality of primary care that could be provided by each SMP. Although a little less than half of the respondents indicated that reforms would bring about an improvement in care quality, 1 in 10 felt that there would be a negative impact on patient care (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1062860612454451">Table 5</xref>). A recurring concern of clinicians was the paucity of current evaluations, one respondent explaining,

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study offers some preliminary insight into the knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes of primary care physicians with regard to the PCMH model. Although the small size of the study sample and its exploratory nature demands that they must be interpreted with caution, important insights were gained nonetheless.</p>
<p>Contrary to anecdotal evidence, there was widespread awareness of the PCMH model at the SMP level and confidence in its ability to positively affect primary care outcomes if implemented appropriately. Successful implementation will hinge on external support, particularly for reimbursement reform, service redesign, and IT development. This support must be designed to target the specific needs of the small and medium-sized medical practice. We found that SMP physicians favored the formation of primary care networks or clusters—loosely organized integrated practices sharing resources—both as an alternative and an adjunct to external support.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that SMP physicians view the provision of a personal physician and the ability to provide coordinated, continuous care as the 2 central elements of the model and the services that they are currently most able to provide. Although there was widespread agreement that implementation of all components would improve the quality of patient care, there was tension acknowledged between the savings that would accrue at a national level and the requirement for individual practices to bear much of the cost. Consistent with work by Berenson and Rich,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612454451">10</xref></sup> this study found that the development of more robust, accountable, and transparent pathways for the integration of primary and secondary care, facilitating SMPs sharing in savings achieved by greater coordination, was necessary if the PCMH model is to be embedded.</p>
<p>A theme that emerged recurrently was the belief that primary care was grossly devalued when compared with other medical and surgical specialties. This was attributed to years of systemic neglect, resulting in a lack of sustainability in care financing and delivery with consequent adverse patient outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section17-1062860612454451">
<title>Policy Implications</title>
<p>The PCMH model has been widely endorsed as a tool by which to transform the delivery of primary care in the United States. A number of studies, primarily involving large group practices, have demonstrated improvements in certain proxy indicators of care quality for specific conditions alongside practice-level cost savings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612454451">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612454451"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612454451">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Results of PCMH implementation projects in SMPs, which provide the vast majority of primary care, are now emerging. It is clear that these smaller, dispersed, and often resource-restrained practices face a considerable struggle to adopt even basic components in the absence of external resources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612454451">1</xref></sup> Work by Rittenhouse et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612454451">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612454451">8</xref></sup> for example, has demonstrated that solo and 2-physician practices perform significantly worse than larger practices (up to 19 physicians) in the extent to which they are able to implement medical home processes, particularly those requiring extended use of IT. This is primarily because of resource constraints. The fact that practices that are owned by nonphysicians (eg, hospitals and HMOs) implement more PCMH processes as a result of the additional resources that this model of service design affords is evidence reinforcing this.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612454451">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>We explored primary care physicians’ perceptions of PCMH focusing on barriers to implementation, infrastructure components, and the impact of reimbursement on care cost and quality. With insufficient resources (eg, time, information, and external support) to embed the model in these practices, a number of measures may be required to overcome this. The current study adds the views of practitioners themselves on these widely endorsed strategies.</p>
<p>The measure that received the most support in our sample is the fostering of the integration of smaller practices into real or virtual networks sharing resources and providing care. Our study found evidence that a number of practices were already doing this, usually in the guise of Independent Practice Associations. Primary care practices must be incentivized to cooperate in this manner, however, and one approach may be to require secondary and tertiary care facilities to communicate more effectively with small practices and to share the gains accrued by this improved integration.</p>
<p>A second strategy would be payment reform at the primary care level. Although the association between the availability of external incentives (eg, pay for performance) and adoption of Medical Home processes is recognized, little is known at present about the level and type of financial incentive that is required for PCMH care implementation in SMPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612454451">10,11,12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612454451"/></sup> Our study is unique, in that it demonstrates that there is less practice-level focus on the type of reimbursement offered and more on the amount, timing, and ease of collection. Evidence from this study suggests that it is vital that policy makers factor in the need for start-up and early transition capital if SMPs are to begin the transition to PCMH care. Equally, ensuring that practices can access payment in a timely manner with as little administrative burden as possible is necessary to ensure that physicians are willing and able to provide the extended services demanded by the model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1062860612454451">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study had several limitations. First, the response rate was 52%, and a higher response would have been preferable. One contributor to this may be questionnaire design; it is noteworthy, for example, that nearly half of the sample did not provide data on practice ownership, and 8% of those that began the questionnaire failed to complete it. However, this response rate is consistent with those obtained from similar samples in several recent physician practice surveys. Second, although the study design allows the exploration of the association between practice characteristics and its degree of “medical homeness,” causality cannot be inferred. Third, only 1 respondent (lead physician/NSSMPP participant) from each practice was selected. Because this was a knowledge and attitudinal questionnaire, different responses may have been received if another physician or a greater number of physicians from each practice were selected. Fourth, the questionnaire was self-administered, increasing potential misclassification errors.</p>
<p>It is encouraging that evidence at this stage suggests that SMPs are keen to adopt medical home components, and our study showed that up to 60% of the sample had begun the process. It appears that the commitment and leadership of individual practice physicians has been instrumental in this, particularly because there is still uncertainty at the practice level regarding the extent of cost savings and the impact on quality and patient/ rovider experience offered by the model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612454451">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612454451">8</xref></sup> One response to this would be the dissemination of results from further medical home demonstration projects. Another would be the development of robust, uniform, and nationally accepted measures to evaluate, accredit, and reimburse for “medical homeness” because our study suggests that confusion remains as a result of the proliferation of PCMH models accepted and the variety of paths to achieve this status.</p>
<p>This study demonstrates that resource sharing within SMPs is achievable through a variety of models. What remains less clear is how the required cultural transformation from one of isolationism to one of cooperation across the traditional silos of individual practices can be achieved. This will be an important area for further research both for implementation of the PCMH and for realization of its potential gains.</p>
