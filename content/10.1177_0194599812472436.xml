<p>Empty nose syndrome (ENS) is a rare iatrogenic disorder occurring after complete inferior turbinate (IT) resection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812472436">1</xref></sup> Some patients require a surgical repair whose principle is to diminish the empty space within the nasal cavity by creating a turbinate-like mass with submucosal implantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812472436">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our objective was to assess the efficacy and morbidity of a β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) implant to repair the head of the inferior turbinate in ENS.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599812472436" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary referral center and was approved by the institutional review board at the University Hospital of Bordeaux (France).</p>
<p>Only patients having undergone total bilateral inferior turbinectomy since more than 12 months and with paradoxical nasal obstruction despite several medical treatments were included. Other turbinectomy, sinus disease, trauma, steroid treatment, and previous head and neck cancer or radiotherapy were exclusion criteria.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis was that a β-TCP implant to repair the head of the inferior turbinate is safe and efficient to restore nasal comfort. The SINUS-UP implant (Kasios, Launaguet, France) is composed of pure nonporous β-TCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812472436"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>).</p>

<label>Figure 1.</label>
<caption><p>(A) The ceramic plate was divided into 4 pieces (*). (B) Each piece was 15 mm long (depending on nasal wall defect), 5 mm wide, and 2 mm thick.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Under general anesthesia, an oral vestibule mucosa incision was made on both sides just above the incisors and canines to the subperiosteal level to raise the facial soft tissues and to reach the piriform aperture. Next, a submucoperiosteal pocket was made along the lateral nasal wall, at the site of the former inferior turbinate head between the nasal floor and the ostium of the nasolacrimal duct. This pocket was filled with 2 layers of ceramic per side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812472436"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). The oral mucosal incision was closed with 2-0 absorbable suture. No nasal packing or irrigation was used during the postoperative period.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0194599812472436-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Nasal symptoms and quality of life (QoL) were assessed by the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) and Rhinosinusitis Quality of Life (RhinoQoL) questionnaires.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812472436">2</xref></sup> Next, clinical examination and nasal fibroscopy were performed to check macroscopic mucosal trophicity (edema, erythema, ulceration, or implant exposition), secretions, crusts, and position of the implant before and at the last follow-up after surgery. A cotton test was not performed. In our opinion, a foreign body in contact with the nasal mucosa could stimulate the trigeminal sensitivity and disturb the patient’s assessment of his or her own nasal comfort. Moreover, the features and position of the cotton have not been clearly standardized and validated.</p>
<p>A sinonasal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed before and 1 month after surgery to eliminate sinus disease, to measure the remaining lateral nasal wall, to check implant position, and to measure the distance between the top of the implants and the nasolacrimal duct aperture (DNLI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812472436"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812472436"><bold>D</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Data were expressed as median (interquartile range). Statistical analysis was performed by the nonparametric <italic>U</italic> test with the Statel Med 1.5 software (Ad Science, Paris, France). Statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Five patients were included between March 2010 and December 2011. There were 2 women and 3 men with a median age of 53.5 years (49.2-54.7). Only 2 patients had previously undergone septoplasty. The 3 others did not present a septal deviation. No tobacco consumption was reported. Only 3 patients had nasal crusts associated with inflammatory mucosa and purulent secretions. No polyps and sinus pathology were observed on fibroscopy and sinonasal CT scan. One patient had undergone a unilateral medial maxillectomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812472436"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>The median delay between turbinectomy and implantation was 10.7 years (1.3-29.7). The median follow-up was 13.5 months (8.2-21). No nasolacrimal duct complication was observed. One layer of implant was spontaneously extruded without any symptom 6 days after surgery through a per-operative unilateral mucosal perforation. At the last follow-up, no mucosal abnormality was observed on either side. There was no longer any crust in patients who had complained about it before surgery.</p>
<p>The NOSE and RhinoQoL scores before and after surgery are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812472436"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599812472436"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref> shows the boxplot comparison for the major QoL scores. On the postoperative CT scan, all implants were in the correct position, and the median DNLI was 4.2 mm (1.8-6.6).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite its small sample and short follow-up, this study seems to show the good efficacy and safety of this type of repair. The population, the implants, and the surgical procedure were homogeneous, thus avoiding a common bias encountered in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812472436">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812472436">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Not all implant materials can be used to repair empty nose syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812472436">3</xref></sup> Inert materials are not safe enough.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812472436">3</xref></sup> Unlike biomaterials, ceramics have been validated in preclinical studies for use in the nasal fossa and have shown good biocompatibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812472436">4</xref></sup> Mechanical extrusion occurring a few days after surgery, as in one of our patients, should be differentiated from immune extrusion.</p>
<p>The specific resorption/substitution balance of implanted biomaterials must be adapted to the target organ and depends on their composition and structure. Acellular dermis shows some degree of shrinkage and resorption that sometimes requires further augmentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812472436">3</xref></sup> Although we cannot formally conclude that β-TCP could become a choice material in this setting, it is compact and nonporous, 2 important features that help to decrease the resorption rate.</p>
<p>Recent data on shear stress and nasal pressure gradient during inspiration reinforce our clinic hypothesis that the head of the IT is a key to understanding ENS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812472436">5</xref></sup> Positioning the implant at this site seems to be more physiologic than on the floor or in the nasal septum. Moreover, the quantity of material is known, and postoperative QoL scores in this small series were near those of the normal population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812472436">2</xref></sup></p>
