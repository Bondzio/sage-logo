<abstract>
<p>Using synergies between research, teaching, and social initiatives, the author designed and offered a number of courses in the arena of sustainability: a first-year MBA course on sustainability for all contexts, a module required for all first semester business undergraduates on sustainable businesses for subsistence marketplaces as part of a broader course on professional responsibility, and a year-long interdisciplinary graduate course on sustainable product and market development for subsistence marketplaces. The author describes the approach in terms of its philosophical orientation of envisioning a better world <italic>as well as</italic> associated challenges, its substantive focus on subsistence marketplaces, and its methodological orientation of employing bottom-up teaching approaches. A concluding discussion places the author’s educational endeavors in perspective in light of the literature and existing learning frameworks as well as the principles of responsible management education.</p>

<p>In this article, we discuss a number of sustainability-related teaching experiences created at our university as “data” while critically evaluating them. The essence of all these education endeavors is for students to integrate seemingly disparate notions about business and social and ecological good. Such an experiential account supplements the literature on sustainability in management education. This literature has ranged from trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1052562911432256">Christensen, Peirce, Hartman, Hoffman, &amp; Carrier, 2007</xref>), institutional structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562911432256">Clark, Starik, &amp; Heuer, 2008</xref>), institutional resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1052562911432256">Springett &amp; Kearins, 2001</xref>), curricular content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1052562911432256">Rands, 2009</xref>), and the philosophical underpinnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562911432256">Giacalone &amp; Thompson, 2006</xref>) to specific case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1052562911432256">Pesonen, 2003</xref>). Our educational efforts are grounded in more than a decade of research on low-literate, low-income consumers and subsistence marketplaces as well as social initiatives. In contrast to macro-level economic approaches to poverty or mid-level business strategy approaches that emphasize organizations working in these contexts (e.g., the bottom of the pyramid approach; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1052562911432256">Prahalad, 2005</xref>), our research has taken a bottom-up subsistence marketplaces approach beginning with life circumstances and micro-level behaviors of consumers and entrepreneurs. We construe the term <italic>sustainability</italic> broadly to capture economic, environmental, and social aspects consistent with frameworks such as the triple bottom line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562911432256">Elkington, 1998</xref>), and with the definition of sustainable development as meeting “the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1052562911432256">World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>We begin by framing our approach philosophically, substantively, and methodologically. We then describe our teaching initiatives, analyzing positive and negative aspects of our experiences. We reinterpret our approach using the literature and learning frameworks and conclude with a discussion of the how the Principles of Responsible Management Education (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unprme.org/">http://www.unprme.org/</ext-link>) are furthered through our educational endeavors. Specifically, we emphasize the essence of the first principle of developing capabilities of students in working toward “creating sustainable value for business and society and to work for an inclusive and sustainable global economy” both through a general emphasis on sustainability as well as a substantive focus on subsistence marketplaces, largely neglected in management education. We emphasize understanding of global social responsibility (the second principle) and educational experiences about leadership (the third principle). Our educational endeavors are based on extensive research about creating sustainable value, in accordance with the fourth principle. Practitioner involvement through in-depth projects reflects the fifth principle of interacting with managers. Dissemination to and learning from educators captures the sixth principle of creating dialogue.</p>

<title>Philosophical, Substantive, and Methodological Orientations</title>
<p>In this section, we provide an overview of our educational program and its key distinguishing characteristics and a framework that summarizes our approach.</p>
<sec id="section2-1052562911432256">
<title>Overview of Educational Offerings</title>
<p>This program is in place in the business school of a large Midwestern public university in the United States. Although we describe the courses in the sections below moving from simpler to more complex, we actually began with a year-long graduate-level course on sustainable product and market development for subsistence marketplaces that includes an international immersion experience. As shown in a timeline of our program-development process in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1052562911432256">Figure 1</xref>, the year-long graduate course was introduced in 2006. Subsequently, in 2007, we followed up with a 5-week module on sustainable businesses for subsistence marketplaces, as part of a larger course on professional responsibility, scaled to all (approximately 600) incoming first semester undergraduate students in 2009. This path, which began with a heavy people emphasis, has led to a first-year MBA course on sustainable marketing and business with an environmental emphasis for all economies, and an experimental junior/senior undergraduate course as well as an online course on the same topic. In sum, we offer early and later learning experiences on sustainability with a particular emphasis on subsistence marketplaces that amplify people-related issues.</p>

<sec id="section3-1052562911432256">
<title>A Framework for Educational Endeavors on Sustainability and Management</title>
<p>We present the foundational principles of our approach in the form of a framework for educational endeavors on management and sustainability covering philosophical, substantive, and methodological elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1052562911432256">Figure 2</xref>). Philosophically, our approach is very much in the mode of “envisioning a better world.” However, we jointly emphasize understanding the challenges that lie ahead, thus moving beyond “talking the talk” to “walking the walk.” Thus, our vision is not left at an abstract level of discussion. Rather, the challenges associated with implementing the vision are carefully evaluated, with an emphasis on <italic>practicing</italic> sustainability. In tune with this practical emphasis, our approach is interdisciplinary in a very broad sense—going beyond areas of business to engineering, design, and other technical areas, as well as being international in scope, and providing an integrative learning experience. Our offerings culminate in business solutions through deliverables, such as product design and business plan development, which are economically sustainable in addition to other forms of sustainability. Thus, we treat subsistence contexts and issues of sustainability as being central to the business rather than a peripheral activity. Issues of poverty are addressed centrally in management education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562911432256">Dart, 2008</xref>) and different stakeholder perspectives are incorporated in understanding challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1052562911432256">Reade, Todd, Osland, &amp; Osland, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>Philosophical, substantive, and methodological orientations</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1052562911432256-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Substantively, we began with a focus on subsistence marketplaces, using the most resource-constrained and ecologically affected circumstances as our laboratory and providing a distinct window to sustainability in management education in general. We, thus, emphasize the people dimension and highlight the interlinkage with the planet dimension of sustainability. We construe sustainability in a broad sense, with explicit consideration of synergies, and trade-offs between people and planet elements.</p>
<p>Methodologically, we adopt a bottom-up orientation in executing the courses—from learning mindsets, to research, to assignments, and the nature and design of solutions. We use the dictionary meaning of bottom-up—“an approach to a problem that begins with details and works up to the highest conceptual level” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bottom-up">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bottom-up</ext-link>). Rather than emphasize top-down delivery of knowledge and concepts, we adopt a bottom-up discovery from “data.” The topic of sustainability is most conducive to such an orientation, creating a true discovery process in the classroom. This orientation is implemented through means such as projects and assignments; learning from stakeholders often neglected in top-down approaches, such as poor consumers and entrepreneurs; through reading interviews and participating in simulations; learning from our own experiences as consumers, such as in the arena of unsustainable consumption; and examining the meaning of sustainability. Rather than accept top-down definitions, students are encouraged to understand sustainability in terms of elements they see and how these elements interact. The bottom-up research mindset emphasizes speaking to customers, including impoverished individuals, during the course about subsistence marketplaces, through qualitative interviews, observations, and virtual and actual immersion. Moreover, such research is conducted with a mutual learning mindset acknowledging the expertise of respondents in surviving in subsistence. The idea is to create solutions that resonate at this level to the extent possible and are thus socially sustainable as well. Finally, in terms of designing solutions, the focus is very much on incorporating aspects that “sustain” for the communities who would use the product. Thus, this approach comes full circle in terms of a bottom-up orientation. It also leads to an aggregation of bottom-up insights in a way that leads to unique solutions.</p>
<p>Noteworthy here is how such an approach is ideally suited to the arenas of subsistence and sustainability, given the lack of emphasis on these topics in traditional management education, and the opportunity for mutual learning with students. As noted, our approach to poverty from an economic perspective itself takes a bottom-up, micro-level approach. We begin with micro-level life circumstances of subsistence consumers and entrepreneurs rather than with enterprises that function in these contexts or with more macro-level poverty data. Finally, our approach to introducing sustainability into the curriculum is itself bottom-up in many respects, in the additional sense of beginning with grass-roots faculty initiatives rather than based on top-down directives from university or college levels.</p>

<title>Course Offerings on Sustainability: Experiences and Evaluations</title>
<p>In this section, we describe the “data,” that is, our experiences with courses, while tying them back to the philosophical, substantive, and methodological orientations described earlier. Each course is accompanied by a table that also makes these linkages. We also critically evaluate various aspects of our offerings in terms of positives, challenges, and shortcomings and discuss outcomes.</p>

<title>Sustainable Marketing/Business Enterprises</title>
<p>Our discussion begins with courses on sustainability in general, without a specific focus on subsistence marketplaces. However, our distinct chronological development beginning with subsistence marketplaces is noteworthy in these efforts as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1052562911432256">Figure 1</xref>). Our first-year MBA course is 8 weeks in duration and aims to engender an appreciation among students for the challenges that lie ahead for businesses in the arena of sustainability (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1052562911432256">Table 1</xref>). It is focused on environmental sustainability in advanced economies. Through lectures, case discussions, guest speakers, and a course-long project, we examine and critically evaluate contemporary trends in sustainable business practices and discuss topics such as sustainable consumer behavior and product design.</p>

<p>The course uses a project-based approach, focusing students on learning-by-doing, very well suited for the nascent area of sustainable business practices. We begin with an assignment where students review an article that analyzes the concept of sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1052562911432256">Marshall &amp; Toffel, 2005</xref>). Students are asked to examine and write about a company’s sustainable business practices in terms of how sustainability is defined and expressed in the firm’s mission or value statements; what the firm’s specific sustainability goals are and how they are measured; what is specifically meant by sustainability, that is, what is being sustained, what specific strategies, tactics, or practices the firm employs to achieve its sustainability goals; and what the strengths and weaknesses of the company are as it relates to sustainability. Such an assignment that is example based sets the stage for an open-ended discussion in the first session of the meaning of sustainability and why companies should address it. The definition of sustainability as well as the interrelationships between elements, such as people and planet, are discussed as open questions for which students will have to seek answers during the course and later. Also, discussed is the substantive orientation we take of using understanding from subsistence marketplaces, which broadens the approach to sustainability. A broad introduction to the course is provided that relates global perspectives on poverty with trends in population growth and environmental degradation, creating a holistic notion of sustainability.</p>
<p>The first class is also the venue for having a subset of the project sponsors speak about their projects. For example, we have had an entrepreneur who manufactures solar ovens (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sunoven.com">www.sunoven.com</ext-link>) speak to the class about his work in subsistence marketplaces and his extension into advanced economies, reinforcing our approach and potential learning from different parts of the world. Several local entrepreneurs who are potential sponsors of projects are invited to speak to the class. Groups are formed in the first class and students are given a day to choose from the available projects.</p>
<p>In preparation for the next week, a paper about 10 technologies for social change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1052562911432256">Voelcker, 2006</xref>) is used as required reading, again covering solutions for poverty contexts but applicable more generally as well. The group assignment is to conduct research on the companies involved in class projects; gather information about companies making similar products, and learn about technology, consumer behavior, and other relevant topics; and make a brief presentation about the direction of the project. An individual assignment addresses unsustainable consumer behaviors and possible consumer resistance to products. Students are asked to examine their own actions as consumers by creating a personal inventory of their behaviors over the course of 1 to 2 days in terms of unsustainable consumption practices. Using this basis, they tie the insights back to their project topic and possible consumer resistance to the products likely to be involved in the project. The emphasis is on learning based on one’s own behaviors or observations. In fact, one’s own expenditures on energy in managing a household is then used subsequently in the course to analyze business strategy issues, making a personal link to the topic (e.g., individuals finding the behavioral changes that lead to greatest savings in day-to-day household activity versus businesses finding the pathway that maximizes impact when choosing a sustainable path). Also captured in this approach is the need to change one’s own behavior from a philosophical orientation to work toward a sustainable world, which is then a basis to think about a business perspective.</p>
<p>The second session begins with a discussion of the assignment on unsustainable consumer behavior. This is followed by a discussion of sustainable consumer behavior, using examples such as the voluntary simplicity movement and their motivations and values, thus examining different types of consumers and deriving insights rather than using a top-down discussion of the principles of consumer behavior. The discussion also covers common segmentation schemes related to green products and a discussion of such topics as what will drive sustainable consumer behavior, what will consumers be willing to give up, and how attitudes may translate to behaviors. A discussion of consumer behavior including one’s own in the context of sustainability provides a foundation for what follows in the rest of the course. The substantive orientation of subsistence marketplaces can also be incorporated here through a discussion of consumption and the local environment in poverty contexts.</p>
<p>For the following week, groups are asked to narrow down their focus to one to two segments, provide the rationale for their choice in terms of consumer behavior of specific segments, and discuss any product redesign. Their in-class presentation focuses on market segments, consumers, and products. As another part of their group assignment, they are asked to present concrete examples of sustainable products and their learning about sustainable design in general from readings and web-based material (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcdonough.com/">http://www.mcdonough.com/</ext-link>). The class covers sustainable product design by using examples ranging from eco-friendly building materials to flexible solar panels and hybrid automobiles as bases to extract some general insights. The cradle-to-cradle approach to product design and the underlying assumptions are contrasted with conventional product design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562911432256">McDonough &amp; Braungart, 2002</xref>). A number of sustainable design principles are discussed, such as life cycle assessment, and design for replacement, to provide background. Finally, students are briefly introduced to green market research in the recent past and the research method of in-depth interviews to use for their project for the next week. As a group assignment, students are asked to talk to at least two to three potential users through unstructured, in-depth interviews that cover current ways in which the same need is met, elicit open-ended reaction to the product idea, situations under which the product would be bought and suggested modifications to it, and broad attitudes on sustainability. The presentation in class the following week covers learning from market research and suggested product redesign. Market research is continued in the following week as well. Given the short duration of the course, actual product design is not feasible, but some redesign of the existing product is undertaken. Students perform a life cycle analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1052562911432256">Westkemper, Alting, &amp; Arndt, 2001</xref>) for a chosen product (e.g., clothing) as an in-class assignment and then modify the life cycle to lessen environmental impact.</p>
<p>The class the following week also covers sustainable distribution and supply chains and designing and communicating a sustainable value proposition. Using examples to spur discussion ranging from Wal-Mart, cost cutting and related practices, to Starbucks, poor farmers, and CAFÉ practices, and LEED building standards, the importance of broadening sustainability to the entire value chain is emphasized. By emphasizing the role of poor producers and employees in the value chain, our substantive orientation is reinforced. The continuum of steps toward sustainability from compliance to a green supply chain is discussed. Using examples and relating back to the discussion on sustainable consumer behavior, the topics of designing and communicating a sustainable value proposition are discussed. Examples that reflect a community-based approach to communication and emphasis on green aspects of advertising messages are discussed. The trade-offs that consumers are asked to make in gauging value are discussed as well as the importance of identifying win-win scenarios for consumers. In-class assignments here include plotting the value chain for existing products (say, understanding where a subset of products owned by students came from and where they end up after usage life) as well as designing promotions for products depicted in short cases previously assigned for reading. The aim here is to have the students begin to broaden their thinking to various elements of the business plan, thus confronting challenges through the design of solutions, consistent with our philosophical orientation.</p>
<p>For the ensuing week, student groups are asked to focus on parts of the final business plan assignment and to analyze a case for discussion. Groups are assigned different roles—as a sustainability consultant at the focal company (or a competitor) attempting to convince a skeptical audience, a skeptic who works for the focal company (or a competitor), or a sustainability expert (for an environmental group or at the industry level). Using contrasting perspectives to analyze situations and cases is in keeping with the holistic nature of sustainability and the approach of envisioning a better world through such courses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562911432256">Collins &amp; Kearins, 2007</xref>, on stakeholder engagement in teaching sustainability). In the next week or sometimes in the same session, groups are combined to participate in mini-conferences to find consensus, reflecting the need for different sectors to come together on issues relating to sustainability (e.g., environmental groups may be assigned to act as mediators between the other groups, after which groups report back on their final position). In this as in other discussions, our philosophical orientation is reflected as students wrestle with the need to infuse values and envision a better world as a company while having to face the immediate and practical issues that arise. Students are also introduced to sustainable accounting and finance issues.</p>
<p>Additional assignments relating to scenarios such as where sustainable products fail and organizations need to design a response are completed by students. Students are also asked to create a promotional plan for a hypothetical situation where a green product has problems, drawing from current events where possible. The aim here is to anticipate failures and react to them in ways that address the perceptions of the larger public. Another assignment requires students to assess trends in the next one or two decades in a specific geographic region such as the Midwestern United States, including climate change and resource shortages. It requires some groups to choose a company in a sector likely to be maximally affected and design plans for the immediate and longer (say, 15-year term) term, and other groups to postpone planning and put emergency plans in place in 15 years. The strategic framework developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1052562911432256">Hart and Milstein (2003)</xref> is used for this purpose. The discussion aims to bring out the need for companies to proactively chart a sustainable path. The class also involves guest speakers who broaden the content by covering challenges in sustainability and related business practices. (A regular speaker at our class shared the Nobel Prize for peace for his work on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He brings out the effects of climate change to the Midwestern United States, which then forms the basis for an assignment about companies that are in this region, while using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1052562911432256">Hart and Milstein [2003]</xref> framework.)</p>
<p>The class presentation and discussion broaden out to comprehending challenges in a variety of realms ranging from energy to water, population explosion, and climate change, as well as the current systems of delivery of food and energy. The discussion covers the unique nature of these challenges in terms of their delayed effects in a cultural and a technological context finely tuned to seeking and delivering immediate and short-term benefits. A historical perspective from the industrial age onward is used to highlight the role of economic development within society and ecology. As mentioned, a sustainability framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1052562911432256">Hart &amp; Milstein, 2003</xref>) is used to highlight issues internal and external to a company and in the current and future timeframes. This content also comes full circle in connecting subsistence marketplaces to issues of sustainability, whether it be with population growth among the poor, differential impact of climate change on poor communities, or their roles as producers. A broader business model that incorporates issues of social good as it relates to offerings is presented, consistent with our philosophical orientation. Also discussed are mindsets that impede thinking in this arena as well as examples of change brought about by individuals and groups, again emphasizing individual-level considerations.</p>
<p>The seventh week is devoted to presentations with an audience including project sponsors. Student groups cover different elements of a sustainable business plan. The written report is due soon after. The format of the sustainable business plan evolved from our experience and incorporates sustainability throughout (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1052562911432256">appendix</xref>). The final deliverables reflect our philosophical orientation in terms of incorporating sustainability-related values into the vision and mission of the organization and working the vision through to business strategies, implementation plans, and performance metrics.</p>
<p>Additional assignments we have planned include extreme scenario analysis, such as $20 per gallon prices for gasoline, or extreme water shortages, effects on consumers, and potential business responses, or the design of larger ecosystems (e.g., energy grids). Thus, these assignments go beyond a single organization’s perspective to system-level thinking, either in response to a short case or for student projects.</p>
<p>In summary, our first course on sustainability in any context weaves in our substantive orientation on subsistence marketplaces to create a global perspective; uses a bottom-up methodological orientation to creating a learning experience, from personal experiences to analysis of examples and projects; and captures a philosophical orientation of envisioning a better world while understanding the inherent challenges. Although creating an appreciation for the complex issues involved, by itself, the course does not allow depth of coverage of specific issues, such as product design, sustainable accounting, sustainable finance, or sustainable supply chain management. Whereas awareness, appreciation, and a broader mindset about sustainability follow from such a course, this early experience needs to be supplemented with options for subsequent, more specialized learning experiences.</p>

<title>Professional Responsibility Through Sustainable Global Businesses for Subsistence Marketplaces</title>
<p>This 5-week module is an offshoot of the yearlong class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1052562911432256">Figure 1</xref>) offered to all (approximately 600) first semester business undergraduates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1052562911432256">Table 2</xref>). It combines the twin issues of sustainability and poverty alleviation to highlight professional responsibility and is organized around developing a sustainable business for a subsistence context. It is framed within a larger course on professional responsibility, aptly described as being about “me,” “us,” and “more than us,” or self, profession (or organization or any other collective unit), and global society, with the emphasis of the latter on the important role that businesses can play in addressing global problems. Students participate in a poverty simulation that involves 4 “weeks” of playing assigned roles in families living in poverty in the United States represented by 15 minute periods, during which time students have to make tradeoffs between various needs and try to make ends meet, interacting with entities such as banks, pawnbrokers, and employment offices. This simulation is followed by an assignment requiring a discussion of what happened, how they reacted, and what they learned about poverty. It should be noted that beginning with poverty in the United States is very helpful as it provides a relatively familiar comparison for then examining subsistence marketplaces, where poverty is more extreme. Students analyze interviews and videos to understand subsistence contexts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1052562911432256">Table 2</xref>). Using a number of assignments to understand subsistence and sustainability, groups generate product ideas, develop a short business plan, make presentations, and participate in a poster session.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The course is facilitated in small sections run by juniors and seniors previously trained with content in the form of videos of the instructor covering topics, structured assignments, and so on. Students work on an assignment involving analysis of interviews of subsistence consumers and entrepreneurs before the first meeting, which involves either a poverty simulation described earlier, or a regular class, for logistical reasons. Regular class sessions are structured around a video-based introduction and in-class assignments, allowing for a section leader to lead discussion on the topic. A video-based lecture on poverty and low literacy in the United States and India provides insights about low-literate, low-income consumers in the United States and subsistence consumers and entrepreneurs in India.</p>
<p>In the second part of this same class session, an immersion exercise is used with images and video. Students in assigned groups are asked to note down observations from scenes in subsistence marketplaces to identify unique characteristics of the larger context and needs of individuals and households. Subsequently, students use this exercise as a basis to generate product ideas at the end of the class. We are also designing additional exercises to emphasize product idea generation. In the ensuing week, students move from a general focus on understanding life circumstances in subsistence marketplaces to generating product ideas. Their next individual assignment is on analyzing videos to further reflect on subsistence contexts as well as to generate additional product ideas that would serve subsistence consumers, emphasizing the need for solutions and for confronting challenges as outlined in our philosophical orientation.</p>
<p>After the first 2 weeks, classes are organized to emphasize student presentations and group assignments. In the third class, a video-based lecture covers the example of one company involved in balancing people, planet, and profit by engaging in subsistence marketplaces, covering the needs served, products, competition, aspects of marketing, and performance metrics. The slide presentation is interspersed with video of some relevant material to bring the topic to life. In this class, the topic of environmental sustainability is formally covered, emphasizing the need for ecologically sustainable business solutions, and a number of specific product examples are shown. Students are, thus, challenged to consider both people (living in poverty) and planet (by considering ecologically sustainable solutions). Such sequential treatment facilitates student learning and translation into their project as well. Section leaders are encouraged to stop the presentation at points that can facilitate discussion. This part of the class is followed by group presentations with time built in for questions and feedback from section leaders and small group discussions. The assignment is structured to enable groups to cover relevant topics, such as needs served, and description of solutions. Again, the key here is to structure the class with a mix of listening and doing, with the important issues of content and administration covered by the instructor on video. The next group assignment involves a written documentation of part of the business plan over the course of the week before Thanksgiving in the United States. Immediate feedback is provided on the business plan through email to enable incorporation into revisions. The final class involves a video-based summary, linking the experience to broader themes including sustainability and professional responsibility. The need to view a business in a broader context as well in terms of global problems that can be addressed and in terms of seeing beyond compartmentalized notions of profit, ecological good, and social good is emphasized. Students make final presentations and then prepare for a poster session organized as a large public event a few days later, where they take the role of a startup company seeking investors. Video-based lectures are being moved from regular classroom scheduling to out-of-class activities while additional in-class exercises on idea generation and business plan design are planned for future iterations.</p>
<p>The essence of the learning is for students to be able to integrate seemingly disparate notions of social good and ecological good into the notion of a business, thus broadening the notion of what a business is for the realities of the 21st century under the umbrella notion of sustainability. In this regard, a typical student reaction goes something like, “Until now, I thought a business is about making money and nothing else.” Noteworthy in the completion of a 5-week module is that it includes a very condensed version of virtual immersion and the design of solutions. Again, the emphasis has been on economically sustainable solutions reflective of a business perspective rather than a nongovernmental organization. Whereas the occasional student group may want to take on projects such as building hospitals or transportation systems and argue for economic viability from grants, we encourage self-contained products and economic sustainability, with the end user paying at least some and usually the entire final price. Thus, we follow through on our philosophical orientation in moving beyond a broader vision for a business to confronting the challenges in implementing it. Students have come up with or modified a range of interesting ideas that cover the gamut from eco-friendly, noninflammable housing alternatives, to flooring material for hygiene in subsistence dwellings, and many iterations of water purification devices.</p>
<p>This module again highlights our philosophical, substantive, and methodological orientations, with a focus on the subsistence context to bring out issues of sustainability, our bottom-up orientation to students learning about the context and generating solutions, and the central role of envisioning a better world and the role of business for a sustainable global society as well as the challenges that would need to be confronted. We are able to impart a significant early experience on a large scale, although we continue to develop the overall model and administrative support each year as an ongoing process. With the right mix of structured tasks and educational materials available online, along with a motivated group of section leaders, and investment and administrative support for a larger course such as this on professional responsibility or on a related topic, we believe that the topic of sustainability can reach all business majors through such a modular approach. The first semester time slot emphasizes the importance of the topic of sustainability in the very first business course that students enroll in, reaching them at a formative period in their education, as they begin to learn about business and the career that lies beyond.</p>
<p>As noted, this course is implemented in small classes by section leaders, typically juniors or seniors who have taken the course themselves in their first semester. They are selected through an application and interview process. We conduct training sessions for section leaders in the previous semester, taking them through each aspect of the course and building a team dedicated to delivery of the learning experience. In recent iterations, this training has been converted into a formal course. During the delivery of the professional responsibility course including this specific module, weekly meetings with section leaders are scheduled. A number of issues are central here, foremost being the recognition that student section leaders cannot be full-fledged instructors. Thus, very detailed teaching material needs to be prepared, including video presentations by the instructor, teaching materials for specific classes, and in-class exercises. With experience, we have found the need to provide minute details to enable consistency among section leaders while also allowing for their creativity. Although our experience with section leaders has been very positive, the occasional problems we face include the very busy schedules of section leaders and consequent inability to spend time focusing on the week-to-week tasks. We also find the need to create a very detailed organizational/procedural roadmap that lays out pathways of communications for different contingencies, such as attendance records or missed assignments. At a broader level, we need to constantly find solutions to the fundamental issue of placing a junior or senior in the role of facilitator, who does not have the authority or experience to decide on issues that may arise in a classroom setting.</p>
<p>Through this early experience, we set the stage for junior- or senior-level courses that would provide a further integrative experience. We have offered an experimental course for juniors or seniors on sustainability modeled around the graduate-level course described earlier. The challenge now is to create additional learning experiences as well as have sustainability percolate into other course offerings.</p>

<title>Sustainable Product and Market Development for Subsistence Marketplaces</title>
<p>The year-long graduate-level course on subsistence marketplaces <italic>Sustainable Product and Market Development for Subsistence Marketplaces</italic> has been offered now for 5 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1052562911432256">Table 3</xref>). Following an application process in spring of the preceding academic year, business, engineering, and industrial design students along with a smaller number of students from other disciplines (including education, nutrition, and communications) and a small number of exceptional undergraduate business students form the class. Such an interdisciplinary approach has meant the need to initially develop a strong reputation with experimental classes to generate interest as well as overcome administrative issues, such as how the credit hours would count for students in different campus units. The diversity of the students contributes to both the overall classroom experience and the success of the projects. Students leverage their diverse educational backgrounds, skills, and past work experiences to contribute in different ways and fill different roles on the teams. They also reflect different stakeholder perspectives within organizations through their functional specialties. Additionally, differences in socioeconomic, cultural, and geographic backgrounds allow students to contribute to the course in different ways. This diversity contributes significantly in a course where the students share a role in defining their own learning outcomes and those of their classmates. Also noteworthy in tempering our conclusions is the self-selection of students. Students strive to move out of traditional courses, are open-minded with a deep desire to learn about different cultures, and are committed to using their expertise to have a positive impact on society. Thus, our conclusions about outcomes should be tempered by the self-selected sample we are dealing with.</p>

<p>Students spend the fall semester understanding subsistence marketplaces through virtual immersion in this context and through emersion of business, engineering, and design principles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1052562911432256">Table 3</xref>). The 5 weeks of virtual immersion in subsistence contexts includes a poverty simulation described earlier; analysis of interviews and videos of subsistence consumers and entrepreneurs; the development of conceptual models of the consequences of poverty and low-literacy, as well as poverty and the local environment; and the development of conceptual models of needs, products, and market interactions of subsistence individuals. This period concludes with a critique of papers that are based on the same data and presentation of a summary by the instructor. Students are asked to identify areas of agreement and disagreement with the conclusions drawn in the papers, rather than take them at face value, consistent with the theme of discovery from the data. We begin with life circumstances of those living in poverty before even focusing on needs and products. These efforts to sensitize students through learning by doing appear to be quite effective, with the poverty simulation based in a U.S. context providing a strong launching pad. In fact, one common form of feedback is an unlearning of the notion that “the poor are where they are out of choice,” among some students. Students develop insights in a bottom-up sense from interview data and videos rather than have the instructor’s interpretation be at the center. Our observations suggest that virtual immersion is eye-opening for students and makes them aware of their own assumptions and certainties that were previously taken for granted. But such understanding is, of course, nowhere close to capturing the stark reality and lived experience of subsistence consumers and entrepreneurs. We should, however, be wary of concluding that we have somehow become experts in the domain, an issue that has not arisen in our experience because of the constant reinforcement of the need to learn from subsistence marketplaces, as well as the open-mindedness that students bring to the classroom.</p>
<p>The next 6 weeks are spent in emersion of business, engineering, and design principles applicable to subsistence marketplaces using a rich set of cases and guest speakers including technologists and social and commercial entrepreneurs, some or all of whom are project sponsors, and explicit consideration and reflection on the need for new or modified concepts for these settings. In our experience, these weeks have been useful in bringing out business implications based on understanding, derived from virtual immersion and analyzing enterprises engaged in this domain. Thus, from a business perspective, some degree of comparison with relatively affluent markets occurs. However, time constraints do not permit such comparison and contrast in engineering or design, nor do we tease out explicit comparisons about a range of business concepts. Rather, the discussions are at the level of being contextualized to settings of case studies. In-depth learning and emersion, we believe, have to occur more organically over the course of the entire experience and are bottom up, consistent with our orientation. Case analyses emphasize the role of “values” of organizations studied as well as challenges in adhering to values and practical issues, in keeping with the philosophical orientation mentioned earlier. Organizations are analyzed in terms of visions, missions, and practices and synergies and tradeoffs between economic, social, and environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>In parallel with emersion, students are assigned to groups that balance technical and business skills and match interests with project sponsors (typically, small or large businesses or social enterprises). Organizational sponsors provide student teams with real-life problems that might specifically relate to an existing product, segment, or market or may be broad in nature and technological, consumer, or societal-need focused. Sponsors provide access to individuals currently working with these and related issues, past market and field experiences, and market and product development expertise. During later weeks, student groups generate and evaluate a long list of possible issues, and ideas that form the basis for possible solutions, which are then narrowed to a smaller set. The final weeks of the semester are spent designing preliminary market research to be conducted during an international immersion experience.</p>
<p>Noteworthy in designing the project is the need to have a key component that involves the design of a solution. Thus, a “marketing” plan for existing solutions simply goes against the orientation of the course of learning from subsistence marketplaces before designing solutions for them. It also takes away from the centerpiece of the class in terms of learning, bringing together very different disciplinary perspectives to design economically, ecologically, and socially sustainable solutions, thereby confronting a range of challenges. There has to be some give and take in this phase to carve out the domain of each project. Typically, students have complete freedom in terms of the larger sustainable business plan, with the domain of the solution that would be the focal design being partially constrained (e.g., healthy food or beverage, vocational education, medicine dispensing cabinet, optical kit) or even unconstrained. Even here, when instructors believe that the sponsors’ solution focus is narrow, broader design to include additional elements is recommended to students. Thus, key here is for students to incorporate the design of core solutions as the central part of their project and to ensure that it is a significant element. Such a focus is consistent with the larger orientation of <italic>learning from</italic> to <italic>design solutions for</italic>, which should be distinguished from a search for parallel markets for existing solutions. We do not believe that the latter is suitable for the underexplored arenas of subsistence and sustainability. Also noteworthy are the nature of organizations we work with—often ones that infuse important social values into their mission—consistent with our philosophical orientation of envisioning a better world but understanding the challenges in getting there through the design of solutions from products to business plans. Our interdisciplinary groups also balance different perspectives as they, in turn, balance the needs of different stakeholders.</p>
<p>Travel during part of the winter break is planned for actual immersion in the context and to conduct market research. Field trips have covered several cities in India including Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Jabalpur, Delhi, and Agra. Students observe households and retail and wholesale outlets that serve subsistence consumers in urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. Students conduct interviews with low-literate, low-income individuals in different settings with an interpreter to translate to the local language, gleaning insights about the problems, ideas, and concepts they have developed in their projects. These interviews are open-ended, designed to learn from interviewees with a mutual learning mindset—that is, bottom up in terms of research methods as well. Students interact with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and corporations engaged in subsistence contexts that wrestle with broader visions, social values, and challenges in implementation, consistent with our philosophical orientation. A student immersion experience geared to visiting the environment of the urban and rural poor requires considerable planning, rehearsal, and effort. It is however, by every indication, a transformative learning experience for the students. Despite earlier idea generation based on classroom emersion and immersion, the international immersion experience is very powerful and brings about project insights that cannot be replicated remotely. It captures our philosophical, substantive, and methodological orientations—with bottom-up learning of the domain of subsistence marketplaces, the observation of institutions that infuse social values to serve them, and interactions with different stakeholders. Direct interviews with subsistence consumers and entrepreneurs and observations of their living conditions and marketplaces enable learning outcomes that cannot be captured through other means. From our observations, this is perhaps the most successful aspect of our course. But it involves extraordinary effort to put together. For one, the research the course is based on and the ability to implement the field trip rest on years of field work and development of a dedicated team on the ground in a subsistence context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1052562911432256">Figure 1</xref>). Through long-standing investments in field relationships, we are able to implement aspects of the field trip at short notices, such as project-specific observations and interviews. Such arrangements could also be made through a nongovernmental organization or similar organization with access to communities, although our dedicated team adds a level of sophistication and ongoing feedback to the classroom throughout the year.</p>
<p>In the first few weeks of the spring semester, students further evaluate the concepts that were refined through field research as well as additional concepts they generated and narrow down to one concept. They then take their concept to a workable prototype and develop sustainable manufacturing, marketing, and business plans, thus confronting the challenges involved as it relates to elements of business and engineering. Throughout the semester, students can get direct responses to concepts and prototypes from subsistence consumers and entrepreneurs in India through our field team. Content covered emphasizes sustainable product design; sustainable business plans that include elements such as sustaining the local environment, local livelihoods, and local culture; and economic, environmental, and social objectives. Thus, the bottom-up orientation carries through to the nature of the comprehensive solution that aims foremost to enable economically, ecologically, and socially sustainable marketplaces. The philosophical orientation of envisioning a better world and challenges therein is captured in the larger solution that students develop as well as individual elements, such as sustaining the local economy.</p>
<p>The spring course offers a space for students to be creative and also to understand and execute the elements of a sustainable business plan. However, we should note that the course ends with prototypes in different stages, leaving room for moving projects forward into commercialization through some related means, a step we aim to move toward. Thus, we increasingly seek project sponsors who are most likely to benefit and implement ideas stemming from the business plans that students develop. Moreover, time constraints and current workloads prevent market research from developing toward quantitative conclusions as the concept testing provided is also preliminary. Thus, we should note that much market research is needed beyond what is conducted in the course to take a product to commercialization.</p>

<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>The year-long course has been extremely well-received by students (approximately 100 to date), partially reflected by extremely high evaluations, and more fully captured by word-of-mouth and unsolicited comments that simply describe the course as life-changing or transformative, no less. Because of space constraints, only two illustrative quotes are provided:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The immersion trip was an incredible experience—a chance to see business at its best. Interacting with consumers, entrepreneurs, and nonprofit workers helped me to understand how to design products and programs for maximum impact. I was amazed at the resourcefulness and creativity I witnessed on the trip.</p>
<p>The trip to India is the capstone to my MBA experience. In India, I was able to take the knowledge gathered in the classroom and apply it in a context of one of the most important markets in the near future: subsistence marketplaces. Our project team includes engineers, industrial designers, and MBAs. The challenge of making a multidisciplinary solution to real-world problems in subsistence markets has been the best project that I have been involved with in my graduate school career.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The impact of the year-long course on subsistence marketplaces is evident at the university and is used as a model of interdisciplinary, integrative learning experiences. Businesses and social enterprises that sponsor our class projects and receive detailed prototypes and business plans at the end of the course are also influenced by our teaching and have provided consistently positive feedback. We are also beginning to see outcomes being put into practice by a few of our sponsors (e.g., working model of prototype). Prospective instructional cases are being developed out of several reports. Our course was also recently listed as one of the top entrepreneurship courses by <italic>Inc.</italic> magazine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1052562911432256">Buchanan, 2011</xref>). Feedback on the module for first-year undergraduates has been very positive, as reflected from feedback from both section leaders (approximately 100 to date) and students (approximately 1,500 to date) and also in the quality of the work presented in project reports and poster sessions, the latter having received positive feedback from the larger community that attends. Our outcomes for sustainable marketing enterprises have been uniformly positive in terms of traditional measures, such as evaluations and course-related comments, although no more so than with other successful courses. This is in contrast to our year-long course, which elicits perhaps an exponentially different level of positive outcomes, gauging from unsolicited feedback to a variety of sources.</p>
<p>Our initial foray has been through stand-alone courses, which, in turn, led to a module within a larger course on professional responsibility. Our hope is that sustainability diffuses into the fabric of a range of business courses as faculty examine ways of incorporating this all-important topic and as students question how specialized functional knowledge applies to new realities. Our multidisciplinary approach to teaching is important given the cross-disciplinary nature of sustainability and the emerging nature of sustainability in management education. We offer a sustainability certificate for students who participate in specific learning experiences, as a way of stimulating interest and recognizing accomplishments.</p>
<p>Demonstrating the value and impact of teaching about sustainability through stand-alone courses and modules serves a number of purposes—a learning space to apply specialized knowledge to looming challenges, a demonstration of the value and potential impact of incorporating courses about sustainability, a medium to learn about the topic and fine-tune courses in the future, and a pathway for individual faculty interested in moving forward without waiting for full-fledged, top-down affirmation—again emphasizing a bottom-up approach. Such an approach requires individual faculty to champion the topic until a critical mass of interest is reached. At our college, increasing support for sustainability is very evident.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section10-1052562911432256">
<title>Parallels With Literature and Practice</title>
<p>We note that elements of learning experiences relating to sustainability such as an interdisciplinary orientation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1052562911432256">Welsh &amp; Murray, 2003</xref>), introspection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562911432256">Bradbury, 2003</xref>), unsustainable behaviors, systems thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562911432256">Bradbury, 2003</xref>), or even more broadly, incorporating critical skill-sets of reflexivity, critique, and social action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562911432256">Kearins &amp; Springett, 2003</xref>), have been emphasized in the literature and resonate with our experiences. A number of elements of our approach exist in other curricular innovations or in broader calls for sustainability in education, such as interdisciplinary approaches involving students from across campus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562911432256">Calder &amp; Clugston, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1052562911432256">Thursby, Fuller, &amp; Thursby, 2009</xref>) and difficulties associated with environmental education for sustainability. Our year-long course represents relationship-building among and with students from across campus, reflecting the call for sustainable education by putting relationships back into education and moving beyond managerial and economic values to ecological values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1052562911432256">Sterling, 2001</xref>). Our experience also reflects issues such as developing international experiences, revising core courses (i.e., designing a new one) and creating optional courses, building relationships with commercial and social enterprises, building internal support for courses, and developing resources (e.g., case studies and learning materials) highlighted in embedding sustainability in business education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1052562911432256">Hunting, Mah, &amp; Tilbury, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Our approach emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of these topics and the business solutions that emerge. Such collaborative, interdisciplinary teamwork tapping into the diverse cultural backgrounds of students as well as the design element that characterizes some of our courses is emphasized in examples of global MBA programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1052562911432256">Roome, 2005</xref>). Our focus on subsistence marketplaces in the context of sustainability is noteworthy as understanding environmental issues in developed versus developing countries and keeping a focus on sustainable development has been highlighted as a key challenge of environmental education in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1052562911432256">Marcinkowski, 2010</xref>). To contrast with our bottom-up approach, the disciplinary content of a number of courses on poverty begin with a strategy-level focus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wdi.umich.edu/News/552/">http://www.wdi.umich.edu/News/552/</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hbs.edu/mba/academics/coursecatalog/1908.html">http://www.hbs.edu/mba/academics/coursecatalog/1908.html</ext-link>). Such courses represent relatively macro-level approaches that provide an organizational-level perspective, whereas we begin with subsistence consumers and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>We found examples of top-down approaches to teaching sustainability, such as those that examine social, economic, and political dimensions of environmental problems and institutional roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1052562911432256">Springett, 2005</xref>). A number of courses on sustainability in general begin with more of a top-down perspective, such as through examining capitalistic systems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1052562911432256">1</xref></sup> However, others blend top-down with bottom-up approaches as well, and we found several examples that reflect bottom-up learning experiences, such as the use of the concept of land as a basis for themes on sustainability and management to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1052562911432256">Gilbert, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562911432256">Walck, 2003</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562911432256">Walck (2003)</xref> argues for the need to move from being too abstract to concrete starting points, very much in line with our own approach. Built into assignments for students are introspective exercises, akin to our approach (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1052562911432256">Springett, 2005</xref>). Our approach of using introspection resonates with approaches to sustainability that capture inner and outer worlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562911432256">Bradbury, 2003</xref>). Also pertinent to our overall approach, the MBA program has been described as being narrowly focused on functional specialization and analytical decision making rather than preparing students for leadership for the 21st-century global environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1052562911432256">Mintzberg &amp; Gosling, 2002</xref>) and being in the functionalist, technocentric, centralized decision-making end of the continuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1052562911432256">Thomas &amp; Benn, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1052562911432256">
<title>Evaluation Through Learning Frameworks</title>
<p>In evaluating our approach with existing frameworks, our emphasis on experiential learning captures the notion of learning being a process rather than an outcome that is derived from experience, holistic and integrative, and involving interactions between individuals and the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562911432256">Kayes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562911432256">D. A. Kolb, 1984</xref>). Our international immersion is a very fitting example of experiential learning as is the entire year-long class experience through product design and business plan development. Thus, our students traverse opposite ways of grasping experience and transforming experience, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1052562911432256">Houde, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1052562911432256">A. Y. Kolb &amp; Kolb, 2005</xref>)—concrete experience (e.g., poverty simulation, international immersion) and abstract conceptualization (e.g., emersion of concepts), and reflective observations (e.g., a number of assignments) and active experimentation (e.g., concept generation and testing, prototyping). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1052562911432256">Ng, Dyne, and Ang (2009)</xref> note the importance of experiential learning for international and culturally diverse experiences.</p>
<p>Critical pedagogy emphasizes a student-centered classroom where faculty and students are on an equal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562911432256">Giroux, 1997</xref>). Our courses are very much in this vein, as issues of sustainability and subsistence are ones where expertise is elusive if at all it exists. In fact, we push this notion further in our course on subsistence marketplaces, emphasizing the conversation on an equal plane with subsistence consumers and entrepreneurs who possess expertise in surviving the harshest of conditions. We emphasize a mutual learning mindset. The interdisciplinary nature of our class works to facilitate such decentering as students and faculty seek expertise within and outside the class. Also relevant from a critical pedagogy perspective is crossing interdisciplinary boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562911432256">Barnett, 1997</xref>). Problematizing concepts is another aspect of critical pedagogy to enable complicated understanding, wherein the interests of different individuals in specific situations as they relate to a problem are analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1052562911432256">Welsh &amp; Murray, 2003</xref>), coming through in our approach in balancing the perspectives of different stakeholders, accentuated through direct immersion. An action orientation through designing products and developing business plans is also relevant here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1052562911432256">Welsh &amp; Murray, 2003</xref>, provide an example of a collaborative learning experience).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562911432256">Kearins and Springett (2003)</xref> discuss aspects of critical theory, such as reflexivity, that is, the assumptions made in creating knowledge. A number of elements of our courses, such as participating in poverty simulations and understanding radically different contexts, emphasize reflexivity. Thus, virtual immersion and emersion engender a questioning of assumptions. In fact, understanding what one takes for granted is one of the biggest aspects of learning when studying subsistence marketplaces, or the planet decades from now with a host of environmental and social problems. The authors also note the role of critique with a focus on power—again a very central topic in the courses we teach. Finally, the dimension of social action emerges in our focus on designing solutions in every course we teach.</p>

<title>Top-Down Versus Bottom-Up Processes for Creating Changes to the Curriculum</title>
<p>The notion of a top-down versus bottom-up approach, although used earlier with respect to the learning experiences we designed, also relates to processes for incorporating sustainability into the curriculum. Top-down approaches include university- or college-level declarations and policies or directives, some specifically focusing on the sustainability curriculum and leading to curricular innovations (e.g., policies or directives and strategies at the university level; sustainability as a top priority; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1052562911432256">Lidgren, Rodhe, &amp; Huisingh, 2006</xref>), strategies for business schools for incorporating a sustainability curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1052562911432256">Hunting et al., 2006</xref>), creation of Masters programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1052562911432256">Pesonen, 2003</xref>). Curricular approaches to sustainability across the university include agreement gauged through surveys on disciplinary content for sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1052562911432256">Sherren, 2007</xref>). Such top-down approaches should be contrasted with our approach, which emphasizes individual championship of courses perhaps then leading to larger change, as in the case of a required module on this topic and subsequent offerings on sustainability. This is in contrast to university- or school-level directives being the initiator of change. Our approach, although involving a large investment on the part of the individuals seeking change, provides an alternative starting point involving fewer resources.</p>

<title>Principles of Responsible Management Education (PRME)</title>
<p>In conclusion, our educational endeavors further the PRME (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unprme.org/">http://www.unprme.org/</ext-link>). The essence of the first principle of developing capabilities of students in working toward “creating sustainable value for business and society and to work for an inclusive and sustainable global economy” is captured in our general emphasis on sustainability as well as our substantive focus on subsistence marketplaces, the latter for the most part left out of management education. We inculcate in students an understanding of global social responsibility as enunciated in the second principle and create educational experiences that enable leadership as articulated in the third principle. Our educational endeavors are grounded in more than a decade of research that advances understanding about creating sustainable value, in accordance with the fourth principle. Our engagement with practitioners through in-depth projects reflects the fifth principle of interacting with managers and our efforts to disseminate our experiences and learn from other educators captures the sixth principle of creating dialogue. In conclusion, our educational endeavors in sustainability represent unique philosophical, substantive, and methodological orientations that capture the PRME.</p>
