            <p>A ‘shreds’ video combines existing live music concert footage, predominantly including a famous male rock guitarist or guitar based rock group, with a self-produced overdubbed soundtrack. The result is a musical parody that exists in an intersection between production and consumption and works as a within-genre evolution. The shred is controversial and its most popular instalments have been pulled from YouTube on claims of copyright infringement. This paper examines shreds as a form of multimodal intertextual critique by engaging with the videos themselves, as well as audience responses to them. As such, the applied method is genre analysis and multimodal semiotics geared towards the analysis of intertextual elements. The paper shows how prodused parody exists as a co-dependence between: (1) production and consumption; (2) homage and subversion; (3) comprehension and miscomprehension; and (4) media synchronicity and socioeconomic dis/harmony. The paper also discusses how shreds can be interpreted as tampered-with gender performances. In conclusion, it becomes clear that the produsage of shred videos is part of ‘piracy culture’ because it so carefully balances between the mainstream and counter-culture, between the legal and the illegal, and between the commoditized artefact and networked production.</p>

         <title>Introduction: Shredding media and genres</title>
         <p>A ‘shreds’ video combines existing live music concert footage, predominantly including a famous male rock guitarist or guitar-based rock group,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1354856512456791">1</xref>
            </sup> with a self-produced overdubbed soundtrack. The result is a musical parody that exists in an intersection between production and consumption and works as a within-genre evolution. This paper examines shreds as a form of multimodal intertextual critique by engaging with the videos themselves as well as audience responses to them.</p>
         <p>The originator of the ‘shreds’ videos is a Finn named Santeri Ojala (aka StSanders). After producing a number of shreds videos, Ojala was reportedly banned from YouTube after them receiving complaints of copyright infringement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354856512456791">Wortham, 2008</xref>). In a way this is indicative of a tension between a legal and an illegal element of the shred and the separation between consumers and producers as enforced by economic measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354856512456791">Enzensberger, 1970</xref>). While it can be contended that this is a form of piracy per se, there is an interesting grey zone relating for example to fair use and media companies’ content management policies to be explored here. As of now many of the videos are still available, both on YouTube (although with significantly smaller number of views) and through Ojala’s own website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stsanders.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.stsanders.com</ext-link>). While Ojala is commonly regarded as the originator of the shred parody, others have appropriated the form since the initial videos. In a typical ‘shreds’ video much precaution is taken to carefully synchronize the added sound with the existing visual content of the live footage. The final result is a video with a user-generated soundtrack that is so well coordinated that many users, unexposed to previous ‘shreds’, initially mistake it for the original video and sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354856512456791">Phan, 2007</xref>). However, as shall be further detailed in the analysis and discussion, the added sound in many ways confronts and critiques many of the common assumptions about the male guitar hero, the audience and the context of the concert.</p>
         <p>For the purposes of this paper, ‘shreds’ is a particularly interesting phenomenon since it so explicitly combines a pre-existing visual material with a user-produced sound in a socio-digital context. The fact that this produsage is done with such laborious time-consuming effort further motivates them as a target of study. In addition, and what is perhaps even more interesting is, of course, how the produsage of this material is placed within remix culture and emerging cultural values.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section2-1354856512456791">
         <title>Background: Produsage on YouTube</title>
         <p>When the concept of a remix found its use in everyday language, it was commonly connected to the restructuring of a piece of music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354856512456791">Knobel and Lankshear, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856512456791">Manovich, 2007</xref>). Today, the concept has a wider connotation, but still, the underlying structure of the music remix remains at the core of it. The ability to ‘disconnect’ and separate various tracks of the music enabled a way of manipulation that, in hindsight, was a step towards complete ‘digitalism’. This improved ability to manipulate parts of the whole, and recombine them into new wholes, lead to new creative outputs and genres. In fact, a recent study shows that the amount and diversity of productive outcomes of a community or network is heavily related to the ability to reuse and remix available content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856512456791">Cheliotis and Yew, 2009</xref>).</p>
         <p>Thus, the previous separation of consumption and production is to an increasing extent being challenged by scholars who theorize that these activities are better modelled as a coincident process of ‘prosumption’ or ‘produsage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354856512456791">Bruns, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354856512456791">Fornäs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354856512456791">Humphreys and Grayson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354856512456791">Tapscott and Williams, 2006</xref>). For this paper we will use the term ‘produser’ for the combination of user/producer. By engaging themselves in a process of co-creation of new knowledge and artefacts, which builds and extends on existing content and artefacts, users become produsers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354856512456791">Bruns, 2007a</xref>). Produsage theory sees a user as always already a producer. In other words, produsers, with the help of pervasive media technologies, applications and services, engage in the repurposing, remixing and redistribution of media objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354856512456791">Lessig, 2008</xref>) and virtual products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354856512456791">Skågeby, 2011</xref>). Such media objects include music, sound, images and videos, which originate from a variety of sources (e.g. television, motion pictures, Internet, personal media archives) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354856512456791">Knobel and Lankshear, 2008</xref>). On a larger scale, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354856512456791">Cooper (2009</xref>: 304) explores, in what she refers to as ‘economic dynamics’, an insightful framing that acknowledges that capitalist relations today are often muddled with more common wealth or distributed gift-giving modes of goods and service circulation. As such, ‘things are not simply used up, but used in performative ways to create (new) economic, social and cultural values as well as statuses’.</p>
         <p>In this context of produsage, YouTube has emerged as an important media-sharing platform for user-generated content. YouTube is a video sharing service that provides produsers with a relatively straightforward platform to add and view videos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354856512456791">Benevenuto et al., 2008</xref>). These videos can be, for example, ‘home videos’, videos originating from broadcast television or movies, commercial videos (trailers, product commercials) or remixes of various kinds. YouTube videos are often also embedded in, or linked to, from other online services (e.g. blogs, Facebook, Twitter, MySpace) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354856512456791">Cha et al., 2007</xref>). It is also common for videos of a certain type to link to each other and consequently form embedded small networks, or communities, of their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354856512456791">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
         <p>More importantly for this paper, YouTube has also become an important forum for critical commentary and parody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354856512456791">Edwards and Tryon, 2009</xref>). Shred videos engage audiences in an ‘attack’ of their host genre from within. As such they also engage in parody as a specific form of <italic>critical intertextuality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354856512456791">Gray, 2006</xref>).</p>

         <title>Theory: Parody, critical intertextuality and genre literacy</title>
         <p>Parody is commonly defined as an imitation of the style of a particular writer, artist or genre with deliberate exaggeration for comic effect. As such, the parody, by definition, contains references to other genres and texts. Without these references, or <italic>intertextuality </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354856512456791">Chandler, 2007</xref>), the parody would lose its potential ‘to talk back to more authoritative texts and genres, to recontextualize and pollute their meaning-construction processes, and to offer other, ‘improper’, and yet more media literate and savvy interpretations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354856512456791">Gray, 2006</xref>: 4). An analysis of intertextuality can then be defined as a concern for the external relations between texts (rather than the internal logic of <italic>a text</italic>). Intertextuality views texts as always co-dependent on other texts for their textual meanings (i.e. as always already part of existing semiotic systems). As such, texts can provide proposed readings that challenge mainstream interpretations and subvert conventional discourses. It is obvious that a critical intertextual perspective has conceptual commonalities with both hypermedia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354856512456791">Landow and Delany, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354856512456791">Orr, 2009</xref>) and the consumer-as-producer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354856512456791">Grossberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354856512456791">Kotler, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354856512456791">Toffler, 1980</xref>). Without going in to meticulous detail on the philosophical underpinnings of intertextuality, this paper will examine parody as a critical form of intertextuality, specifically in the context of video produsage and genre literacy. As such, it also becomes important to conceptualize the genre.</p>
         <p>Genres are seen as one of the main principles for structuring modern media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354856512456791">Bjurström et al., 2000</xref>). Genres are defined as (relatively) stable patterns or familiar forms that function as a common frame of reference. In this way, they shape expectations by forming relationships between consumers and producers (Grossberg, et al., 1998) and by being both descriptive and prescriptive. As such, genres are also ideal theoretical and methodological tools for examining produsage: ‘I focus on genres because they are the meeting-point between the process of producing media materials and the process of using them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354856512456791">Agre, 1998</xref>: 81).</p>
         <p>Genre, rather than providing a strict definition of a class of objects, provides an orientation for produsage activities and outcomes. Genre can be seen as a collection of conventions, a structure of cultural value judgments or as a set of intertextual relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354856512456791">Devitt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354856512456791">Miller, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354856512456791">Swales, 1990</xref>). In practice, this is what creates a recognizable genre, allowing people to produce similar objects. The genre also implies that there is a ‘stream’ of cultural objects following a recurring form and function, rather than a single instance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354856512456791">Agre, 1998</xref>). However, the genre is not to be regarded as completely rigid in form and function. Genres can be unstable over time as they develop due to changes in media technology structures, market transformations, or even the intentions and concerns of produsers. Any such changes may happen gradually (e.g. through a merging of genres) or rapidly (e.g. through regulated changes). Another dynamic of genre has to do with the fact that it is self-referring – instances of the genre continuously reinforce or challenge the genre itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354856512456791">Yates and Orlikowski, 1992</xref>). Reconnecting genre and parody it can be said that parody is an intertextual process that ‘makes fun of the way a genre works’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354856512456791">Gray, 2006</xref>: 45). Parody criticizes the genre from within. For this critique to be fruitful, the process of parody requires of its audience an understanding of the genre’s conventions – a genre literacy.</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>Genre literacy, as such, not only may act as a powerful tool for conformity to be maintained, but also provides two integral conditions for a critical intertextuality: it is a system that can be disrupted and reconstituted by one text, allowing one text to affect many, and given the prevalence of media discussion today, it is a system that allows for communities to form around such rogue texts, communities that can act to reinforce, further disseminate, or even amplify such texts’ disruptive force. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354856512456791">Gray, 2006</xref>: 46)</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>Interpretative communities – or produsing audiences – become so significant because they embody the comprehension of the criticism. At the same time, the parody is also at the mercy of audience miscomprehension or disregard. Hence, it is important, as Gray stresses, to conduct a <italic>cultural</italic> analysis of genre – an analysis that is sensitive to ‘the processes of categorization and at what cultural and media practices that are behind them’ (2006: 30). In summary, what is interesting for this paper are the ways that produsers re-use media, genres and their boundaries, to create parodic content, which is then shared over a computer-mediated social network. While it can be difficult to definitely determine when a stream of media objects come to form a genre of its own, the process of parody produsage is important since it highlights which elements are culturally and temporally situated within the (emerging) genre at the time of the study.</p>

         <p>Two types of data were sourced for this paper: (1) shred videos, and (2) video user comments. The paper will focus mainly on the shred videos created by Ojala since he is the originator, the most productive produser of shreds, and has been continually produsing shreds over the development of the genre. However, the data material will also include a number of shreds prodused by other YouTube aliases to indicate the adoption of the format. Ojala’s website reports 18 specific instances of ‘guitar shreds’, including for example santana shreds,<sup>

            </sup> In total 21 shred videos were analysed. The videos have between 25,000 and 2,200,000 views on YouTube as of the time of writing. The reason for the relatively low view count should be read in the light that the original videos have been pulled from YouTube (due to copyright infringement claims) once before and the new uploads have not yet generated views in the same range. For the 21 chosen videos the comments on YouTube amount to 27,059 at the time of writing. To create a more manageable volume of comments, five shred videos were randomly selected and all comments elicited. The rationale behind this approach, rather than randomizing from the entire comment pool, is to retain the coherence and sequence of the comments made to a single video. This selection resulted in 4277 comments included in the analysis.</p>

Because the objects of study in this paper are videos specifically, the paper follows the generic procedure of the genre analysis, but also uses a specifically developed method to mapping out the content. An adapted version of the video analysis method developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354856512456791">Machin (2010)</xref> was used. The purpose of this method is to ‘transcribe videos in a way that allows us to best describe and analyse the way that sound, image and word work together <italic>multimodally, </italic>to show how they interrelate to form a single communicative act’ (2010: 185). More specifically, the analysis made use of an annotation model consisting of three ‘tracks’. This is a particularly fruitful way to analyse prodused parody because it makes it easy to identify what tracks actually contain produser-generated material (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354856512456791">Table 1</xref>).</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>There is an obvious risk of over-intellectualising parody and removing all aspects of fun through dry academic analysis. Nevertheless, shreds as cultural and social objects are more than just ‘guys mucking about in their boring office-desk jobs’. First, the very effort of produsing a shred is significant and defies simplistic reduction to just-for-fun (even though this is part of it). This is also expressed vividly in the video comments, for example, ‘The twisted mastermind behind these is incredibly dedicated, patient, and talented’ (user comment). Second, as audiences engage with media objects, there is a chance that they (the media objects) become more than what the produser may have intended from the beginning. This includes a development of the shred in itself and as such the host genre in general. While the early shreds were generally focused upon bad guitar playing, adding new instruments, (out-of-genre) sounds and even lyrics became part of the development. In addition, a more deliberate imitation of the original artist’s style of playing or well-known hit song added to the (mis-)comprehension of the shred.</p>

         <p>Naturally, there are several ways to read the ‘shred’ genre. A main theme, however, is located in the tension between cultural critique and cultural homage. It is clear that there are some manifest pop-cultural references made in shreds. The explicit inclusion of fragments of well-known ‘rock anthems’ (e.g. ‘The Final Countdown’ by Europe and ‘Iron Man’ by Black Sabbath) in the audio soundtrack creates a sense of familiarity with the audience and points to a guitarist-in-learning. Several comments make reference to ‘a guitar center on a Saturday afternoon’ where novice players try out their favourite licks and riffs. Further, including elements that are not typically part of the host genre, such as tap-dancing or whistling, pose further challenges to the romantic idea and connotations of the guitar hero.</p>
         <p>On a more latent level, the shred also highlights how the produsage of a particular parody requires prior knowledge of genre elements (‘comprehension’ in Chandler’s terms, ‘genre literacy’ in Gray’s terms). The shred can include emphases that make the added sound particularly critical or humorous. For example, the adding of applause after each (poorly) performed solo can be read as simply being in contrast to the quality of the performed solo, but also as a critique against the custom for each band member to perform lengthy solos that the audience then (customarily) cheer for.</p>
         <p>As mentioned, the produser-generated guitar melodies are created with a balance between skill and deliberate amateurism. While the melodic qualities are obviously flawed the sound of the guitar is kept very realistic. The quality of the other sounds, however, are very ‘cheap’. Keyboards, handclaps and drums all sound very amateurish, synthetic and out-of-date. Still, viewers unfamiliar with the band, or not knowing what the original content should sound, may be tricked by the quality of the synchronized material and interpret the performance as being that of a very poor musician. For example, several comments highlight the gradual (or sudden) realization that the video is, in fact, parodic: ‘I didn’t understand that it was fake until like half way. I was thinking “interesting style”. Then when I realized it was fake, I couldn't stop laughing’ (user comment). Others seem to not realize that the audio is overdubbed at all: ‘ummm this was aweful:(vai is good but here he dont have a good day:/’ (user comment). This, however, leads us to a common theme in the comments, namely irony. The irony takes on several different forms, but (mis-)comprehension is a major theme. Some comments acknowledge that the audio has been substituted, but make an ironic jest out of the notion that the sound has been exchanged for a ‘genuine’ track by another group (e.g. Nickelback, Primus or The Residents). This becomes meta-critical since it also criticizes the referred artist and its genre (e.g. ‘art rock’). A variation on this is to imply that the artist in the shred is in fact copying a player-in-learning: ‘I played this exact same piece during the 2nd grade talent show. Thanks for ripping me off Steve’ (user comment) – and thus reverse the direction of flattery. Other comments seem to pretend to not have comprehended that the audio is replaced, and for example make use of advanced music-theoretical terms to suggest that the skill required to perform a solo of this kind is immense. Deliberate miscomprehension also takes the form of rants about how a hard rock life of drugs and downward artistic spiralling may have played a part in this particular shoddy performance. Of course, there are also members of the audience who leap to the defence of their heroes. Their comments express a dislike against what they see, not as homage at all, but as plain mockery of a genuinely skilled guitar player.</p>

            <p>The parodic text adds itself to our genre understanding, and works toward corroding away that which has been allowed to work undetected in the genre. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354856512456791">Gray, 2006</xref>: 47)</p>

         <p>Ganetz, citing Judith Butler, points to parody as one way to ‘make visible the cracks’ in gender-normative performances: ‘The resistance against the already given gender norms, against the repetitions, can be found in the parodies that make visible the characteristics of the imitation’ (2009: 128, my translation). As the electric guitar and ‘rock’ music in general is closely connected to the performance of masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354856512456791">Bayton, 1997</xref>), the prodused parody of the ‘shred’ becomes particularly interesting to analyse in terms of gender performance. Indeed, it is hard to ignore the fact that virtually all instances of the ‘shred’ genre contain male musicians only. The hegemonic masculinity of guitar heroes is also paralleled in the popular literature. For example, in the book <italic>The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists</italic> the author remarks that out of the 100 presented guitarists 48 were American, 14 Swedish, 13 British, seven German, four Norwegian and three Canadian. Two each came from Finland, Poland, Brazil and Denmark, and one each from Switzerland, France and Australia. Ninety-six of the guitarists were still living at the time the book was published, with only Euronymous, Jesse Pintado, Chuck Schuldiner and ‘Dimebag’ Darrell deceased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354856512456791">McIver, 2009</xref>).</p>
         <p>What the author fails to mention is that not a single one was female. Even if we do not limit ourselves to ‘metal rock’ music, it is clear that most ‘guitar heroes’ are men. In 2003, <italic>Rolling Stone Magazine</italic> presented their ‘100 greatest guitarists’ list. On the list were two women: Joni Mitchell (no. 71) and Joan Jett (no. 86) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354856512456791">
               <italic>Rolling Stone Magazine</italic>, 2003</xref>). To further the argument, signs of a male hegemony in (electric) guitar music are visible in, for example, recruitment to instrumentalist education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354856512456791">Zervoudakes and Tanur, 1994</xref>), in media representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354856512456791">Ganetz, 2009</xref>) and in audience reception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354856512456791">Tagg, 1989</xref>) – the guitar, and particularly the electric guitar, is <italic>repeatedly</italic> coded as an instrument connected to masculinity. This points to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354856512456791">Acker (2006)</xref> has coined an inequality regime. Inequality regimes are defined as the ‘the interlocked practices and processes that result in continuing inequalities in all work organizations’ (2006: 441). The analytical approach of inequality regimes is closely connected to the concepts of legitimacy and visibility. Legitimacy entails how inequality regimes justify (or do not justify) the inequalities they sustain; while visibility concerns the awareness the organization displays regarding inequalities (manifest or latent). In terms of legitimacy there are examples of parodied female guitarists, but (currently) women are not as well represented as men in guitar rock, which is a fundamental part of why the parody of the shred can be read as gender-normative critique. When it comes to visibility, the recurring lists of ‘top guitarists’ are, but one, clear sign of ‘invisible’ inequality regimes at play.</p>
         <p>As mentioned, a well-performed guitar solo is also a good performance of masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354856512456791">Ganetz, 2009</xref>). In the shred video the guitarist enacts all the expected elements of masculine gender performance by, for example, arm-waving, jumping, tough and aggressive body language and (facially) displaying deep emotional investment in the performed guitar solo. This is however contrasted by the prosumer-generated soundtrack, which synchronizes appropriately with the visuals, but confronts them in terms of performance. Thus, this presents an intersection between visual and audible gender performance. In the prosumption of ‘shreds’, gender performance arguably becomes a multimodal postmodern canvas (albeit not necessarily a ‘blank’ canvas) that can be ‘tampered with’. Consequently, by referring to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354856512456791">Halberstam’s (2005)</xref> distinction between transgendered and transsexual bodies, we may shed even more light on the ‘shred’. According to this notion, the ‘shredded’ guitarist can be read mainly as transgendered – that is, the multimodal gender performance is altered – but it can not be read as transsexual since the visual body is not ‘deliberately reorganized’ (2005: 97). In reading the shred as an example of transgendered bodies, we have already noted that the visual representation of the male bodies are left (technically) unaltered. However, in visuality is also embedded social power, which is here brought into ambivalence. This unsettling of social power arguably directs our attention towards the visual representation as such, altering our ‘socio-material perception’ of it – very much in the way Ganetz and Butler identified the purpose of the parody. That is, when gender performance follows the expected norms, we think little of it. But, when the shred alters the audial performance, certain elements of (gendered) <italic>imitation and visuality</italic> become highlighted to us.</p>
         <p>As a final reflection on gender performance, it is likely that ‘shredding’ (as produsing practice) is still a very male-orientated practice. As such, there is also reason to think that the humour of shreds is co-constructed to actually <italic>reduce</italic> anxiety about any ‘queering’ that may be going on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354856512456791">Hawkins, 2006</xref>). That is, the jest of the parody may not only function as a gender-normative critique, but also as to disarm any real challenge to the constructed nature of conventional masculinity. Thus, the shred should certainly not be over-interpreted as a sign of the destabilization of hegemonic masculinity. Nevertheless, at the same time it cannot be neglected as an (attempt at) undermining of traditional and repeated masculinity.</p>

However, the shred relies on synchronicity in a broader sense, both technically and socially. Their combination of <italic>existing</italic> video with <italic>self-produced</italic> (and synchronized) music and sound is the technical part. This is a laborious and time-consuming effort. In the case of shreds, it is particularly salient that produsers must, during the actual process of produsage, consume the originating material in order to produce a synchronized experience. That is, produsers, in order to perform the art of audiovisual synchronization must quite literally and concurrently consume the original visual material while producing the audio (although post-editing is certainly utilized for perfection).</p>
         <p>While synchronicity is a central characteristic of produsing multimodal parody, it does not capture the ‘sense-making’ sociomaterial aspects very well. On a sociomaterial level, the shred expresses a co-dependency between being technically ‘on time’ and being socio-economically ‘disharmonius’.</p>

         </fig>
         <p>Media synchronicity needs to align with genre literacy or the parodic power is lost. At the same time, a shred also needs to be critical enough to parodize its host genre effectively, and thus also be disharmonius in relation to the mainstream. The media synchronicity of the shred relates both to harmony (within the disruption of the genre) and disharmony (in relation to the mainstream). However, the disharmony of parody cannot be completely without socio-material resonance – the peer prosumers (or audience) must be able to make sense of it. It can be almost a relief for the audience to find that the pet peeve they have been so annoyed about has been effectively captured in a particular piece of prodused parody. As such, there is an element of harmony in disharmony (that may perhaps be best described as a recognition of commonality in going against the mainstream), as a growing number of people may find the same parody expressing their concerns and/or intentions.</p>
         <p>An interesting aspect of the shred genre is how many of the instruments remain unheard when out of picture. This is a very literal practice of audiovisual synchronization. It may, of course, be a pragmatic decision on the behalf of the produser of the video to minimize the effort expended. However, this choice also adds value to the final product as it emphasizes a perception of the artist(s) as being of second-rate quality, which is arguably one of the functions/purposes of the genre.</p>
         <p>Another purpose of the synchronization is more directed towards the audience of the genre. The synchronization is key to the produsage balance of the genre. For the shred, the balance remains in being ‘convincingly bad’. That is, the produser needs to be good enough to persuade consumers that the final product <italic>could be</italic> the real thing. At the same time, they criticize the romantic idea of the guitar hero as an instrument equilibrist, by producing a ‘bad’ soundtrack.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>The examples analyzed in this paper indicate the variety of practices and semiotic styles used when produsing parody on YouTube. By analysing these examples as emerging genres with certain commonalities we can begin to position them as parts of counter-culture. Counter-culture refers to modes of resistance to, critique of, or deviation from what is perceived as a non-desirable norm. In the media climate of today there is reason to explore how counter-culture, consumerism and technicity are interwoven. Assuming a ‘long tail development’ of cultural expression and consumption, we will likely also witness a great variety of emerging forms of counter-culture that may, or may not, become mainstream, but where the academic excitement is found in the processes of emergence and how participants experience them. This paper has begun to show how the analysis of produsage outcomes can identify and characterize new media genres and genre elements. These genres are of cultural importance since they are mediators of the relation between produsers. Through their form, function and content, genres assist produsers in recognizing situations and objects. As consumers, we have certain expectations from a certain genre. However, these expectations can also be confronted by prodused media objects, which in turn can come to evolve the genre in itself.</p>
         <p>This paper has suggested that we can understand parody on YouTube as prodused, intertextual, genre-evolving critique. The practice of produsing parody on YouTube is situated in a co-dependence between (technical) synchronization and (sociocultural) dis/harmony. In a wider sense, the videos analysed in this paper are (post-)modern examples of counter-culture. They use existing media to produse ‘improper’ alterations and alternative interpretations. Still, because of the social network effect of YouTube they are capable of reaching a mass audience, form sub-genres of parody and even generate revenue (both for personal account holders and for YouTube). As such, the role of the produser is a contradictory, or perhaps, intermediary, one. This is because of the fact that the range of potential alteration is nebulous and manifold, due to it being based on an infrastructure deeply enmeshed in commercial exploitation, for example by the capitalization of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354856512456791">Skågeby, 2009</xref>). This shows how YouTube is also situated in-between a common-placed media institution and a platform offering relationships that go beyond the institutionalized set of rules. The mundane produsage of shreds can be interpreted as a liberating and empowering practice. However, on a socioeconomic level it can also be seen as subject to re-commodification and incorporated in an economy ultimately based on exchange values (rather than social bonding values). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354856512456791">Comor (2010)</xref> suggests, a process of produsage is always followed by attempts to manage and exploit. As such, it is interesting not only to reconsider the removal of the shred videos on YouTube, but also the appearance of Ojala on the American <italic>Jimmy Kimmel TV Show </italic>(ABC, 9 January 2008). In a segment from the show Ojala is interviewed and asked to perform a ‘live shred’ (i.e. a video is shown on a screen and Ojala ‘shreds’ to it). Ojala is then joined by guitarist Slash, from Guns’n’Roses, who plays along with Ojala, eventually interrupting and drowning Ojala’s shred with a ‘properly skilled’ guitar solo. So, while these examples of prodused parody are illustrative of a practice where previously passive consumers express their new produsive positions as members of networked culture, they can also be seen as subversion that can be effectively disarmed or controlled.</p>
         <p>This in turn leads us to consider the relationship between technology and technique. Technology, in this case, can be understood as YouTube, easy-to-use movie editing software and networked computers. Technique, in this case, refers more to the embodied skills of produsers to code and decode cultural messages. At times, prodused parody enters the mainstream to become part of broader public discourses on contemporary popular culture, spreading well beyond YouTube. As such, the produsage of parody is a vivid example of technique-in-use – that is, the potential to apply technique through technology. The big change, compared with earlier forms of prodused parody, is that produsers now engage in collaborative self-reflection and discussion around technique-in-use. Interpretative communities continuously re-mix cultural content in a process of concurrent discursive re-evaluation and re-interpretation.</p>
