<p>A graduate seminar as set forth in a school’s catalogue does not, of course, always coincide with what is actually taught in the course so described, nor how often said course is offered. (Berkeley’s sociology department duly announces the most recent outing for each of their graduate courses, but this practice is rare.) The Penn State course catalogue lists two graduate seminars, “Theories of Society I” and “Theories of Society II” that have been so defined since at least 1983, and very likely 20 years before that. At most universities such courses are known by the more conventional titles, “Classical Social Theory” and “Contemporary Social Theory.” Both Princeton and Wisconsin use this familiar nomenclature, though each also offers other “theory-saturated” courses which presuppose knowledge gained in basic theory classes. Northwestern’s sociologists offer “classical,” “modern,” and “contemporary” theory seminars, perhaps an ideal practice by which to indoctrinate graduate students into the profound mysteries of social thought between the Enlightenment and today’s latest wrinkles.</p>
<p>Penn State at one time used precisely this plan, but such a thorough pedagogical arrangement is no longer considered necessary in a reputable graduate program, in part because methods have become more complex while theory in some quarters has waned in general appeal. Instead, as at Ohio State, one course in “sociological theory” is required of incoming students, after which they may elect more theory training or not, as they and their advisors see fit. At the other extreme are Berkeley and Chicago. The former offers a course about Marxist and post-Marxist theory, on cultural theory, a special course in Bourdieu, plus the usual survey theory classes, whereas at Chicago, for an entire quarter, one can study either Mead, or Weber’s sociology of religion, something called “axiality,” as well as the “History of Social Theory.”</p>
<p>So, why, one might ask does Penn State’s catalogue refer to its two graduate seminars as “Theories of Society,” I and II? Perhaps only Neil Smelser knows, and those few left of his cohort who are still teaching. Smelser’s teacher at Harvard and also his co-author, Talcott Parsons (1902-1979), worked with a team of three other sociologists to produce in 1961 a monumental two-volume, boxed set for The Free Press of Glencoe called <italic>Theories of Society</italic>. As the two volumes are displayed in their illustrated slipcase, the first volume’s spine reads <italic>Theories of Society I</italic>, and the second accordingly. The sturdy box itself (10.5”h × 8”w × 3.5” thick) features 74 captioned photographs of theorists between Hobbes and Sorokin, all but two are white males, and many European. The photos were trendily washed in shades of pink and yellow, and vary by size indicating each theorists’ relative importance, so that the largest is of Freud, then Weber, then Simmel and Durkheim. All the others are substantially smaller. Susanne Langer, now mostly remembered as a philosopher of art, and the anthropologist, Ruth Benedict, are the only females whose photos grace the box.</p>
<p>The boxed set cost $25 in 1961, fully $195 today, about the price many reference volumes cost now, but not so for any book designed to serve as a required text in theory courses, as these two volumes clearly were. In fact, many copies must have been sent gratis to professors at the time, as 30 years ago copies of the set were ubiquitous in faculty offices, often high on a shelf, likely unread since grad school days. The set lent a certain theoretical weight to any professor’s displayed library, whether or not it was still consulted or used as a textbook. Like the so-called “Green Bible” at Chicago, <italic>Theories of Society</italic> became a totem, particularly for those who admired or adopted Parsons’ functionalist scheme of theorizing. At 1500 pages and weighing about eight pounds, it helped legitimate a field that in 1961 was still dismissed by neighboring disciplines as the lightweight uppity adolescent who had burst into the parlor laughing while more sober adults spoke in hushed tones.</p>
<p>For those who have never seen or used the set, consider some comparative data of a gross sort when it is placed beside familiar books of current usage. Goffman’s <italic>The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life</italic> is about 87,000 words long at 255 pages. Mills’ <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> consumed about 83,000 words over 226 pages. George Ritzer’s full-scale history of social theory, 8th edition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094306113491543">2011</xref>), contains under 367,000 words at 668 pages. Charles Lemert’s well-known theory anthology in its fifth and latest edition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113491543">2013</xref>) takes extracts from 111 authors, is 513 pages long, and uses up about 444,000 words. And Alan Sica’s <italic>Social Thought</italic> features the work of 144 authors in 663,000 words on 765 pages. In remarkable contrast to all these, <italic>Theories of Society</italic> offers nearly 1,400,000 words of excerpts, plus 29 pages of bibliography in dual-column format, and a large index as well. In addition to lengthy commentaries by each of the four editors, there are 169 excerpts from 87 theorists, many of them multiple selections by Freud, Weber, Durkheim, and Simmel. Put another way, the Goffman volume is 6.3 percent as long as the Parsons et al., Mills’ is 6 percent, Ritzer’s is 26.7 percent, Lemert’s is 32.2 percent, and Sica’s is 48.1 percent as long. By any standard, <italic>Theories of Society</italic> is a monumental collection of theoretically-oriented writings, probably the largest ever produced in English and intended for the textbook market.</p>
<p>In 1952 the dynamo who co-founded The Free Press, Jeremiah Kaplan (1927-1993), had asked Parsons and Edward Shils (1910-1995), perhaps on the basis of their <italic>Toward a General Theory of Action</italic> (1951), to put together an anthology of theoretical classics which could be adopted for textbook use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094306113491543">Parsons et al, 1961</xref>: p. xxv). Many others were already in print, but the G.I. market was still functioning, and the Harvard team seemed well positioned to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand for sociology books compared with previous decades. <italic>The Lonely Crowd</italic> and other postwar books had created a hunger for sociology that The Free Press thrived on feeding. Only after Shils essentially left the project were Jesse Pitts (1921-2003) and Kaspar Naegele (1923-1965), both Parsons’ students at Harvard, added to the editorial team as junior members. Each editor was allowed to select excerpts under certain headings and to write extensive introductory material. In Shils’ case he relinquished the role of editor proper, and instead wrote a postscript to the two volumes, “The Calling of Sociology,” a 40,000-word monograph (pp. 1405-1448) that became famous in its own right. It was reissued (1980) in one of Shils’ essay collections, serving as the volume’s title.</p>
<p>The material filling the two volumes was divided into five sections: (1) Historical and Analytical Foundations, (2) Differentiation and Variation in Social Structures, (3) Personality and the Social System, (4) Culture and the Social System, and (5) Social Change. Those familiar with Parsons’ <italic>The Social System</italic> (1951) will recognize the terminology as being close to his own in that famously opaque book. The first volume opens with Naegele’s “Observations on the Scope of Sociological Analysis” (pp. 3-29), followed by a very large entry by Parsons, “An Outline of the Social System,” fully 50 pages and 47,000 words. Those who have studied Parsons would intuit that he claims the rest of the gigantic book documents, in ways that he found satisfactory, a “convergence” of ideas among dozens of thinkers which met, as it were, in his own mind. His general theory, in short, was for him and a few of his more dedicated followers the <italic>summum</italic> of all preceding social analysis. That almost nobody agreed with Parsons in this self-estimate, even including his co-editors, did not slow his forward motion over the succeeding 18 years of his life, as he refined his ideas. In fact, he explained that even before <italic>Theories of Society</italic> was published, his opening “outline” to the book was outmoded, and no longer accurately represented his own “evolving” notions. Several reviewers had little to say about the book’s contents other than to argue vigorously against Parson’s opening statement.</p>
<p>Each of the five major headings was further subdivided. For instance, within the first heading, Parsons wrote an “editorial forward” that eats up 13,000 additional words, and is followed by a dozen excerpts from Machiavelli to Spencer. Naegele then contributed a 10,000-word introduction to “The Elements of Social Interaction: Roles and Collectivities,” followed by excerpts from Simmel, Mead, Marcel Mauss, and Weber. Naegele continued with an introduction to “The Modes of the Institutionalization of Action” (7500 words) where he comments on excerpts from Tönnies, Ralph Linton, Durkheim (two selections), and Weber (also two). The ratio between the editors’ introductory materials in these first 153 pages of the first volume (discounting the two, long opening essays by Naegele and Parsons) and the actual excerpts from classic writers is on the order of one to five (about 19 percent).</p>
<p>The 118,000 words of classical theory, encapsulated within the first major heading of the book—even if one chose to dispense with the editors’ commentary—would likely constitute more “contact” with foundational texts (by Hobbes, Locke, Adam Smith, Malthus, Hegel, Mill, Rousseau, Comte, Marx, and Maine, in addition to those already named) than most sociology graduate students today experience. Naturally, one could argue that reading Foucault, Baudrillard, Butler, Žižek, Baumann, Bourdieu, and other contemporaries obviates the need to study more antique texts. Yet none of these writers would likely agree, having themselves developed their “new” viewpoints after reading precisely those texts, learning the ropes therein. When Parsons’ wrote about “the Hobbesian worldview” or Marx cavilled against Hegel’s metaphysics or Foucault argued against Rousseau, they assumed that their readers immediately recognized their points of reference. <italic>Theories of Society</italic> was thus meant to provide precisely that Archimedean point on which to stand, even if it was superficially cast in Parsonsian terms. And whereas today’s theory reader textbooks, like those of Lemert and Sica, were assembled with similar intentions, the necessary brevity of the selections and the urge to become widely inclusive make it difficult for novices to entertain distinctive worldviews in ways that the Parsons <italic>et al</italic>. volumes facilitate. In fact, many of the then-standard writers presented in <italic>Theories of Society</italic> (e.g., Lenin, Pareto, von Gierke, Lewis Morgan, Lord Acton, Chester Bernard, Edmond Goblot, von Harnack, Karl Bücher, Herman Schmalenbach, Marc Bloch, Maitland, Robert MacIver, Robertson Smith, among others) have become entirely foreign to sociology in ways that Parsons and his colleagues would probably have found incomprehensible 50 years ago when they sent their gigantic manuscript to press.</p>
<p>If the two-volume set failed to present “everything worth knowing in the history of social thought,” it came as close as any reader ever has, establishing a canon which, like so many before it, has slowly been overlooked rather than absorbed or transcended by later theorizing. The foundational link between “then” and “now” has for many students been severed. And yet how many of Judith Butler’s fans realize that her first book, <italic>Subjects of Desire: Hegelian Reflections in Twentieth-Century France</italic> (1987) is a clearly written analysis of works by Hegel and his French interpreters (Kojève, Hyppolite, Sartre, Derrida, Lacan, Deleuze, and Foucault)? Could she shortly thereafter have written <italic>Gender Trouble</italic> (1990) without first serving a strenuous apprenticeship in these antique texts?</p>
<p><italic>Theories of Society</italic> continues with a strong mixture of what we now call micro, meso, and macro analysis. Political analysis gets its due, as does stratification, the sociology of religion, a great deal of attention is paid to “personality and social structure,” the sociology of culture and values is given much attention, and social change—despite Parsons’ alleged inability to countenance it, especially in violent or revolutionary forms—is also canvassed at length. Naturally there are omissions, particularly given today’s obsession with computerization and all that means for the lucky percentage of earth’s population who have access to its miracles. Yet when one reflects on the primordial conflicts continuing to frustrate peaceful development in so many parts of the world, perhaps that portion of contemporary life to which the Parsons volumes cannot speak is much smaller than the <italic>avant garde</italic> today would care to believe.</p>
<p>The two volumes were reviewed in at least six sociology journals, and by well-known scholars with deep experience in social theorizing. The famous Columbia positivist, Hans Zetterberg, was asked by <italic>AJS</italic> for his opinion (May 1962). Predictably given his orientation, he claimed that “little of it can be called ‘theory’ except in the idiosyncratic sense in which most sociologists use this word,” yet “the selection is so excellent that these volumes contain a good share of what most of us will agree are ‘classical’ sociological passages” (p. 707). The excerpts, though not particularly “theoretical,” nevertheless “continue to serve as inspiration for fruitful ideas in contemporary sociology. Of course, we have read them before [!], but we will become better sociologists if we read them again” (<italic>ibid</italic>.). But despite its great bulk, Zetterberg “missed Plato, Aristotle, Khaldun, Tocqueville, von Stein, and Sorel.” He notes Parsons’ wish to “bask in the glory of some of the best sociological writings of all time” (p. 708), and thereby to fortify his own theorizing. But he wonders why more recent elaborations upon classical themes were not included, those by Lewis Coser, George Homans, Seymour Martin Lipset, Robert Merton, Arnold Rose, all of whom were in their prime at the time. He concludes with a sentiment echoed in other reviews: “The fact that modern sociology is represented by Parsons’ summary of his own thinking is no substitute for many genuine advances over older formulations made in recent years” (<italic>ibid</italic>.).</p>
<p>Llewellyn Gross in a lead <italic>ASR</italic> review (April 1962) seems to have read an entirely different book. He says nothing about the classical entries, but instead takes apart Parsons’ claims for his own theory being the culmination of a “revolution” in social science. He speaks well of Naegele’s introductions (“an original addition to the literature of sociology. . . keenly sensitive to the divergence and ‘severalness’ of sociological usage”), then chides Shils for his “disconcerting inconsistencies” (p. 260). He seems perplexed by Shils’ claim that “sociology can and almost certainly will divest itself of the quasi-Marxist, populistic, rationalistic, anti-authoritarianism. . . the theory itself will need the guidance of the ‘experience’ or of the ‘vision’ of authority.” Since Shils was famously conservative in all things, his sentiments make sense, yet if one reflects on the Events of May 1968 and the great enthusiasm for neo-Marxist thinking throughout the 20 years of sociology after Shils wrote “The Calling of Sociology,” it is clear that he was as committed to a special form of theoretical fantasizing as was his close friend, Parsons.</p>
<p>Another stalwart of the theory camp was chosen by <italic>Social Forces</italic> to evaluate the two volumes. Alvin Boskoff was also given a lead review (October 1962), seeing <italic>Theories of Society</italic> as “overwhelming in sheer size and weight,” a marker for the recent success of sociology, yet unsure of its intended audience (p. 83). Boskoff helpfully compares this reader with those by Lewis Coser and Morris Rosenberg, Edward Borgatta and Henry J. Meyer, C. Wright Mills’ <italic>Images of Man</italic>, and another by Charles and Zona Loomis. He runs through Parsons’ shaping of the book to bolster his own ideas, then regrets that there is too much Freud but not enough Cooley, MacIver, Lowie, Giddings, Oppenheimer, Znaniecki, or Teggart. Quite in contrast to Lewellyn’s estimate of Shils’ long contribution, Boskoff thinks highly of it, an “unanticipated dividend.” He compliments Shils for “clarifying” a number of issues, and for urging theorists toward “conceptual clarity, conversion of concepts to testable propositions, a revivified focus on social change as a master sociological problem, and a concern for a usable typology of societies to complement the study of social change” (p. 84). Boskoff concludes with “no other work provides such extensive coverage and guidance to our theoretical heritage. Perhaps the work is too long for practical, immediate use; but both new and old students of sociology will recognize its value over the long run as a repository of sociological problems and creative ideas” (<italic>ibid</italic>.)</p>
<p>The young Donald N. Barrett (1927-1987) also took the lead review in <italic>The American Catholic Sociological Review</italic> (now <italic>The Sociology of Religion</italic>), delivering the most detailed and complimentary analysis among all the reviewers. He details the putative intimacies of the excerpted material with Parsons’ special interpretation of them, yet also pointing out that Naegele “almost completely ignores Parsons’ treatment of dynamics and change” (p. 270). Parsons’ “frequent asseveration and repetition are not logical grounds” for proving the adequacy of structural-functionalism, and he pointedly argues that “the cardinal importance attached to the <italic>analytic</italic> distinction between social and cultural dynamics cannot be minimized in the present formulation.” Barrett wants to appreciate the heroic theoretical labors that Parsons and his colleagues have laid at his feet, yet he maintains a healthy skepticism about their claims, perhaps due to the vary excerpts around which Parsons tries to weave his web. He inadvertently, perhaps, diminishes Parsons’ standing by quoting from him at length, each theoretical statement becoming further removed from everyday speech, familiar in its prolixity to readers of Sorokin, Mills, and others who “deconstructed” it at the time. Barrett is not unaware of Parsons’ “slippery distinctions” and “the abstruseness of Parsons’ writing,” yet he concludes his essay with congratulations to Jeremiah Kaplan for having sponsored this “beautiful, albeit expensive” product.</p>
<p>Helmut Wagner was asked by <italic>Social Research</italic> (Summer 1963) to compare the Parsons et. al. with <italic>Modern Social Theories: Selected American Writers</italic> by Charles and Zona Loomis. The result is an interesting essay because Wagner tried to be fair to both parties, not an easy task since the Loomis couple’s aim in writing their book was entirely different from that which inspired <italic>Theories of Society</italic>. Charles Loomis was an early Parsons student who had creatively strayed from the master’s path, deciding to compare his teacher’s idea with those of Kingsley Davis, Robert Merton, and Robin Williams (all former Parsons students), plus chapters on George Homans and Pitirim Sorokin (both Parsons’ Harvard colleagues), and another on Howard Paul Becker, who was free of any Harvard connections. Loomis’ own “processually articulated structural model,” imputed to be an improvement on Parsons’ theorizing, is compared with the work of the seven others writers. “The study of Charles and Zona Loomis negates rather than supports Parsons’ contention of a practically universal consensus on his central principles. These claims do not stand up when confronted with non-Parsonsian theories” (p. 264).</p>
<p>Wagner’s estimate of the Parsons volume itself is briefer than his treatment of the Loomises, but he does compare Parsons with Shils in a revealing way: “Parsons sees ‘the classics’ of sociology as stepping stones to his theoretical system. Shils returns to them because “they had more insight and understanding of fundamental things than practically any living sociologists, and their ideas have not yet been widely absorbed” (<italic>ibid</italic>.). This is the implication of all such books, but it is good that Shils stated it without hesitating to make it known.</p>
<p>When The Free Press in 1965 reissued <italic>Theories of Society</italic> in a cheaper one-volume edition “for students,” <italic>Comparative Education</italic> asked Edmund King in England to write about it (June 1966). He begins: “This massive tome of weighty scholarship. . . represents the kind of individual American thoroughness and assiduous teamwork that can make other countries’ academic life seem amateurish. . . this book is a ‘knock-out’” (pp. 235-36). After singing the book’s praises at some length, he concludes, “it is a most valuable book for any comparative study related to social progress or prediction. . . and it is an essential corrective to any misplaced attempt to prescribe methodologies or orthodoxy of content” (p. 237).</p>
<p>From the blanket dismissal by Gross to the warm embrace of King, <italic>Theories of Society</italic> summoned up in its reviewers a range of expressed sentiment that mimicked its gigantic scope, providing enough material either to please or anger practically any reader. A fine piece of intellectual analysis could be created comparing the contents of these two linked volumes from 1961 with any of the currently available theory readers or textbooks, in order to see precisely what we have lost and what we have gained in the meantime. Are we advancing toward sociological wisdom unavailable to the men (<italic>sic</italic>) who peopled Parsons’ imagination and that of his three colleagues, or have we regressed in our understanding of social processes? It remains an empirical question awaiting a convincing answer.</p>
