<p><bold>Background:</bold> A better understanding of the workplace difficulties experienced by people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) may be critical to developing appropriate vocational and rehabilitative programs.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> We aimed to assess the factor structure, internal consistency and validity of the new Multiple Sclerosis Work Difficulties Questionnaire (MSWDQ).</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Work difficulty items were developed and reviewed by a panel of experts. Using the MSWDQ, cross-sectional self-report data of work difficulties were obtained in addition to employment status and MS disease information, in a community-based sample of 189 PwMS.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Exploratory Maximum Likelihood Factor Analysis on the draft questionnaire yielded 50 items measuring 12 factors. Subscale internal consistencies ranged from 0.74 to 0.92, indicating adequate to excellent internal consistency reliability. The MSWDQ explained 40% of the variance in reduced work hours since diagnosis, 40% of the variance in expectations about withdrawing from work, 34% of the variance in expectations about reducing work hours, and 39% of the variance in expectations about changing type of work due to MS.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The MSWDQ is a valid and internally reliable measure of workplace difficulties in PwMS. Physical difficulties, as well as cognitive and psychological difficulties were important predictors of workplace outcomes and expectations about future employment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) to maintain their employment is of increasing concern. Paid work is known to play a key role in a person’s overall quality of life,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511431724">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511431724"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511431724">3</xref></sup> and it is a salient life issue for PwMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511431724">4</xref></sup> It is therefore important to understand the unique challenges faced by PwMS in the workplace, and how these challenges might be addressed to prevent premature withdrawal from paid work.</p>
<p>The ongoing problems of employment in PwMS have been highlighted in recent studies indicating that unemployment rates remain unacceptably high, with some estimates exceeding 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511431724">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511431724">6</xref></sup> Discordance between employment and other economic trends also suggest there is still much to be accomplished in assisting PwMS to maintain their employment. A recent Australian longitudinal study demonstrated that from 2004–2007, a time of relative economic prosperity with falling unemployment rates in the general population, the employment rate in PwMS declined by a net 5.4%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511431724">5</xref></sup> A similar loss of employment has been observed longitudinally in the USA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511431724">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many studies have examined the types of factors which may influence whether a person with MS is employed or not,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511431724">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511431724"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511431724"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511431724"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511431724"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511431724"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511431724"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511431724"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511431724"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511431724"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511431724"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511431724">16</xref></sup> particularly to inform vocational and rehabilitative programs which assist with employment retention. For instance, the physical symptoms of MS (e.g. self-reported mobility dysfunction, visual difficulties, fatigue, pain, balance problems)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511431724">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511431724">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511431724">10</xref></sup> and other disease-related factors (e.g. MS type, disability, disease duration)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511431724">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511431724"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511431724">12</xref></sup> have been found to predict employment status. Demographic factors (e.g. age, gender, education, spouse’s income) have also variably been found to predict employment status in PwMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511431724">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511431724">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511431724">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511431724"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511431724">14</xref></sup> However, these disease-related and demographic factors when combined appear to account for only a small proportion of the variance in employment status in PwMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511431724">8</xref></sup> Other factors which have been explored and found to be predictive of employment outcomes in some studies include job characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511431724">15</xref></sup> and neuropsychological symptoms of MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511431724">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511431724">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, few studies have examined the impact of these factors in the workplace, or how they might be subjectively perceived by PwMS, especially the extent to which MS symptoms and other disease-related limitations are perceived to be problematic in the workplace. Examining a person’s subjective appraisal of their difficulties in the workplace is important for several reasons. First, the difficulties may be unique to the workplace environment and may not be applicable to other settings, such as social settings. Second, a person’s perception of their work difficulties may be different from their actual difficulties;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511431724">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511431724"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511431724"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511431724">20</xref></sup> for example, they may perceive substantial difficulties in thinking and concentrating, despite having little objective evidence of cognitive impairment. Finally, the subjective difficulties may prove to be more important in predicting departure from work than objectively defined difficulties (e.g. disability level). Thus, an examination of these difficulties will improve our understanding of the reasons some PwMS give up work, and help facilitate the development of strategies to retain PwMS in paid employment.</p>
<p>Several studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511431724">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511431724">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511431724"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511431724">23</xref></sup> have examined subjective difficulties in the workplace, although a number of limitations exist in these studies; for example, only a restricted range of difficulties has been assessed, measures that were not specific or unique to workplace problems in PwMS have been used, and/or the difficulties have been poorly quantified, or were not psychometrically assessed. Nonetheless, Simmons et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511431724">5</xref></sup> have indicated that the ineffective management of MS symptoms in the workplace was the most common reason for employment loss and perceived risk of employment loss. In addition, Uccelli et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511431724">23</xref></sup> assessed 12 factors that PwMS believed contributed to their employment status, including MS-related symptoms, workplace environment, attitudes towards work, attitudes of others, financial considerations, and personal considerations, and all 12 categories were shown to strongly predict employment status in PwMS. However, no psychometric evaluation of their scale was conducted, and only one item measured cognition and one measured fatigue.</p>
<p>Cognition, whether objectively or subjectively assessed, has been found to predict employment status in PwMS, independent of physical MS symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511431724">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511431724">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511431724"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511431724">26</xref></sup> Thus, a more thorough examination of the cognitive changes typically experienced by PwMS (e.g. memory, planning, concentration, problem solving) may lead to the better prediction of workplace outcomes. Thus, in this study, we will explore the types of workplace difficulties experienced by PwMS in more detail, including assessments of physical and cognitive MS symptoms, and subjective workplace difficulties, using a new scale, the MS Work Difficulties Questionnaire (MSWDQ).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1352458511431724">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Institutional Review Board approval was gained to conduct all aspects of the study. Participants were 198 Australian community-derived PwMS aged between 26 and 65 years. Of these, nine cases were deleted due to excessive missing data, leaving 189 cases, including 49 males and 140 females. Most PwMS were from the eastern Australian States (63% NSW/ACT, 27% QLD, 9% Vic, 1% SA/WA). More than one-half were in paid employment (<italic>n</italic> = 102, 46 full time, 56 part time). Of those not in paid employment, the average time since last paid employment was 4.68 years (SD = 4.17).</p>
<p>Study participants were recruited through invitation letters sent to a random selection of 500 PwMS registered with the ACT/NSW/VIC MS Society (50%), advertisements placed in MS newsletters (45%), the MS Research Australia Clinical Trials Register (4%), and direct referrals from neurologists (1%). Exclusion criteria included being unable to read or speak English, and an independent diagnosis of a psychotic disorder (e.g. bipolar disorder) or acute organic brain syndrome (e.g. delirium). Additional demographic information, stratified by employment status, is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511431724">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>A questionnaire asking about demographics, MS disease characteristics, employment, and work difficulties was mailed to the participants. Completed surveys were returned by mail or handed to the researcher (CH) in person. An interview was later conducted by telephone or in person to clarify MS diagnosis and medical history.</p>

<sec id="section5-1352458511431724">
<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-1352458511431724">
<title>Employment measures</title>
<p>Participants were asked to indicate current employment status, if their work hours had reduced since diagnosis due to their MS, and if so, the proportion of this reduction. Response options included: there has been a small reduction (i.e. around 25%), there has been a moderate reduction (i.e. around 50%), there has been a large reduction (i.e., around 75%), or I no longer work at all (i.e. a 100% reduction). Participants were also asked whether their type of work had changed since diagnosis (yes, no, unsure). Currently employed people were asked about their future employment expectations, including how likely it is they would give up work entirely, reduce work hours, or change the type of work due to MS. Response options for these expectations were made on 5-point Likert scales, ranging from 0 (very unlikely) to 4 (very likely).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1352458511431724">
<title>MS Work Difficulties Questionnaire</title>
<p>Initial scale development was conducted after an extensive examination of the literature on employment difficulties in PwMS, with additional items related to cognitive difficulties in MS. Two groups assisted with initial scale development, using the content validation guidelines of Haynes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511431724">27</xref></sup> and Clark and Watson.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458511431724">28</xref></sup> The two groups comprised (1) relevant experts: three MS clinicians (neuropsychologist, occupational therapist, nurse) and an MS employment researcher, who were asked to qualitatively review the scale items, which were refined in line with this feedback; and (2) the 189 PwMS who participated in this study, with their item responses used to assess the item’s psychometric properties.</p>
<p>In total, 123 items comprehensively assessed difficulties in cognition (e.g. learning, prospective memory, concentration), physical functioning (e.g. mobility, bladder/bowel functioning, fine motor control), finance and work security, stress, self-esteem and social interaction, and work environment in the study, and tapped all previously described theoretical domains. Participants provided ratings on 5-point Likert scales (never, rarely, sometimes, often, almost always) as to how frequently they had experienced each workplace difficulty during the past 4 weeks of their current or most recent job. A full list of MSWDQ items is available from the authors.</p>
<p>The Self-Reported Disease Steps Scale (SRDSS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458511431724">29</xref></sup> and various subscales from the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458511431724">30</xref></sup> were used to assess construct validity, that is, the extent to which the MSWDQ subscales reflects the domains of interest; for example, that workplace inaccessibility is positively related to the level of physical disability as measured by the SRDSS. Details of these measures, including a brief overview of current concepts in questionnaire validation, are included in the online supplementary material.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section8-1352458511431724">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>To construct the scale, MSWDQ work difficulty items were subjected to a Maximum Likelihood Factor Analysis (i.e. exploratory factor analysis, EFA) using SPSS (Version 17). EFA is a method of item reduction that enables a more parsimonious conceptual understanding of observed variables to be obtained by determining the number and nature of underlying latent variables or factors (i.e. unobserved variables that are inferred by similarly grouped observed variables).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511431724">31</xref></sup> It can play a crucial role in developing theory and ensuring the unidimensionality and discriminant validity of questionnaires,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458511431724">28</xref></sup> in this case that the work difficulty items contained within each MSWDQ subscale are measuring the same underlying construct, and that the construct that each subscale measures is relatively unique. Internal consistency reliability of the MSWDQ subscales was examined using Cronbach’s alpha,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511431724">32</xref></sup> with values above 0.70 and 0.80 representing acceptable and excellent internal consistency, respectively.</p>
<p>To examine the MSWDQ’s concurrent validity, standard <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare the mean subscale values of each employment status group, and multiple regression analyses assessed the relationship between subscale scores and various employment outcome variables. Assumptions of normality, linearity, homoscedasticity, and independence of residuals were met. Pearson’s correlation coefficients are reported to identify relationships between the subscales and outcome variables. Spearman’s Rho coefficients were calculated for variables with skewed distributions, but since no meaningful difference were apparent in the results, only Pearson’s correlations are reported here. Missing data (&lt; 5% in each variable) were replaced by values imputed using the expectation maximization algorithm in SPSS’s Missing Value Analysis.</p>

<p>EFA analysis revealed a final 12-factor solution comprising 50 items. The 50-item questionnaire is presented as an appendix to this paper. See online supplementary material for detailed EFA analysis results, correlations between factors, and detailed scoring information. The factors were named: general cognitive difficulties (Cronbach’s α = 0.92), prospective memory difficulties (α = 0.89), fatigue (α = 0.87), non-supportive workplace (α = 0.89), low self-esteem (α = 0.82), interpersonal difficulties (α = 0.78), movement/mobility difficulties (α = 0.91), bladder/bowel difficulties (α = 0.85), pain/temperature difficulties (α = 0.74), workplace inaccessibility (α = 0.83), work/home balance difficulties (α = 0.84), and financial security concerns (α = 0.82).</p>

<title>Scale construction</title>
<p>To enable cross-comparison between work difficulty domains, work difficulty subscale scores were computed as a percentage by summing observed item scores and dividing this by the total possible item scores in each subscale then multiplying this value by 100 (to give a maximum total score in each subscale of 100). Total MSWDQ scores were computed by the averaging subscale scores that defined the overall scale.</p>
<p>Concurrent validity of the MSWDQ, or the extent to which the MSWDQ predicts current work outcomes, was assessed by computing <italic>t</italic>-test comparisons on mean subscale scores between PwMS groups in paid employment and those not in paid employment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458511431724">Table 2</xref>). The MSWDQ total score and subscale scores differentiated between PwMS in paid employment and those who were not, with the exception of the bladder/bowel difficulties and financial security concerns subscales. A standard multiple regression examining associations between the 12 MSWDQ subscales and time since last employed, in PwMS who were not in paid employment, was not significant [<italic>F</italic>(12, 73) = 1.59, <italic>p</italic> = 0.12], suggesting that non-working participant responses were not influenced by the time they had spent out of work.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to develop and validate a new measure of workplace difficulties in PwMS, the MSWDQ. Exploratory Maximum Likelihood Factor Analysis indicated the presence of 12 latent variables in the scale which, when combined, accounted for about 40% of the variance in important work outcomes. These latent variables included general cognitive difficulties, prospective memory difficulties, fatigue, movement/mobility difficulties, workplace inaccessibility, pain/temperature difficulties, bladder/bowel difficulties, low self-esteem, interpersonal difficulties, non-supportive workplace, work/home balance difficulties, and financial security concerns. Cronbach’s alpha values for the 12 latent variables ranged from 0.74–0.92, reflecting adequate to excellent internal consistencies.</p>
<p>The MSWDQ showed good concurrent validity in relation to past withdrawal from work. In particular, most subscales were able to differentiate between currently employed and unemployed participants, and most were related to a reduction in work hours since diagnosis. In relation to the changed type of work since diagnosis, only movement/ mobility difficulties and pain/temperature difficulties were associated with this variable, suggesting that physical difficulties may impact more on the type of work performed, than cognitive, psychosocial or work-related issues.</p>
<p>In currently employed PwMS, the MSWDQ subscales were also associated with future work expectations, a variable which has not been adequately examined in previous MS employment research. All subscales, with the exception of a non-supportive workplace, were related to expectations about reducing work hours. However, physical difficulty subscales (i.e. movement/mobility difficulties, workplace inaccessibility) appeared to contribute more to expectations about withdrawing from work entirely, whereas cognitive or psychological difficulties (i.e. general cognitive difficulties, prospective memory difficulties, fatigue, low self-esteem, interpersonal difficulties), and external work influences (i.e. work/home difficulties, finances) contributed more to variation in expectations about changing the type of work performed.</p>
<p>In summary, the factors associated with current work outcomes and expectations about future work outcomes were different. In general, physical, psychological and cognitive workplace difficulties were strongly associated with prior and future assessments of withdrawing from work. However, difficulties relating to external work factors (e.g. financial concerns, home/work balance difficulties) were more strongly associated with future expectations of reducing work hours, but not past reductions in work hours. That is, PwMS in paid employment expected that external work factors may be important in determining the longevity of their future work, although based on the results of people who had already left the workplace this did not appear to be the case. Disparate results were also detected in relation to expectancies of changing the type of work and prior changed type of work. That is, only physical difficulties were associated with previously changed type of work, although cognitive, psychological and external work difficulties were also associated with expectations about changing type of work.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest the fears of PwMS about the potential impact of external work factors (e.g. work/life balance) in reducing their work hours, or the impact of these and psychological and cognitive difficulties on the type of work they do, may be unfounded. However, alternatively, the results may reflect that the participants had not yet made changes in their workplace they felt were necessary, because of other considerations such as perceived job instability, financial restrictions and so on. Nonetheless, future research is required to more clearly ascertain the nature of the gap between employment expectations and actual employment outcomes.</p>
<p>Previous research on work outcomes in PwMS has indicated that various factors may affect whether a person is employed or not. These include, but are not limited to, the extent of physical symptoms and level of cognitive functioning,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511431724">16</xref></sup> disease characteristics such as disease duration or MS type,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511431724">12</xref></sup> and demographic factors such as age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511431724">26</xref></sup> The present results extend this MS workplace literature several ways. First, they demonstrate that perceived difficulties in the workplace are not only an important determinant of employment status, but they also influence the <italic>extent</italic> to which a person with MS withdraws from the workplace. Notably, the MSWDQ accounted for a considerable 40% of the variance in the proportion of work hours reduced since diagnosis. Examining factors that influence a person’s decision to reduce their work hours as opposed to withdrawing from work entirely is an important strength of this study, since it acknowledges the impact of MS on more subtle changing work profiles that may otherwise not be identifiable using the dichotomous work status variable (i.e. employed vs. not employed).</p>
<p>Second, this present study additionally examined perceived cognitive difficulties and fatigue in relation to important work outcomes. Prior studies have examined perceived cognitive difficulties and fatigue in relation to workplace difficulties in PwMS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511431724">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511431724">23</xref></sup> but the coverage of these difficulties was inadequate. Importantly, in this study, perceived cognitive difficulties and fatigue at work were associated with actual withdrawal from work, and expectations about changing their type of work in the future. This is an important finding, as it suggests that perceptions of cognitive difficulties and fatigue in PwMS may have been just as important as perceptions of physical difficulties in determining their retention in the workplace.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to note that subjective prospective memory impairment emerged as a separate construct to other cognitive difficulties in the analyses. Prospective memory refers to an ability to remember to perform an intended action at a certain time or in response to a specific cue in the future (e.g. remembering an appointment time);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458511431724">33</xref></sup> that is, it involves recalling the task and recalling and organizing the appropriate time in which the task needs to take place.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1352458511431724">34</xref></sup> It differs from retrospective memory (i.e. remembering past events) in that it does not involve remembering things in response to an explicit request.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1352458511431724">35</xref></sup> Thus, the results of this study suggest that PwMS may be capable of distinguishing this ability, which is a commonly used memory function,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1352458511431724">36</xref></sup> especially in the workplace, from other cognitive abilities.</p>
<p>Finally, the MSWDQ was determined to be a valid and reliable measure of work difficulties that can be used to predict work outcomes. Prior measures of work difficulties and employment status in PwMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1352458511431724">37</xref></sup> have not been adequately psychometrically tested, few empirical studies have been conducted, and/or few relevant work outcomes were assessed, with many prior studies of perceived work difficulties failing to make any predictions at all about work outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511431724">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511431724">22</xref></sup> Indeed, it is also likely that these perceptions influence work outcomes independently of their level of actual difficulties. For example, previous research indicates little or no relationship between perceived cognition and actual cognition in PwMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1352458511431724">35</xref></sup> For these reasons, the MSWDQ is a promising tool to examine the impact of MS in the workplace in conjunction with other more objective MS-related measures such as MS type or level of disability.</p>
<sec id="section13-1352458511431724">
<title>Study limitations</title>
<p>These results should be interpreted with caution given several study limitations. First, the unemployed participants provided retrospective reports of their perceived work difficulties, whereas employed participants were able to provide current reports of these difficulties, perhaps contributing to some bias in the recall of past work difficulties, especially in some participants with objective difficulties in long-term memory (for review see Amato et al.).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458511431724">38</xref></sup> Thus, prospective longitudinal analysis is required to more closely assess changes in actual and perceived cognition. Second, factors which may have contributed to a positive work environment (e.g. stable MS symptoms, psychological support, access to rehabilitation, limited distractions, flexible work schedule, adequate temperature, understanding from co-workers, support of family)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511431724">23</xref></sup> were not examined in this study; an investigation of the potential for these factors to buffer against the impact of MS and reduce workplace difficulties may be pertinent. The influence of other factors such as actual difficulties and depression or anxiety on the relationship between perceived workplace difficulties and work outcomes also remains to be determined in future research.</p>
<p>Third, much of the information for the study was collected from a relatively restricted sample of PwMS residing the eastern states of Australia; it is unclear to what extent the MSWDQ is applicable to other populations and settings (i.e. external validity). Future research is required to fully assess its usefulness in other contexts. Fourth, while MSWDQ construction involved using quantitative methods to broadly assess the many perceptions that PwMS have of their difficulties in the workplace, the scale items trialed were developed using existing literature and expert review rather than exploratory methods involving direct consultation (i.e. interviews) with PwMS. This approach assumes that the difficulties which are important to PwMS were indeed included in this study. Finally, the cross-sectional nature of this study precludes any causal inferences being drawn, thus, the research does not enable one to conclude that perceived workplace difficulties have caused the work outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1352458511431724">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Many PwMS leave the workplace within a few years of being diagnosed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1352458511431724">39</xref></sup> In this study, the MSWDQ was shown to be an internally reliable and valid 12-component measure of workplace difficulties in PwMS that can predict current work outcomes and future employment expectations. Important strengths of the scale are that it explores workplace difficulties that are unique to PwMS, and more thoroughly assesses cognitive function and fatigue. Together, these results may assist clinicians to better understand their patients’ perceptions of workplace difficulties, and the role these may play in contributing to their departure from work, and other important work outcomes. Such an understanding may be crucial in facilitating the development of successful vocational rehabilitation programs for PwMS.</p>
