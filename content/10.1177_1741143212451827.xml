<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Welcome to this special 40th Anniversary Edition of <italic>Educational Management Administration &amp; Leadership</italic>. This issue features review papers from leading academics on six of the major and enduring themes in our field, and is timed to coincide with the 40th Anniversary of BELMAS (British Educational Leadership, Management and Administration Society), which owns the journal. <italic>EMAL</italic>’s first issue was published in June 1972 and it was initially published only twice a year, with the title of ‘Educational Administration’. It expanded to three issues a year in 1982, four in 1990 and six in 2009.</p>
<p>BELMAS was founded just after the journal, an anomaly that is explained partly by the lead time taken to set up the Society, following initial discussions in 1970 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143212451827">Glatter, 2004</xref>). This joint initiative may also be regarded as the start of the academic field of educational leadership and management in the UK. The articles in the journal may also be seen as a barometer for the changing emphases within the field over this 40 year period. We are grateful to Derek Glover, who has prepared a full content analysis of all EMAL volumes, to underpin this extended editorial. The analysis codes articles by decade, using four criteria:</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741143212451827">Table 1</xref> shows that, in each decade, the largest number of articles do not relate to a specific sector. This reflects the attention paid to theory and conceptual analysis. It also shows sustained interest in generic issues, such as parental involvement, teacher appraisal and governance, particularly over the past 20 years. Articles on primary schools reached a peak in the third decade, then declined, and we should be pleased to receive more articles focused on this sector. Those with a secondary focus peaked in the second decade, then declined, before increasing again in the fourth decade. The numbers of further and higher sector articles have been fairly consistent with a peak for the former in the second decade. The decline in local authority sector articles from 1992 is almost certainly linked to the advent of self-management, following the Education Reform Act 1988. The overall growth in papers reflects the increased number of issues per volume, noted above.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741143212451827">Table 2</xref> shows that, in the initial period, when the field was becoming established, conceptual papers dominated. For the past three decades, however, empirical papers have been in the majority as research into educational leadership and management has grown. Literature reviews have increased but they still comprise less than 10 per cent of all articles. The number of policy analyses has remained fairly stable with a modest increase in the past decade. We should be pleased to receive more conceptual papers as the journal enters its fifth decade.</p>

<title>Context</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741143212451827">Table 3</xref> provides a breakdown of the national context of articles.</p>
<p>In the first 20 years of the journal, UK articles dominated. Subsequently, the number of international articles has grown, especially during the past decade. As a UK-based journal, <italic>EMAL </italic>will always seek to publish high quality articles from all four countries in the UK. However, the growth of international articles reflects a deliberate strategy to position <italic>EMAL </italic>as the preferred outlet for international, as well as UK-based, authors. <italic>EMAL </italic>was included in the prestigious Index of Social Sciences (ISI) in 2011, further enhancing its global appeal. The increase in articles unrelated to national contexts reflects the development of theory and its generic application to educational settings.</p>

<p>The detailed breakdown of the subject content of <italic>EMAL </italic>over the past four decades illustrates the ebb and flow of interest in specific topics. Substantial growth is evident in the following areas.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Leadership development</italic>, as debate about the need for specific preparation for leaders has grown. Tim Simkins’s article, in this issue, traces this pattern</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Gender and diversity</italic>, as recognition of the need to address imbalances in the demography of leaders has taken root. Marianne Coleman’s article, in this issue, examines this issue and shows how much this aspect of the field has changed since an article entitled ‘a Head<italic>master</italic> replies’ appeared in the second issue of the journal.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Culture and values</italic>, as a shift away from rational management, has become apparent. Jacky Lumby’s article, in this issue, explores this trend.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Governance,</italic> as self-management has become the norm in many countries. There was a special edition on this theme, edited by Chris James, Steve Brammer and Mike Fertig, in 2011.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Appraisal</italic>, as many countries have introduced performance management schemes.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Research concepts and methodology</italic>, as the field has reflected on how to build reliable and valid research to underpin policy and practice. There was a special edition on this theme, edited by Jacky Lumby, Nick Foskett and Brian Fidler, in 2005.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Middle management and leadership</italic>, as recognition that leadership is not just headship, has grown. This links to notions of distributed leadership, examined in Megan Crawford’s article, in this issue.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Largely because of the growth in the number of papers each year, few topics have seen a decline. One exception, perhaps surprisingly, is inspection, while there has also been reduced attention to issues of curriculum, teaching and learning. Given the contemporary interest in instructional leadership, and leadership for learning, a reduction in the number of articles on this theme is also unexpected.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1741143212451827">Table 5</xref> shows that special issues were occasional features of the journal in the first two decades, but they have become more frequent from the 1990s and have been regular annual features since 2004. There is insufficient space to reprise all these special issues but comments about a few of them would be appropriate. The issue on micropolitics in 1982 shows the significance of this management model in the 1980s, linked to the important work of Eric Hoyle. Consecutive special features on Chris Hodgkinson and Thomas Barr Greenfield are the only examples of issues devoted to academic leaders of the field. The 2004 issue on the National College for School Leadership was an early opportunity to appraise the work of this innovative body. The Education Reform Act is the most important piece of educational legislation in the UK since the Second World War and this was commemorated with a Special Issue 20 years after the Act. Allan Walker and Philip Hallinger will be editing a Special Issue on Leadership Preparation and Development next year (volume 41(3)).</p>

Alongside the academic equivalent of ‘one hit wonders’ are prolific authors, who have influenced the field, often in profound ways. Sadly, some of these pioneers are no longer with us, including George Baron, Ray Bolam, Valerie Hall, Meredydd Hughes and Harry Tomlinson, who all died in the 21st century. BELMAS Council vice-presidents Ron Glatter, Peter Ribbins and Rene Saran are among the authors who began contributing to the journal in the 1970s. <italic>EMAL </italic>editor Tony Bush’s first contribution was in 1984.</p>

<title>The Special Issue</title>
<p>Compiling a Special Issue to reflect 40 years of the journal is no easy task. The Editorial Board identified six topics that have been of enduring significance during the past 40 years, and invited leading authors to prepare overview articles on these themes, drawing from <italic>EMAL </italic>articles and other sources. We believe that the articles in this special issue will be a valuable resource for academics, practitioners and research students.</p>
<p>The opening article, by former <italic>EMAL </italic>editor Peter Ribbins and Brian Sherratt, focuses on policymaking in England. Leaders and managers operate within a policy framework, which influences, and may determine, how they operate. The authors focus specifically on the role of the permanent secretary, the top civil servant in the English (and formerly the UK) Department of Education. They rehearse the relationship between policy, and leadership and management, and base their discussion within a humanistic and interpretive perspective. The note the often uneasy connections between senior officials and politicians and identify five modes of ‘centrism’, linked to notions of policy continuity. They also provide an extended discussion of the origins of the Education Reform Act 1988 (ERA), the subject of a special edition of <italic>EMAL </italic>in 2008, as we note above. Policy can be understood as one of the four main building blocks of educational leadership and management, alongside research, theory and practice, and this paper provides a valuable contribution to our understanding of this important relationship.</p>
<p>In the second article, Ron Glatter examines the twin concepts of autonomy and accountability, enduring themes, which have become more potent in the post-ERA context, as Ron notes in his opening paragraph. He provides an insightful historical overview, including a full report on the 1975 BEAS (the predecessor to BELMAS) conference in Cardiff, and a discussion of the rapid advance of a relatively new type of school, called academies, which are independent of local authority control. The author notes that autonomy is a subtle concept, varying according to context, activity and level. He notes the disproportionate influence of the small independent sector in England, a point reinforced by the Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, in May 2012. He comments that autonomy is exercised within a ‘high stakes accountability framework’, including inspections and publication of examination and test results. The author concludes, with former Secretary of State Kenneth Baker, that there is a need for intermediate bodies, between schools and central government.</p>
<p>Jacky Lumby, in the third article, addresses the nature of organizational culture, one of the most powerful and frequently used concepts in the educational leadership literature. She charts the disciplinary underpinnings of culture, and the ‘ideological debate’, which has unfolded over time. She reports on the different definitions of this concept, but claims that there is ‘infrequent deep engagement’ with how culture might be understood. She notes that educational leaders reflect both global pressures and local imperatives, and comments on the significance of sub-cultures. She discusses the extent to which leaders can influence culture and concludes that the concept may be ‘inevitably and continuously disputed’.</p>
<p>The next article, by Marianne Coleman, discusses the relationship between leadership and diversity. She notes the wide scope of the concept, including gender, ethnicity, religious affiliations, disability, social class, and sexual orientation, and the tendency to apply stereotypes to leadership; white, male, heterosexual, middle class and middle aged. She links diversity to human rights, and to social justice, and comments on the different global policy contexts and their impact on diversity. She reports on the ways in which diversity issues have featured in <italic>EMAL</italic>, with gender issues dominating until issues of ethnicity began to appear in the 21st century. She discusses the under-representation of women and BME leaders, and the key role of ‘gatekeepers’ in ‘blocking appointments’. She comments on several ‘debates around diversity’, and concludes that ‘mainstreaming of diversity’ is rare.</p>
<p>The field of educational leadership is replete with theories or models, purporting to explain, or to advocate, specific leadership approaches. In the early phases of the field, these focused largely on individual leaders, notably principals and headteachers, who were usually expected to operate within a bureaucratic framework, with top-down leadership and positional authority. More recently, there has been greater interest in shared leadership, through models such as collegiality and participative leadership. The fifth article, by Megan Crawford, explores the relationship between solo and distributed leadership, currently the most favoured normative model. She notes that the interest in distributed leadership arose out of dissatisfaction with the solo model, and that it became particularly significant in England, partly because of the influence of the National College for School Leadership (NCSL). She reviews several contributions to the discussion of distributed leadership in <italic>EMAL</italic>, all of which were published in the 21st century. She cautions that this concept has ‘strong rhetorical pull’, and concludes that ‘if an organization is to be dynamic, then it needs leadership flowing through it’.</p>
<p>There has been extended discussion about the best ways to lead and manage, illustrated by numerous models, of which distributed leadership is currently strongly favoured, as we note above. However, less attention has been given to how leadership capability should be developed. Tim Simkins, in the final article, examines the ways in which this theme has been addressed over the past 40 years. He divides his analysis into three eras, those of ‘administration’, ‘management’ and ‘leadership, linked to the evolving title of the journal. The first phase was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143212451827">Bolam (2004</xref>) as that of ad hoc provision, often by universities and what were then described as local education authorities. During the second period, the government became increasingly involved, notably following the establishment of the Teacher Training Agency in 1994, which introduced provision for current and aspiring headteachers. The latter, the National Professional Qualification for Headship (NPQH), was introduced in 1997 and is still of national significance in 2012, despite losing its mandatory status earlier in the year. The era of leadership is reflected most strongly in the creation of the NCSL, with its leadership development framework. The author discusses three theoretical perspectives; functional, constructivist and critical, and claims that most writing on leadership and management development ‘has accepted the essentially functionalist assumptions’. He concludes that the increasing centralization of provision, through the NCSL, significantly weakens other players, such as universities and local authorities.</p>
<p>The six articles in this Special Edition collectively provide a longitudinal overview of major themes in educational leadership and management over the 40 year life of the journal, in the UK and beyond. We hope and believe that the next 40 years will offer the potential for a similar extended treatment of major themes as our field continues to develop and evolve.</p>
