<title>Proposal</title>
<p>The development of injectable therapies – interferonβ1 (IFN) and glatiramer acetate (GA) – in the mid 1990s ushered in a new era in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment. Prior to that time, MS was often considered untreatable, with MS patient care focusing on symptom management. The 30% reduction in the rate of clinical relapses observed with injectable therapies was modest, but this was 30% more than previously available. The term ‘platform therapy’ entered the MS lexicon, and consensus statements sprouted up recommending patients with relapsing MS be treated with these injectable therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512469700">1</xref></sup> Early and persistent treatment with injectable MS therapies became standard management throughout MS care. In the more than 15 years since their approval, long-term safety of these therapies has been extraordinary strong, with few identified serious long-term risks of continued therapy.</p>
<p>However, flu-like side-effects typically persist with IFN and often become more troublesome as patients transition into progressive MS. It is not uncommon to hear patients report 1–2 days of fatigue and weakness following each IFN injection. Skin reactions typically persist with subcutaneous injections, and lipoatrophy is quite common with long-term use of GA. Skin induration and lipoatrophy often leave only a couple of remaining sites for injection administration. These common side-effects and dislike of injections contribute to injection fatigue, non-adherence, and long-term non-persistence with both IFN and GA. One study of over 6000 patients with MS starting injectable treatment found a 45% discontinuation rate over only 18 months, which rose as high as 67% depending upon the injectable therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512469700">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Around the same time that injectables were approved, dramatic advances in basic neuroimmunology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) converged to enable screening of potential anti-inflammatory therapies through short-term, imaging-driven Phase II trials. This efficient development process accelerated the pathway to regulatory review for natalizumab, fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, and laquinimod. These new therapies have ushered in a new era of MS therapies – an era with improved efficacy, greater tolerability, more acceptable routes of administration, and very good safety.</p>
<p>The first approved oral disease-modifying therapy was fingolimod, which was found to reduce annualized relapse rate by 48–54% and new MRI lesions by 70–82%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512469700">3</xref></sup> A head-to-head comparison with one IFN preparation found fingolimod to have superior efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512469700">4</xref></sup> Risks of fingolimod include bradyarrhythmias at the time of treatment initiation, macular edema and some infections. The absence of risk factors such as diabetes, cardiac history, and certain medications help identify patients who are at significantly lower risk for these complications. Fingolimod’s start-up and initial monitoring can be cumbersome, but long-term safety and tolerability has been very good.</p>
<p>Teriflunomide was the second oral MS therapy, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2012. Teriflunomide reduced annualized relapse rate by 31–36% compared with placebo,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512469700">5</xref></sup> and performed similarly to an injectable when evaluated head-to-head. Aside from the risks of hepatic irritation (mostly during the first months of treatment), alopecia, and teratogenicity, teriflunomide is quite well tolerated, with low rates of treatment discontinuation due to side-effects. Teriflunomide is the active metabolite of leflunomide, for which there is 15 years of safety experience in over a half million rheumatoid arthritis patients.</p>
<p>Dimethyl fumarate (also called BG-12) is a third oral MS therapy. The twice-daily dosing regimen reduced annualized relapse rate by 44–53% and new MRI lesions by 71–90%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512469700">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512469700">7</xref></sup> Dimethyl fumarate also has a strong tolerability profile, with flushing and gastrointestinal symptoms the main side-effects. Safety has been very good, and like the other oral therapies, there is no observed increased rate of opportunistic infections or cancers. Dimethyl fumarate is very similar to the fumaric acid preparation Fumaderm, which has been approved in Germany for psoriasis since 1994, providing substantial safety experience.</p>
<p>Based upon the results from Phase III trials, these new oral therapies appear to be at least as effective (teriflunomide) or more effective (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate) than the platform injectables. Tolerability is excellent, and the oral route of administration is understandably preferred by patients over injection. Safety issues in the 2-year trials have been rare, and open-label Phase IV observation studies to date have not identified new long-term safety problems. Global safety vigilance will continue for years to come. Importantly, both teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate are closely related to approved therapies with over 15 years of strong safety experience in humans.</p>
<p>In addition, with the effective risk-stratification for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512469700">8</xref></sup> there is an argument for using natalizumab as a first-line treatment in selected high-risk patients. For an individual patient, risk stratification for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is not static but can change over time. Nonetheless, the very low risk of PML in those with favorable risk profiles makes natalizumab a reasonable option for some patients very early in their disease course.</p>
<p>Altogether, the excellent efficacy, safety, and tolerability profiles of new MS therapies suggests that it is time to abandon the old <italic>injectable</italic> platform therapies and replace them with new <italic>oral</italic> platform therapies as first-line treatment for relapsing MS. The profound axonal transection in tissues with active inflammation as well as marked brain atrophy after even a single clinical relapse suggests an urgent need to use effective therapies early in the course of MS. The oral route of administration will likely lead to higher adherence and long-term persistence than seen with injectable therapies. Safety vigilance with these new therapies should continue, spurred on by mandatory regulatory requirements. Nonetheless, we should not be ossified by perpetual worry regarding hypothetical very long-term (i.e. &gt;2–3 years) complications from oral therapies. The theoretical risks of yet-to-be-demonstrated very long-term complications are not sufficiently compelling to ignore the superior efficacy–risk profile with oral therapies and their strong patient preference.</p>
