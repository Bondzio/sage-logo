<abstract>
<p>Teachers of students with moderate and severe disabilities must possess the skills and knowledge to address a unique set of needs and challenges. These may include, but are not limited to, management of challenging behaviors, performance of health-related procedures, use of assistive technology, and instruction using evidence-based strategies. This article describes the process undertaken by a higher education consortium of faculty with expertise in low incidence disabilities from across institutions of higher education in Kentucky to address the challenge of supporting 1st year teachers (i.e., interns) when assigned mentors and administrators who do not have expertise in this area. This consortium addressed this challenge by creating two documents: (a) an alignment of state standards to professional standards and (b) an addendum to the state internship materials. The intent of this article is to share the development process with others who may wish to design similar documents to address state and national standards for teacher interns.</p>

<p>The preparation and evaluation of new teachers are complex areas that require ongoing collaboration between universities, state departments of education, and local school districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406412452761">McCormick &amp; Brennan, 2001</xref>). Perhaps nowhere is this need more acute than for new teachers of students with moderate and severe disabilities (MSD), a category used in Kentucky to include students with moderate to profound intellectual disabilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0888406412452761">Delano, Keefe, and Perner (2008/2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0888406412452761">Downing (2006)</xref>, among others, have discussed the unique challenges for teacher education programs in MSD.</p>
<p>While educators increasingly are required to ensure that all students have access to and make progress in the core curriculum, teachers of students with MSD also must ensure that their students are equipped with the life skills essential for postschool outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406412452761">Collins, Karl, Riggs, Galloway, &amp; Hager, 2010</xref>). In addition, teachers of students with MSD must address unique communication needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0888406412452761">Kearns, Towles-Reeves, Kleinert, Kleinert, &amp; Thomas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0888406412452761">Towles-Reeves, Kearns, Kleinert, &amp; Kleinert, 2009</xref>) as well as special health care and the more probable presence of additional disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0888406412452761">Orelove, Sobsey, &amp; Silberman, 2004</xref>). Teachers also must have the knowledge base and skills to work closely with a broad team of professionals (e.g., general education teachers, speech/language pathologists, physical and occupational therapists, paraprofessionals, rehabilitation counselors). Finally, teachers of students with MSD must be prepared to implement evidence-based practices that often are not part of general education teacher training programs, including direct systematic instruction, errorless learning and prompting procedures, incidental teaching, and explicit strategies to facilitate generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0888406412452761">Delano et al., 2008/2009</xref>). As a result, in this most critical period of induction into the education field for new teachers, administrators often do not have the essential tools to know whether a teacher of students with MSD can effectively implement evidence-based practices and strategies to address the unique needs of students. Although preliminary research and a few published examples exist, an even more pressing task is to demonstrate evidence-based practices for teaching core content to students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0888406412452761">Agran, Cavin, Wehmeyer, &amp; Palmer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406412452761">Collins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0888406412452761">Delano et al., 2008/2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0888406412452761">Jimenez, Browder, &amp; Courtade, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0888406412452761">Kleinert, Collins, Wickham, Riggs, &amp; Hager, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to describe the process by which a Higher Education Consortium (HEC) of low incidence (MSD) faculty representing each of the preservice programs in Kentucky worked with the Education Professional Standards Board (EPSB) to develop an explicit observational tool as an addendum to the state-mandated teacher internship evaluation for all 1st year teachers. This process included meeting with MSD faculty (fall 2009), partnering with EPSB (spring 2010), aligning Council for Except ional Children (CEC) and Kentucky Teacher Standards (summer 2010), further aligning CEC standards to Kentucky Teacher Internship Standards (fall 2010), and obtaining final adoption (spring 2011) for statewide use.</p>
<p>The internship process for Kentucky previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406412452761">McCormick and Brennan (2001)</xref> will be briefly reiterated within our discussion below. The bulk of this article is devoted to illustrating how the competencies identified as essential for all teachers in the state could be directly “translated into practice” for teachers of students with MSD and the evidence the internship team could gather to document the teacher effectively implements those competencies. The HEC was especially interested in providing guidance as to how teachers could address core content and life skills within daily evidence-based instruction and collaborate effectively with other professionals, including general education teachers in inclusive settings to provide instruction.</p>
<sec id="section1-0888406412452761">
<title>Evaluating the Need for Change</title>
<p>Given the complex nature of preparing and evaluating new teachers, MSD faculty are charged with the responsibility of collaborating with regional colleagues and governing organizations (e.g., State Departments of Education, EPSB) and local school representatives. This best practice model is easier to articulate than apply, given the complex nature of these organizations. Historically, the field of low incidence disabilities (i.e., MSD) has been small in comparison with other content areas, such as elementary education, due to a complex and highly heterogeneous student population that makes up a very small percentage of the overall school population. Moreover, the field requires teachers who have a unique set of exemplary skills and knowledge to address cognitive, social, instructional, behavioral, physical, communication, technology, and medical issues.</p>
<p>In 2009, the Kentucky Department of Education (KDE) Office of Next Generation Learners invited a cadre of MSD faculty from across Kentucky to meet and share common issues and needs. This initiative originated from the low incidence component of Kentucky’s State Professional Development Grant (SPDG). The KDE saw a growing need to support new teachers of students with MSD in Kentucky, as well as the faculty that prepared those teachers. This HEC originally met to examine the ongoing need for such a group, the pressing state and national issues that members were attempting to manage individually at their respective institutions, and the capacity of the members to address those challenges. Acknowledging a charge to continue and extend efforts to produce high-quality teachers entering the field of MSD, the HEC initially started with biannual meetings targeting such topics as reviewing program standards, national and state curriculum standards, teacher training, and resource sharing. Across meetings, attending faculty represented seven state institutions (public and private) with teacher certification programs in MSD. The HEC continued its work into 2010 by exploring the ongoing need for improved teacher training for teachers of students with MSD and for continued support for those teachers after graduation. In Kentucky, ongoing support occurs through the Kentucky Teacher Internship Program (KTIP). In particular, the KTIP is designed to help beginning teachers (interns) experience a successful and productive 1st year in the classroom.</p>
<p>The challenges commonly faced by beginning teachers after they graduate from a university program are to be addressed through the KTIP itself. One KTIP provision is to offer strong mentors for interns through their 1st year of teaching. In reality, the process is often much different for interns who teach students with MSD. The most striking difference is often at the district level. The first challenge is the experience level of many principals. Principals who serve as the district level KTIP committee representative often do not have enough MSD knowledge or experience to competently evaluate and support the intern. The evaluation process includes the observation of specific instructional practices; many KTIP principals have little to no experience in the MSD field and are limited in their knowledge of evidence-based instructional practices in low incidence disabilities. A second challenge is the practice of assigning a certified teacher who may not have MSD certification or experience to serve as the intern’s district resource teacher. This is a crucial issue as the resource teacher is required to spend 50 out-of-class hours mentoring the intern. All too frequently, districts do not have enough teachers certified in MSD to serve as resource teachers for new interns. Although assigning an “out-of-field” resource teacher can meet the letter of the law, it poses significant challenges to implement best instructional practices. The resource teacher in these situations is the intern’s primary contact for questions, problems, or other related matters that can pose an issue during the 1st year of teaching; if the resource teacher does not have the knowledge base to support an intern who teaches students with MSD, the mentorship may be less than effective. Finally, teacher educators assigned to internship committees often lack MSD-specific knowledge or expertise (e.g., the teacher educator may come from an Institutions of Higher Education (IHE) that does not have a low incidence preparation program). Recognizing these frequent issues in the make-up of the KTIP committee, the HEC believed more could be done to support interns teaching students with MSD.</p>

<title>Engaging the EPSB Through the Change Process</title>
<p>As a result of the needs of new teachers of students with MSD and a desire to improve the education of all students with low incidence disabilities, the HEC set the goal of improving the KTIP process for MSD-certified interns. Having identified this need (Step 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0888406412452761">Figure 1</xref>), the second step involved approaching the EPSB to explain the challenges new MSD-certified teacher interns were experiencing through the current KTIP process and to explore possible options to improve the process. Informal contacts between the HEC chairperson and the respective EPSB liaison assigned to outreach led to more formal discussions. These discussions helped the EPSB to clearly understand the issues facing teachers serving students with MSD during their internship year. The purpose of the first formal meeting was to establish a dialogue, explain the purpose of the HEC, and understand the parameters required by the EPSB.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0888406412452761-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>The third step involved a thorough alignment of the CEC Initial Common Core (ICC) standards and the Individualized Independence Curriculum (IIC) standards that are designated for teachers of students with low incidence disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0888406412452761">CEC, 2009</xref>) to the Kentucky teacher standards. Four members of the HEC formed a subcommittee to undertake this alignment and then discussed the resulting document with the HEC members, who took it back to their respective universities to update their programs and practices. The parallel alignment was vital to establish consistency with state and national standards required by the EPSB. This also provided a service to the EPSB, as the EPSB did not have the specific subject area staff needed to perform such an alignment. This helped to forge a strong working relationship between the EPSB and the HEC. It also allowed EPSB staff to thoroughly see the strong alignment of the ICC and IIC standards to the Kentucky Teacher Standards and to quickly move the project to the next step.</p>
<p>The fourth step involved a careful alignment of the CEC ICC and IIC standards to the KTIP process itself (e.g., development of lesson plans, observations of instruction). The HEC and EPSB realized that the KTIP process is governed by state law and changes or modifications would involve significant efforts through the legislative process. As a result, the HEC derived a plan to develop a supplemental addendum to the KTIP for MSD interns. This supplemental addendum would mirror the entire KTIP process and its handbook with the special caveat of providing MSD-specific language and MSD-relevant exemplars for MSD-certified interns. The HEC agreed that the supplemental addendum to the KTIP would be titled the “Moderate and Severe Disabilities Strategic Addendum.”</p>
<p>In the addendum (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0888406412452761">Figure 2</xref>, for a sample addendum page), the HEC subcommittee replicated the internship training document from the KTIP handbook for all teachers and then modified it to meet the unique needs of MSD-certified interns. The modification process was not meant to develop two parallel documents, but rather to take those KTIP sections that needed supplemental information and exemplars pertinent to teaching students with MSD. This unique addendum also could be used in conjunction with the other required documents in the KTIP (e.g., lesson plan forms) without altering the essential formats. Not altering original content has resulted in a more relevant KTIP handbook for new MSD-certified interns in Kentucky classrooms and enables all stakeholders (e.g., state EPSB Board, principals, mentoring teachers, and the MSD teacher intern himself or herself) to see how the state standards for all teachers apply directly and specifically to teachers of students with MSD.</p>

<p>As work on the addendum progressed, the EPSB advisory board invited HEC members to share their work. This eventually resulted in the EPSB student internship advisory board formally endorsing the HEC’s work on the MSD strategic addendum. The EPSB later shared that the addendum process for MSD-certified teachers would serve as a pilot for other content area certifications reflecting specialized skill sets (e.g., music education) the EPSB governed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article has described the efforts of a collaborative group of higher education faculty with expertise in MSD across institutions of higher education in Kentucky to increase the implementation of best practices in school settings through (a) aligning state standards with CEC standards for students with low incidence disabilities and (b) creating a document specific to using evidence-based practices to teach students with low incidence disabilities to be used in supporting and evaluating MSD-certified teachers during their internship year. Since the beginning of the KTIP program, the challenge of finding members of the internship committee with expertise in best practices in low incidence disabilities has been a continuous problem. In many cases, committees failed to include a member with expertise in working with students with <italic>any</italic> type of disability. The work of the HEC has been aimed to increase committees’ awareness of best practices as they work with MSD-certified teachers during their induction year.</p>
<sec id="section4-0888406412452761">
<title>Challenges in the Process</title>
<p>Several challenges arose in the context of our work. First, state standards are often written in broad language to encompass knowledge and skills across a range of ages and content areas. For example, all teachers should be able to create a classroom environment that is conducive to learning, conduct effective instruction, and assess the results of that instruction. That said, there are specific skills and knowledge that should be expected of teachers of students with MSD that may not be reflected in general standards, such as dealing with the most challenging behaviors, performing health-related procedures, designing and using effective communication systems, providing safe physical management, and implementing instructional practices that have been validated as effective for students with intellectual disabilities. Providing lists and examples of these skills based on national standards can better prepare mentors to support, work with, and evaluate teachers who are new to the field.</p>
<p>Second, it is true that all teachers should be able to work with all students. This is the foundation of inclusion and differentiated instruction. Yet, it is also a fact that teacher education programs and school districts must work within the constraints of the existing system. Until personnel preparation changes and school districts become more inclusive, it is necessary to have additional standards that address specific skills needed to provide an appropriate education for students with the most significant needs. In time, standards may evolve to focus more on consultative skills for specific needs. Until that time, organizations such as CEC will find it necessary to set specific standards based on a body of research overwhelmingly conducted in segregated or resource classrooms. Although we have intentionally tried to provide examples of more inclusive programming within the addendum (and specifically within the Kentucky Leadership Teacher Standard, which includes initiatives that new teachers can undertake to create more inclusive opportunities for their students), we also understand that research on effective practices in inclusive classrooms is limited. The authors of this article, in fact, struggled to use language that reflected skills specific to working with students rather than settings (e.g., teachers who work with students with MSD rather than MSD classroom teachers).</p>
<p>With these considerations in mind, the “Moderate and Severe Disabilities Strategic Addendum” is a document that makes clear the level of expertise needed to adequately and effectively work with students with MSD. In addition to being a document that can be used by interns or 1st year teachers, it also is a document that can be used to assess the progress of teacher candidates at the preservice level as they are beginning to acquire a set of disability-specific skills. Moreover, such an approach as outlined in this article might also prove valuable in the development of principal observations or “walk-throughs” for more veteran teachers of students with MSD. Increasingly, administrator observations “based on rigorous teacher performance standards” are being considered in the evaluation of teacher effectiveness under No Child Left Behind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0888406412452761">U.S. Department of Education, 2011</xref>, p. 18).</p>
<p>At the time this article was written, the “Moderate and Severe Disabilities Strategic Addendum” was in its 1st year of use with internship committees in Kentucky. Initial feedback from interns and their committee members has been positive. Still, a period of time is needed before enough data are gathered to determine the usefulness of the addendum in better supporting MSD teachers. While it is possible that more interns will pass the internship with better documentation that they have the skills necessary to meet the needs of their students, it also is possible that more interns may fail the internship because it will become more apparent that they are lacking the skills that have been identified as necessary by their profession. Only a detailed analysis of the data over time will provide that information. Clearly, this is the next step (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0888406412452761">Figure 1</xref>), and the authors of this article strongly support future research in this area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0888406412452761">
<title>Next Steps in Validation of the MSD Intern Support Tool</title>
<p>The MSD addendum was posted on the EPSB website at the beginning of the 2011 school year. To evaluate use, we have proposed the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0888406412452761" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>EPSB will identify 1st year teachers who are working in classrooms with students who are identified as having MSD. Those teachers will be surveyed to determine whether they were aware of the MSD addendum and the extent to which it supported their internship.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>EPSB will identify the university and practitioner staff who serve on the KTIP team for teachers of students with MSD. These KTIP members will complete a survey reporting use of the MSD addendum tool and the extent to which the tool assisted in their work with the new special educator.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Follow-up interviews will be conducted with individual teachers who used the MSD addendum during their internship year. Interviews will gather information informally on the quality of their experience, whether the tool assisted with lesson planning, communicating with colleagues and parents, collaborating, taking leadership roles within the school, and other aspects of teaching for the first time.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Data will be collected, analyzed, and reported to all stakeholders for any subsequent revisions of the addendum and to provide guidance for needed professional development (Step 6 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0888406412452761">Figure 1</xref>). Following the pilot year, online modules of professional development will be created. Internship teachers will have examples of evidence-based practices and knowledge of how the CEC standards can be applied in daily teaching activities. KTIP committee members will have models of evidence-based practices for students with MSD, as well as examples of how to coach teachers new to the field. Principals will be provided with professional development to alert them to the unique academic needs of this population and the supervisory support needed for all teachers of students with MSD.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there are challenges when implementing a new model across an entire state. There are challenges inherent in the overall change process as well as data collection intricacies when the process is locally implemented with regional oversight. Consistency of data will require a standardized process of collection through online surveys. Due to the geographical scope of the state, on-site observations of mentoring teams using the tool is currently not feasible. However, teams will be recruited to provide video to serve as a model for others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0888406412452761">
<title>Recommendations for Other States Considering This Process</title>
<p>For those who want to develop a comparable addendum in other areas (e.g., autism) or in other states, the following advice is offered:</p>
<list id="list2-0888406412452761" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Involve stakeholders in the initial work of the committee (e.g., faculty across IHEs in the state, representatives of the state department of education, and other governing bodies) so that everyone recognizes the needs for specific skill sets unique to the content area.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Be transparent in the process by giving frequent reports to and ongoing feedback from those not involved in the actual process of alignment and development.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Be thorough and thoughtful in aligning state standards to professional standards by reading and discussing each item and the intent of its wording.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ground recommended practices and examples in the professional research literature base.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Once the document is completed, field test it with preservice teachers enrolled in field experiences and make revisions based on feedback.</p></list-item></list>
<p>As we prepare new teacher educators in such areas as low incidence disabilities, it is more critical than ever that we give administrators and others who mentor new teachers the supports they need to do <italic>their</italic> jobs while emphasizing that national and state teacher standards truly apply to all teachers.</p>
