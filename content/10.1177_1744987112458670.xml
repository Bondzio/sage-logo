<abstract>
<p>The use of mobile devices for professional, business, educational, personal and social purposes has accelerated exponentially over the last decade. Staff working in healthcare organisations, and patients and visitors using healthcare settings, understandably want to use mobile technology. Concerns have been raised about safety in terms of interference with equipment, and threats to privacy and dignity, yet less policy attention has been paid to infection risks.</p>
<p>Healthcare professional students were supplied with smartphones as part of a larger educational project. Devices collected from a sub-sample of students working in operating theatre contexts were sampled to estimate the cross-contamination potential of the technology. A longitudinal multiple measures design was used. Under laboratory conditions, samples were taken from surfaces using swabbing techniques followed by contact plating. The devices were subsequently cleaned with 70% isopropyl alcohol and returned to the students.</p>
<p>All devices demonstrated microbial contamination and over three quarters (86%) polymicrobial contamination. The technique and sites used to sample for microbial contamination influenced the levels of contamination identified. Swabbing alone was less likely to isolate polymicrobial contamination than contact plating, and some microorganisms were isolated only by contact plates and not by swabbing of the same area.</p>
<p>The findings from this study demonstrate further research is urgently needed to inform evidence-based infection control policy on the use of personal equipment such as mobile devices in the healthcare settings where contamination may have adverse effects on patients, staff and visitors.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1744987112458670" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) established a number of Centres of Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL) to speed dissemination of best practice in learning and teaching. One CETL, the Assessment and Learning in Practice Settings (ALPS) was established in 2005, and consisted of five University partners (Bradford, Huddersfield, Leeds, Leeds Metropolitan and York St. John) and involved staff and students undertaking health professional and social work programmes. Part of the programme of work was the development of e-learning tools for mobile devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112458670">ALPS, 2008</xref>), and T-Mobile MDA™ Smartphones were distributed to more than 900 students studying at higher education institutions (HEIs) across Yorkshire. The intention was that the students would use the devices during placements as a communication tool and to collect evidence to contribute to a summative assessment of their performance. One of the barriers encountered was that some organisations placed restrictions on where, and how, the devices could be used. These restrictions were purportedly founded on a perceived infection risk, although the evidence on which these assumptions were based was weak. Those healthcare organisations that allowed students to use the devices recommended washing the devices with detergent-soaked cloths. This compliance standard was in the absence of any evidence of benefit and could have caused irreparable damage to the device.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1744987112458670"><title>Background</title>
<p>Interest in the infection potential of telephones can be traced right back to the early 1900s (Aronson, 1977). One of the first investigations conducted in a healthcare environment found pathogens on telephones in an intensive care unit, and consequently claimed this presented an environmental risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987112458670">Cozanitis et al., 1978</xref>). Two later studies presented opposite views on the contamination risk posed by telephones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1744987112458670">White, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987112458670">Rafferty and Pancoast, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>The first study to test mobile (cell) phones was carried out in one hospital and focussed on the identification of multidrug-resistant <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> contamination of the devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987112458670">Borer et al., 2005</xref>). Interest in the infection risks associated with telephony rose significantly from 2006 as mobile phone use became widespread. There was a similar increase in the number of studies undertaken in clinical settings, despite prohibitions on use due to concerns about interference with hospital equipment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987112458670">Klein and Djaiani, 2003</xref>). This restriction was finally relaxed in the UK in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987112458670">Department of Health, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The accelerating growth in mobile device use permeating professional and personal life, coupled with the apparent lack of evidence to inform local policies regarding safe use of devices in healthcare environments, provided the impetus for this study.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1744987112458670" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>Over a nine-month period MDA™ smartphones used by student operating department practitioners (ODP) were sampled. Devices were originally provided to a range of health and social care professional students, including nurses, in the study site (one of the five partner Universities); however, only ODP students remained committed to using the devices for social and professional purposes over the study period. These devices enabled the students to access their email, calendar, and the Internet via the 2G networks. As the devices were used in operating department contexts, the implications of any significant findings would be transferable to other professions and staff working in similar clinical settings.</p>
<p>Devices used by two different cohorts of students were sampled; one group (nine devices) on six occasions, the other (seven devices) three times, with a period of use between each sampling activity. No other study was found that incorporates repeated longitudinal sampling of mobile devices in its design, despite single sampling having been identified as a study limitation, as the transient or resident status of bacteria cannot be established with once only sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1744987112458670">Srikanth et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Following receipt of ethical approval from the institutional Research Ethics Panel, devices were collected using aseptic technique, and placed in sterile sample bags, prior to immediate transport to the laboratory. Sampling was carried out using sterile swabs moistened in maximum recovery diluent (MRD), followed by dry swabbing to remove any remaining residue. Surfaces were swabbed using a crosshatch pattern to ensure complete coverage. The use of moistened swabs followed by dry swabbing has not been previously described. Following sampling, the swab tips were removed and placed in 5 ml of sterile MRD. This process was repeated for the front, back, side edges, screen and keypad of the device, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744987112458670">Figure 1</xref>.
<fig id="fig1-1744987112458670" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Identification of mobile phone areas</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1744987112458670-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Upon completion of swabbing, contact plates of Tryptone soy agar (TSA), were used to ‘print’ the keypad, front and back of the device, by placing the device in contact with the plate for three seconds. The only other use of contact plates was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987112458670">Jeske et al. (2007)</xref>, who used them as the sole method for sampling from both static and mobile phone keypads. This is despite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1744987112458670">Tunç and Olgun (2006)</xref> suggesting contact plates should be used to negate the need to use swabs, on which some bacteria may remain during transfer in the laboratory, resulting in their failure to be plated and cultured.</p>
<p>Each device was then cleaned with a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe, and placed into a sterile sample bag and then returned to its user, usually within four to five hours, but always on the same day.</p>
<p>The swab tips in the MRD were spun in a vortex for 30 seconds and then plated onto TSA and incubated for 24 hours at 37°C. Following incubation the numbers of bacteria recovered were recorded and the individual colonies were transferred to individual wells in 96-well plates filled with Tryptone soy broth (TSB) and incubated for a further 24 hours at 37°C. This procedure replicates the isolation and ‘purification’ processes carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987112458670">Ekrakene and Igeleke (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987112458670">Brady et al. (2009)</xref>. After incubation, a 96-well plate replicator was used to plate out the isolated bacteria onto a range of diagnostic culture media including: TSA; Oxacillin resistant staphylococci isolation medium (ORSIM) (LabM UK); Mannitol salt agar (LabM UK); Slanetz &amp; Bartley medium (LabM UK); Harlequin E.coli/Coliform medium (LabM UK); McConkeys agar (LabM UK); Baird Parker medium (LabM UK); and <italic>Brilliance</italic> UTI Clarity agar (LabM UK). These plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C. Growth on these media were subjected to a range of diagnostic tests including Gram staining, latex agglutination and catalase tests in order to arrive at a presumptive identification of the isolated bacteria. After incubation, identification was carried out based upon combinations of outcomes on different media as specified by the manufacturers.</p>

<p>Devices used by two different cohorts of ODP students were sampled; each student had one device. Nine students in Group 1 were sampled on six occasions, and the seven students in Group 2 were sampled three times. Coagulase-negative <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> species was the most common isolate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987112458670">Table 1</xref>), which is consistent with findings in the literature that tested for these organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987112458670">Nelson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987112458670">Karabay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987112458670">Jayalakshmi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987112458670">Arora et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987112458670">Sepehri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1744987112458670">Singh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1744987112458670">Srikanth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987112458670">Brady et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744987112458670">Tekerekoğlu et al., 2011</xref>).

<p>The devices demonstrated polymicrobial (multiple species of microorganism) growth in all cases except one, which was contaminated solely with Coagulase-negative <italic>Staphylococcus </italic>species. No device was found to be free of growth. The instances of polymicrobial growth are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744987112458670">Figure 2</xref>. This includes an ‘unknown’ category, which demonstrated contamination by one or more microorganisms that were not identified by the specific laboratory methods used here. The polymicrobial growths detected show that 12% of devices had just two types of bacteria on them, with 86% of the devices having three or more bacteria on them; some having as many as seven different types present.

<p>On one device, no contamination was found on the front and back when swabbed, but bacteria were isolated using contact plate application in the same areas. Similarly, another mobile phone demonstrated contamination only using the contact plate method on all three areas (front, back and keypad), but not from the swabs of the same areas. There were also instances where the contact plates were the only method to isolate specific bacteria, despite swabbing carried out on the whole of the device.</p>
<p>There were instances where swabbing established the presence of a single type of microorganism, but the plates isolated polymicrobial growth. One example of this was where only Coagulase-negative <italic>Staphylococcus </italic>species was found from samples taken with swabs of the front and keypad of one device and confirmed by the contact plates taken of the same areas. However, coliforms were also isolated from this device, but only on the front, back and keypad contact plates. Another example was where the swabs identified Coagulase-negative <italic>Staphylococcus </italic>species on the front, back, keypad, edge, and screen, yet the contact plates also isolated MRSA on the front, and both <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and coliforms on the front and back. Coliforms were the microorganisms most regularly isolated by contact plate, but not from swabbing.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1744987112458670" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The most commonly found bacterial isolates were Coagulase-negative <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, which are not generally considered to be pathogens, but have been shown to cause infections. For example, S. epidermidis, which is a commensal of the skin, has for a long time been regarded as relatively innocuous but has now been generally accepted as a pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1744987112458670">Vuong and Otto, 2002</xref>); mainly as the most frequent cause of catheter-associated sepsis and implant infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987112458670">Presterl et al., 2007</xref>). Likewise, <italic>Staphylococcus caprae</italic>, another skin commensal, has been implicated in septicaemia, as well as infections of the urinary tract, bones and joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744987112458670">Shuttleworth et al., 1997</xref>); both have also been recorded as meticillin-resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987112458670">Carbon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987112458670">Ross et al., 2005</xref>). However, other bacteria more widely accepted as pathogenic have also been isolated from mobile phones, including many with a potential for drug resistance: meticillin-sensitive <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MSSA), meticillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> species, <italic>Enterococcus</italic> species including vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococci</italic> (VRE), <italic>Micrococcus</italic> species, <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic>, <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Aeromonas</italic> species, <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> species, and coliforms (<italic>Klebsiella</italic> species, <italic>Enterobacter</italic> species, and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>; strains of which can be pathogenic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987112458670">Krieger et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This evidence indicates that some pathogens can survive for prolonged periods on plastic surfaces such as mobile devices, presenting a potential risk of transmission. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987112458670">Falk et al. (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744987112458670">Schabrun and Chipchase (2006)</xref> identified that meticillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococcus</italic>, and some Gram-negative microorganisms survive on inanimate objects such as hospital equipment for many months, just as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987112458670">Kramer et al. (2006)</xref> showed that nosocomial bacteria such as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>,<italic> Enterococcus </italic>species<italic>, Acinetobacter </italic>species and <italic>Klebsiella </italic>species can survive on inanimate surfaces for extended periods. The weight of evidence predicates that there is high probability that a mobile device, brought into a healthcare environment, will carry live bacteria for a period of time such as a shift, and there is a risk that these contaminants could be transferred onto hands if the phone is touched. A number of studies have shown that when clean (washed) hands or gloved hands touch contaminated objects, they too become contaminated with these organisms, which carries the potential risk of transmission to other surfaces and people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744987112458670">Rusin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987112458670">Duckro et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987112458670">Hayden et al., 2008</xref>). Sharing phones may directly facilitate the dispersal of pathogenic bacteria, and perhaps worryingly, could result in dispersal when the mobile phones are taken home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987112458670">Chawla et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The inclusion of contact sampling of the devices after swabbing has identified that isolation of some microorganisms may not be achieved through swabbing alone. There were many instances of bacteria isolated solely by the contact plate method, with <italic>Enterococcus </italic>species the only organism not isolated through this approach. No other study, to date, has incorporated both sampling strategies, and hence may have as a consequence failed to isolate bacteria that were present. The effectiveness of the combined sampling strategy appears to explain the significant difference in polymicrobial findings between this study and previous research. In this study, the majority (86%) of devices showed contamination by three or more different bacteria, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1744987112458670">Srikanth et al. (2010)</xref> identified that 48% of the mobile phones they tested had two different species of bacteria on them, and just 26% had three or more, whilst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987112458670">Brady et al. (2011)</xref> found 11.8% and 6.9% respectively, with the majority (64.7%) growing just one species. The efficiency of the sampling strategy used in this study may also account for the finding that no device was free from contamination, unlike other studies where up to 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987112458670">Khivsara et al., 2006</xref>) failed to show any growth.</p>
<p>The longitudinal data found a rise in the volume of bacteria on Group 1’s devices in the first October sampling point. This sampling was undertaken following a prolonged period between sampling events, during which the students were undertaking clinical placements. It is not possible to establish whether contamination occurred in clinical settings and this contributed to the rise, or if it was due to the extended time lapse between sampling events (five months) and therefore there was greater opportunity to accumulate contaminants. One explanation is that the bacteria are transient in their populating of the devices. This is supported by the results from two devices from Group 1 that were free of MRSA at the first three sampling events, were subsequently contaminated in October (following use in clinical practice), but no evidence of MRSA was found at the November sampling. There was no pattern in terms of presence, numbers, or location of contaminants across the period of sampling in this study. The transient nature of the contamination is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1744987112458670">Figures 3(a)</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1744987112458670">3(f)</xref>, which illustrate bacteria isolated from one mobile phone across multiple sampling events.

<p>Group 1’s devices were cleaned with alcohol wipes in the laboratory after the October sampling point. The results from just 11 days later found contamination levels remained higher than those found at three previous sampling points (March, April and May). The literature acknowledges that the numbers of microorganisms on handheld devices, including pathogens, are reduced by cleaning with alcohol, but not totally removed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987112458670">Kilic et al. (2009)</xref> found that only 33% of mobile phones that were cleaned at least once a week with alcohol were contaminated, albeit solely with S. <italic>epidermidis,</italic> whilst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987112458670">Jayalakshmi et al. (2008)</xref> established that 70% isopropyl alcohol disinfected nearly all mobile phones in their study (129/132), with a gross reduction in the number of organisms on the remaining three. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987112458670">Ramesh et al. (2008)</xref>, found that it was the act of daily cleaning, not the cleaning method used (alcohol versus dry cloth) that was significantly associated with amount of growth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1744987112458670">Singh et al. (2010)</xref> carried out a similar study to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987112458670">Ramesh et al. (2008)</xref>, by sampling devices cleaned by their user using both alcohol and dry cloths, and also found no significant difference in the bacterial rates of the participants’ phones, irrespective of their cleaning regime. However, after cleaning in the laboratory with 70% isopropyl alcohol, the overall bacterial load was reduced by around 87%, with 42% of the phones showing no growth. This questions the efficiency of alcohol as a cleaning agent for mobile phones and indicates that further investigation is needed into the optimal disinfection methods for these devices.</p>
<p>As a response to poor hygiene practices in healthcare settings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987112458670">Goldblatt et al. (2007)</xref> called for strict regulations regarding where mobile phones should be used, and similarly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1744987112458670">Ulger et al. (2009)</xref> concluded that limiting mobile phone usage was required. In a study of healthcare workers (HCWs), 73% recognised the need to restrict the use of mobile phones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1744987112458670">Srikanth et al. 2010</xref>). However, when a proposal limiting use of devices to less than three times in a working day was suggested, only 29% would have adhered to it based on their current practice; 57% handled their phone more than three times, and 14% used their phone in excess of 20 times in a working day. Indeed, a number of commentators suggest the benefits mobile phones bring makes banning their use in healthcare settings unrealistic and impractical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987112458670">Borer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1744987112458670">Srikanth et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the weight of evidence concerning the microbial transmission potential of mobile devices this does not seem to be translated into workable guidance or advice on use or cleaning of mobile devices for staff and patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987112458670">Brady et al., 2011</xref>). This is unsurprising given the absence of hospital standard disinfection guidelines for personal items like mobile phones, and manufacturers warning explicitly against using cleaning agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987112458670">Jeske et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987112458670">Datta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987112458670">Gunasekara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1744987112458670">Singh et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite evidence that these devices do not cause interference with medical equipment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987112458670">Ramesh et al., 2008</xref>), findings that resulted in relaxation of the restrictions on their use in healthcare settings, no guidance has been given on their disinfection. In the UK the Department of Health has published two separate documents specifically on the use of mobile devices in the healthcare environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987112458670">Department of Health, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987112458670">2011</xref>), yet neither make any reference to the devices’ infection potential.</p>
<p>This study sampled a small number of devices of one specific design, which may limit generalisability, nevertheless the approaches used for sampling, culturing and cleaning suggest that the infection potential is greater than previously thought.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987112458670" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The findings from this study suggest that mobile phones are contaminated with significant numbers of transient pathogenic bacteria, indeed far more than has previously been identified. This study was not designed to ascertain the clinical risks that might occur from transmission, merely establish the most reliable and valid approach for testing microbial contamination on mobile phones. The existing evidence, and these findings, are in agreement that microorganisms growing on mobile devices have the potential to be transferred into healthcare environments if used, although the probability that contamination will occur is as yet unknown. Further observational research is needed to ascertain the actual risk of contamination posed by mobile phones use by healthcare staff when undertaking normal duties. In the absence of a more effective alternative we would concur with other authors and recommend cleaning devices with 70% isopropyl alcohol. This advice is advocated on the basis that cleaning is used in combination with strict concordance with hand washing and infection control measures. Additional laboratory sampling of mobile phones, and evaluation of disinfection methods, is needed to confirm the efficacy of sampling techniques and optimum cleaning methods. This research is urgently needed to inform the development of robust evidence-based infection control policy on the use of mobile devices within healthcare settings.</p>
