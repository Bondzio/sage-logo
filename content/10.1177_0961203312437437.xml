<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate the pathophysiology of Q waves in II, III, avF in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). <bold>Methods:</bold> Inflammation evaluation by CMR using T2, early (EGE) and late gadolinium enhanced images (LGE) was performed in 20 SLE patients with mild cardiac symptoms and Q in leads II, III, avF of ECG. Their results were compared with 20 SLE patients with the same symptoms and normal ECG. <bold>Results:</bold> In both groups, T2, EGE and left ventricular ejection fraction were normal. However, in 3/20 with Q in II, III, avF, CMR revealed lesions indicative of acute myocarditis. In the rest of them, CMR documented transmural LGE, due to past inferior myocardial infarction in 4/20 and epicardial LGE due to past myocarditis in 8/20 (4/8 in the inferior and 4/8 in the lateral wall of left ventricle). No LGE was found in 5/20 and the Q was attributed to the position of the heart. In 3/20 with normal ECG, CMR detected past myocarditis in 2/3 and myocardial infarction in 1/3. Coronary angiography assessed coronary artery disease in all SLE with evidence of myocardial infarction and normal coronaries in 9/10 patients with past myocarditis. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Q in II, III, avF in SLE may indicate myocardial infarction, acute or past inflammation or be a positional finding. The lack of Q does not exclude the possibility of infarction or inflammation. CMR is the best tool to reveal the pathophysiology of Q waves in SLE and guide treatment of heart involvement in these patients.</p>

<p>Heart disease is a major complication in the management of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and has recently been considered as the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312437437">1</xref></sup> In the past, the cardiac manifestations were severe, or even lethal, as was proven by post-mortem examinations. Nowadays, subclinical features are more prevalent than clinically apparent disease and therefore should be recognized by careful clinical, electrocardiographic (ECG), echocardiographic and other non-invasive evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312437437">2</xref></sup> Recently, the application of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), a non-invasive, non-radiating technique, enabled detailed assessment of the pathophysiology behind the cardiac involvement in SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312437437">3</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312437437">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Q waves have been used for many years as the typical ECG hallmark of myocardial infarction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312437437">7</xref></sup> and/or myocardial inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312437437">8</xref></sup> However, marked Q waves in II, III, avF are not necessarily a manifestation of clinical disease (it may be due to a changed position of the electric axis of the heart) and conversely the absence of the Q wave in leads II, III, aVF does not exclude the presence of disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312437437">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of our study was to apply CMR in SLE patients under remission who presented to the outpatients’ clinic of our tertiary cardiac centre with mild cardiac symptoms and Q waves in II, III, avF of the ECG, without any known previous history of heart disease and compare their results with those of SLE patients with the same cardiac symptoms but without Q, in order to investigate the pathophysiology of these ECG findings.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-0961203312437437"><title>Patients’ clinical history and ECG evaluation</title>
<p>Twenty females, aged 46.5 ± 6.7 years, with a history of SLE diagnosed 11 ± 2.5 years ago, currently under remission, were presented to the cardiac outpatients’ clinic with mild cardiac symptoms (atypical chest pain, sinus tachycardia and recent onset of shortness of breath) and presence of Q waves in II, III, avF. Our population included only females, because SLE occurs 10 times more commonly in females than in males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312437437">1</xref></sup> and there is increasing evidence of differences in clinical presentation of cardiac disease in females compared with males.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312437437">9</xref></sup> No known previous history of cardiac event was documented in any of them. Their results were compared with those of 20 females aged 45.8 ± 6.9 years with a history of SLE diagnosed 10 ± 2.3 years ago, currently under remission, with the same mild cardiac symptoms, but without ECG changes. All patients underwent a detailed history before the CMR evaluation and the scan was performed within a week after the onset of atypical symptoms. SLE diagnosis followed the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312437437">10</xref></sup> Assessment of SLE activity was based on the European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement (ECLAM) index.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312437437">11</xref></sup> Patients were classified into active (ECLAM&gt;5) or inactive (ECLAM&lt;5) by investigators blinded to CMR findings. Eight out of 20 patients with Q waves and 10/20 without Q waves were active. Anti-phospholipid (aPL) antibodies and anti-SSA/Ro antibodies were evaluated in all of them. Clinical evidence of possible myocardial infarction or myocarditis was based on either documentation by history/medical record or Q waves &gt;40 ms, in two contiguous leads on ECG. History of hypercholesterolaemia was defined as any indication for cholesterol-lowering drug treatment according to the Adult Treatment Panel III of the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312437437">12</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312437437">14</xref></sup> Hypertension history was defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) &gt;140 mmHg or diastolic BP &gt;90 mmHg, consistent from two readings obtained from two visits, or a need for antihypertensive treatment according to the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure 7 criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312437437">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203312437437">16</xref></sup> Significant smoking was defined as &gt;10 pack-years of tobacco use. Resting 12-lead ECGs were obtained a week before CMR evaluation. We applied the Minnesota Code criteria for significant Q waves (codes 1-1 to 1-2 except 1-2-8) as ECG evidence of MI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203312437437">17</xref></sup> This was interpreted using both a computer analysis and a single reader blinded to CMR results and clinical outcome. Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and /or bundle branch blocks or rhythm disturbances were excluded in order to avoid contamination of our population with Q waves due to other reasons.</p>
<p>Informed written consent was signed by all patients and the protocol was approved by the hospital’s ethics committee.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203312437437" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>The presence of myocardial inflammation and the left ventricular systolic function were evaluated by CMR. Myocarditis was documented using STIR T2-weighted (T2-W), T1-weighted (T1-W) before and early after contrast media injection (EGE) and late enhanced images (LGE). The study was considered as positive, if two out of three imaging sequences gave positive results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312437437">18</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec5-0961203312437437"><title>CMR evaluation of inflammation</title>
<p>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance examination was performed with a 1.5 T Philips Intera system using STIR T2-W, T1-W EGE and LGE. ECG-triggered, STIR T2-W multislice spin-echo sequence was performed in short axis orientation and the signal ratio measured from the region of interest covering the myocardium of the left ventricle as well as within a skeletal muscle in the same slice. ECG-triggered T1-W multislice spin-echo images were obtained in axial orientation with identical parameters before and after an intravenous bolus of 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA. Measurements after Gd-DTPA were started within 1 min of injection (EGE) in the same area as in T2-W. Immediately after the second set of T1-W images, 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA was given again and late gadolinium-enhanced images (LGE) were taken 15 min later in short, horizontal and vertical long axes, using a 3D–T1-TFE sequence, preconditioned with a 180° inversion pulse (flip angle = 15°, <italic>TE</italic> = 1.4 ms, <italic>TR</italic> = 5.5 ms, TI 225 to 275 ms as individually optimized to null myocardial signal, matrix 256 × 192 and slice thickness = 5 mm). Images were analysed according to previously described protocols and values for T2 &gt; 2 and EGE &gt; 4 were considered abnormal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312437437">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203312437437">19</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203312437437"><title>CMR functional study</title>
<p>For each subject, localizing scans were obtained to define the long (two-chamber) axis of the left ventricle. A mid ventricular short axis view was prescribed and used to plan a four-chamber view. The short axis orientation was then defined accurately, perpendicular to both the two- and four-chamber views. To cover the entire left ventricle, 10 contiguous (gap = 0 mm) short axis slices were acquired in each study. The imaging sequence was a 2D, multi-phase (16 cardiac phases were acquired per cardiac cycle resulting to a temporal resolution of 47 ms for a heart rate of 80 beats/min), steady-state free-precession (SSFP) sequence (<italic>TE</italic> = 1.5 ms, <italic>TR</italic> = 3.1 ms, flip angle = 70°, slice thickness = 8 mm, acquired in-plane spatial resolution = 1.8 mm × 2.0 mm) characterized by the application of balanced gradients in all directions. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;55% was considered abnormal</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0961203312437437"><title>Image analysis</title>
<p>In T2-W the signal ratio was measured from the region of interest covering the left ventricular myocardium as well as within a skeletal muscle in the same slice.</p>
<p>In T1-W EGE, which reflects hyperaemia and capillary leak as a marker of inflammation, the early myocardial enhancement was measured from the region of interest covering the left ventricular myocardium as well as within a skeletal muscle in the same slice.</p>
<p>To assess the contrast-enhanced images (LGE), all short-axis slices from base to apex were inspected visually to identify areas of normal (completely nulled) myocardium. Mean signal intensity and standard deviation (SD) was derived and a threshold of &gt;2 SD exceeding the mean was used to define areas of LGE. Summing the planimetered areas of LGE in all short- axis slices yielded the total volume, which was also expressed as a proportion of total LV myocardium (% LGE). The LGE analysis was performed by one experienced reader and reviewed and confirmed by a second expert reader with both of the independent readers blinded to patients’ identity and clinical profile. Any discrepancies in analysis between the two readers were then adjudicated by a senior reader with &gt;10 years of CMR experience, also blinded to patients’ identity and clinical profile. An inter-reader evaluation of concordance, using kappa coefficient (the closer to 1 the better concordance) showed that the level of concordance was very good (0.75).</p>
<p>Cine images were used for the evaluation of LVEF. Left ventricular endocardial borders were outlined on the end-systolic and end-diastolic short axis view images covering the entire LV. Papillary muscles were considered myocardium. LVEF was calculated as follows: LVEF = [(volume at end-diastole - volume at end-systole) / volume at end-diastole]. The MRI-MASS (Medis, Leiden, the Netherlands) software was used and the readers were blinded to the clinical data.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0961203312437437"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All measurements were expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical significance of the differences was investigated using unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test. Statistical significance was considered to be <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0961203312437437" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>No increase in myocardial enzymes and/or blood inflammation indexes was documented at the time of cardiac evaluation. The Q waves were in II, III, aVF and were not accompanied by any ST change indicative of acute ischaemia. The routine echocardiogram showed hypokinesia of the inferior wall only in 4/20 with Q waves in II, III, aVF. No evidence of pericarditis was documented in any patient. All patients were further evaluated by CMR. The patients with normal ECG had also normal routine echocardiogram.</p>
<p>No statistical difference in age, disease duration and/or disease activity was identified between SLE with and without Q waves. In all patients T2, EGE, left ventricular end-diastolic (LVEDV), end-systolic volume (LVESV) and LVEF were within normal limits and no statistical difference was identified between SLE with and without Q waves (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203312437437">Table 1</xref>). However, in 3/20 with Q waves in II, III, avF (all with inactive disease) the T2 was &gt;2, the EGE &gt; 4 and the analysis of LGE images revealed an epicardial lesion (in inferior wall in 2/3 and in lateral wall in 1/3). These patients fulfilled the CMR criteria of acute myocardial inflammation and were considered positive for acute myocarditis, although they had neither increase of cardiac enzymes nor other clinical or ECG findings except Q waves in inferior leads. In the rest of them, although T2 and EGE were normal, LGE was indicative of past transmural inferior myocardial infarction in 4/20 (those with severe hypokinesia on the echocardiogram). In the remaining 13/20, an epicardial LGE due to past myocarditis was assessed in 8/13 (4/8 in the inferior and 4/8 in the lateral wall of left ventricle). Finally, in 5/13 the CMR evaluation was normal and Q waves were considered as a positional finding. Interestingly, in 3/20 patients with normal ECG, although T2 and EGE were normal, LGE epicardial lesions in lateral wall due to past myocarditis were identified in 2/3 and an inferior, transmural myocardial infarction in 1/3. Additionally, although statistics could not be performed due to small patient numbers, the extent of LGE in the patients with Q waves was higher compared with those without Q (6 ± 4% <italic>vs</italic>. 3 ± 1%, respectively). SLE patients’ profile and CMR findings are summarized in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203312437437">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961203312437437">2</xref>.

<p>X-ray coronary angiography assessed the presence of coronary artery disease in all patients with myocardial infarction. The three patients with acute myocarditis presented clinical findings of SLE relapse in the next two weeks and were treated accordingly. X-ray coronary angiography was also performed in 9/10 patients with evidence of past myocarditis and normal coronaries were identified.</p>
<p>Although the small patient number did not allow detailed statistics, four patients with evidence of past myocarditis had positive anti-SSA/Ro antibodies. All patients with acute myocarditis were considered as having inactive disease according to ECLAM. However, it was proven in the next two weeks that heart involvement was the first sign before the development of active disease.</p>
<p>All patients with evidence of myocardial infarction had positive aPL antibodies and were smokers, with mild hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension.</p></sec>

<p>In our study, after evaluation of SLE patients with the same clinical profile, CMR identified the presence of myocardial scar in patients with Q waves in II, III, avF and interestingly in some without Q waves. However, the CMR analysis of patients with Q waves in II, III, avF was indicative of myocardial infarction in the minority and of myocarditis in the majority of them. Additionally, CMR was able to diagnose acute, subclinical myocarditis before any increase of blood inflammatory indexes or cardiac enzymes in patients, who were considered inactive according to ECLAM.</p>
<p>There is an increasing number of publications supporting cardiovascular disease being a major cause of morbidity and mortality in SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312437437">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312437437">6</xref></sup> The pathophysiology of heart involvement in SLE seems to be the result of interaction of different processes such as atherosclerosis, vasculitis, intravascular thrombosis and myocarditis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312437437">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312437437">6</xref></sup> An increased prevalence of subclinical atherosclerotic disease using non-invasive imaging techniques has led to the suggestion that accelerated atherosclerotic disease may account for the high cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312437437">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312437437">4</xref></sup> Coronary artery disease (CAD) has a prevalence ranging between 6% and 10% in SLE and the risk of developing CAD is 4–8 times higher in SLE patients compared with controls. The traditional cardiovascular risk factors are also more predictive in SLE patients than in controls. SLE related risk factors, such as autoantibodies to endothelium, circulating immunocomplexes, activated complement products and nephritis, are additional factors for development of both vasculitis and atherosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312437437">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312437437">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, corticosteroids increase the serum concentration of cholesterol, lipoproteins and triglycerides and predispose to CAD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312437437">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The exact pathophysiologic mechanism of SLE myocarditis is not clear but most likely is the result of an immune complex mediated vascular phenomenon resulting in interstitial inflammation and secondary myocyte injury. Circulating antibodies such as antimyocardial or anticardiolipin antibodies may also contribute to lupus myocarditis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312437437">6</xref></sup> The clinical detection of myocarditis in SLE ranges from 3% to 15%, although it appears to be more common in autopsy studies. This suggests a rather larger subclinical presentation of myocarditis in SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312437437">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312437437">3</xref></sup> Signs and symptoms, if present, are similar to those of infective myocarditis and include chest pain, dyspnoea, tachycardia and arrhythmias. ST changes, Q waves and increased cardiac enzymes can be occasionally found. However, acute, clinically overt myocarditis is rare and is thought to occur only in those with active disease, usually in association with pericarditis. Myocarditis can further contribute to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312437437">3</xref></sup> Echocardiography can possibly suggest myocarditis, but is unable to facilitate a definite diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312437437">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>CMR can easily visualize the entire myocardium and it is ideal for a patchy process like myocarditis. It is also very sensitive to tissue composition changes which take place during myocarditis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312437437">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312437437">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312437437">6</xref></sup> The imaging protocol used in this study captures the three basic phenomena of the myocardial inflammatory response (oedema, increased capillary leakage and focal necrosis/fibrosis) and can offer a non-invasive diagnostic tool in these patients. A combined CMR approach using T2-W, EGE and LGE has a sensitivity of 76%, a specificity of 95.5% and a diagnostic accuracy of 85% in the detection of viral myocarditis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312437437">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203312437437">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore CMR is currently considered the best non-invasive technique for myocardial infarction detection and quantification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203312437437">19</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312437437">21</xref></sup> There are previous studies of the correlation between Q waves and LGE in coronary artery disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203312437437">20</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203312437437">22</xref></sup> Q waves have been used for many years as the hallmark ECG finding of myocardial infarction. However, marked Q waves in II, III, avF are not necessarily a manifestation of cardiac disease (it may be due to a changed position of the electric axis of the heart) and conversely the absence of the Q wave in leads II, III, aVF does not exclude cardiac disease. Furthermore, it is not possible to differentiate Q waves in leads II, III, aVF into positional and abnormal ones according to their changes during deep inspiration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203312437437">23</xref></sup> According to recent publications, Q waves reliably predict MI location, size and transmural extent only in patients with anterior infarction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203312437437">24</xref></sup> However, there are only few data about Q waves in patients with inflammatory diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312437437">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203312437437">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our findings, identifying greater percentage of myocarditis compared with myocardial infarction in SLE patients, are in agreement with the current literature about CMR findings in SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312437437">3</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312437437">6</xref></sup> However, it is important to notice that acute myocarditis in our SLE patients presented without typical signs or increase of myocardial enzymes and the CMR findings preceded the full expression of active SLE. This is in agreement with recent reports and reflects the high incidence of subclinical lupus myocarditis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312437437">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312437437">6</xref></sup> According to recent publications clinical myocardial involvement is identified in less than 10%, while an autopsy study detected myocarditis in 33% of SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203312437437">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961203312437437">27</xref></sup> This discrepancy, together with the high cardiac morbidity and mortality in SLE, supports that the early assessment of subclinical myocarditis is of additive value for patient management. ECLAM, the currently used activity index, represents a global disease activity score but does not reflect obligatory cardiac involvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312437437">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this paper, we focused to the clarification of the pathophysiologic background of a routinely used index like Q waves by CMR in SLE patients. It is important to stress that although the presence of Q in the ECG is considered traditionally as a hallmark to identify scar, it is unable to differentiate the nature of scar (acute, past myocarditis or myocardial infarction).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203312437437">28</xref></sup> Furthermore, the absence of Q in inferior leads can not exclude the presence of scar and may be due to the smaller amount of scar in SLE without Q compared with those with Q waves. Finally, Q waves after a myocardial infarction may disappear partially or completely in the evolution of the myocardial infarction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203312437437">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961203312437437">29</xref></sup> Therefore, CMR is the only non-invasive technique able to reveal the details of cardiac pathophysiology in SLE.</p>
<p>For CMR evaluation of SLE patients, a protocol suggested by a JACC White Paper for evaluation of myocarditis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203312437437">19</xref></sup> that includes T2, EGE, LGE and function evaluation is the ideal approach. Two out of three positive criteria should be fulfilled to document the diagnosis of acute myocarditis. If the patient has past myocarditis, the presence of LGE could be the only finding; or nothing may be found, because LGE shrinks and can disappear over time, and LV could remain normal, or dilated in the case of progression to heart failure. In recent myocardial infarction, evidence of oedema can be documented in the same area as scar. However, the oedema area is larger than the area of scar, indicating the area at risk. In old myocardial infarction the typical finding is the presence of LGE in the area of scar (bright is dead). It is important to stress that the LGE in myocarditis is subepicardial and has a diffuse pattern, while the LGE in infarction can be either subendocardial or transmural and follows the distribution of the diseased coronary vessel. This is of special clinical value, because myocardial infarction needs ischaemia evaluation and anti-ischaemic treatment or revascularization strategies, while myocarditis needs intensification of immune therapy.</p>
<p>Although other imaging techniques have reported the importance for risk stratification of patients without history of prior myocardial infarction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961203312437437">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961203312437437">31</xref></sup> the LGE can also detect small, unrecognized myocardial scar missed by other imaging techniques. Additionally, it can differentiate between scar due to past or subclinical myocardial infarction and scar due to a past inflammatory process, missed by echocardiography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203312437437">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961203312437437">32</xref></sup> Furthermore, CMR may detect subclinical, acute myocardial inflammation in SLE presenting without any increase of cardiac enzymes and/or blood inflammatory indexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312437437">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312437437">6</xref></sup> LGE persistence can also suggest ongoing chronic active myocarditis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961203312437437">33</xref></sup> The superior spatial resolution of MRI allows better tissue characterization that was not possible with nuclear and echo techniques and explains why this observation has not been reported previously. It is, however, consistent with reports of myocardial fibrosis based on post-mortem studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961203312437437">34</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec11-0961203312437437"><title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>Our study has the following limitations: 1) only SLE patients with mild cardiac findings seeking medical advice in our tertiary cardiac centre were included in the study and therefore final conclusions about the incidence of cardiac involvement in SLE cannot be drawn; 2) ECGs with Q in other leads were not available and were not included in the study; 3) myocardial biopsy data were not available in SLE with CMR evidence of inflammation (ethical reasons, due to mild clinical presentation of the disease); 3) long-term follow up in order to evaluate future cardiac events and the patients’ post treatment clinical situation was not available.</p>
<p>As a conclusion, Q in II, III, avF in SLE may indicate myocardial infarction, acute or past myocardial inflammation or be a positional finding. The lack of Q does not exclude the possibility of infarction or inflammation. CMR is superior to ECG and echocardiography to detect the pathophysiology of Q waves in SLE and guide treatment of heart involvement in these patients.</p></sec></sec>
