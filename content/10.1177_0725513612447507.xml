<italic>Thesis Eleven</italic> has always been a ‘slow’ journal. While the immediacy of everyday life and the widely observed acceleration of time affect all of us, we generally move closer to the rhythms of the <italic>longue durée</italic>. <italic>Thesis Eleven</italic> is not a magazine, and typically looks to taking the longer view. Sometimes things are different. Various cities, not least French and American, have burned over recent decades. Somehow the English events nevertheless managed to shock. Editorial discussions of the English riots, prompted by email correspondence from our Hull advisor Keith Tester, led to the conclusion that we should respond to the events. This issue opens with reflections from Tester, Bauman, Carroll and McDonald, offering different views of the riots and their implications. Sociology, it seems, still has its work cut out.</p>
<p>On the slower front, <italic>Thesis Eleven</italic> has long had a strong interest in rock music. Rock is not only the soundtrack to our formations. It is the carrier of hopes, dreams, and cultural traffic, ideas, sounds and messages that have been constitutive of modernity. Rock tells its own stories, in words, lyrics, sounds and visuals; its heart and soul is to be found in the live music scene, though it is mainly consumed in recorded form. This issue opens up onto some of these themes. Henshall tells the remarkable story of Clarksdale, Mississippi, putative home of the blues, and the attempts at urban revival there, combined with the struggle to keep memory and community intact without museumification of its culture. Oldham offers pioneering insight into the life and work and style of Australian rock guitar god Lobby Loyde, while Beilharz responds to his paper, working on both historical memory and on the records, both vinyl and historical. Walker, Hogan and Beilharz offer the first part of their two-part history of Australian rock music, working out of their research project, ‘Vinyl Age – the History of Rock Music in Australia, 1945–1995’. This part of the story is told through the medium of recording labels. It is a first attempt at periodizing and interpreting the Australian scene; Part Two follows in the next issue. The issue closes with an interview with Clinton Walker, whose contribution to Australian rock writing is on a par with Lobby Loyde’s contribution to its sonics. Rock on, or rock out!</p>
