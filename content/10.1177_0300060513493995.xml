<sec id="sec1-0300060513493995" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is defined as the involuntary loss of urine that occurs when intra-abdominal pressure exceeds urethral pressure, for example during coughing, sneezing or physical exertion. It is a common condition in women, with an incidence of 18.9% in those aged &gt;20 years in China,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300060513493995">1</xref></sup> and is a distressing problem with a profound impact on health-related quality of life.</p>
<p>Although the aetiology of SUI is unclear, urethral hypermobility and reduced periurethral connective tissue support (usually due to damage to functional extracellular matrix [ECM] in connective tissue) are considered important pathophysiological changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300060513493995">2</xref></sup> The functionality of ECM is maintained via the secretion of proteases and growth factors by connective tissue cells that modulate ECM remodelling (ECM metabolism).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300060513493995">3</xref></sup> Imbalances in ECM metabolism may therefore weaken the periurethral support structure, leading to a failure of pelvic support and increasing urethral hypermobility and involuntary urine leakage.</p>
<p>The ECM is a complex mixture of long chain proteins including collagen, elastin and proteoglycans. Collagen types I and III are the main structural components of ECM in periurethral support tissues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300060513493995">3</xref></sup> which include the anterior vaginal wall, pelvic fascia and ligaments. Collagen levels are reduced in the pelvic fascia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300060513493995">4</xref></sup> and anterior vaginal wall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300060513493995">5</xref></sup> in women with SUI, implicating abnormal collagen metabolism in the pathogenesis of SUI. Collagen is mainly synthesized by fibroblasts, which also secrete matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases that regulate collagen degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300060513493995">6</xref></sup> There are limited data regarding the role of fibroblasts in collagen metabolism in SUI, however.</p>
<p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are common intracellular signalling molecules that are involved in a broad range of cellular activities including meiosis, mitosis and postmitotic functions, and are responsible for controlling cell proliferation, differentiation and survival in eukaryotes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300060513493995">7</xref></sup> Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 are three major subfamilies of vertebrate MAPKs. Mammalian ERK has two main isoforms, ERK1 and ERK2, which play a pivotal role in a wide range of cellular activities in response to extracellular stimuli including mitogens, cytokines and growth factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300060513493995">7</xref></sup> In addition, the ERK1/2 signalling pathway is involved in the modulation of collagen metabolism in renal,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060513493995">8</xref></sup> cardiac,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300060513493995">9</xref></sup> systemic sclerosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300060513493995">10</xref></sup> gingival,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300060513493995">11</xref></sup> dermal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300060513493995">12</xref></sup> and pulmonary fibroblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300060513493995">13</xref></sup> However, the association between ERK1/2 in periurethral support tissue fibroblasts and SUI remains unclear.</p>
<p>The present study examined levels of phosphorylated (p)ERK1/2 (and therefore the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway) in the anterior vaginal wall of patients with SUI, and investigated the role of the ERK1/2 pathway in type I and III collagen synthesis by anterior vaginal fibroblasts in vitro, in order to elucidate the potential link between the ERK1/2 pathway and SUI pathogenesis.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0300060513493995"><title>Study population</title>
<p>Women diagnosed with SUI according to the recommendations of International Continence Society (ICS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300060513493995">14</xref></sup> who underwent tension-free vaginal tape surgery at the Department of Gynaecology, Women’s Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China between January 2007 and December 2010 were recruited to the study. Subjects without SUI or pelvic organ prolapse (POP) who were undergoing intravaginal cystectomy for vaginal wall cyst or radical hysterectomy for stage I cervical cancer were recruited as controls. Criteria for exclusion from the control group were: hormone replacement therapy within the previous 3 months; signs of urinary infection; oestrogen-related disease (endometriosis, myoma or functional ovarian tumour); clear clinical evidence of POP (≥grade 2); and urge incontinence. All participants were diagnosed via a combination of medical history, gynaecological examination, urinary stress test, ultrasonography and urodynamic examination, including POP-Q test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300060513493995">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Biopsy samples of the anterior vaginal wall were taken 1–2 cm from the uterine cervix, and included mucosa, submucosa, connective tissue and smooth muscle. A portion of tissue was fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemical analysis, and the remainder was frozen immediately at −80℃ for Western blot analysis.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Committee of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and all study participants provided written informed consent prior to biopsy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0300060513493995"><title>Phospho-ERK1/2 immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Paraffin wax-embedded vaginal wall tissue was cut into serial 4 -µm sections. Antigen retrieval was carried out by heating in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95℃ for 40 min. Sections were then incubated with rabbit antihuman p-ERK1/2 (1 : 100 dilution; Cell Signaling Techology, Danvers. MA, USA) for 1 h at 25℃, then washed three times with 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) at 25℃ for 3 min each wash. Immunohistochemical staining was visualized using a ChemMate EnVision™ kit HRP/DAB (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sections from known ERK1/2-positive breast cancers were used as a positive control, and either normal rabbit serum or the absence of primary antibody was used as negative control.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0300060513493995"><title>Phospho-ERK1/2 Western blotting</title>
<p>Total protein was extracted from vaginal tissue using T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent, and quantified using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (both Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Proteins (60 µg per sample) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and transferred to hybond-C pure nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at 25℃, then washed three times with 0.01 M Tris-buffered saline–Tween 20 (TBST; pH 7.5) at 25℃ (5 min each wash). After washing, membranes were incubated with rabbit antihuman ERK1/2 (1 : 1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit antihuman p-ERK1/2 (1 : 1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology) or rabbit antihuman β-actin (1 : 2000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology) for 12 h at 4℃, washed three times with TBST at 25℃ (5 min each wash), incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (1 : 10000 dilution; Pierce) for 1 h at 25℃, then washed again three times with TBST at 25℃ (5 min each wash). Protein complexes were visualized using a chemiluminescence system (Amersham) and Kodak X-OMAT film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA). The relative band densities were analysed using NIH Image (version 1.62; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/</ext-link>). ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 were quantified by reference to β-actin.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0300060513493995"><title>Fibroblast cell culture</title>
<p>Fibroblasts were prepared from fresh vaginal wall tissue of a single control subject as described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300060513493995">16</xref></sup> and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, at 37℃ in a humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide in air. Fibroblasts were identified according to morphology and the presence of vimentin. For identification of vimentin, cultured cells were fixed in formaldehyde for 20 min then incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide at 25℃ for 10 min, followed by mouse anti-human vimentin (1 : 1000 dilution; Boster Biological Engineering, Wuhan, China) overnight at 4℃. Cells were washed three times at 25℃ with PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4), incubated with rabbit antimouse immunoglobulin G (1 : 1000 dilution; Boster Biological Engineering) at 37℃ for 30 min, then washed again three times at 25℃ with PBS. Staining was visualized by incubation with streptavidin fluorescein at 37℃ for 30 min. Primary cell cultures in which &gt;95% of the cells were positively stained for vimentin were used in further experiments.</p>

RNA (500 ng) was reverse transcribed in a 200 -μl volume containing 1 µl oligo-dT primer, 1 μl dNTP mixture, 25 U RNase inhibitor and 200 U SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carslbad, CA, USA<bold>)</bold>. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using Primer Premier 6.0 and Beacon designer software (Premier Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The reaction mixture comprised 1 µl cDNA, 12.5 µl SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China), 0.5 µl each primer, and double distilled water to a final volume of 25 µl. Primer sequences were: human collagen I, 5′-GGTGTTGTGCGATGACGTGATCTGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTGGTCGGTGGGTGACTCTG-3′ (antisense); human collagen III, 5′-CCACGGAAACACTGGTGGACAGATT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAATGCCAGCTGCACATCAAGGACA-3′ (antisense); and human 18 S rRNA (control), 5′-GACTCAACACGGGAAACCTCAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCAGACAAATCGCTCCACCAAC-3′ (antisense). The cycling programme involved preliminary denaturation at 95℃ for 1 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95℃ for 10 s, annealing at 62℃ for 25 s, and elongation at 62℃ for 20 s, followed by a final elongation step at 70℃ for 5 min.</p>

<p>The present study found significantly lower levels of p-ERK1/2 in the anterior vaginal wall of women with SUI compared with control women. In addition, inhibition of ERK kinase using PD98059 significantly reduced collagen I and III mRNA and protein levels in primary human vaginal fibroblast cultures. These findings suggest that the ERK signalling pathway may play a role in the pathogenesis of SUI.</p>
<p>Both ERK1 and ERK2 are widely expressed in human tissue such as lung,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300060513493995">13</xref></sup> kidney,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060513493995">8</xref></sup> heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300060513493995">9</xref></sup> and brain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300060513493995">18</xref></sup> and the ERK1/2 signalling pathway is involved in the development of human diseases, including cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300060513493995">19</xref></sup> The role of ERK1/2 in pelvic support tissues and the pathology of female SUI remain unknown, however. The present study used anterior vaginal wall tissue since this is an important part of the periurethral support structure that has been examined by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300060513493995">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0300060513493995">21</xref></sup> Immunohistochemical staining of vaginal wall fibroblasts in the current study revealed high levels of ERK1/2. Taken together with the reduction in p-ERK1/2 protein in women with SUI compared with controls, this indicates that abnormalities in the ERK1/2 signalling pathway may play a role in the pathogenesis of SUI. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway is known to play key roles in the transmission of proliferative signals from membrane-bound receptors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300060513493995">22</xref></sup> and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 regulates the activities of several transcription factors (including c-myc and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein [CREB]). This leads to alterations in the transcription of genes that are important for fibroblast proliferation and differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0300060513493995">23</xref></sup> The ERK1/2 present in vaginal wall fibroblasts may therefore be important for fibroblast activation.</p>
<p>Abnormal collagen metabolism in SUI is well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300060513493995">5</xref></sup> Others have explored the role of ERK signalling in fibroblast collagen metabolism,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060513493995">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300060513493995"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300060513493995"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300060513493995"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300060513493995"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300060513493995">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300060513493995">17</xref></sup> but there are limited data regarding the involvement of ERK in collagen metabolism in pelvic support tissues. Collagen types I and III are important in maintaining tissue tensile strength and the mechanical stability of pelvic support tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0300060513493995">24</xref></sup> The ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059 binds to inactive ERK1/2 and prevents its activation by c-Raf, thereby inhibiting phosphorylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0300060513493995">25</xref></sup> Levels of collagen I and III mRNA and protein in primary human vaginal fibroblasts were significantly reduced by PD98059 treatment in the present study, suggesting that ERK1/2 signalling is crucial for collagen I and III synthesis in the pelvic floor. The activity of the ERK1/2 pathway is regulated by many different stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, viral infection, transforming agents and carcinogens, which can then influence collagen synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0300060513493995">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0300060513493995"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0300060513493995">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, female SUI is associated with reduced levels of p-ERK1/2 compared with controls, and inhibition of the ERK1/2 signalling pathway inhibits collagen types I and III synthesis in vaginal wall fibroblasts. It is possible that abnormalities in ERK1/2 activation may be involved in the pathogenesis of female SUI. Further, larger scale investigations are required to fully elucidate the influence of ERK1/2 on collagen metabolism in SUI.</p>
