<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Heat sensitivity and cognitive deficits are typical manifestations of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although cognitive deficits are quite well characterized, practically no data exist on the effects of heat on cognitive performances in MS.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To assess the effects of short-term heat stress on cognitive functioning in subjects with MS.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 23 heat-sensitive MS and 19 healthy control (HC) subjects participated. Moderate heat exposure took place in a Finnish sauna. Cognitive functioning was measured with tests of sustained attention and processing speed, the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT 3” and 2”) and the computerized visual vigilance test, before, during and after heat exposure.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> During the heat exposure, the core body temperature of the MS group rose significantly more (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002) than that of the HC group. The heat stress worsened the performance of the MS group in the PASAT 3” (<italic>p</italic> = 0.025) but not in the other cognitive measures. The performance in the PASAT 3” was reversed almost to the baseline level only 1- h after the heat exposure.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A significant increase in core body temperature during heat stress is associated with a mild and reversible worsening of the PASAT 3” performance, while visual vigilance performance seems to remain almost unaffected.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Heat sensitivity is a common feature in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511422926">1</xref></sup> Uthoff has already described changes in visual acuity and colour perception during heating. In addition to visual dysfunction and feelings of physical weakness, some patients report reversible problems in cognition after heat exposure. According to the current hypothesis, temperature-related reversible changes in core body temperature together with demyelination can cause nerve conduction block.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511422926">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cognitive problems are a common manifestation of MS, as 50–60% of patients are indicated to present at least mild cognitive impairments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511422926">3</xref></sup> It is suggested that neuropathological changes related to MS disturb the functioning of distributed neural network and, thus, cognitive functions such as information processing speed, attentional performances, and new learning are the most vulnerable cognitive processes in MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511422926">3</xref></sup> Processing slowness has been suggested to be the main reason for deficient performance in different cognitive tasks, such as the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), one of the most frequently used tests to assess cognitive performance in MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511422926">4</xref></sup> Because heat is thought to slow down conduction in the axons, it may also affect cognitive processing.</p>
<p>The cognitive performance of patients with MS has been shown to deteriorate towards the end of cognitive tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511422926">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511422926">7</xref></sup> This phenomenon has been interpreted as a sign of cognitive fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511422926">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511422926">7</xref></sup> Deterioration has been observed both during a 15 min-long computerized test of sustained attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511422926">5</xref></sup> as well as during the 3 min-long PASAT test with high processing and working memory demands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511422926">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511422926">7</xref></sup> The mechanisms underlying the performance deterioration during the tasks are not known; neither do we know whether heat affects or amplifies deterioration during sustained cognitive activity.</p>
<p>So far, the question of whether heat stress affects cognitive performance has not been addressed in MS. The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of sauna-induced short-term heat stress on attentional performance in heat-sensitive persons with MS. The question of whether heat provokes deterioration of cognitive performance during the tasks was also evaluated. Assessments were conducted at baseline, during and after heat exposure.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1352458511422926">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the local Health Care District and all study subjects gave informed consent for their participation. In total, 23 persons with MS showing self-perceived heat sensitivity participated in the study. They were recruited from among subjects admitted to inpatient rehabilitation at the Masku Neurological Rehabilitation Centre (Finland) and through the regional MS Association. The inclusion criteria were confirmed MS diagnosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511422926">8</xref></sup> relapsing–remitting or secondary progressive MS, a score of 0–5.5 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511422926">9</xref></sup> age between 20 and 55 years inclusive, and self-perceived heat sensitivity. The exclusion criteria were a relapse during the preceding month, cardiac disease, hypertension or significantly increased blood pressure (systolic pressure &gt; 160 mmHg, diastolic &gt; 95 mmHg), or other disease likely to preclude sustained heat exposure, signs of any other medical or mental condition precluding participation, and central nervous system disease other than MS. The three last- mentioned criteria were also applied to the healthy control (HC) group, which included 19 healthy volunteers matched to the MS subjects by sex, age, and education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1352458511422926">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Eligible subjects were either given a briefing or contacted by phone to explain the study protocol. The potential candidates were asked about their perceived sensitivity to heat by asking them whether heat causes them any problems. A neurological screening was then conducted including the verification of eligibility criteria, signing the informed consent and rating neurological impairment and disability using Kurtzke’s Functional System Scales and the EDSS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511422926">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the neurological screening, the subjects went through the entire test battery with the assessor to reduce practice effects during the initial measurements. On the day after the practice session, three actual assessments were performed beginning (with a few exceptions in the HC group) at about 9:00 am. The first was carried out prior to the heat exposure (= baseline), the second during heat exposure (= heat exposure), and the third 1 -h after it (= 1-h delay). The aggregate time was approximately 4 h. The baseline and delay measurements were performed in a separate laboratory at a room temperature of approximately 21°C/70°F.</p>
<p>The subjects were not allowed to eat after their breakfast before the actual sessions were completed. All fluids taken were standardized, and drinks including caffeine were prohibited before or during the testing. Once the subjects had completed the first and second measurement, they were advised not to fatigue themselves before the 1-h delay assessment. The experimental protocol was carefully pilot-tested first with healthy persons, and then with MS subjects. All the measurements were performed by a single assessor (AI).</p>
<sec id="section5-1352458511422926">
<title>Heat exposure</title>
<p>The heat exposure took place in a specially designed dry (humidity ≤ 5%) Finnish sauna. The subjects were dressed in swimming suits. In the first phase, the subjects rested, lying supine for 15 min and in the second, they sat on a chair for 20–25 min performing two cognitive tests. The mean temperature at head level was 39.6°C/103.3°F (range 30.0–46.1C°/86.0–115.0°F) in the first phase and 54.6°C/130.3°F (range 50.1–63.2°C/122.2–145.8°F) in the second phase. The visual acuity of the subjects was controlled both at the beginning of the session as well as before starting the cognitive tests. For the duration of the heat exposure, the subjects used a transportable heart rate monitor and were instructed to report their heart rate levels to the researcher who observed them continuously via the transparent door of the sauna.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1352458511422926">
<title>Body temperature</title>
<p>Core body temperature was measured using the VitalSense® telemetric physiological monitoring system (Mini Mitter Co., Inc., Bend, OR, USA). This invasive method consists of a receiver/monitor and a thermistor-based ingestible capsule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511422926">10</xref></sup> The method was chosen because it has shown at least an accuracy similar to that of rectal probe core temperature monitors, but is less prone to subject discomfort.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511422926">10</xref></sup> Subjects took the ingestible capsule in the morning, before the actual measurements.</p>

<title>Cognitive measures</title>
<sec id="section8-1352458511422926">
<title>The PASAT</title>
<p>The PASAT primarily measures ability to focus and sustain attention, and rapidly process information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511422926">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511422926">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511422926">14</xref></sup> In this test, the subjects were instructed to listen to 61 single digits presented at 3-s (3”) and at 2-s (2”) intervals. The subject was instructed to add all consecutive two digits in a row and give the answer to the examiner. The intra- and inter-rater reliability of the Finnish PASAT 3” version is good, although the test is prone to considerable practice effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511422926">15</xref></sup> Rosti-Otajärvi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511422926">15</xref></sup> have suggested two pre-baseline measurements for the PASAT 3” to compensate for the effects of practice. In the present study, the PASAT 3”and 2” were both practised twice, and the third presentation of the test served as the baseline performance. Two parallel versions of the test were used alternately. In the present study, the number of total correct calculations was used as a study variable. To evaluate whether heat provokes performance deterioration towards the end of the test, the number of correct calculations was recorded in three phases (1–20, 21–40, 41–60 calculations).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1352458511422926">
<title>The visual vigilance test</title>
<p>The visual vigilance test measures the ability to sustain attention for a longer time period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511422926">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511422926">16</xref></sup> The test is included in a computerized reaction time measurement program, the CogniSpeed®.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511422926">17</xref></sup> In this test, different letters are presented in the middle of the computer screen (heat-resistant Panasonic CF-29 laptop). The presentation time of the letters is 500 ms, and the interval between the letters 1000 ms. In the 15-min test, 600 letters are presented, of which 120 are target letters (Y, L). The order of the target letters changes in each presentation. The subjects were instructed to keep the preferred hand near the space bar and press it as soon as possible every time he or she saw the target letter. This test has been shown to be very easy for HCs, whereas even MS patients with relatively good overall cognition have shown signs of cognitive fatigue by slowing their performance towards the end of the test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511422926">5</xref></sup> In the present study, the subjects performed the visual vigilance test for 5 min during the practise session to familiarize themselves with the test and avoid practice effects during the initial test. The mean reaction times and total number of errors were used as study variables. To evaluate whether heat provokes performance deterioration towards the end of the test, the reaction times and errors were recorded separately in three 5-min phases (0–5 min, 5–10 min, 10–15 min).</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section10-1352458511422926">
<title>Other measurements</title>
<p>In addition to the cognitive measures, all the subjects performed physical measurements. The results of those will be reported elsewhere. The subjects filled in self-rating questionnaires evaluating their mood state (Center for Epidemiologic Studies – Depression, CES-D)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511422926">18</xref></sup> and subjective feelings of fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale, FSS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511422926">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511422926">20</xref></sup></p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section11-1352458511422926">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>The differences of the study groups in terms of gender were analysed with the χ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511422926">2</xref></sup> test, in terms of age, education and mood with the <italic>t</italic>-test, and in terms of core body temperatures with the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to evaluate the effects of group (MS vs. HC), assessment time (baseline, heat exposure, 1-h delay) and test phase (three consecutive test phases in each cognitive measure), as well as the interaction between these factors on the cognitive performance. If the interaction between group and assessment time was significant, tests of within-subject contrasts were performed to determine whether the performance change from baseline to heat exposure was different between the study groups. In the PASAT, the analyses were separately performed for the 3” and 2” versions, and in the visual vigilance test, for the reaction times and the number of errors. All the statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 16.0 for Windows software.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section13-1352458511422926">
<title>Background variables</title>
<p>Twenty four subjects with MS entered the neurological examination. Of these, one was excluded because of primary progressive MS. Thus, altogether five male and 18 female subjects with MS with a mean age of 42.3 (SD 7.0) years and a mean education of 13.7 (2.8) years participated. All had a relapsing–remitting disease course except for one with secondary progressive MS. Mean EDSS score was 2.9 (1.1; range 1.0–5.0) and mean disease duration 8.3 (5.0) years. The control group consisted of five male and 14 female subjects with a mean age of 40.6 (10.9) years and a mean education of 14.7 (2.6) years. The groups did not differ in either gender (<italic>p</italic> = 0.729), age (<italic>p</italic> = 0.560) or education (<italic>p</italic> = 0.270). The MS patients had more problems with their mood state on the CES-D than the healthy controls (MS 10.3 (7.5), HC 4.9 (4.0), <italic>p</italic> = 0.010). In the FSS, the patients scored on average 5.1 (1.1) points, indicating evident signs of subjective fatigue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1352458511422926">
<title>Core body temperature</title>
<p>Heat stress was well tolerated. No discomfort or considerable deterioration in signs or symptoms was observed or reported either during or after the heat exposure. The average increase in core body temperature was 0.5°C/32.9°F in the subjects with MS, and 0.2°C/32.4°F in the HC from the beginning to the end of the heat exposure (MS: at the beginning 37.2°C/99.0°F, at the end 37.7°C/99.9°F, after 1-h delay 37.4°C/99.3°F; HC: at the beginning 37.2°C/99.0°F, at the end 37.4°C/99.3°F, after 1-h delay 37.4°C/99.3°F). The core body temperature of the MS group was significantly higher than that of the HC at the end of the heat exposure (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002), but not at the beginning (<italic>p</italic> = 0.933) or after 1-h delay (<italic>p</italic> = 0.693).</p>

<title>Discusson</title>
<p>The results of this controlled study showed that the core body temperature of the MS patients rose significantly more than that of the HCs during heat stress in a Finnish sauna. In association with this, significant deterioration in PASAT 3” performance was observed in the MS group. In the other cognitive measures, heat stress did not show significant negative effects, although a tendency towards significance was observed in the processing speed measure of the visual vigilance test. The negative effects of heat on the PASAT 3” performance were short-lived, while the performance was reversed almost to baseline level within 1- h of the heat stress. Heat did not change the performance profile of the study groups differently during the tests.</p>
<p>In the present study, the patients with MS performed significantly more poorly than the HCs on the PASAT and on the visual vigilance test requiring sustained attention and high processing speed. This finding is consistent with previous observations about deficits in information processing and attention in MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511422926">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511422926">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511422926">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511422926">21</xref></sup> Although the patients with MS differed significantly from the HCs on the cognitive measures used, they did not exhibit remarkable cognitive decline, as seen as relatively high baseline scores in the PASAT 3”. In the present study, the effects of heat on cognitive performance in MS were not remarkable, while only the PASAT 3” performance deteriorated significantly from baseline assessment to that during heat exposure, and even then reversed almost to the baseline level within 1- h after the heat exposure. Heat did not affect either the PASAT 2” performance or accuracy in the 15 min-long visual vigilance test. Instead, processing speed in the visual vigilance test seemed to be slightly more vulnerable, while the MS group showed a tendency towards significant difference between the baseline performance and that observed during the heat exposure.</p>
<p>In patients with MS, deterioration in cognitive performance during sustained cognitive activity has been observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511422926">5</xref></sup>-<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511422926">7</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511422926">22</xref></sup> To evaluate whether heat provokes this phenomenon, we recorded the performance of the study subjects in three phases. In the present study, both groups performed differently at the different phases of the tests, manifested as significant main effects of test phase in the PASAT 3” and 2” and performance speed of the visual vigilance test. Almost consistently, the MS and HC group performed more poorly at the end than at the beginning of the tests. The effect was more pronounced in the MS than in the HC group in the PASAT 2”. This is in line with the finding of Schwid and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511422926">6</xref></sup> and Rosti and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511422926">7</xref></sup> that patients with MS may deteriorate their performance towards the end of the test more than HCs. Heat stress was observed to affect the performance profile of both study groups in the PASAT 3” but not in the other cognitive measures. Thus, heat did not change the performance profile of the MS patients differently than that of the HCs, and did not provoke deterioration towards the end of the tests.</p>
<p>Information processing and attention are known to be modulated by the distributed neural network, and temperature plays a critical role in nerve conduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511422926">1</xref></sup> An increase of as little as 0.5°C in core body temperature may cause a block in conduction in demyelinated axons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511422926">2</xref></sup> As myelin is lost, conduction fails at progressively lower temperatures, and with substantial amounts of demyelination, the blocking temperature is a steep function of the amount of myelin present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511422926">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511422926">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511422926">24</xref></sup> This theory applies relatively well to our findings, with a transient increase in core body temperature of 0.5°C accompanied by a slight and reversible decrement in the PASAT 3” performance. Interestingly, the negative effects of heat were only observed in the PASAT 3”, while the performance in the other cognitive measures remained more stable.</p>
<p>The cognitive measures were selected from those known to be sensitive to reflect MS-related cognitive impairments, namely attentional performance and information processing. However, the results of the four measures used to characterize the effects of heat stress on cognitive performance in MS were not consistent with each other. Firstly, heat affected performance in the PASAT 3” but not the PASAT 2”. This finding could be explained by the fact that while the formal validity and reliability as well as practice effects of the PASAT 3” are well characterized, the same does not hold true for the PASAT 2”. PASAT 3” performance has been observed to stabilize after two practice sessions in a Finnish sample of patients with relapsing–remitting MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511422926">15</xref></sup> However, the practice effects of the PASAT 2” are not known. It is possible that in a test which sets high demands on processing speed, working memory and attention, more practice rounds should have been used. Thus, two pre-baseline assessments were apparently enough for the PASAT 3” but not for the PASAT 2” to stabilize the performance before the actual measurements. The use of the visual vigilance test also showed some limitations. Although processing speed is known to be one of the most vulnerable cognitive domains in MS, heat did not have a significant effect on the processing speed of the visual vigilance test, although a tendency was observed. While the error rate in the test was observed to suffer from an almost floor effect, the test might be considered as too easy for patients with good overall cognitive capacities and not sufficiently sensitive to detect the negative effects of heat on cognitive performances. Moreover, the heterogeneous performances of the study subjects made it difficult to analyse the results using existing statistical procedures. Although some of the variables were not normally distributed, the repeated measurements were analysed using repeated measures analyses of variance due to the lack of corresponding non-parametric procedures. The above-mentioned limitations in the tests and statistical procedures should be borne in mind when interpreting the results of this preliminary study.</p>
<p>In the present study, the performances of the HC group remained relatively stable, showing minor and almost continuous improvement throughout the experiment. The results are well in line with those from studies on the effects of heat stress on healthy people, which have shown either stable performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511422926">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511422926">27</xref></sup> or improvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458511422926">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511422926">31</xref>-</sup>heat stress has also been shown to weaken the performance of HCs, especially in long-term exposure to high temperatures, using complex cognitive tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511422926">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1352458511422926">34</xref></sup> Detrimental effects on performances requiring vigilance and monitoring have been associated with a core body temperature higher than 37.5°C/99.5°F. In the present study, the heat stress was moderate, and consequently the core body temperature of the HCs rose to 37.4°C/99.3°F, just under the critical level of 37.5°C/99.5°F. Furthermore, the selection of cognitive measures in the present study was made on the basis of suitability for the MS population, not specifically for the HC subjects. Interestingly, the HCs showed minor problems of performance accuracy in the visual vigilance test at 1-h delay, the type of test evaluated as most sensitive to detect the negative effects of heat on cognitive performance in healthy subjects. Whether the detrimental effects of heat would have been more prominent and longer lasting in MS subjects, and whether the effects would also have been found in HCs at higher temperatures and during longer heat exposure, as well as in even more complicated cognitive tasks, remains to be clarified in further studies.</p>
<p>Our sauna experiment was based on pilot tests. We aimed to produce a reasonably long, moderate level of heat exposure to avoid excessive strain and total exhaustion. Furthermore, the experiments were always done at around noon to control for the changes in circadian body temperature patterns. We believe our aims with the thermal experiment protocol were achieved. No severe adverse effects were observed, and the 0.5°C/32.9°F increase in core body temperature in MS subjects during the heat stress provides evidence of a sufficient heat exposure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study provides novel evidence that an increase of 0.5°C/32.9°F in core body temperature during heat stress is associated with a mild and reversible worsening of attentional performance in patients with MS. The slightly negative effects of heat on attention observed in the present study can only be generalized for MS patients with relatively mild overall disability and for those who suffer from subjective heat sensitivity. We cannot rule out the possibility that heat affects differently other cognitive domains and patients with more severe disability.</p>
