<abstract>
<p>Cobia head protein hydrolysate (CHPH) with angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was prepared with papain. The 3 kDa ultrafiltration filtrate CHPH-IV of the hydrolysate exerted a potent ACE inhibitory activity with IC<sub>50</sub> being 0.24 mg/mL. The fractions with molecular weight located between 1749 Da and 173 Da represented up 66.96% of CHPH-IV, and those between 494 Da and 173 Da represented up 31.37% of CHPH-IV. It was found that the ACE inhibitory activity of CHPH-IV was intensified from IC<sub>50</sub> 0.24 mg/mL to 0.17 mg/mL after incubation with gastrointestinal proteases. The CHPH-IV significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner after oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) at dose of 150 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg and 1200 mg/kg body weight. These results suggested that CHPH-IV from cobia head protein hydrolysate by papain could serve as a source of peptides with antihypertensive activity in functional food industry.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1082013212442196" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hypertension, which affects 15–20% of all adults, is one of the major risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases, stroke and the end stage of renal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013212442196">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Angiotensin I converting enzyme (peptidyl carboxy peptidase, EC 3.4.15.1, ACE) belongs to the class of zinc proteases that needs zinc and chloride for activation. ACE plays an important and physiological role in regulating blood pressure. It converts an inactive form of decapeptides, angiotensin I, to a potent vasopressor octapeptide, angiotensin II, and inactivates catalytic function of bradykinin. Therefore, inhibition of ACE is considered to be an important therapeutic approach for controlling hypertension. Many synthetic ACE inhibitors such as captopril, enalapril, alacepril and lisinopril were used in the treatment of essential hypertension and heart failure in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013212442196">Ondetti, 1977</xref>). However, some undesirable side effects may occur such as cough, lost of taste, renal impairment and angioneurotic edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013212442196">Antonios and MacGregor, 1995</xref>). The peptides derived from food proteins are considered to be milder and safer compared with synthetic drugs. Many studies have been directed toward enzymatic hydrolysates of different food proteins, including casein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013212442196">Silva and Malcata, 2005</xref>), mushroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013212442196">Lee et al., 2005</xref>), whey protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1082013212442196">Vermeirssen, 2004</xref>), porcine muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013212442196">Arihara, 2001</xref>), chicken muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013212442196">Fujita et al., 2000</xref>), soybean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013212442196">Kuba et al., 2005</xref>) and fish protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013212442196">Ono et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Fish by-products are usually discarded as processing waste or used for animal feed because of its poor functional properties. Recognition of the limited biological resources and the increasing environmental pollution have emphasized the need for better utilization of by-product from the fisheries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013212442196">Guerard et al., 2005</xref>). Fish by-products are considered as a safe material and provide proteins with high nutritional properties and a good pattern of essential amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013212442196">Shahidi et al., 1995</xref>). These by-products are very important bioresources that might be utilized for applications in food, health care products and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, the use of fish by-products has been of increasing interest for years. Many studies especially paid attention to prepare bioactive peptides using enzymatic hydrolysis from fish by-products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013212442196">Byun and Kim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013212442196">Je et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013212442196">Qian et al., 2007</xref>). Recent studies have identified a number of bioactive compounds or bioactive peptides with health benefits such as antioxidative activity, antihypertensive activity, from fish skin, fish frame and fish bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013212442196">Je et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013212442196">Kim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013212442196">Lee et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Cobia, <italic>Rachycentron canadum</italic>, is a large, migratory, coastal pelagic fish of the monotypic family <italic>Rachycentridae</italic>, which is distributed worldwide in tropical and subtropical seas, with the exception of the eastern Pacific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013212442196">Ditty and Shaw, 1992</xref>). In China, the cobia-farming regions are located in the southern areas, namely Guangdong and Hainan provinces. China’s total output is 19,634 tons in 2006, ranking first in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013212442196">FAO, 2009</xref>). Cobia was consumed now mainly as fillets and sashimi. A sizeable amount of by-products including head, skin, viscera and bone is generated during fillets processing and can be as high as 40–50% of the original material. Furthermore, Cobia head takes about 20–25% of the original material. And with the amount of 45.38% protein on a dry weight basis, cobia head can serve as an additional source of protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013212442196">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). The objective of this study was to prepare papain hydrolysate from cobia head protein with angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory activity. We also determined the molecular weight distribution of high activity fraction of the hydrolysate and assessed its antihypertensive action by oral administration in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).</p>

<p>Fresh cobia (<italic>Rachycentron canadum</italic>) head used was provided by ZhanJiang GuoLian Aquatic Products Co., Ltd., (Guangdong China) in November 2008. After washing with water, the cobia heads were immediately grinded and packed (about 100 g per bag) and stored at −20 °C until use.</p>
<p>Papain (650,000 U/g) was purchased from Pangbo Biological Engineering Co., Ltd (Nanning, China), pepsin and pancreatin were purchased from Shanghai Biochemical Company (Shanghai, China). ACE (from rabbit lung), HHL (Hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine), and captopril were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Other reagents used were of analytical grade.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1082013212442196"><title>Preparation of cobia head protein hydrolysate</title>
<p>Hydrolysate of cobia head was produced according to pilot-study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013212442196">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>). The cobia head was ground and homogenized with two volumes of distilled water, then poured into a reaction vessel. The pH was adjusted to 6.0 and the system was incubated in a water bath of 73 °C. The enzymatic hydrolysis was started by adding 0.35% (by weight of raw material) papain with stirring. The reaction was terminated after 4 h and the reaction system was heated at 100 °C in a water bath for 15 min to inactivate the protease, followed by cooling to room temperature and pH was adjusted to 8.3. The resulting solution was centrifuged at 4 °C, 5000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min and the supernatant was collected for further analysis. The hydrolysate solution was separated into four fractions (CHPH-I, &gt; 8 kDa; CHPH-II, 8–5 kDa; CHPH-III 5–3 kDa, CHPH-IV, &lt; 3 kDa) using an ultrafiltration membrane bioreactor system (Millipore, USA). The ultrafiltration was performed at 0.25 MPa, 4 °C. CHPH-IV was collected, lyophilized and stored at −20 °C until further analysis within a month.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1082013212442196"><title>Determination of ACE inhibitory activity</title>
<p>ACE inhibitory activity was assayed using the spectrophotometric assay of Cushman and Cheung (1976) with some modification. A 50 µL sample solution was mixed with 50 µL of 5 mM HHL as substrate containing 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.3) and 500 mM NaCl and then pre-incubated at 37 °C for 6 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition 50 µL of 25 mU/mL ACE solution in a buffer containing 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.3) and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 150 µL of 1.0 M HCl. The liberated hippuric acid was extracted with 1 mL of ethyl acetate. The mixture was centrifuged and 0.5 mL of ethyl acetate layer was transferred to a fresh test tube and evaporated to dryness on a water bath for 15 min at 100 °C. The residue containing hippuric acid was dissolved in 3 mL deionized water and the solution was measured using a UV visible spectrophotometer (UV-1700, Shimadzu Co., Japan) at 228 nm against deionized water as a blank. The ACE inhibitory activity was also expressed as IC<sub>50</sub>. The IC<sub>50</sub> value was defined as the concentration of inhibitor (soluble protein) required to inhibit 50% of the ACE activity. The soluble protein content of the samples was determined using the Folin-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013212442196">Lowry method (1951)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1082013212442196"><title>Simulation of gastrointestinal digestion</title>
<p>The stability of the ACE inhibitory peptide against gastrointestinal proteases was assessed in vitro. The lyophilized sample CHPH-IV (1 mg/mL) was individually digested with pepsin (pH 2.5, 37 °C, 3 h) with stirring, in a ratio of substrate to enzyme (200:1, w/w) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013212442196">Hernandez-Ledesma et al., 2004</xref>) and the digests were used for ACE inhibitory activity determination. Moreover, the samples were successively hydrolyzed with pepsin (pH 2.5, 37 °C, 3 h) and pancreatin (pH 8.0, 37 °C, 4 h) with stirring in a ratio of substrate to enzyme (200:1, w/w) and the digests were used for ACE inhibitory activity determination also.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1082013212442196"><title>Stability of CHPH-IV for ACE</title>
<p>A 50 µL aliquot CHPH-IV was incubated with 50 µL of 50 mU/mL of ACE at 37 °C for 3 h. IC<sub>50</sub> values were compared with that of before and after pre-incubation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1082013212442196"><title>Determination of molecular weight distribution</title>
<p>The molecular weight distribution of CHPH-IV was analyzed by high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) using Waters-PROTEIN-PAK 60 column. The mobile phase was 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). Its flow rate was 0.7 mL/min. Detection was performed by UV-light absorption at 214 nm, and the whole system was maintained at constant temperature 25 °C. After the equilibration between mobile phase and packing was established, the aliquot of 10 µL samples was injected into HPSEC apparatus (Waters 600E, Waters Co., Milford, USA) for analysis. A molecular weight calibration curve was obtained from the following standards from Biorad: Triosephosphate-isomerase (MW 26,625 Da), Myoglobin (MW 16,950 Da), Aprotinin (MW 6512 Da), Insulin-B (MW 3496 Da), Bacitracin (MW 1423 Da), HHL (MW 423 Da). This yielded a near linear correlation between the retention time (<italic>t</italic>) and the log of the molecular mass (Mr) of peptides. The regression equation was: log  Mr = - 0.244 <italic>t</italic> + 6.652(<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.9691).</p>

<sec id="sec9-1082013212442196"><title>Antihypertensive action in spontaneously hypertensive rats</title>
<p>Thirty spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (9-week-old, male, SPF, 279 ± 3 g) with tail systolic blood pressure (SBP) over 170 mm Hg were obtained from Slac Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Rats were housed in a room kept at 23 ± 1 °C with a relative humidity of 50% and a 12 h light-dark cycle, and fed with standard laboratory diet. Tap water was freely available. The lyophilized CHPH-IV was dissolved in distilled water and orally administered to rats at a dose of 150 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg and 1200 mg/kg body weight (BW), respectively. The positive control group was administered a commercial antihypertensive drug, captopril, at a dosage of 4 mg/kg BW. The negative group was administered the distilled water only. All of the products were orally administered in 2 mL of water. The SBP of the rats was measured at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 24 h after administration of the peptides using the tail-cuff method with a programmable electro-sphygmomanometer (BP-98A; Softron Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) after warming the rats in a chamber maintained at 37 °C for 15–20 min.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1082013212442196"><title>Effect of ultrafiltration on the ACE inhibitory activity of CHPH</title>
<p>Ultrafiltration has been widely used to fractionate fish hydrolysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013212442196">Chabeaud et al., 2009</xref>) or fish by-product protein hydrolysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013212442196">Lee et al., 2010</xref>) with the aim of their functional properties or enhancing bioactive peptides. Cobia head protein was hydrolyzed with papain. The protein hydrolysate obtained was separated into four fractions CHPH-I (&gt;8 kDa), CHPH–II (8–5 kDa), CHPH-III (5–3 kDa) and CHPH-IV (&lt;3 kDa) using an ultrafiltration membrane bioreactor system. The ACE inhibitory activity of CHPH and the four molecular weight fractions were shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013212442196">Table 1</xref>. The ACE inhibitory activities of the hydrolysates varied with the MW distribution, the inhibitory activity increased as the molecular weight decreased. Among the all MW groups, CHPH-IV exerted the most potent ACE inhibitory activity with IC50 value being 0.24 mg/mL. CHPH -III also exhibited higher activity (IC50 0.36 mg/mL) compared to CHPH. Bioactive peptides usually contain 3–20 amino acid residues and low MW peptides are more potent as bioactive peptides than high MW peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1082013212442196">Pihlanto, 2000</xref>). ACE inhibitors derived from food proteins are usually short peptides with molecular weight lower than 1.5 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013212442196">Oshima et al., 1979</xref>). Therefore, we selected CHPH-IV to investigate further.

<p>In order to check the inhibitory character of the isolated peptides, IC<sub>50</sub> values of CHPH-IV were determined before and after pre-incubation with ACE. It was found that pre-incubation did not change the inhibitory activity of the CHPH-IV, and IC<sub>50</sub> values for the CHPH-IV before and after pre-incubation with ACE were 0.24 and 0.21 mg/mL, respectively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013212442196">Fujita et al. (2000)</xref> classified ACE inhibitory peptides into three types, based on changes in ACE inhibitory activity after the peptides were digested by ACE. Substrate type peptides are those which show a decrease in ACE inhibitory activity after being digested by ACE. The inhibitory activity of the inhibitor type peptide is not significantly affected by ACE digestion. The pro-drug type peptides are those which show an increase in ACE inhibitory activity after ACE digestion. It has also been reported that the substrate type peptides do not affect the blood pressure of SHR, but the inhibitor and pro-drug type peptides produce a reduction in blood pressure values. We would class CHPH-IV as an inhibitor type peptide and we suggest that CHPH-IV has antihypertensive activity in vivo.</p>

<p>Not all of the ACE inhibitory activity peptides in vitro have antihypertensive activity in vivo. It is of crucial importance that ACE inhibitory peptides remain active during gastrointestinal digestion. Gastrointestinal enzyme incubation in vitro provided an easy process to imitate the fate of these peptides under oral administration. The stability of CHPH-IV against gastrointestinal proteases in vitro was examined in order to predict the antihypertensive effect in vivo. The ACE inhibitory activity of the peptide showed a change after in vitro incubation with gastrointestinal proteases. The results showed that the ACE inhibitory activity of CHPH-IV was increased from IC<sub>50</sub> 0.24 to 0.15 mg/mL after pepsin digestion, and from IC<sub>50</sub> 0.24 to 0.17 mg/mL after a successive digestion with pepsin and pancreatin.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013212442196">Grimble and Silk (1989)</xref> suggested that intact dipeptides or tripeptides could be transported from the intestinal lumen into the blood circulation. Many researchers found that other short peptides with peptide length more than three could also be absorbed into the blood circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013212442196">Langguth et al., 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1082013212442196">Zhao et al. (2009)</xref> reported that the inhibitory activity of the peptide isolated from <italic>Acaudina molpadioidea</italic> hydrolysate was intensified from IC<sub>50</sub> 15.9 to IC<sub>50</sub> 5.3 mM after pepsin digestion and increased from IC<sub>50</sub> 15.9 to IC<sub>50</sub> 4.5 mM following further chymotrypsin digestion. This inhibitory peptide from <italic>A. molpadioidea</italic> showed a clear antihypertensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats. So, intensification of the ACE inhibitory activity was found after gastrointestinal proteases treatments, which indicated that CHPH-IV may have a potential antihypertensive effect.</p>

<sec id="sec16-1082013212442196"><title>Antihypertensive effect of CHPH-IV in SHR</title>
<p>Antihypertensive effect of CHPH-IV and captopril were evaluated by measuring changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHR at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h after oral administration as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013212442196">Figure 2</xref>. There was no change in SBP in the negative control group during the investigation period. The oral administration of captoril, caused significantly decrease in SBP at 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after administration. Three concentrations of CHPH-IV could all significantly decrease the SBP in SHR compared with negative group in a dose-dependent manner after oral administration 2 to 8 h. The decreases in SBP caused by 1200 mg/kg of CHPH-IV at 4, 6 and 8 h after oral administration were even greater than that caused by 4 mg/kg of captopril contrasting with negative control group, and showed significant difference compared with positive group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The maximum decreases of 57 mmHg in SBP caused by 1200 mg/kg of CHPH-IV was observed at 4 h post-administration. The decreases in SBP caused by 600 mg/kg of CHPH-IV at 6 and 8 h were also greater than that caused by 4 mg/kg of captopril contrasting with negative control group but had insignificant difference compared with positive group. Heart rates of these SHR were also measured after oral administration. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1082013212442196">Figure 3</xref>, there was no significant change in the heart rate of SHR at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after oral administration. Moreover, in order to investigated the antihypertensive activity of CHPH-IV to normotensive rats, six wistar-kyoto rats (WKY, 9-week-old, male, SPF, 283 ± 7 g, SBP &lt; 120 mm Hg) were administered CHPH-IV at a dose of 600 mg/kg. The results showed that CHPH-IV did not modify the SBP of WKY (data not shown).

<p>CHPH-IV of Cobia head protein papain hydrolysate exerted a potent inhibitory activity to ACE in vitro and decreased the systolic blood pressure of SHR after oral administration. It is also important that the administration of CHPH-IV did not change the systolic blood pressure of the normotensive WKY rats. Therefore, CHPH-IV from Cobia head protein papain hydrolysate could be very useful in the preparation of antihypertensive peptides. A further research on the purification of ACE inhibitory peptides from CHPH-IV is undergoing.</p>
