<abstract>
<p>Established in the early 1970s, the talent search model has garnered strong theoretical and programming support for addressing the academic needs of highly able students. The two main components of the talent search model are discovery (identification) and development (programming) of academic talent. Discovery of academically talented elementary and middle school students occurs via the process of above-level testing, usually offered through university-based centers. The essence of talent search program intervention is acceleration, which has robust research support as the most effective intervention for high-ability students. Whereas talent search identification and programming are university based, talent search participants receive nearly all of their instruction in K-12 settings, where academic acceleration is less likely to be implemented. In this investigation, a large sample of talent search participants (<italic>n</italic> = 5,844) were asked questions designed to measure the various ways in which the students study mathematics, science, and language arts (writing and reading) in the K-12 setting. More than two thirds of the study sample reported that they were taught in the regular classroom, learning the same material, at the same level and pace as nongifted peers. The type of curriculum differentiation or program delivery model (e.g., small-group instruction) reported by the students varied according to subject area, with the greatest percentage of reports of differentiated delivery in mathematics. Main effects were found for gender, grade, and ability. Implications for school-based accelerative interventions are presented.</p>

<p>Julian C. Stanley, founder of the talent search model, adapted Robert Browning’s quote, “A [person’s] reach should exceed his [or her] grasp, or what’s a heaven for?” as an apt metaphor for the above-level testing approach to identifying and serving gifted students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0016986213479654">Colangelo, Assouline, &amp; Gross, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0016986213479654">Stanley, Keating, and Fox (1974)</xref> referred to the talent search model as a three-dimensional model: Discovery, Description, and Development. Discovery identifies students who are academically able through the process of above-level testing (for a detailed explanation of the talent search model, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0016986213479654">Brody, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0016986213479654">Lupkowski-Shoplik, Benbow, Assouline, &amp; Brody, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0016986213479654">Olszewski-Kubilius, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Discovery of talent is a necessary, but not sufficient, component of gifted education. Once discovered, educators should be committed to the development (program intervention) of talent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0016986213479654">Bloom, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0016986213479654">Bloom &amp; Sosniak, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0016986213479654">Csikszentmihalyi, Rathunde, &amp; Whalen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0016986213479654">Rogers, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0016986213479654">Olszewski-Kubilius &amp; Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0016986213479654">Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, &amp; Worrell, 2011</xref>). Within the talent search model, the process of talent development is best informed through the description of the talent search participants’ characteristics, which include their cognitive profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0016986213479654">Swiatek, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0016986213479654">Swiatek, Lupkowski-Shoplik, &amp; O’Donoghue, 2000</xref>) as well as their learning environments.</p>
<p>A major advantage of the talent search model for developing academic talent is the coherence between assessment of aptitude (discovery) and program intervention (development), which is designed to further develop that aptitude, typically through accelerative experiences. However, the typical K-12 educational system presents talent search participants with an educational paradox in that the delivery of curriculum is not likely to parallel the needs of the students, as revealed through above-level testing. In other words, talent search participants, who are discovered through university-based above-level testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0016986213479654">Assouline &amp; Lupkowski-Shoplik, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0016986213479654">Stanley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0016986213479654">Warne, 2012</xref>), spend only a limited time—or have limited access to—university-based programs, which rely on academic acceleration as a major programming option. These same students experience the vast majority of instruction in the K-12 classroom, where accelerative strategies are limited. A major goal of this study is to determine how talent search participants report the ways in which they study the content areas measured by the talent search model (verbal, quantitative, and science reasoning).</p>
<p>Ironically, it is typically through the K-12 school setting that information about talent search testing is made available to students and their parents. However, educators do not usually use the above-level scores obtained through the above-level testing to inform their educational practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0016986213479654">Olszewski-Kubilius &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>). Fewer than 10% of the educators in Olszewski-Kubilius’ and Lee’s study used talent search scores to program for their students despite significant efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0016986213479654">Olszewski-Kubilius, 2005</xref>) to influence schools. The disconnect between the information revealed by students’ above-level test scores and actual school-based programming is an unfortunate waste of valuable information that could provide important data for more differentiated programming that aligns the learner’s needs with the academic program.</p>
<p>One of the most comprehensive resources regarding gifted program models is available in the exhaustive second edition of the edited book <italic>Systems and Models for Developing Programs for the Gifted and Talented</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0016986213479654">Renzulli, Gubbins, McMillen, Eckert, &amp; Little, 2009</xref>). Gifted programming typically offers an array of options that may range from project-oriented enrichment pullout programs, usually provided at the elementary and middle school level, to content-specific acceleration (e.g., math), which is more common in middle and high school. A major aim of the current study is to increase awareness regarding the degree to which the learning environment, as reported by the student, matches the student’s academic needs. A second aim is to inform educators about the usefulness of above-level test information in developing challenging programs for high-ability learners.</p>

<title>Discovering High-Ability Learners Through Above-Level Testing</title>
<p>Above-level testing is the foundation of the talent search model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0016986213479654">Brody, 2009</xref>). The talent search process is a two-step process that begins with recommending high achieving students, as determined via a grade-level, standardized achievement test, for above-level testing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0016986213479654">Figure 1</xref> captures the effect of the two-step process, which is to take students who appear to be very similar in academic performance, based on grade-level test scores (represented by the shaded area under Bell Curve 1), and differentiate among them (represented by the area under Bell Curve 2). Curve 1 depicts the normal curve generated by grade-level achievement testing, which is designed to reveal what students have already learned. Gifted students will typically hit the ceiling on a grade-level achievement test because the items are insufficiently difficult to differentiate between them. Above-level testing, which includes items on content that represent material that has not been formally taught, reveals to educators and parents what students are ready to learn next.</p>

<p>The first talent search occurred in the early 1970s. Participants were junior high students who took the SAT, a college entrance exam developed for 11th- and 12th-grade college-bound students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0016986213479654">Assouline &amp; Lupkowski-Shoplik, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0016986213479654">Brody, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0016986213479654">Stanley (1990)</xref> chose to use the SAT with high-ability junior high students because it effectively allowed them to demonstrate their reasoning abilities in content in which they had not received formal instruction. In the mid-1980s, the ACT, a college entrance exam designed for 11th and 12th graders, became another above-level option for junior high–age students and in the 1990s, EXPLORE, a test for 8th graders, was added as an option for elementary students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0016986213479654">Lupkowski-Shoplik et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-0016986213479654">
<title>Describing Characteristics of High-Ability Learners</title>
<p>Performance on the above-level test is of primary importance to the talent search model. Early research (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0016986213479654">Bartkovich &amp; Mezynski, 1981</xref>) looked at the appropriateness of using high performance on grade-level tests to recommend students for above-level testing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0016986213479654">Olszewski-Kubilius (2004)</xref> offered a succinct description of the strong performance of talent search participants on the above-level test:
<disp-quote>
<p>A substantial percentage score extremely well-above the means for the students for whom the test was designed. . . . These data indicate that above-level testing is not too difficult for these students and significant proportions of students who score at the top of in-grade-level achievement tests have knowledge and abilities similar to students three to five years older. (p. 70)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We believe that this is an absolutely critical piece of information for educational programming.</p>
<p>The tests that are used for talent searches measure student aptitude in verbal and quantitative reasoning, as well as (for ACT tests) science reasoning. From the beginning, researchers have been interested in how gender affects student performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0016986213479654">Benbow (1988)</xref> detailed gender differences, specifically emphasizing the fact that boys outperform girls in the area of mathematics. Several decades later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0016986213479654">Olszewski-Kubilius and Lee (2011)</xref> examined talent search participants’ scores on the SAT, ACT, and EXPLORE tests. They found gender differences for every year from 2000 to 2008, with males outperforming females on the SAT, ACT, and EXPLORE mathematics tests and the EXPLORE science test. Females outperformed males on the verbal portion of the SAT and on the English and Reading tests for ACT and EXPLORE. Although all these differences were statistically significant, the effect sizes, which represent differences between average scores of talent search participants, were very small.</p>
<p>When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0016986213479654">Olszewski-Kubilius and Lee (2011)</xref> parsed the talent search scores into various ranges of performance to determine the presence of gender differences, they found that the proportion of males increased in relation to the proportion of females at the higher score ranges on the math tests. For the verbal tests, the reverse was found in the higher score ranges; there was an increase in proportion of females relative to the proportion of males. Simply stated, the more extreme the math/science scores, the greater the difference favoring boys. The more extreme the verbal scores, the greater the difference favoring girls.</p>
<sec id="section3-0016986213479654">
<title>Learning environment</title>
<p>Determining academic readiness so that it can be matched with academic challenge is one component to ensuring a stimulating learning environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0016986213479654">Robinson &amp; Robinson, 1982</xref>). Unfortunately, this may not be a fundamental component of today’s learning environment. Twenty plus years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0016986213479654">Archambault et al. (1993)</xref> determined that this principle was not adhered to:
<disp-quote>
<p>The most salient survey finding [of classroom teachers] is that third and fourth grade teachers who responded to this survey [of classroom practices for educating gifted and talented students] made only minor modifications to the regular curriculum to meet the needs of gifted students. (p. 104)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fast forward 20 years for a more current view of the learning environment vis-à-vis gifted education through an examination of the Council of State Directors of Programs for the Gifted (CSDPGP) and the National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC)’s 2010-2011 <italic>State of the States in Gifted Education National Policy and Practice Data</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0016986213479654">CSDPG &amp; NAGC, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>At almost every grade level, the regular classroom is one of the most-used delivery methods for gifted services. It was the most frequently named method for pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten . . . and second most frequently named in early elementary . . . upper elementary . . . and middle school. (p. 13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The resource room, which is typically associated with pullout programs, is reported by more than half of the respondents to be the most frequently used delivery model in upper elementary.</p>
<p>In the same document, we reviewed the responses from Iowa and Florida regarding gifted programming, including the reported top delivery models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0016986213479654">CSDPG &amp; NAGC, 2011</xref>). Approximately 96% of the participants in our sample came from Iowa (53%) and Florida (43%); the remaining 4% were from 20 other states. Both Iowa and Florida have a state mandate for gifted, and both include the provision of services in the mandate. Iowa’s top delivery systems are reported to be the regular classroom, telescoping, resource room, and cluster classrooms. Florida’s top delivery systems include resource room, gifted content courses, regular classroom, cluster grouping, and magnet schools; see the <italic>State of the States</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0016986213479654">CSDPG &amp; NAGC, 2011</xref>) for a detailed discussion regarding the 18 delivery model options presented on the <italic>State of the States</italic> questionnaire.</p>
<p>We also believe that it is equally relevant to consider what learning environment the <italic>student</italic> prefers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0016986213479654">Kanevsky (2011)</xref> created a scale, the <italic>Possibilities for Learning</italic> survey, which allowed students to provide input on their preferences for categories that the author labeled as pace, collaborative learning, choice, curriculum content, evaluation, open-ended activities, expert knowledge, teacher–student relationships, and sharing learning. Besides compiling lists of common preferences, Kanevsky also compared the responses of gifted students with those of students who had not been identified as gifted. Not surprisingly, she found that gifted students were much more interested in learning about complex curriculum content, including topics that might be considered unusual; understanding at an expert level; getting more challenges; going more in-depth into material; working at a faster pace; learning about connections between ideas; and choosing how to demonstrate what they had learned.</p>
<p>In addition to the differences in learning the material, the gifted students also had differences in how they wanted to interact with other students. The gifted students were more interested in working in groups sometimes and alone sometimes; had less of a dislike of sitting alone, teaching other kids, and sharing their work with adults outside of school; and had more of a dislike of asking for help. Based on these findings, many gifted children desire to have a more rigorous learning environment, which could be attained through various methods of acceleration, an intervention that has been demonstrated to be highly effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0016986213479654">Colangelo et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Developing High-Ability Learners</title>
<p>What role do schools have in developing academic talent? In a prescient article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0016986213479654">Bloom and Sosniak (1981)</xref> challenged professionals to consider “schooling” in its traditional sense and the relationship to developing excellence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0016986213479654">Bloom’s (1985)</xref> seminal book, <italic>Developing Talent in Young People</italic>, highlighted what neurobiologists, mathematicians, artists, athletes, and other talented individuals required to develop their talents. Bloom’s work also exposed the lack of academic challenge and advancement for high-ability students as deficiencies of schools in developing talent. Through reports like PISA 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0016986213479654">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2010</xref>), we have well-documented evidence of decreased momentum of U.S. students in math and science, which suggests that we have not addressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0016986213479654">Bloom’s (1985)</xref> challenge from more than a quarter of a century ago.</p>
<p>A review of the literature suggests that the integration of the talent search model into the K-12 framework is rare (see Reznulli et al., 2009, for an extensive discussion of various program models). However, we did find one instance of a regional group of school districts that incorporated the major components of the talent search model into the K-12 setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0016986213479654">McCarthy, 1998</xref>). McCarthy explained that the classes offered through the Academically Talented Youth Program, which focused on the areas of math and English, adhered to the philosophical principles of talent searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0016986213479654">Lupkowski-Shoplik et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0016986213479654">Olszewski-Kubilius, 2004</xref>), especially in terms of content acceleration. Despite the widespread acceptance of this program, which was literally integrated into the school structure, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0016986213479654">McCarthy (1998)</xref> determined that there was still misinformation and misunderstanding about the talent search model and the role that the various components of the model (i.e., above-level testing) could play in differentiating the curriculum for highly able students.</p>
<p><italic>A Nation Deceived: How Schools Hold Back America’s Brightest Students</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0016986213479654">Colangelo et al., 2004</xref>) put to rest any equivocation regarding the effectiveness of the educational intervention known as academic acceleration. Academic acceleration represents a set of educational interventions that moves students through an educational program at a faster than usual rate or younger than typical age and exposes students to complex, challenging curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0016986213479654">Colangelo et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0016986213479654">Rogers’s (2007)</xref> research synthesis left no doubts regarding acceleration as critical for bringing together suitable learning environments and content areas of strength. The types of acceleration that were especially effective in promoting the development of potential included challenging the student in the specific area(s) of talent on a daily basis, such as having an entire class of students with similar ability; providing gifted students opportunities to work independently on content in which they are gifted and have an interest; offering single-subject or whole-grade acceleration; grouping gifted students with like-ability peers, which can be in a small group within a classroom, grouping for a single subject, or grouping all the time in a separate classroom; teaching at a faster pace with less practice and review; and approaching topics at a more conceptual level. Rogers found one unhelpful instructional technique was pairing high- and low-ability students.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0016986213479654">Lubinski (2004)</xref> highlighted the long-range effects of academic acceleration for highly able students in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). Among those students who were accelerated, many expressed one main regret about their acceleration: They did not have additional opportunities for more acceleration. Longitudinal investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0016986213479654">Wai, Lubinski, Benbow, &amp; Steiger, 2010</xref>) make salient the point that instructional “dosage” matters: “Rare accomplishments in STEM appear to emanate from rich talent development opportunities experienced early in life” (p. 870). Academic acceleration is the foundation of educational interventions that promote high expectations and excellence, especially in STEM.</p>

<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>The primary purpose of this investigation was to determine, through student self-report, the frequency of various school-based delivery models for mathematics, science, and language arts that were reported by a sample of highly able students who participated in a university-based academic talent search. We also evaluated the differences between boys and girls on their performance on talent search above-level tests of English, reading, mathematics, and science and used these data to establish high and low performers in order to determine whether there were differences in academic programming according to ability level, grade level, and gender.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The overall talent search sample included 6,280 gifted students (Grades 4-6) who qualified for and participated in a university-based academic talent search program during the 2005, 2006, and 2009 academic years. Student participants in this talent search sample came from 22 different states; however, 53% came from Iowa and 43% came from Florida.</p>
<p>The study sample participants completing the survey (<italic>n</italic> = 5,844) comprised 93.1% of the talent search sample tested in 2005, 2006, and 2009. Talent search participants scored at the 95th percentile or above on one or more sections of a grade level test, such as the <italic>Iowa Tests of Basic Skills</italic> (renamed the <italic>Iowa Assessments</italic> in 2011), or on a state proficiency test, such those administered by Florida and Illinois. The participants completed the EXPLORE test, which was developed for eighth-grade students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0016986213479654">ACT, Inc., 1997</xref>), as an above-level test.</p>
<p>The study sample was composed of students in Grade 4 (41.0%; <italic>n</italic> = 2,395), Grade 5 (33.6%; <italic>n</italic> = 1,962), and Grade 6 (25.4%; <italic>n</italic> = 1,487). Boys represented 53.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 3,104) of the sample and girls represented 46.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 2,735); five respondents did not indicate gender. The 2005 test registration form did not ask participants to indicate their ethnicities. Among 2006 and 2009 cohorts (<italic>n</italic> = 2,911), participants were predominantly White (68.2%; <italic>n</italic> = 1,986); 14.7 % (<italic>n</italic> = 428) of the participants did not indicate their ethnicity/race correctly, or preferred not to respond. The remaining subgroups identified themselves as Hispanic American (6.2%; <italic>n</italic> = 180; Mexican American/Chicano/Puerto Rican/Cuban/Other Hispanic Origin), Asian American/Pacific Islander (4.8%; <italic>n</italic> = 139), multiracial/mixed (3.6%; <italic>n</italic> = 104), African American/Black (2.4%; <italic>n</italic> = 70), and American Indian/Alaskan Native (0.1%; <italic>n</italic> = 4).</p>

<title>Materials and Procedures</title>
<p>At the beginning of each academic year, students who have earned high scores (e.g., 95th percentile or higher) on a grade-level test receive talent search invitation/recruitment materials, which are prepared by university-based talent searches and sent to schools for personnel to distribute to qualified students. Students take the invitation to participate in the talent search home to their parents, and students’ parents register them for the talent search program several weeks prior to the testing session. Testing typically takes place on a Saturday morning. For the EXPLORE test, there are two national testing dates.</p>
<p>The EXPLORE assessment is a multiple-choice test that was developed in the early 1990s by ACT, Inc., as part of their suite of academic assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0016986213479654">ACT, 1997</xref>). EXPLORE includes four tests designed to measure academic development in the four content areas of English, mathematics, reading, and science. Each test is timed and must be completed within 30 minutes. The total testing time involved is approximately 2 hours. Scores for each of the four tests are reported on a scale of 1 to 25. Scores from all four tests are averaged to generate a composite score, which is also reported on a scale of 1 to 25.</p>
<p>Prior to the administration of the four academic tests, students have the option of responding to 12 nontest items, which are developed locally (i.e., the questions are not formulated by ACT), in this case by the various talent search organizations. This short survey is referred to as the “Local Item Survey” component portion of the EXPLORE assessment and takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>The 12 forced-choice items from the Local Items Survey include items related to students’ perception about academic challenge, perception of their talent areas, and perceived expectations of parents. Of the 12 forced-choice items, there were 3 specific items, 1 for each of the content areas of mathematics (M), science (S), and language arts (LA; assessed with two of the four EXPLORE tests: English and reading) that addressed instructional delivery. Each item had 5 possible responses regarding instructional delivery and students could indicate all that applied; therefore, there were 15 possible responses that were analyzed for the study. The five responses, which corresponded to instructional delivery choices, for each item were the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0016986213479654" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>I am in the regular classroom learning the same (M/LA/S) as everyone else; this choice represented the <italic>regular classroom</italic>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I work in a small group with other students who are good in (M/LA/S) within the regular classroom; this choice represented <italic>ability grouping</italic>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I have M/LA/S in a special class with other gifted (M/LA/S) students; this choice represented a <italic>pullout</italic> option.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I work at a higher grade level for (M/LA/S; mark this even if you also work at a higher grade level for other subjects); this choice represented <italic>single-subject</italic> or <italic>whole-grade acceleration</italic>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I work individually with a teacher or other adult to study (M/LA/S) that is advanced (more challenging); this choice represented <italic>individual tutoring or distance learning</italic>.</p></list-item></list>
<sec id="section9-0016986213479654">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The Local Item Survey is completed prior to the administration of the four EXPLORE tests. On completion of all 12 local items, test proctors distribute the EXPLORE tests and students take all four EXPLORE tests (English, mathematics, reading, and science). Test proctors collect all of the materials and return them to ACT for scoring; although ACT does not develop the Local Item Survey, it does score the responses. About 1 month after the completion of the test, the individual score report and a university-generated score interpretation guide are sent from ACT to the student’s home. The score report does not include information about the student responses to the Local Item Survey because that information is sent only to the talent search organization.</p>
<p>Talent search participants’ group scores and data from the Local Item Survey were accessed after the study investigators received institutional review board approval from their university. The three items from the Local Item Survey that were used for this investigation were asked only during the academic years of 2005, 2006, and 2009. Students’ scores from EXPLORE were also obtained from the same years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0016986213479654">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Although optional, the Local Item Survey was completed by 93.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 5,844) of the participants who tested in 2005, 2006, and 2009. Students’ performance scores on the EXPLORE tests were used as variables to determine how the instructional methods of the participants vary as a function of aptitude, as measured by performance on the EXPLORE tests. The data analyses were completed using SPSS 19. Descriptive statistics and frequency distribution analyses were conducted for the demographic variables, for the EXPLORE scores, and to determine the percentage of students responding to the choices for each of the three items from the Local Item Survey. The data were grouped and compared in three categories: grade, gender, and EXPLORE score quartiles for mathematics, science, reading, and English. Chi-square tests were used to compare the instructional method choices for each subject by gender, grade, and quartile level. To report effect size, we included Cohen’s <italic>w</italic> for the chi-square analysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0016986213479654">Kirk (1996)</xref> recommended a descriptive interpretation of small, medium, and large effect size when ω<sup>2</sup> = .010, .059, and .138, respectively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0016986213479654">Cohen (1988)</xref> recommended a descriptive interpretation of small, moderate, and large effect size when <italic>w</italic> = .1, .3, and .5 respectively.

<p>In responding to each question, participants were able to choose multiple options concerning instructional method. Because students could choose multiple answers, considerable numbers of students selected the regular class option along with one or more of the other instructional options for gifted students. Regarding the other instructional options, grade skipping and pullout classes were the most commonly indicated instructional delivery method, whereas tutoring was the least commonly reported method. Mathematics had the highest percentage of students indicating more than one instructional method (36.9%); language arts had the second highest percentage selecting more than one instructional method (27.8%), and science had the lowest percentage selecting more than one instructional method (17.7%). Therefore, in math especially, students reported that they did participate in differentiated (i.e., gifted programming) delivery systems of instruction.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0016986213479654">Table 3</xref> reports the percentages of boys’ and girls’ responses and chi-square values for each category of instructional method. Gender differences in the instructional methods were largest for mathematics among all categories except for ability grouping.

Boys were more likely to receive grade skipping, pullout class, and tutoring, whereas fewer boys than girls indicated that they received math instruction in a regular class. It should be noted that the gender differences were statistically significant; however, they were not large, as revealed by the small effect sizes.

<p>Proportions of students indicating the regular class were similar between fourth and fifth graders and decreased from fifth to sixth graders in all three subjects. Interestingly, this pattern also was apparent for ability grouping for all three subjects. The percentages selecting ability grouping decreased considerably from fifth to sixth grades in all three subjects.</p>
<p>However, students in higher grades indicated grade skipping more for mathematics and science; the increases were larger between fifth and sixth grades, compared with those between fourth and fifth. The grade gap among students selecting grade skipping was not significant for language arts.</p>
<p>The gaps between grades for students indicating pullout classes were significant for all subjects. The proportion choosing the pullout class option increased gradually as grade increased for mathematics and language arts. However, the response for science pullout classes decreased from fourth to fifth grade, and then increased considerably from fifth to sixth. Last, there were no significant differences for the tutoring option in all three subjects.</p>
<p>To investigate the relationship between student-reported instructional method and above-level test performance, top and bottom quartile groups for each aptitude area were selected and matched to the choices of the instructional methods on the related subjects. In other words, performances on mathematics and science reasoning tests were matched to the choices of mathematics and science instructional methods. Both the performance on English and reading areas were matched to the instructional method indicated for language arts.</p>
<p>As presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0016986213479654">Table 5</xref>, there are significant differences between the top and bottom quartile groups relative to the type of instruction they received. Proportionately fewer students in the top quartile group of all content areas indicated receiving instruction in the regular class, and more indicated instruction in a pullout class than bottom quartile groups. In addition, students in all top quartile groups indicated grade skipping significantly more than bottom quartile groups, except for reading, although reading approached statistical significant difference, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, 3039) = 3.512, <italic>p</italic> = .061. Consequently, proportionately more students in the top quartile reported opportunities to learn through the pullout class and grade skipping than the bottom quartile groups in all content areas.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Over the past several decades, school-based gifted and talent programs have made considerable progress in effectively identifying and serving academically gifted students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0016986213479654">Archambault et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0016986213479654">Renzulli, et al., 2009</xref>). However, for a variety of reasons (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0016986213479654">Assouline &amp; Lupkowski-Shoplik, 2012</xref>), one of the most research supported identification models, the talent search model, has not found its way into the vast majority of K-12 settings. The talent search model implements above-level testing as its primary vehicle for discovering highly able students. The results from the above-level testing are descriptive of the learner and provide information relative to developing students’ academic talent. The talent search has proven its effectiveness and removed the mystery regarding who is ready for more challenge and in which areas.</p>
<p>However, “who is ready” is only part of the equation. Once we have discovered “who,” we need to describe and develop the talent. We need mechanisms to document “what” delivery models are effective and to determine whether they are being used. This, too, is no longer a mystery. There is ample research indicating that high-ability students need modifications to the regular curriculum in order to have their learning needs met. This modification has two major forms: enrichment and acceleration. The latter has proven itself exceptionally valid for the development of academic talent. More than half a century of robust research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0016986213479654">Colangelo et al., 2004</xref>) has revealed that acceleration is the most effective delivery model for high-ability students. In fact, the pattern is quite clear, the higher the ability, the more necessary the acceleration.</p>
<p>The purpose of this investigation was to provide a portrait of the kinds of instructional delivery models experienced by upper elementary talent search students in math, language arts, and science. The majority of students in our sample reported that for all three content areas, they are receiving instruction in the regular classroom, learning the same material with same-age peers. This finding corresponds to the data presented in the 2010-2011 <italic>State of the States in Gifted Education</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0016986213479654">CSDPG &amp; NAGC, 2011</xref>): The regular classroom is a common delivery model for upper elementary students. Combined, these findings indicate that in elementary schools, there does not seem to be straightforward alignment of delivery of high-level content that matches high ability. This is disconcerting because the regular curriculum was not established with these students in mind. The regular curriculum functions best for students who fall into the large—and important—group known as “regular” students; their learning needs are commensurate with their age and grade. The regular curriculum is on display exactly where it belongs, in the typical, heterogeneous classroom.</p>
<p>The regular curriculum and the heterogeneous classroom are not the problem. The problem, as highlighted by the results of this study, is that those students who are of high ability (nearly 7 out of 10) in the elementary school grades are spending their time in the regular classroom for their core subjects such as math, science, and language arts. The pace of the regular classroom is too slow for highly able students. The complexity of the content is not sufficient. Although there is nothing wrong with the regular curriculum, what is “wrong” is the mismatch between academic readiness of gifted students and the level and pace of curriculum of the regular classroom. What is “wrong” is that there is a model, the talent search model, which has proven effective at differentiating the needs of high-ability students, yet the model is not implemented in schools.</p>
<p>As mentioned, nearly 7 out of 10 students who qualified for, and participated in, talent search testing (thus, they had achievement levels at the 95th percentile or higher on grade-level tests) indicated the regular class as an instructional option. However, our data did reveal that close to 31% of the sample report differentiated delivery models, and we found some unique patterns for instructional delivery according to content, ability, grade level, and gender.</p>
<p>Math is the content area with the lowest percentage of students reporting instruction delivered in regular classes (68.6% total; 72.1% of girls and 65.5% of boys, which was a significant difference), and the highest percentage reporting one or more of the gifted interventions (29.7% of boys and 26.22% of girls, which was a significant difference), indicated they received math instruction in a pullout class setting. Although the differences were statistically significant, the effect sizes were small; nevertheless, they reveal a long-standing pattern of differences in math programming between boys and girls.</p>
<p>Math was also the content area with the highest percentages of differentiation reported by the top quartile in math. Although there were fewer girls than boys in the top quartile in math, there were no significant differences in percentages reporting any of the instructional delivery methods.</p>
<p>Science was the content area with the highest percentage of students reporting instruction in the regular classroom (87%, with no significant difference between boys and girls). Not surprising, science was the area with the smallest percentages of students reporting one or more of the gifted interventions (12.6% for grade skipping was the highest). However, sixth graders had the lowest (80.2%) percentage reporting instruction in the regular class, whereas the fifth graders had the largest percentage (90.6%) reporting regular class. In general, these finding point to a lack of coherence in the science programming for high-ability elementary students.</p>
<p>Percentages reporting gifted instructional interventions for language arts were between math and science (79.4% reporting regular class, with no differences between boys and girls). Smaller percentages of students in fifth and sixth grade reported instruction in the regular class for math and language arts.</p>
<sec id="section16-0016986213479654">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are important limitations to the study. A major limitation is that the sample is not nationally representative. Because 96% of the participants came from two states, Iowa (53%) and Florida (43%), generalization to the variety of delivery models across the United States is not possible. This sample represents a convenience sample of talent search participant in Iowa and Florida. However, both Iowa and Florida are among the 31 reported (out of 45) states that have a mandate for gifted and talented services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0016986213479654">CSDPG &amp; NAGC, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>An additional limitation is related to the small number of items that were asked about instructional delivery related to content areas. There was only one item per content area (math, language arts, and science). For each item, students had five options regarding instructional delivery model and they could choose all that applied.</p>
<p>Finally, this study relied on students’ self-reporting of the ways in which they study math, language arts, or science. The items used limited educational jargon (e.g., ability grouping); rather, the students could choose among responses that described the learning environment (e.g., “I work in a small group with other students who are good in language arts within the regular language arts classroom”). Nevertheless, the degree to which we can rely on students accurately describing their learning environment is a limitation. Because the responses corresponded with the reported program delivery methods in the <italic>State of the States</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0016986213479654">CSDPG &amp; NAGC, 2011</xref>), we believe that the students’ self-reports of the learning environment are likely reliable. Future research might also look at student-perceived level of challenge as it relates to self-reported learning environment and above-level test performance.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Despite the fact that more than four decades of talent search research reveal that above-level testing is a particularly valid system for discovering academic talent, it is not used in schools. This highlights an unfortunate disparity between research and educational practice. The talent search model has documented what teachers of gifted and talented students have been saying for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0016986213479654">Archambault et al., 1993</xref>): One size does not fit all, and the differences among gifted students require tailored educational opportunities. The jury has ruled: Differentiation is necessary and the greater the extremes in ability, the more important accelerative opportunities are to develop talent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0016986213479654">Colangelo et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This investigation revealed that the everyday school life of nearly 7 out of 10 high-ability students is spent in learning environments that are not suitable to their learning needs. Although some of the results were slightly promising in that there are pockets of differentiation (e.g., high ability in math), the opportunities likely are not systematically implemented. In math, fewer girls earn scores in the upper quartile—and those who do earn scores in the upper percentiles are still less likely to be involved in gifted programming. Any school reform measure has to take this into account.</p>
<p>With the widespread concern about STEM, it is remarkable that 87% of upper elementary students who are highly capable in science are taking science in the regular classroom. These results run counter to what we know is important in developing STEM to the highest levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0016986213479654">National Science Board, 2010</xref>). The results for math were slightly promising; however, the results for science were discouraging. Differentiation in science is virtually nonexistent. Science is a critical part of STEM (the first letter in the STEM acronym); however, our capable students do not receive appropriate challenges in science during the formative elementary school years.</p>
<p>In the past, the field had limited evidence to indicate what it needed to serve academically advanced students. However, a body of research now demonstrates that accelerative strategies are effective. It’s been more than three decades since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0016986213479654">Bloom and Sosniak (1981)</xref> challenged educators regarding the role of schools in developing talent. In 1993, Archambault et al. detailed the lack of differentiation, despite clear evidence of the necessity. In 2004, Colangelo et al. highlighted the importance of acceleration as a highly effective intervention for gifted students. Current results reveal that we remain guilty of not doing what we know is effective for high-ability students, especially in science. The mystery that now needs to be solved is: Why are so many bright students academically misplaced when we know <italic>exactly</italic> what they need?</p>
