<p><bold>Background:</bold> We assessed the clinical outcomes of symptomatic and asymptomatic coronary heart disease (CHD) with type 2 diabetic patients.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> Population-based cohort study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study sample consisted of 380 men and 546 women, aged ≥30 years. Silent CHD was defined using Minnesota coding criteria on baseline electrocardiogram (ECG), in the absence of a history of CHD and symptoms of angina. Participants were categorized into four groups: group 1, participants with no CHD symptoms and with normal ECG; group 2, silent CHD; group 3, participants with symptomatic CHD but with normal ECG; group 4, participants with symptomatic CHD and ECG-determined CHD. Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CHD events for these groups, with group 1 as the reference.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> During median follow up of 9.2 years, we ascertained 226 CVD events (202 CHD). In the multivariable-adjusted model, among men, HRs (95% CI) of CVD events were 2.32 (1.29–4.16), 2.56 (1.47–4.46), and 3.97 (2.24–7.02) for groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively; the corresponding figures among women were 1.19 (0.65–2.18), 1.90 (1.24–2.92), and 1.92 (1.02–3.62) respectively. Similar results were achieved for CHD events.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In both sexes, symptomatic CHD was an independent predictor of recurrent CVD/CHD, regardless of ECG results. In diabetic men with asymptomatic CHD, ECG could be of prognostic value for incident CVD/CHD. The present study provides evidence-based support only in men for the ADA recommendation of ‘further cardiac testing for diabetic patients with an abnormal resting ECG’.</p>

<p>The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (hereafter diabetes) is increasing worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711428065">1</xref></sup> Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in diabetic patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711428065">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diabetic men and women, using glucose-lowering medications, have been shown to harbour coronary heart disease (CHD) risk comparable to non-diabetic patients with CHD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711428065">3</xref></sup> In patients with diabetes, pain response to ischaemia is often blunted and leads to CHD without symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711428065">4</xref></sup> Silent myocardial ischaemia is a major public health issue, the early detection of which can significantly reduce CVD morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711428065">5</xref></sup> The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended cardiac testing ‘for diabetic patients with typical or atypical cardiac symptoms or an abnormal resting electrocardiogram (ECG)’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711428065">6</xref></sup> However, there are limited data available evaluating the performance of these guidelines in a clinical setting. To best of our knowledge, there is no epidemiological data justifying such approach among Middle Eastern populations with high prevalence of CVD risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711428065">7</xref></sup> Using data from a large community-based cohort of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS), we investigated the prevalence and long-term clinical outcomes of symptomatic and silent CHD among diabetic patients.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1741826711428065"><title>Study population</title>
<p>Details of the TLGS have been reported elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711428065">8</xref></sup> The TLGS is a prospective study aimed at determining the risk factors and outcomes for non-communicable disease. It has been conducted on a representative sample of 15,005 residents of district-13 of Tehran, aged 3 years and over.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711428065">8</xref></sup> Participants were categorized into the cohort and intervention groups, the latter to be educated for implementation of life style changes. Of 1358 diabetic individuals aged ≥30 years at baseline (1999−2001), those with missing data on ECG, history of CHD, and Rose questionnaire were excluded, leaving 1023 diabetic individuals; of whom 926 (380 males and 546 females) completed the followed up (response rate ≈90%) until March 2009 (median of 9.2 years) (supplementary material Figure 1). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and the ethical committee of the Research Institute for Endocrine Sciences approved this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711428065"><title>Clinical and laboratory measurements</title>
<p>A trained interviewer collected information which included demographic data, medical history, family history of CVD, medication use, physical activity status, and smoking habits, using a validated questionnaire. Applying a Farsi version of the Rose questionnaire, history of any chest pain was assessed during the interviews. Weight, height, waist circumference (WC), and blood pressure were measured according to the standard methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711428065">8</xref></sup> Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by square of height (m<sup>2</sup>). A 12-lead resting ECG was recorded by two trained technicians according to a standard recording protocol developed by the School of Public Health, University of Minnesota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711428065">9</xref></sup> using a PC-ECG 1200 machine. Two trained physicians coded the ECGs independently according to the Minnesota codes using a measuring loupe specially manufactured by University of Minnesota.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711428065">10</xref></sup> For assurance of quality, a third trained physician recoded 10% of ECGs and all the data were doubly entered and rechecked. Rose angina score was measured for participants who had pain over anterior or left lateral sternum or radiating to the left arm, during exertion which forced the person to stop and went away in less than 10 minutes after he/she had stopped. Rose questionnaire data are interpreted according to previously published guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711428065">11</xref></sup> All blood analyses were done at the TLGS research laboratory on the day of blood collection on a fasting sample. Plasma glucose levels, serum total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and serum triglycerides (TGs) were measured using previously reported methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711428065">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711428065"><title>Definition of terms</title>
<p>In accordance with ADA criteria, diabetes was defined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711428065">12</xref></sup> as fasting plasma glucose ≥7 mmol/l, 2 h post-challenge plasma glucose ≥11.1 mmol/l, and current use of anti-diabetic drugs. Diabetes was also ascertained in participants who answered yes to the following question ‘have you ever been told by a doctor that you have diabetes (high blood sugar disease)?’ Family history of premature CVD reflected any prior diagnosis of CVD in female first-degree relatives aged less than 65 years or male first-degree relatives under the age of 55 years. Smoking was defined as history of current smoking. Physical activity was categorized to three groups: vigorous, those who had hard physical activity at least 3 times a week; moderate, those who had hard physical activity at least once a week regularly; none, those without any regular hard physical activity. Self-reported CHD was defined as a positive answer to the question as to ‘whether the subject has ever had a prior diagnosis of CHD by a physician’. Patients were defined as having symptomatic CHD if they had a self–reported history or symptoms of angina in the Rose questionnaire. ECG determined CHD was defined according to the Minnesota code<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711428065">13</xref></sup> and Whitehall criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711428065">14</xref></sup> which categorize subjects into three groups: probable CHD, which included major Q or QS wave (Minnesota codes 1.1, 1.2) or complete left-bundle branch block (Minnesota code 7.1.1); possible CHD, which included small Q or QS wave (Minnesota code 1.3), ST depression (Minnesota codes 4.1–4.3), or T-wave items (Minnesota codes 5.1–5.3); and no CHD (ECGs that had none of these criteria).</p>
<p>To investigate the sex-specific combined effect of symptoms and ECG on the development of CVD, a joint symptom/ECG variable was created. Hence, participants were divided into groups based on both their symptoms and ECG results: group 1 participants with no CHD symptoms and with normal ECG; group 2: participants with no CHD symptoms but with ECG-determined CHD (silent CHD); group 3: participants with symptomatic CHD but with normal ECG; group 4: participants with symptomatic CHD and ECG-determined CHD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711428065"><title>Definition of CHD and CVD outcomes</title>
<p>Details of the collection of cardiovascular outcomes have been published earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711428065">15</xref></sup> Each participant of the TLGS was followed up for any medical event during the previous year initially by telephone call; the participant was questioned regarding any medical conditions leading to hospitalization by a trained nurse and then, during a home visit, a trained physician collected complementary data regarding that event and confirmed the data acquired with medical files. Data collected were then evaluated by an outcome committee to assign a specific outcome for every event according to ICD-10 criteria and American Heart Association classification for cardiovascular events. The ischaemic heart disease (ICD10 rubric I20−I25) and cerebrovascular diseases (ICD10 rubric I60−I69) were used to define CVD outcomes. The CVD outcomes included definite and probable myocardial infarction, angiographically proven CHD, unstable angina and stroke, as defined elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711428065">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711428065">15</xref></sup> Death from CHD or stroke was confirmed by reviewing by the death certificate and reconfirmation by medical records.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711428065"><title>Statistics</title>
<p>Data are presented as mean±standard deviation for continuous variable and frequencies for categorical variables. TG/HDL-C had a skewed distribution and was shown as median (interquartile range). Comparability between the participants and non participants was assessed using a propensity score analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711428065">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Baseline characteristics of participants were recorded for the four symptom/ECG groups as well as among those with and without incident CVD, using ANOVA or Chi-squared test or Mann−Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test, as appropriate.</p>
<p>Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of incident CHD and CVD events for each defined groups with the first group as the reference. Follow- up duration was defined as the period between entrance to study and the end points in each analysis. End points were considered as the CVD/CHD events and censoring was defined as leaving the residence area, non-CVD death, lost to follow up, or until end of follow up. Candidate covariates were age, smoking status, level of physical activity, family history of premature CVD, life style intervention, BMI, WC, total cholesterol, TG/HDL-C, lipid-lowering drugs, and antihypertensive drugs. Those covariates with a <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.2 in the initial univariate analysis were included in the multivariable analysis.</p>
<p>We also assessed, the number needed to screen (NNTS), to identify one person who will develop incident CVD/CHD. NNTS was calculated by inverting the absolute risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711428065">17</xref></sup> as follows: NNTS=(incidence<sub>exposure</sub>−incidence<sub>reference</sub>)<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>The proportional hazards assumption in the Cox model was assessed using log-log plot of survival and Schoenfeld residual test. All proportional hazards assumptions were appropriate.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 15 and <italic>p</italic>-values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741826711428065" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Among men, participants had lower TG/HDL-C (2.9 vs. 3.7; <italic>p</italic> = 0.027) than non-participants. Among women, participants were younger (53.9 vs. 56.5 years; <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) and had lower SBP (134.2 vs. 138.7 mmHg; <italic>p</italic> = 0.014) but higher BMI (30.0 vs. 28.9 kg/m<sup>2;</sup> <italic>p</italic> = 0.004) and had higher WC (97.4 vs. 94.4 cm; <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) compared with non-participants. All of these measures were included in a logistic model with participation as the outcome. The probability of participation was then estimated and used as a propensity score. We added this propensity score to the survival models as a covariate and examined if the probability of participation was associated with incident CVD/CHD events. The probability of participation was not associated with incident CVD/CHD events and the parameter estimates remained essentially unchanged. The selection bias, therefore, might have not affected our estimations.</p>
<p>The final sample consisted of 926 diabetic patients with the mean age of 57.9 and 53.9 years for men and women, respectively. At baseline, among men 10 and 69 patients had probable and possible CHD; the corresponding values among women were 11 and 81 cases, respectively. Furthermore, at baseline, 51 and 47 men had angina according to the Rose questionnaire and physician-reported diagnosis of CHD, respectively; 21 men were to be detected by either approach. Among women, the corresponding values were 89 and 59, respectively, with 27 women meeting both criteria.</p>
<p>Baseline characteristics for different groups of ECG/Rose variable are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711428065">Table 1</xref>. As compared to individuals in group 2, those in group 3 had significantly higher SBP in men and higher WC in women.

Comparisons between baseline characteristics of the participants who did/did not develop incident CVD are shown in supplementary material <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711428065">Table 1A</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711428065">Table 2</xref> presents the sex-specific HRs of incident CVD for each group. In men, as compared to the first group, the other groups had significant risk of incident CVD in age-adjusted models. After further adjustment for potential risk factors, the HRs attenuated but was still significant. As such, that the men in group 4 had an almost fourfold risk of CVD.

<p>Diabetic women with silent CHD had no risk for incident CVD compared with those in group 1, in both age- and multivariable-adjusted models. The women in groups 3 and 4 had an approximately twofold risk of incident CVD in the age- and multivariate-adjusted models.</p>
<p>Supplementary material <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711428065">Table 2A</xref> presents HRs of incident CHD in the four groups of diabetic men and women. Diabetic men in groups 2, 3, and 4 had significant HRs of CHD, compared to group 1 in age- and multivariable-analyses. In women, patients in group 2 were not at greater risk of CHD than those in group 1; however, women in groups 3 and 4 were almost two times as likely to have CHD as those in the first group. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711428065">Table 2</xref> and supplementary material <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711428065">Table 2A</xref> also show number need to screen to find a diabetic patient, who will develop CVD/CHD events, in different risk groups with different screening approach.</p>
<p>We found significant interaction between symptom/ECG groups and sex in prediction of CVD/CHD (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in multivariate analysis.</p>
<p>As an ancillary analysis, we repeated the analyses after further excluding participants who self-reported CHD. Isolated angina (Rose + /ECG −), conferred a risk for CVD. The results, however, achieved statistical significance only among men (men: multivariate HR 3.45, 95% CI 1.74–6.87; women: multivariate HR 1.6, 95% CI 0.92–2.78).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1741826711428065" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>We demonstrated the prevalence of silent CHD, as diagnosed by resting ECG, on a diabetic population, to be 11.3% (men 11.8% vs. women 11%). Silent CHD was an independent predictor of CHD/CVD events only among men. Furthermore, in both sexes, symptomatic CHD was an independent predictor of recurrent CVD/CHD, regardless of ECG results.</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported a broad range of prevalence rates for silent CHD among diabetic patients, ranging from 16 to 59%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711428065">18</xref></sup> It is well known that silent myocardial ischaemia is more common in diabetic patients than non-diabetic ones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711428065">4</xref></sup> In the present study, only 43% and %35 of diabetic men and women, with ECG evidence of ischaemia had symptomatic CHD, respectively.</p>
<p>In our data analysis, the risk of CVD or CHD events was almost similar between diabetic men with silent CHD and those with symptomatic CHD, whereas silent ischaemia was not a risk factor for development of CHD/CVD in women. This could be explained by non-specific ECG abnormalities used to define CHD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711428065">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, 60% of the TLGS diabetic women had central obesity (as defined by WC ≥95 cm);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711428065">20</xref></sup> it has been shown that some minor ECG changes and false-positive criteria for inferior myocardial infarction are more prevalent among obese individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711428065">21</xref></sup> Arthur et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711428065">22</xref></sup> reported that geometric changes come with obesity may have a major effect on ECG. Therefore, subsequent misclassification might have contributed to the attenuation of associations. Sex differences in the validity of self-reported information on angina using the Rose questionnaire could represent another possible explanation for these findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711428065">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our results among men are in line with studies reporting the presence of silent myocardial ischaemia in diabetic patients have the same risk of CHD events as those with symptomatic angina.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711428065">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711428065">25</xref></sup> In the Fremantle Diabetes Study, however, silent myocardial infarction had a prognosis similar to that in patients without a history of CHD or Q waves at ECG in the baseline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711428065">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The NNTSs reported here can help healthcare providers to decide on screening approaches they might take. For example, we have shown that among women compared with screening for combined symptomatic and ECG-determined CHD (i.e. group 4), at least five times as many people need to be screened for ECG-determined CHD (group 2) to detect a CVD event.</p>
<p>First, as is the case in majority of population-based studies, we did not have data regarding exercise tolerance testing or thallium scanning for diagnosis of silent CHD in asymptomatic diabetic patients. Second, there was no detailed information about the duration of diabetes, degree of diabetic control, or the presence of diabetic organ damages. Third, our study sample comprised middle-aged Persian men and women; we cannot, therefore, make inferences beyond a similar group.</p>
<p>As for strengths, the diabetic patients were not selected from those referred from hospital or clinics for further cardiac testing based on clinical circumstance. Since, this was a population-based study with continuous monitoring for CVD events, we had no selection bias and we could extrapolate the result of the study to the general diabetic patients.</p>

<sec id="sec10-1741826711428065" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our study highlighted the importance of symptomatic CHD in diabetic patients, as emphasized by ADA. The contribution of CHD symptoms to the risk of CVD/CHD was independent of ECG criteria for ischaemia in both sexes. We observed that resting ECG provided important incremental prognostic information in the evaluation of diabetic men. The present study provide evidence-based support only in men for the ADA recommendation of ‘further cardiac testing for diabetic patients with an abnormal resting ECG’, but not in women; however, whether the routine screening of silent CHD among diabetic men can alter treatment or prevent CVD events needs further studies.</p>
