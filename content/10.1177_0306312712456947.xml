<abstract>
<p>This paper explores empirical ontology by arguing that realities are enacted in practices. Using the case of Atlantic salmon, it describes a series of scientific and fish-farming practices. Since these practices differ, the paper also argues that <italic>different salmon</italic> are being enacted within those different practices. The paper explores the precarious choreographies of those practices, considers the ways in which they enact agency and also work to generate Otherness. Finally it emphasises the productivity of practices and notes that they generate not simply particular realities (for instance particular salmon), but also enact a penumbra of not quite realised realities: animals that were almost but not quite created.</p>

<p>…purely cosmological thinkers reject the ontological assumption that we must seek an ordered ground and ask about the character of things themselves, rather than the <italic>type</italic> or <italic>kind</italic> of things they represent. Such cosmologists, in so far as they are concerned with order in any sense, ask ‘How many and what kinds of kosmoi are there?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306312712456947">Hall and Ames, 1995</xref>: 196)</p>

<title>Anticipating difference</title>
<p>The turn to ontology in STS is part of a much wider intellectual and political movement. In Western thinking this can be traced back at least as far as Nietzsche, and it now expresses itself both in post-structuralism, and in a range of empirical disciplines, including cultural studies, human geography, parts of feminism, anthropology and post-colonialism. So what is happening? And what is at stake?</p>
<p>The passage above is taken from pragmatist philosophers and sinologists David L. Hall and Roger T. Ames. These authors offer a grand narrative, claiming that it has been usual in Western thought since the Greeks to treat cosmological and ontological questions as if they were essentially indistinguishable. The working assumption has been that the cosmos has an order: that it is composed of particular kinds of entities, framing relations, forces, causes, and all the rest. The task of philosophy has been to inquire into the general character of this order in the cosmos – they call this its ‘ordered ground’ – while the empirical sciences have explored particular phenomena and causes in specific domains.</p>
<p>This scheme assumes that the cosmos is endowed with a single order, and it helps to explain why in the dominant Western tradition the ontology postulated by philosophers has been indistinguishable from the general character of the cosmos. To ask about what exists in general (to ask about ontology) has been at the same time to ask about the general ordering of the cosmos. But Hall and Ames note that it does not have to be so: it is possible to imagine a cosmos without a single order, which is how the dominant traditions in Chinese classical philosophy approached the world. They add that within Western thinking since Nietzsche, the two concerns have also started to separate. This quick story suggests that to turn to the empirical study of ontologies relevant to our practices is not to stray into <italic>terra nullius</italic>, but rather to move into a territory amply populated by Chinese philosophy, a growing tradition of Western contrarian writing, and indeed other – for instance Amerindian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0306312712456947">de Castro, 1998</xref>) world views.</p>
<p>The landscape described by Hall and Ames is visible within STS. Parts of the discipline cleave firmly to the assumption that there is a single ordered ground, whereas other parts try with more or less success to wash this assumption away. This becomes clear if we ask how STS handles empirical difference. Here its instincts lead in two quite different directions. On the one hand it sometimes says that since different groups have different locations and social and material interests, it is unsurprising that they also have different perspectives. This social constructivist way of thinking is grounded, at least implicitly, on the assumption that the cosmos is endowed with a single order (for instance a single social structure, or a single material world.) Indeed, it needs this if its explanations are to work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0306312712456947">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, parts of actor-network theory, feminist material semiotics and post-colonial STS work quite differently. Focusing on practices rather than people or groups, these avoid assuming that there is a grounding order. Instead they say that practices generate orders. Ordering becomes a relational and performative effect of practices, and since the latter vary, this also means that ordering varies too. As a result, questions of ontology (the kinds of objects or entities that exist) are detached from general assumptions about the character of the cosmos and become a matter for empirical investigation. At the same time, the cosmos turns from a general framing order into contingent sets of orders, ordering processes, disorders and unknowable fluidities.</p>
<p>This division helps to make sense of one recurrent feature of STS: the fact that from the point of view of constructivism the empirical study of ontologies tends to look like an unnecessary and complex restatement of differences that are already being well explored within constructivism. But this is a reading that rests on a misunderstanding. Empirical studies of ontology are not trying to explain why differences arise within a single cosmological grounding. Instead, and quite differently, they are looking at what objects come to <italic>be</italic> in a relational, multiple, fluid, and more or less unordered and indeterminate (set of) specific and provisional practices; what it is that follows if ontologies are separated from assumptions about a singly ordered cosmos. And related moves can also be traced in anthropology (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712456947">Helmreich, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0306312712456947">Strathern, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>In STS there is a long tradition of empirically studying ontologies in practice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0306312712456947">2</xref></sup> In the present paper we work within this tradition using material from a long-term ethnography of salmon farming in West Norway. We seek to contribute to a conversation about the character of animals by attending to what a farmed Atlantic salmon is if it is treated as an effect of relational practices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0306312712456947">3</xref></sup> In what follows, first we attend to multiplicity to show that different salmon are done in different practices. Second, and also echoing a recurrent finding in empirical enquiries into ontology, we note that the ordering of those practices is a choreography that is precarious and uncertain. Third we touch on what we call the textures of ordering. Moving to salmon–human enactments in which salmon become slippery and elusive, we consider how such practices enact separations between humans and salmon. Our argument is that the textures of practices are important for what a salmon is, since they define the qualities of salmon and humans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0306312712456947">4</xref></sup> And then, fourth, we use the same materials to touch briefly on the productivity of human–salmon relations, and argue that while farmed Atlantic salmon are indeed inextricably linked with people, they also escape from and are Other to the human.</p>

<title>Multiplicity</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Kristin fishes … [the daufisk] out with a small net, and puts them in a bucket; she remembers the numbers in her head (‘sort of’, she laughs! And then writes the numbers [4, 5, 2 … ], onto one of the many sheets of paper in the common area) … . Some of the fish are very dead … . Sometimes they aren’t.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0306312712456947">5</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We are on a salmon farm in west Norway. ‘Daufisk’ is the vernacular for ‘dead fish’ and, as is obvious, Kristin is fishing dead salmon out of the water. So what is a salmon in this practice? How is it being done in the relations that make up Kristin’s work?</p>
<p>Matter-of-factly we may say that it’s a fish that is dead or alive, or injured or otherwise. If it is dead it is also something to be put in a bucket, and dumped in a tank filled with formic acid and other dead fish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0306312712456947">6</xref></sup> That’s a set of possibilities. Indeed, it is the set of possibilities. It’s quite simple. And a salmon (more precisely a dead salmon) is an object that needs to be sifted out and removed.</p>
<p>Compare what Kristin is doing with this textbook definition.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The Atlantic salmon … is a salmonid fish, a group of species typified by a laterally compressed body form and a dorsal adipose fin, posterior to the main dorsal fin … . (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0306312712456947">Webb et al., 2007</xref>: 18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Relations are being done here too. There’s implicit reference to Linnaean systematics, and the physical characteristics of the salmon are also described. The text continues so:<disp-quote>
<p>The early/life-history stages of the species, encompassing eggs, alevins, fry and parr, live in fresh water. … smolts, a later stage associated with the migration of fish from their natal rearing areas, are typically silver … . (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0306312712456947">Webb et al., 2007</xref>: 18–19)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here more relations are being done. We are learning about the lifecycle of the Atlantic salmon, and the next citation further specifies that lifecycle, linking it to both geography and genetic segregation.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The Atlantic salmon occurs in temperate waters and shows a complex, diverse biology. The species is quintessentially anadromous, spawning (i.e. reproducing) in fresh water and followed by a freshwater juvenile phase and subsequent oceanic feeding migrations. This is combined with a tendency to home to natal areas to spawn … . Homing results in the reproductive segregation of individuals into distinct groups whose members share a common natal origin … (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0306312712456947">Webb et al., 2007</xref>: 19–20)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All of these citations come from <italic>The Atlantic Salmon: Genetics, Conservation and Management</italic>. The book is more than 500 pages long, so what we have quoted only scratches the surface. Even so, at least in outline, we have a beginning. The Atlantic salmon is being described and that description locates it in a web of links that include a taxonomic system, particular genetic attributes, and a specific lifecycle, geographical range and feeding characteristics. If we were so minded we might draw all these relations in the form of an (actor) network.</p>
<p>Compare and contrast. Kristin’s practice generates one kind of network of relations. A salmon is alive, or it is dead, or it is injured or otherwise. The textbook and the practices that go into it generate a different network: as we have seen this has to do with Linnaean systematics, lifecycles, behaviours, and all the rest. We have two sets of practices here, and those practices are doing different salmon because the relations that they enact are themselves different. This is the kind of move that characterises empirical ontology. A salmon is not general but <italic>specific</italic>. It depends on how ‘it’ is being done in practice. We do without the assumption that there are salmon out there with a definite form, in existence outside the practices in which they are being done. That is the first move. And then, here’s the second, it follows that since those practices aren’t the same, different and multiple salmon subsist in different and multiple worlds. This, then, follows once we study ontology empirically. There is no ordered ground separate from practices and their relations. If there is order, it is a provisional and specific effect of practices and their ordering relations. There is no ‘salmon’ behind the various practices that do salmon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0306312712456947">7</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section3-0306312712456947">
<title>Choreography</title>
<p>But let’s return to the farm and look at a further practice: that of vaccinating young salmon or parr. Again what we’re looking for are relations: for networks, webs or rhizomes of tangled relationality that give shape or form for a moment to anaesthetised salmon.</p>
<p>The vaccination cabin is surrounded by pipes and cables, and is filled with more pipes and cables, together with buckets, tables and machines. It is wet, busy and noisy. The parr are pumped up through a pipe, arrive in batches in a gush of water, and drop into a container filled with water and anaesthetic. Once they go limp they’re lifted in a metal basket and decanted onto a stainless steel work surface behind a rapidly moving conveyer belt. Katrine is wearing waterproof overalls and rubber gloves. She’s lifting the fish, two at a time, and dropping them into grooves on the conveyer belt very fast – about 120 a minute. The fish are being whisked away into the vaccination machine. If they are large enough and they’re also the right way round, then they’re vaccinated.</p>
<p>This is hard work, it’s cold, it’s wet, and:<disp-quote>
<p>… the fish are slippery. Perhaps they are more slippery for Marianne and myself than for the three women? They are certainly less easy to handle, more elusive.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>So what is a salmon here? What kind of a creature is being done in the web of relations that make up this practice?</p>
<p>Here’s one answer. It is a matter of <italic>agency</italic>. The latter is being done and distributed. If a salmon is properly anaesthetised, then its capacity for agency is restricted. It is rendered passive, more easily handled by people, and more possible to vaccinate. If, on the other hand, it is flopping around because the anaesthetic has become too dilute, then the whole process grinds to a halt. At the same time, agency or its absence is not restricted to salmon alone. People’s hands reach out, lifting the fish, and dropping them onto the conveyer belt. When she’s doing this Katrine doesn’t usually look at the fish. She juggles them without looking down because she knows how they feel. Novices can’t do this. Gradually, however, the hands begin to learn how to do the sorting: they generate another relational ordering and distribution of agency. Here are Marianne’s field notes:<disp-quote>
<p>Both yesterday and today I … vaccinated, but today … it went better … but it was also very cold … fingers stiffen after a while even with woollen gloves, and my grip becomes less sensitive and I don’t feel the difference of the two sides of the salmon as accurately, and my wrist is not as smooth and … I make more mistakes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But machines can make mistakes too. If someone drops a salmon in the wrong way, the machine goes ‘beep’ and a red light flashes. The offending fish is washed into a bucket of water, picked up and put through the process again. There’s a display on top of the machine too, with the number of ‘feilvendte’ or ‘wrongly turned’ fish. And this can go wrong:<disp-quote>
<p>[Today] I learned that ‘feilvendt’ is registered by a sensor that detects light. Machine 1 is not as sensitive as machine 2, but yesterday afternoon Kristin washed it with alcohol and thinks it has improved somewhat. They say that sometimes when the salmon is very dark [the machine] … makes mistakes, mistakes right for wrong. While the insensitive machine mistakes wrong for right.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0306312712456947">8</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>So what is the salmon here? One answer is that it has to do with agency. Another and complementary answer is that the practice can be understood as a set of repetitious relations including people and physical materials that enact ‘the salmon passive’, or perhaps ‘the salmon not passive enough’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0306312712456947">9</xref></sup> Following Charis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0306312712456947">Thompson (2007)</xref> we may think of this as a demanding and intricate choreography. Salmon passivity and human or vaccination-machine agency are being done relationally, in practice, and moment-by-moment. And this choreography takes effort, work, continual redoing, and is more or less precarious. Such is the point of Thompson’s metaphor. All in all, it isn’t surprising that sometimes the choreography goes wrong. If there is too much anaesthetic in the water the salmon die (not that this actually happened). Without inner woollen gloves fingers stiffen and drop the salmon into the machine the wrong way. If the optical sensor on the vaccination machine gets dirty it stops working properly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0306312712456947">
<title>Texture</title>
<p>We’re saying, then, that if passive salmon are done, if that is what a salmon is in this set of relations, then this is only so whilst the practices hold steady. The choreography has to be sustained, and there is no grounding order lying behind everything giving it shape and holding off chaos. And the same holds for the relations <italic>between</italic> practices. Since these do different things, their relations – and the objects they enact – become similarly uncertain, complex and contingent. This means that what an object – or a salmon – is becomes an effect of those changing choreographies. Salmon, then, may change in form between practices – they may be ‘fluid’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306312712456947">de Laet and Mol, 2000</xref>). Indeed, the character of that fluidity is essential to their survival – as in the move from fresh to salt water, or being vaccinated at the right time. This, then, is a second move in empirical studies of ontology: they explore precarious choreographies. To make a third move we turn to what we will call the <italic>textures</italic> of ordering practices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0306312712456947">10</xref></sup> Again we work empirically.</p>
<p>In the vaccination hut, the machine not only checks that the salmon are the right way round but also measures them. Eleven centimetres long, that’s the minimum. Most of them make it, but a few don’t. The machine goes click, and washes the sub-sized fish down a different pipe into tank 15. From the outside, tank 15 looks much like any other. It’s cylindrical, 5 m across and 2 m deep. But this is where the resemblance ends. Most of the tanks are nearly filled with water. Most are being fed a steady stream of fresh water. In most the water is slowly moving, and the young fish are lined up and gently swimming against the current. Many are artificially lit. In all, the fish are being fed. They have a system, too, for adding extra oxygen. But tank 15? It’s different. There’s only 1 m of water in it and a limited fresh water feed. No current. No lighting. No feeding. No extra oxygen. In short, this is where the reject salmon go. And it’s the end of the road for them. Before long they’ll be asphyxiated. So we’re on the margins here. But what is going on?</p>
<p>The answer is that they were probably going to grow too slowly. Possibly, they simply ate less. They didn’t transform pellets into body weight quite as fast as ‘hungry’ salmon. People on the farm point to the ‘taperne’, the small ‘losers’, swimming slowly close to the edge of the tanks. These are fish that don’t get enough to eat, or don’t digest their food. So tank 15 contains potential losers – potential because they’re going to go no further. ‘If they don’t grow here, they won’t grow anywhere’, says Tore, the manager. But why do some fish become losers?</p>
<p>To understand this we need to trace some more or less invisible relations: the hinterland of practices that do the ‘losers’. So note first that thriving necessarily goes with failure to thrive. That which fits is impossible without that which does not. In a relational world, control and ordering are impossible without lack of control and disordering. Like flowers and weeds, each implies the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306312712456947">Bauman, 1989</xref>). On the farm these relations are done in a series of more or less invisible practices. First, veterinary practices enact fish that are healthy and thrive for particular reasons and in particular ways. They also enact fish that fail to thrive – again for a variety of reasons including particular infections and specific kinds of injury. The latter are the Others to the fish being done as healthy and whole. Here’s the first link with the occupants of tank 15. Small salmon aren’t necessarily sick or injured, but they might be. Second, the practices of classifying animal behaviour treat salmon as creatures with a range of behavioural attributes distributed across a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306312712456947">Damsgård et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306312712456947">Huntingford et al., 2006</xref>). Here some become timid and others bold, while others are more or less aggressive. This is the second link with the reality of tank 15. Those that are timid or pacific may grow less well on the farm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0306312712456947">11</xref></sup> Third, fish biology enacts salmon as varying metabolic systems (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0306312712456947">Stead and Laird, 2002</xref>), also with their differences distributed across populations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0306312712456947">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a world of abundance (shortage of feed is not a problem on the farm) some salmon eat less than others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0306312712456947">13</xref></sup> These will probably be slow growers. Others may eat plenty, but are metabolically inefficient. A skinny fish is ill-adapted to life on the farm. This is the third resonance with tank 15. Note, before moving on, that each of these three practices also enacts a particular version of science: the practices (and their salmon) are locations that mobilise fish biology and veterinary practice too.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0306312712456947">14</xref></sup> And then, fourth, salmon are not easily held in place. In the choreography of marine aquaculture, nets have a mesh size of between 1.9 and 3.8 cm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306312712456947">Bostick et al., 2005</xref>). Parr that don’t grow properly are more likely to escape into the sea. This needs to be avoided on the farm: they must not ‘contaminate’ their wild cousins.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0306312712456947">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Salmon that conform and salmon that do not: we are on the margins here. We’re looking at a practice that separates, the chosen from their Others, and tank 15 is the place of the Others. The triage in the vaccination cabin distinguishes between salmon that are problematic for the farmer and/or for the environment, and those that are not. It condenses the relations between those that fit and those that don’t. It acknowledges that choreographies do not simply fail, but that they necessarily fail. But what of the <italic>texture</italic> of this separation? Here is our tentative suggestion. There is not much that is indeterminate in this practice. The divide between those that are going to make it and those that are not is sharp. Indeed, it is clear to the point of being abrupt. One click of the machine and the fish that will never grow up is delivered to the shadowy realm of tank 15. The science may be – it is indeed – full of shades of grey, but this isn’t how it is in the vaccination cabin.</p>
<p>So that is one texture of separation, but textures that divide come in other forms too. Let’s move to a different location, the marine site on the fjord, where mature salmon spend about a year and a half as they grow and put on weight. Here are John’s field notes.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Let’s be honest. This is not the most appealing form of work. Sucking the dead salmon out of the pens. Putting them in a wheelbarrow. Carting them along the central walkway. … Up the small ramp to the raft … to put them with some small difficulty in a large metal container where they are dissolved by formic acid to make an absolutely noisesome slurry that is subsequently … fed to mink…</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With about 600,000 salmon in the farm, the people working there walk on the rooftops of a city of fish. Given the numbers, some will die each day, and it’s important to extract these to reduce the risk of infection. So the ‘daufisk’ are sucked out of each pen up a large pipe and disgorged in a cascade of water. Carting 100 kg of dead salmon in a wheelbarrow is quite demanding. But so too is getting a grip of the daufisk.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My first attempts to get hold of salmon are … inexpert. I’ve got blue rubber gloves on. And then I am grabbing them, or trying to, by two hands. … But then I start to watch Knut … Knut is a powerfully built man, and he picks the salmon up … by their tails. In one hand. And they don’t slip out of his grasp. … So … I give it a go [though] … . I’m not very good at it because it takes some strength. You need to grab the fish by the base of the tail, just where the fin starts. And then you need to hold it very tight. And if you do that, the fin itself, or rather its stiff part, is just a little broader than the base of the tail. Then you can hold the salmon and lift it up so long as you hold it tight enough.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>More field-notes:<disp-quote>
<p>Whether or not I can a get a grip of the salmon … depends on at least three factors.</p>
<p>One … the weight of the salmon. … The biggest simply slither out of my grasp when I try to pick them up … . Slither with a clunk … when they flop back onto the deck. They weigh too much and their ‘natural slipperiness’ means that I can’t get a grip on them.</p>
<p>Two, whatever it is that is holding them. Like gloves … which are somewhat rough … but even so the salmon, the big ones, slip through them. We need, then, to attend to the textures of relationality.</p>
<p>And three … on whether I pick them up with my left hand or my right. The arthritis in … my right hand … means … that I don’t grip as hard with my right hand as do with my left. I didn’t know this … until faced with the salmon slither test.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These paragraphs describe another web of relations from the margins: hands, gloves, slithery fish, wheelbarrows, water and arthritis are being woven in a further web of choreographed relations. In this practice, when an arthritic joint seizes agency then so too does a fish, even after death. As with vaccination, a passive salmon becomes a more or less precarious achievement of a web of relations. When something goes wrong it slithers off. But now the texture is entirely different. Yes, it still has to do with separation. A dead fish will be separated from its living cousins. But, and in addition, a slippery fish will also be separated from those seeking to handle it. Attend, then, to the practices of handling dead fish. Attend to their quality. Here, and we have said it already, the fish becomes slippery. It is being rendered slick, slimy and evasive. If we think about <italic>textures</italic> – if we say that the textures of human–salmon practices are important in defining what a salmon is – then we need to add that the daufisk routines in the middle of the fjord are a long way removed from the summary clarity of the separations being done in the vaccination cabin. There isn’t much that is clear, clean or clinical when it comes to daufisk. Instead its slipperiness becomes an important part of its texture – of what a salmon is.</p>
<p>This argument about texture applies to all kinds of practices. But let’s just look at one more. This has to do with feeding:<disp-quote>
<p>Christoffer is checking the feed levels … . [H]e runs up the gantry … scooping feed out of a bucket and looking to see how the fish respond as it hits the water. … some of the pens are not particularly hungry, but in one of the others … the water is boiling with the fish. In one of the quieter pens … though the salmon are not actually frantic to feed, they are taking the pellets as they sink through the water … . He suspects … that they have been overfeeding in some of them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Feed represents about 60% of the cost of raising fish, so waste is avoided. The supply is controlled by computers and is linked to the biomass of the salmon present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306312712456947">Lien, 2007b</xref>). But knowing whether the inhabitants of the pens are hungry also depends on Christoffer. How are the salmon behaving? Are they ravenous? Are they mildly interested? Or are they simply ignoring the feed that he throws at the surface of the water? These questions lead us to a further set of choreographed relations from the margins. Salmon are done as limp and passive when they’re being vaccinated or after they are dead, though we also know they sometimes seize agency and slither off. Here, by contrast, salmon are being done as active and hungry because they are feeding visibly. One of the industry software companies boasts: ‘We make your fish talk’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0306312712456947">16</xref></sup> and something like this is happening here. When Christoffer climbs up on the gantry, salmon come to ‘say’: ‘we are hungry’ or ‘we aren’t’. So what should we say about texture here?</p>
<p>Note, first, that the modality of the practice is different. In the vaccination cabin it took machinic form. For the daufisk routine it was a matter of manual handling: of feel and grip and surface textures. Now, however, we have moved into an interaction dominated for people in part by machines and computer programmes, but in part also by the visual. But if the quality of the interaction is changing, then, and crucially, we need to add that Christoffer sees very little as he peers through the attic window into the city of fish. At best he can only see what is going on a couple of meters down, and most of what is going on is invisible to him. Only a few fish get to ‘speak’ while most remain mute – and hidden.</p>
<p>So this is a third story of human–salmon textures and separations. But this time the texture isn’t abrupt, and neither does it have to do with the slippery surfaces of manual handling. The register is quite different. This time separation has to do with another kind of surface, that of water, its limited translucency, and the fact that salmon are separating themselves from the human visibility afforded by this practice. It is textures of seeing and of not seeing that take shape. The salmon is being done as elusive, as nearly mute and as evasive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0306312712456947">17</xref></sup> People can barely see into the water at all. Here we want to say that the salmon – even the Atlantic farmed salmon – is living at and beyond the margins of the human.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0306312712456947">
<title>Productivity</title>
<p>Take any practice. Ask about its choreography. Ask how it weaves its relations and enacts its objects. If we think in empirical-ontological fashion we discover difference and multiplicity. Then note that differences are chained together, which means that the ‘salmon multiple’ of aquaculture is sometimes and somehow held together in a precarious choreography of overlapping practices that sustains it from the moment of fertilisation to its final trip to the slaughterhouse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0306312712456947">18</xref></sup> Perhaps, then, in relation to human practices, we need to imagine the salmon as a fluid entity that shifts its shape as it moves between practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306312712456947">de Laet and Mol, 2000</xref>). But then if we want to know about the productivity of human–salmon practices, it is also important to attend to the textures of those practices: how it is that people and salmon rub up against one another, here clinically, mechanically and in the application of technoscience, there in ways that are tactile, and somewhere else in a visual mode that renders salmon elusive and mute.</p>
<p>So by attending to the textures we learn something about what salmon are in relation to people. At the same time we also learn about the productivity of practices. Thus the separation of the inhabitants of tank 15 resonates with divisions and discriminations in fish biology, animal behaviour, veterinary science and environmental protection,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0306312712456947">19</xref></sup> but it also generates an accompanying realm of more or less shadowy alternative realities. This, then, is the first way in which practices are productive around the margins. They leave trails of entities that didn’t quite make it, trails of nearly salmon, trails of salmon that were promptly Othered.</p>
<p>But practices fail too. Their choreography is uncertain. As we have seen, a salmon slithers from gloved hands and flops onto the deck and we suddenly find ourselves in the realm of the slippery, of the unexpected. This is a second way in which the generativity of practice expresses itself around the margins. If the successful ordering implied in triage produces a shadowy realm of nearly salmon with respect to people, then so too do the failures in choreography. Ordering practices also fail, and to fail is to generate a trail of unexpected entities, of unexpected salmon, or salmon out of place, whose destiny is open-ended, uncertain.</p>
<p>Third, we have talked of the elusive. When Christoffer looks down from the gantry to check how the fish are feeding, he knows that almost everything going on within the city of fish is out of sight. But what does this teach us? As we hinted above, the answer is that we learn that human–salmon practices are also productive in ways that are barely visible to humans. Yes, the city of fish out in the fjord embeds innumerable human–salmon practices. But though what goes on in the pens is in part an effect of human–salmon practices, it is also in large measure beyond human knowledge. And this is a third way in which the generativity of practice around the margins expresses itself. Human–salmon practices generate an unknowable and elusive penumbra of slippery salmon-possibilities. For people.</p>
<p>The study of empirical ontology in STS has taken many forms. Some have attended to the productivity of Othering (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0306312712456947">Singleton and Michael, 1993</xref>), and others have sought to interfere and rework the real.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0306312712456947">20</xref></sup> But its actor-network version usually attended to chosen realities, their struggles, their successes and their failures, whilst playing down the multiplication of their shadowy Others. It attended to the flowers rather than the weeds. To say this is not to criticise. Separating ontology from assumptions about the cosmos was – and remains – hard work, and it was already a triumph to show that sociotechnical or political successes could be understood as effects of more or less precarious practical, heterogeneous and contingent relations rather than products or expressions of a general ordering ground (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306312712456947">Latour, 1988</xref>). But there was also a price, and this was to participate in the predominant processes of Othering, and to lose sight of the unseen and anomalous generativity of practices. Our argument is thus that it is time to attend not just to ontologies enacted, but also to their shadowland of alterities; it is time to attend to the textures on the margins.</p>
<p>If we think of human–animal practices, then what might such a move mean? One answer is that since many species have been domesticated for millennia, there are shadowy hosts of enacted but not-quite-realised orders of animals: those that were enacted in the past but have been othered; penumbral animals that are being repetitiously enacted alongside those that are realised; and those that, literally or figuratively, just slip through the net, and live their lives on the margins of what is knowable to the human. Perhaps as we consider such might-have-beens and nearlies, we might borrow from postcolonialism and talk of subaltern beasts: certainly the parallels are striking (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306312712456947">Chakrabarty, 2000</xref>). For like sheep or goats or dogs, salmon can be understood as human companion species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306312712456947">Haraway, 2007</xref>). It is true that they are newcomers to the farm. The selective breeding of farmed Atlantic salmon goes back only 40 years, but the history of people–salmon interaction goes back to the Palaeolithic<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0306312712456947">21</xref></sup>. Human–salmon practices have been generative for at least 12 millennia, and the orderings of not-quite real salmon and their related people continue to grow year-by-year. So this is the challenge. To explore the textures that do salmon in relation to people, to articulate some of those not-quite-salmon, and then to wonder if some of them might be better. These are some of the tasks facing empirical studies of ontology once assumptions about a singly ordered cosmos are washed away.</p>
