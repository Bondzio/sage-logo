<p>The Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behavior (SWAN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054711427399">Swanson et al., 2006</xref>) Rating Scale is a relatively new parent-report measure of symptoms associated with ADHD. Unlike other established ADHD questionnaires, such as the Disruptive Behavior Rating Scale (DBRS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711427399">Barkley &amp; Murphy, 1998</xref>), the SWAN was constructed with the intent of capturing variability at the good ends of attention and activity regulation as well as at the symptomatic levels of these dimensions. For example, the SWAN asks how well the child “listens when spoken to” (attention) or “awaits turn” (activity regulation).</p>
<p>The overall goals of this study were to evaluate the psychometric properties of the SWAN and compare it with the DBRS, because the SWAN could be useful in research aimed at understanding strengths as well as weaknesses in attention and impulse control. Contemporary behavioral genetic and phenotypic studies of ADHD conceptualize the diagnosis as an extreme phenotype that is not etiologically distinct from the spectrum of symptoms that fall within the normal range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711427399">Pennington, 2002</xref>). However, it is possible that the spectrum of symptoms that are behaviorally adaptive does not share a common etiology with the disorder. Measuring variance in both the positive as well as the negative ends of the symptom dimensions can address this question.</p>
<sec id="section1-1087054711427399">
<title>Background</title>
<p>ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting approximately 4% of 4- to 8-year-olds in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711427399">Centers for Disease Control, 2005</xref>). Current diagnostic guidelines include two correlated symptom dimensions of inattention (I) and hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI). A child with ADHD may be elevated on one or both symptom dimensions, resulting in three subtypes of ADHD: inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. To meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD, symptoms must be present before age 7 and occur in more than two settings, be inconsistent with developmental stages, and cause impairments in adaptive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711427399">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711427399">2000</xref>). Parent- and teacher-report measures, such as the DBRS, typically show internal and external validity for symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711427399">Bussing et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711427399">Friedman-Weieneth, Doctoroff, Harvey, &amp; Goldstein, 2009</xref>). However, these same scales do not capture variation at the positive end of the two symptom dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054711427399">Polderman et al., 2007</xref>). Studies of genetic etiologies for ADHD have found that heritability for these symptoms is consistent across the continuum of severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054711427399">Stevenson et al., 2005</xref>). However, without a scale that measures variance at the adaptive end of the phenotype, it is difficult to estimate the degree to which these genetic factors are shared at both ends of the symptom dimensions.</p>
<p>The SWAN Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054711427399">Swanson et al., 2006</xref>) was developed with the goal of detecting variance at the negative and adaptive ends of the two symptom dimensions. The SWAN differs from other ADHD measures in its balanced Likert-type scale that includes positively phrased, <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed.; <italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711427399">APA, 1994</xref>) anchored items (see instrument descriptions below). However, despite this apparent face validity, few studies have examined its psychometric properties, particularly whether the SWAN truly captures meaningful variance at the favorable end of the inattention_and_HI distributions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054711427399">Polderman et al. (2007)</xref> plotted SWAN scores with scores on the Attention Problems scale of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054711427399">Achenbach, 1991</xref>) to test for heteroscedasticity or a difference in variances between the two scales. Whereas the SWAN showed variance at the positive ends of inattention and HI levels, CBCL “positive” scores were truncated at 0. However, this study did not test the external validity of the SWAN scores. Moreover, unlike the SWAN, the CBCL ADHD Scale comprises 11 items that do not map directly onto <italic>DSM-IV</italic> ADHD criteria, but instead tap global symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. For example, Item 10 on the CBCL reads, “Can’t sit still, restless, or hyperactive,” whereas the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria and the SWAN identify nine specific behaviors that fall under the umbrella term <italic>hyperactive</italic>. So, for both these reasons, the Polderman et al. results are not conclusive.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711427399">Young, Levy, Martin, and Hay (2009)</xref> found that the SWAN identified a distribution of ADHD subtypes consistent with the Rasch model, suggesting consistency in the relative predictive strength of individual items on the measure; however, the authors did not correct for inflation due to familial correlations. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054711427399">Hay, Bennett, Levy, Sergeant, and Swanson (2007)</xref> compared the SWAN with ADHD items on the <italic>DSM-IV</italic>-oriented Australian Twin Behavior Rating Scale in a group of Australian twins, aged 6 to 17 years. This study confirmed that the SWAN provides a more normal distribution as compared with the skew and kurtosis found in a 0 to 3 rating scale similar to the DBRS, but other validity tests were not conducted.</p>
<p>In studies of genetic and environmental influences on inattention and impulse control, the ability to measure individual differences across the whole distribution of these symptom dimensions would be useful. Thus, the goal of the current study is to examine the psychometric properties of the SWAN to determine whether it can be useful in future research. Specifically, the goals of the study were to examine the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1087054711427399" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>internal validity of the SWAN as measured by internal consistency and test–retest reliability, exploratory factor analyses, and tests of normality;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>convergent validity of the SWAN with the DBRS at the symptom severity level, via sensitivity/specificity to identify clinically elevated children, and by estimating heritability for symptoms of ADHD; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>external validity of the SWAN, as compared with the DBRS, as measured by phenotypic and genetic correlations with a cognitive latent factor and ratings of interference with daily functioning.</p></list-item></list>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in this study were 379 monozygotic (MZ) and 372 same-sex dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs (1,502 participants in total) from the Colorado Twin Registry in the United States (65%) and the National Health and Medical Research Council’s Australian Twin Registry (35%). This unselected population sample is part of the International Longitudinal Twin Study (ILTS) of early reading and attention development (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711427399">Samuelsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711427399">Willcutt et al., 2007</xref>). This study is ongoing, and data are not currently available from Australia for the post-fourth-grade time point. At the time of the initial assessment with the SWAN, all participants had just completed kindergarten, with ages ranging from 64 to 92 months (<italic>M</italic> = 75.7 months). Mean years of the participants’ parents’ education was 14. Zygosity was confirmed with DNA collected via cheek swabs or, in a small number of cases, by selected items from the questionnaire by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711427399">Nichols and Bilbro (1966)</xref>.</p>

<title>Instruments</title>
<sec id="section5-1087054711427399">
<title>DBRS</title>
<p>The DBRS is a caregiver-report questionnaire comprising 18 items targeting symptoms of inattention and HI, and 8 items measuring conduct disorder, the latter of which were not included in this study. The inattention and HI items map onto the criteria for ADHD as outlined by the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711427399">APA, 1994</xref>). The DBRS is scored on a 4-point Likert-type scale, with anchors 0 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 1 = <italic>sometimes</italic>, 2 = <italic>often</italic>, and 3 = <italic>very often.</italic> The two-factor structure of the DBRS ADHD Scales (i.e., inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity) was established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711427399">DuPaul, Anastopoulos, et al. (1998)</xref> using a normative sample of 4,666 participants ranging from 4 to 20 years old (<italic>M =</italic> 9.57). Subsequent studies have further supported this structure in preschool-aged children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711427399">Friedman-Weieneth et al., 2009</xref>). Adequate reliability, as well as convergent and discriminant validity of the DBRS, have been established for parent and teacher ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711427399">DuPaul, Power, McGoey, Ikeda, &amp; Anastopoulos, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711427399">Erford, 1997</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1087054711427399">
<title>SWAN</title>
<p>The SWAN Scale is a more recently developed measure. The wording of the SWAN items differs from that of the DBRS in that the questions are phrased relative to normal behavior expectations, rather than with a particular focus on deficits. For example, Item 3 on the SWAN reads, “Compared to other children, how well does this child . . . Listen when spoken to directly?” whereas the corresponding DBRS item reads, “Does not seem to listen when spoken to directly.” The SWAN is rated on a balanced 7-point Likert-type scale, with anchors of 0 = <italic>far below</italic>, 1 = <italic>below</italic>, 2 = <italic>slightly below</italic>, 3 = <italic>average</italic>, 4 = <italic>slightly above</italic>, 5 = <italic>above</italic>, and 6 = <italic>far above.</italic> Despite frequent use of the SWAN in recent research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711427399">Cornish, Wilding, &amp; Hollis, 2008</xref>), there exist few independent studies of the measure’s psychometric properties, including incremental ability to predict above-average cognitive performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1087054711427399">
<title>Interference ratings</title>
<p>As part of the DBRS, parents also rated the degree to which symptoms of inattention and HI interfere with social interactions, academic performance, daily responsibilities, and recreational activities. These ratings were made on a 0 to 3 Likert-type scale identical to the DBRS and were completed concurrently with DBRS ratings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1087054711427399">
<title>Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP)</title>
<p>The Rapid Naming subtests from the CTOPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054711427399">Wagner, Torgesen, &amp; Rashotte, 1999</xref>) were used as measures of naming speed, which previous research has shown to load strongly on a general processing speed factor also defined by perceptual speed tasks that do not require naming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711427399">McGrath et al., 2011</xref>). Subtests administered at each time point were chosen according to developmental level. At post kindergarten, participants completed two Rapid Color Naming, two Rapid Digit Naming, and two Rapid Letter Naming tests. At post first and post fourth grades, participants completed two Rapid Digit and two Letter Naming subtests. Raw end times for individual subtests were log transformed and summed to create rapid naming composites, where higher values reflected worse performance.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1087054711427399">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Procedures for the ILTS have been described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711427399">Samuelsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711427399">Willcutt et al., 2007</xref>), so the following description focuses only on the assessments relevant to this article. Participants were assessed using rapid naming measures at the end of kindergarten and first grade in the Australian and U.S. samples, and also at the end of fourth grade in the U.S. sample. One-hour testing sessions were performed at home or at school in the United States, and at school in Australia. Parent ratings of ADHD symptoms were obtained at kindergarten, first, second, and fourth (the United States only) grades while individual testing was completed in the United States and via mail in Australia.</p>
<p>Analyses were performed with SPSS 18.0 and MPlus 6.0. Inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and total ADHD composite scores were created, consistent with procedures used in previous studies of similar rating scales (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711427399">Pelham, Gnagy, Greenslade, &amp; Milich, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711427399">Willcutt et al., 2007</xref>). On both measures, Items 1 to 9 are intended to correspond with symptoms of inattention; Items 10 to 18 tap symptoms of HI. SWAN items were reverse scored (i.e., <italic>far below</italic> = 7 and <italic>far above</italic> = 1) to match the directionality of DBRS symptomatic scores.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section11-1087054711427399">
<title>Internal Validity</title>
<p>Internal consistency was estimated for both measures by calculating Cronbach’s alpha for scale and total scores across the four time points: post kindergarten, post first, post second, and post fourth grades. The DBRS Scales were found to demonstrate positively skewed distributions at all test occasions, with the majority of participants receiving low scores, consistent with previous research. Hence, these values were logarithm transformed prior to analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711427399">Willcutt et al., 2007</xref>). Mean Cronbach’s alpha for the SWAN Scales was nearly identical to that of the DBRS (α = .88).</p>
<p>Low-bound estimates of test–retest reliability for SWAN and DBRS subscales were calculated by correlating scale scores at each time point for MZ twins. As described in previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711427399">Samuelsson et al., 2005</xref>), these coefficients are underestimates of the true reliability due to nonshared environmental factors that create differences between individuals in the twin pair. Nonetheless, both measures demonstrated good reliability, although the mean SWAN coefficient was significantly higher than the mean DBRS coefficient (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Reliability for the SWAN ranged from .72 to .90 (<italic>M</italic> = 0.82); DBRS coefficients ranged from .58 to .81 (<italic>M</italic> = 0.71). The Inattention Scale showed significantly lower test–retest reliability than the other scales for both the SWAN and DBRS at all time points except post fourth grade. Reliability did not vary significantly by time point for the SWAN; however, the post-fourth-grade reliability coefficients were significantly lower than those at post kindergarten for the DBRS.</p>
<p>Longitudinal stability was calculated for both measures by correlating scale and total scores across the four time points: post kindergarten, post first, post second, and post fourth grades. Pearson product–moment correlation coefficients for the SWAN Scales were acceptable and comparable with DBRS coefficients at all time intervals, and ranged from <italic>r</italic> = .57 to <italic>r</italic> = .75 (<italic>M</italic> = 0.67), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; DBRS coefficients ranged from <italic>r</italic> = .51 to <italic>r</italic> = .76 (<italic>M</italic> = 0.66), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The DBRS coefficients were slightly lower than values previously published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711427399">DuPaul, Power, McGoey, Ikeda &amp; Anastopoulos (1998)</xref>, who found inattention <italic>r</italic> = .78, HI <italic>r</italic> = .86, and total <italic>r</italic> = .85. However, the time interval between reports in the DuPaul et al. study was only 4 weeks, while the current study averaged longitudinal stabilities across kindergarten and Grades 1, 2, and 4. To our knowledge, there are no published longitudinal stability values for the SWAN.</p>
<p>Factor analysis was performed using SPSS 18.0. A two-factor, maximum-likelihood extraction model with Varimax rotation was tested on SWAN and DBRS scores, with a random selection of one twin from each pair at post second grade (<italic>n</italic> = 532). Post-second-grade data were used because we expect symptoms of ADHD to become more stable with age and because only U.S. data were available at post fourth grade. Overall, the items loaded as expected for both measures, with Items 1 to 9 loading together as an inattention factor and Items 10 to 18 loading onto the hyperactivity/impulsivity factor (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054711427399">Table 1</xref>). Items 10 and 11 (<italic>fidgets</italic> and <italic>leaves seat in classroom</italic>) cross-loaded in both models. The SWAN showed additional cross-loading of Items 3 (<italic>listens when spoken to</italic>) and 16 (<italic>reflects on questions, controls blurting out answer</italic>). On average, SWAN factor loadings were higher than DBRS loadings (SWAN <italic>M</italic> = 0.74; DBRS <italic>M</italic> = 0.63). The higher loading of SWAN items on the two factors would be consistent with it having a more differentiated Likert-type scale (7 points vs. 4 on the DBRS). Similarly, the two-factor model accounted for 74% of the variance in the SWAN and 64% of the variance in the DBRS. However, the DBRS showed a better fit with this model, χ<sup>2</sup> = 490, <italic>df</italic> = 118, compared with the SWAN, χ<sup>2</sup> = 866, <italic>df</italic> = 118.</p>

<p>To test the difference in fit of the two-factor structure, we used MPlus Version 6.0 to run a confirmatory factor analysis with the default geomin rotation. Maximum likelihood factor analysis was performed, and the Inattention and HI Scales were allowed to correlate within measures. As in the exploratory Varimax rotation, the factor loadings on both the inattention and HI factors were significantly higher on the SWAN as compared with the DBRS (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054711427399">Table 1</xref>). Constraining the path estimates of corresponding items to be equal across measures resulted in a significantly worse fit for both scales—Inattention: Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 45.83, Δ<italic>df</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; HI: Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 64.57, Δ<italic>df</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001—confirming that the measures do not show weak factorial invariance. These results suggest that the variance at the favorable end of the SWAN item scores is being used in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Histogram plots revealed evident skew and kurtosis for the DBRS Scales (Inattention skew: 0.95-1.13, kurtosis: 0.74-1.70; HI skew: 1.37-1.56, kurtosis: 2.25-2.55). SWAN plots were within the normal range (Inattention skew: –0.29-0.09, kurtosis: 0.05-0.65; HI skew: –0.33-0.04, kurtosis: –0.25-0.55). A bivariate scatterplot of SWAN and DBRS total Scale scores at Time 1 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087054711427399">Figure 1</xref> and is representative of plots at all four time points. As we would expect, the shape of the scatterplot demonstrates heteroscedasticity, meaning that there is more variance around the regression line at the low end of the DBRS Scale. Whereas the DBRS attributes scores of 0 to participants who are free of negative symptoms (<italic>x</italic>-axis), SWAN ratings of these same participants capture variability among their scores (<italic>y</italic>-axis). A child who demonstrates good attention and regulation of activity level will have a summed Total scale score of 0 on the DBRS. In contrast, this same child will receive scores between 1 and 4 (in our reverse-scored data set) for each item on the SWAN, and will thus have a Total scale score between 18 and 72. The graph shows us that the SWAN is more sensitive to individual differences at the good ends of the symptom phenotypes than is the DBRS.</p>

<p>To further test this point, we compared MZ and DZ correlations on ADHD subscale scores for probands scoring at the favorable versus unfavorable halves of the distributions (determined by a median split). Because we observed greater variance in the SWAN than in the DBRS at the favorable ends of the ADHD dimensions, we likewise expected to find greater differences between the MZ and DZ correlations in the SWAN in the favorable halves. In contrast, we expected comparable differences between the MZ and DZ correlations for the unfavorable halves. However, the results showed that at both the favorable and symptomatic halves of the dimensions, the SWAN had greater and more significant differences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054711427399">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Convergent Validity</title>
<p>Currently, measures like the DBRS, which map directly onto the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria for ADHD, are considered the gold standard in clinical assessment of ADHD. Thus, it is useful to test whether the SWAN Scale scores are related to the DBRS scores. The DBRS Scale distributions violated assumptions of normality, and the logarithm transformed DBRS Scale scores exhibited a curvilinear relationship with the SWAN Scale scores. Thus, rather than performing linear correlations, we first performed regression analyses using the log transformed DBRS values and a quadratic variable (log<sub>10</sub>DBRS)<sup>2</sup>, to determine the amount of variance shared by the models, as measured by <italic>R</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054711427399">Table 3</xref>).

<p>Both the SWAN and DBRS Scales are ordered categorical variables and, as such, do not have a defined metric. Therefore, to estimate the degree of correlation between the two measures, we used a measure of association (Cramer’s <italic>V</italic>) that is analogous to a Pearson correlation but does not assume a linear relationship. Like a correlation, Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> ranges from −1 to 1, with a value of 0 indicating no association and a value of 1 indicating a perfect association. To calculate Cramer’s <italic>V</italic>, we first computed the chi-square for the difference between the expected number of individuals at each level of the SWAN and DBRS and the observed number of individuals in a contingency table. Then, we entered that value into <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1087054711427399">Equation 1</xref>:</p>

<p>where <italic>n</italic> equals the number of participants and <italic>k</italic> equals the number of rows or columns, whichever is smaller.</p>
<p>Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> statistics were calculated at concurrent time points to estimate the association between the two measures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054711427399">Table 3</xref>). Total scale scores consistently showed the strongest relationship (<italic>M</italic> Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> = 0.53), and Inattention and HI Scales demonstrated moderate cross-measure associations (<italic>M</italic> = 0.48).</p>
<p>Next, we truncated the SWAN item-level scores to match the DBRS Scales. So, using our reverse-scored data set, a SWAN score of 1 to 4 was coded as a 0 in the truncated variable, 5 was coded as 1, 6 as 2, and 7 as 3. Because both scales now violated the assumption of normality, we again used Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> to estimate the agreement between the composite scale scores at each time point. Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> values were similar to those achieved using the nontruncated SWAN scores: <italic>M</italic> total <italic>V</italic> = 0.56, <italic>M</italic> inattention <italic>V</italic> = 0.50, <italic>M</italic> HI <italic>V</italic> = 0.50.</p>
<p>Between-measure diagnostic agreement for ADHD subtypes was also calculated using Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> statistic. In accordance with <italic>DSM-IV</italic> diagnostic guidelines, participants were classified as ADHD-inattentive type if six or more items on the Inattentive Scale were endorsed, hyperactive type if six or more HI items were endorsed, and combined type if six or more items on each scale were endorsed. An item was considered “endorsed” on the DBRS if it was scored as a 2 (<italic>often</italic>) or 3 (<italic>very often</italic>). As mentioned previously, SWAN scores were reversed to match directionality of the DBRS. On the SWAN, items were considered endorsed for scores of 5 (<italic>slightly below</italic>), 6 (<italic>below</italic>), or 7 (<italic>far below</italic>). We found slightly improved categorical agreement when we counted these three ratings as endorsements on the SWAN, as opposed to only counting the two highest ratings, as is done on the DBRS. Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> statistics for categorical comparisons across measures were similar to the continuous values: <italic>M</italic> inattentive = 0.34, <italic>M</italic> hyperactive-impulsive = 0.41, <italic>M</italic> combined = 0.45 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054711427399">Table 3</xref>). Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> agreement for any ADHD diagnosis was 0.50.</p>
<p>Another way to examine categorical correlations is to calculate sensitivity and specificity for the SWAN, using the DBRS as the gold standard. For detection of all ADHD subtypes, the SWAN showed moderate sensitivity (<italic>M</italic> = 58%) and excellent specificity (<italic>M</italic> = 98%). However, it should be noted that given the imperfect reliability of the DBRS in this sample (categorical test–retest reliability ∼.60), it is both a mathematical and theoretical fallacy to assume that the DBRS is in fact the “gold standard.” Error in both measures will lower the apparent sensitivity of the SWAN, and with this in mind, we consider the observed sensitivity values to be acceptable, overall. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1087054711427399">Table 4</xref> reports the number of individual cases identified by both measures, the SWAN only, and the DBRS only at each time point. Overall, the SWAN identified more cases than did the DBRS, and raw agreement rates were comparable at each time point.</p>

<title>Heritability</title>
<p>It is extensively documented that symptoms of inattention and HI are heritable, with one meta-analysis of 20 twin studies finding a mean heritability of 0.76 for total ADHD scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054711427399">Faraone, Spencer, Aleardi, Pagano, &amp; Biederman, 2004</xref>). Thus, testing whether SWAN scores are heritable and genetically correlated with DBRS scores are two important convergent validity tests. We used univariate ACE models to estimate genetic (A), shared environment (C), and nonshared environment (E) factors for DBRS and SWAN separately for each grade level using Mx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711427399">Neale, Boker, Xie, &amp; Maes, 2006</xref>). Likelihood-based 95% confidence intervals were used to estimate the significance of genetic and environmental estimates, with the inclusion of 0 signifying a nonsignificant factor. Nonsignificant paths were then dropped from the model, and difference in chi-squares was used to confirm a nonsignificant loss in model fit. As before, the DBRS measures were log transformed to minimize skew. The effects of age (age and age squared) and gender were regressed out prior to genetic analyses, and the residuals were used.</p>
<p>We used an ACE correlated factors model. Although statistically equivalent to a Cholesky decomposition, the latent A, C, and E factors in this model are linked by a correlation <italic>r</italic> rather than common paths as in a Cholesky decomposition. This model was used to investigate the degree to which shared risk factors account for the comorbidity between SWAN and DBRS. The correlation <italic>r</italic> measures the degree of shared risk. Correlations can range from −1 to 1, indicating the extent to which the same genes influence both traits irrespective of their specific heritabilities. Similarly, this model allowed us to test the extent to which shared and nonshared environmental factors are correlated between these measures. Nonsignificant factors were dropped from the model and the difference in chi-squares was measured to confirm a nonsignificant loss in model fit. The results from a reduced AE model are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1087054711427399">Table 5</xref> because shared environment could be dropped without a significant loss in fit across all grades and measures. Heritabilities for SWAN were similar across subtypes and grade levels, ranging from .69 to .89. Moreover, these estimates are similar to previous findings for ADHD scores.</p>

<title>External Validity</title>
<p>Of primary interest in this study is whether the SWAN offers improved ability over <italic>DSM-IV</italic>-based ADHD measures to measure the full range of behavior, including performance at the good ends of the two ADHD symptom dimensions. Thus, our analyses of external validity focused on testing whether the SWAN offers incremental external validity over the DBRS for predicting good cognitive performance and less behavioral interference.</p>
<p>To answer these questions, we performed linear regressions to determine whether the SWAN could predict cognitive performance and behavioral interference over and above the DBRS. We tested these regressions both predictively and concurrently. Using the “step” option in SPSS 6.0, DBRS Inattention was entered first, followed by DBRS HI, and then each SWAN Scale, one at a time. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1087054711427399">Table 6</xref> shows the results of Rapid Naming scores at post first grade regressed on the postkindergarten ADHD Scales. Adding the SWAN Inattention Scale resulted in a significant <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> change (.068), and Rapid Naming scores were best predicted by SWAN Inattention Scale scores (β = .34) when all predictors were included in the model. The results of rapid naming regressions at post fourth grade (where only data from the United States are available) were similar and therefore not reported in detail here.</p>

<p>In contrast, hierarchical regressions of post-second-grade interference scores on ADHD subscales revealed that the SWAN Scales explained very little variance in behavioral functioning when DBRS scores had already been entered (Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .005). We chose to use post-second-grade data for this analysis as it represented the longest, more stringent predictive time interval where both U.S. and Australia data were available. The DBRS HI Scale was the best predictor of behavioral functioning (β = .209) when all four variables were included in the model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1087054711427399">Table 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, post-fourth-grade Rapid Naming (RAN) scores were regressed onto DBRS and truncated SWAN Scale scores separately, to compare the amount of variance accounted for by each measure. The truncated SWAN Scale scores accounted for more variance than did the DBRS scores, with a mean <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value of .056 for the SWAN total score and .037 for the DBRS.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We examined the psychometric properties of a new measure of ADHD symptoms, the SWAN Rating Scale. The SWAN demonstrates internal validity comparable with the DBRS, as measured by internal consistency, longitudinal stability, and factor structure. The similar factor structures also provide evidence of convergent validity between the SWAN and DBRS, in that the two questionnaires are measuring overlapping constructs. Furthermore, the significantly higher factor loadings on the SWAN indicate that the variance measured by this scale at the good ends of inattention and HI is related to the original two factors, and thus meaningful.</p>
<p>All tests of convergent validity indicate that the SWAN and DBRS are measuring similar constructs. Linear regressions established a moderate amount of shared variance between the SWAN and DBRS subscales. Continuous and categorical agreement between the measures was estimated using Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> statistic and found to be moderate. One possible confound in comparing the measures is that the SWAN has a longer Likert-type scale. With extended Likert-type scales, reporters may be less likely to endorse extreme scores. However, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1087054711427399">Table 4</xref> demonstrates that, on average, the SWAN identified more cases than did the DBRS, so it does not appear that this potential confound was a factor in this sample. Although agreement between the two measures is not perfect, we expected the SWAN to identify different cases than the DBRS because the measures are in fact partly independent, and both are further limited by their own imperfect reliabilities. Furthermore, categorical correlations are always expected to be lower than continuous associations. Taken together, these tests support the use of the SWAN for clinical purposes as well as research in the diagnosis of ADHD subtypes.</p>
<p>Bivariate heritability analyses demonstrated that shared genetic influences account for a large proportion of the phenotypic correlation between the measures. However, the genetic correlation is lower than we expected, and it is not due to a difference in genetic influences specifically at the favorable ends of the scales. Rather, the results suggest that the SWAN is measuring some genetic factors that are distinct from those measured by the DBRS on both ends of the dimensions. This supports the SWAN as a distinct and useful measure of variance not captured by the DBRS.</p>
<p>Our primary question in this study was whether the SWAN has additional information about children performing at the favorable ends of inattention and HI. As predicted, the SWAN does have variance at the positive ends of Inattention, HI, and Combined subscales, as demonstrated by heteroscedasticity with the DBRS Scale. Furthermore, hierarchical regressions of a measure of cognitive functioning showed the SWAN Inattention Scale to be the only independent predictor of cognitive performance, indicating that this subscale in particular is capturing meaningful variance over and above those of the DBRS. Finally, the differences between MZ and DZ correlations were greater for the SWAN at both ends of the symptom dimensions, suggesting that the SWAN offers increased variance for the full spectrum of behaviors.</p>
<p>However, the SWAN did not offer incremental validity for prediction of interference. This may be related to two limitations: (a) the interference ratings were collected at the same time as the DBRS ratings, thus they may be biased to be more closely related to the DBRS scores and (b) the interference ratings were made on a 0 to 3 Likert-type scale, with no variance on the “good” end of interference, so the SWAN’s ability to capture variance at this good end was likely not maximized during these analyses.</p>
<p>Research to date has struggled to identify consistently strong cognitive correlates of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711427399">Nigg, Willcutt, Doyle, &amp; Sonuga-Barke, 2005</xref>). The current study suggests that skewed measures of ADHD symptomatology, such as the DBRS, may be inadvertently limiting the potential for those correlations. In contrast, the SWAN provides sufficient variance at both ends of the inattention and HI spectrums to capture a statistical relationship. Thus, future investigations of candidate cognitive endophenotypes of ADHD would benefit from use of the SWAN as a behavioral measure.</p>
<p>Overall, the SWAN appears to be a useful tool for examining the etiology of the two ADHD symptom dimensions, both at the adaptive and impaired ends of performance. Given the increased range and complexity of SWAN scores, future work could include development of normative scores for diagnosis of ADHD. This would be an improvement over the symptom-count method employed by the DBRS and other <italic>DSM-IV</italic>–based measures for prediction of cognitive as well as behavioral functioning. Normative scores would also serve to strengthen the SWAN as a research tool and would provide a rich set of data with which to examine candidate cognitive endophenotypes for adaptive functioning correlates of development of inattention and HI.</p>
