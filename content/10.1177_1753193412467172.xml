<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Neutrophilic dermatosis of the dorsal hands (NDDH) is a rare cutaneous condition of the dorsum of the hands characterized by painful, erythematous plaques, pustules, and bullae on the dorsum of the hand or digits. It was first described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412467172">Strutton et al. (1995)</xref>. Histologically, there is a dense neutrophilic infiltrate sometimes associated with a leukocytoclastic vasculitis.</p>
<p>A 41-year-old woman presented with a 5-day history of worsening ischaemia of the entire tip of her left index finger. There was a painful, pustular nodule present on the dorsum of the distal phalanx. It was located on the radial aspect of the distal phalanx and measured approximately 1 x 1 cm. The distal phalanx was erythematous and cool to the touch with a delayed capillary refill. She had no systemic symptoms of fever, arthralgia, or malaise. There was no history of diabetes mellitus or trauma. A radiograph of her hands showed no abnormalities. She was treated initially with antibiotics. A dermatology opinion was sought and a diagnosis of neutrophilic dermatosis of the dorsal hands was made. The patient was started on minocycline and prednisolone. The pustular eruption was biopsied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412467172">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412467172">2</xref>).</p>

<p>Histological analysis of the tissue specimen revealed acral skin with a prominent neutrophil infiltrate and leukocytoclastic vasculitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412467172">Figure 3</xref>). Other features noted were a significant papillary dermal oedema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193412467172">Figure 4</xref>) with fibrin deposition and overlying hyperparakeratosis. This confirmed the diagnosis of NDDH causing acute ischaemia of the distal phalanx.</p>

<p>The patient responded well to oral steroids and the ischaemic digit resolved fully within 7 days. Subsequent investigations including urinalysis, blood serology, and upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy were all normal. At a review at 3 months the patient was well and showed no signs of any recurrence.</p>
<p>NDDH is a rare cutaneous condition characterized by painful plaques, pustules, and nodules on the dorsal hand and digits. It is uncommon before the age of 40, and few cases have been reported in the literature. It is often associated with fever and is now felt by many to be a subset or local variant of Sweet syndrome.</p>
<p>Sweet syndrome was first described as an acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis in 1964 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412467172">Sweet, 1964</xref>). The majority of NDDH patients are women who present with tender erythematous plaques on their face, limbs, or upper trunk. Blood tests often reveal a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate and peripheral blood neutrophilia. Histological analysis reveals dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrates with leukocytoclasis.</p>
<p>In 1995, Strutton et al. described a pustular vasculitis of the dorsal hands in six patients. These patients had presented with painful pustular eruptions that clinically resembled Sweet syndrome. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412467172">Galaria et al. (2000)</xref> described similar cases, but as there was no vasculitis in several of these cases, the term NDDH was preferred over pustular vasculitis.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412467172">DiCaudo et al. (2002)</xref> described a case series of seven women. Five had lesions at sites other than the hands. Most of the dorsal hand eruptions resolved within weeks.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of NDDH is often delayed due its misdiagnosis as a soft tissue infection or cellulitis. The neutrophilic infiltration seen histologically may also mimic infection. NDDH often responds to treatment commonly used for Sweet syndrome, such as dapsone and oral steroids. Initial improvements in some patients on minocycline have been reported, yet recurrences during minocycline therapy have also occurred. Furthermore, it has been proposed that minocycline is one of the agents responsible for drug-induced Sweet syndrome.</p>
<p>We believe that our case study is the first reported case in the literature of NDDH causing an acutely ischaemic digit.</p>
