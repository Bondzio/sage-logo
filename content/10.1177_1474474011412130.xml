<abstract>
<p>This article describes a multi-site, mediated performance entitled <italic>Raindogs</italic> achieved in Cardiff in 2002, and discusses the ways in which the presence and coexistence of such transient, aesthetic practices might reveal and pull into momentary focus aspects of the city’s fabric, its manifold temporalities and the diverse activities of its populace. Inter-textual in form and interdisciplinary in ambition, the article combines passages of creative writing with more sustained critical reflection that draws upon architectural planning, contemporary archaeology, forensics and performance analysis; it proposes performance as both a potential mode of enquiry and of interpretive exposition in enhancing public understanding of contemporary urban experiences. It suggests that the script of performance can itself contain moments of disciplinary perception – from local history, cultural geography; and that new forms of dramaturgy might both utilise and disclose the nature of pervasive phenomena of the city, such as surveillance – through the analogous use of media, refiguring the theatre auditorium as an oligopticon, a place from which only part of the city is seen, but seen well and site-specific performance as place-making as much as site-occupying.</p>

<p>Summer in the city. A heat wave. Traffic snarls. A dog sleeps in the shade of a park. He wakes in the cool of a thunderstorm but when the rain clears he’s lost. The rain has washed away the scent, the trail, the path that will lead him home. He now roams the city, a stray dog, one of many, a lost dog, dreaming of home, a rain dog,</p>
<attrib>commences playwright Ed Thomas.</attrib>

<p><disp-quote>
<p>Rain dogs are on the loose again; on my street corner, they sniffed urgently, circled crazily, left a jumble of spoors in the wet concrete. They’ve probably been round to your place too. Just look. Them and their kind it’s usually best to avoid, if we can,</p>

<p>He sits at a table in the open-air snack bar on Hayes Island, an older man in suit and tie, glancing nervously. South Wales Police find him easily enough; record him for three minutes with the nearest CCTV camera. In anticipation of this video, I write these words:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>His city is film-set: he’s always on camera, in a movie of his own imagining. He recreates scenes especially for the surveillance watchers – bored policemen, tired security guards – <italic>Roma</italic>, <italic>Open City</italic>; <italic>Rififfi</italic>; <italic>Wings of Desire</italic>; <italic>Bullitt</italic>. Striking poses, gesturing wildly . . . His magnum opus is to be <italic>Tiger Bay</italic>, a full-length version, on location. But he just can’t find it. As he stands in the flower-bed that was once the Custom House pub, he thinks he hears the clatter of girls from the Salutation, the Lifeboat, the Greyhound; Victor Parker’s guitar sliding from the Quebec; John Silva’s bass thumping from the New Moon. But it’s just traffic. Maybe he should do Godard’s <italic>Weekend</italic> or try Jacques Tati instead. Maybe he should just go to Newport. That’s what J. Lee Thompson did anyway – Horst Bucholz riding the ‘transporter’ bridge. And he wonders when – and if – it ever was ‘Tiger Bay’: caged, urgent, burning bright . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ed Thomas has written for him a text that begins:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The crash changed him. You look at photos of him before and look at him now . . . Not the same bloke. No.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And <italic>after</italic> I have seen the video, I add this:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He hired that <italic>Big Issue</italic> seller to sit with him, likes the mongrel on a string, thinks it adds a touch of gritty social realism to his latest project, the film of his life story. He’s decided that if he sits on Hayes Island long enough, everyone he has ever known – even the dead – will pass-by, will greet him. No longer necessary to go home, he will stay here. And they will come to him, make a fuss, offer a biscuit to go with his tea. He thinks. And he will laugh and chat and reminisce with them – even the dead. Occasionally he will stand and stretch his legs, then circle the chair three times before sitting. And settle himself gradually . . . Of course no one will come near. For his lips draw back too far and show too many teeth for this to be a smile. And his stories have already become a whine, a howl, barked at the moon. And no one will claim him.</p>

<p>The police controller scans his array of monitors and there is the second, standing on a street corner, similarly suited, red-haired and bearded, easily recognizable from his television appearances. For him I write this:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>His city is inspiration: he wanders and loiters, listens and writes: overheard phone conversations, morsels of opinion, whispered desires his stock though he never uses adjectives. ‘If only I could hear the true voice of the multitude,’ he thinks. He wants to rush up to passers-by and demand: ‘Whom do you love?’ ‘When were you last jealous . . . or frightened . . . or cruel?’ ‘How do you embrace?’ ‘What is the one thing you wished you’d said in the most important event of your life?’ ‘How would you want to be remembered?’ ‘Have you ever said “I love you” and lied?’ ‘Was the telegrammic address of Clark’s Pies really “Clarpie, Cardiff”’.</p>
<p>He wants to, but he knows he never will. For even if he plucked up enough courage, set aside his reticence and reserve, there’s always a chance that he’d get his ear filled, bent, end up with more information than he really needs; or he would be deafened by the roar. So he keeps quiet, witnessing and interpreting passing scenes, unpredictable juxtapositions, fleeting occurrences, multifarious sights and sounds. Instead, he examines and records signs, finding – in a scrawled message on a toilet wall, a kebab vomited on the pavement, the entrails of dead pigeons, in the unintentional, the random, in the intimate, unplanned touch of history’s passing – the true message of the city.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ed begins:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The black dog bites when he least expects it: panting in the dark inside his head. Licking its paw in his memory . . .</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Later I write:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Those people who just approached him mistook him for a television star, a comedian. But he enjoyed it: pressing the flesh; making others smile; making their day.</p>
<p>He has decided that he will become a street-greeter, welcoming visitors to the city, a city that only he knows. Here on this spot for instance he will tell them, Captain Scott paused on his way to the civic dinner, feeling an icy blast from far south suddenly scour his heart. He knows a thousand such places, unmarked, invisible to those whose feet grind away the streets each day. And these he will reveal: he will become a ‘revelator’. But home? No familiar smells draw him back to Roath or Ely or Grange. He knows only the miasma of odours – burger, urine, blossom – hovering over Hayes Island. So he will endlessly chase his tail there, round and round.</p>
<p>Moving, looking, being looked at . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<p>The third one stands stock-still. The controller finds him immediately because he is doing that most provocative of things in this flow of consumption, of gazing and grazing. Nothing. He is not playing the game; he must be ‘loitering with intent’. The camera seems drawn to him. For him then, from me:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>His city is all nightmare. He has a feeling for the uncanny auras of the past. And here history seems close to the surface, threatening to return and engulf him with its chaos and plague. His city is shallow but its geology is exotic: communities built on ballast – rock returned in empty coal transports – from the world. What contagion might lurk just below the surface; or behind that facade? You just can’t tell by looking.</p>
<p>He knows that others have lived and died here before him: he sees their handiwork, their laughable claims to immortality. In order not to disturb them he walks cautiously, edgily, unnerved: history ever dogging his steps, threatening to leap out, burst out – like molten lava – and turn lives to ashes in its path. As he walks his city into existence, ‘deep maps’ guide him: records of the events of its past that orientate him. He holds his breath in British Home Stores for instance, never buys drink there because it’s built on a cholera cemetery; sings along to Bob Dylan playing the Capitol – in Benetton; Tom Paxton the Cory Hall – in H&amp;M . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Then Ed:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He’s the crawler of kerbs, the hugger of pavements . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And me again:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He often gets stuck in traffic, shivering, whimpering, afraid to move. So he stands very still, hears the hum, feels the swish of ghostly cars and lorries and trolley–buses . . . in both directions. But only he spots the danger, seems to realize that as he stands here, he is in the middle of the old A48, here in the middle of Queens Street. He could make a run for it but somehow he feels safe, though trembling in both legs and with the urge to piss. Sometimes he just does that anyway, breaking the bye-laws, offending the common good.</p>
<p>Crossing the city takes him a long time: so many hazards to which others seem oblivious. So he decides to mark out safe havens and to guide the unsuspecting. Come close to him and you will be safe. Of course no one will. But he will be vigilant and faithful and true. And he will wear dark glasses so that others don’t see his rolling eyes, the whites exposed at the peril he sees all around.</p>

<p>Of the fourth, who stands on a traffic island close to the bus station I write:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>His city is ‘Comin’ like a ghost town’. He clutches at straws, struggles to orientate himself from the fragments of this and that, half-digested buildings, stumps of architecture, ancient scars . . . that he observes, that survive . . . Occasionally he brings to mind scraps of maps, overlain, redrawn, wafer-thin, riddled with holes . . .</p>
<p>To get some measure of control in his wandering he’s constantly drawn to familiar places – significant places, memorable places, hidden places, non-descript places. To places where things, important things, have happened but of which only he has the barest inkling; favourite places – the market stall where the fish are still arranged in floral bouquets. Some places he avoids at all cost: sites of loss, accidents of fire and explosion, incidents of anarchy and unrest. And he sniffs the air for the scent of the brewery now gone . . . His patch is small and he walks it tirelessly, routine holding him in place, while all else is in flux, countless, tiny journeys intertwining and mingling. Mostly, he loiters at scenes-of-crime – an empty stairwell; a deserted park bench; the street outside Lynette’s flat – wishing it had been other . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ed:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Like it was him that did it . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Me:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>From a distance he seems to stand stock still, though up close his nostrils flare slightly as he sniffs the air. And from time to time he quivers, shocks of excitement passing through him, as he catches, as he senses, a moment of this or that about to go off, about to go pear–shaped. Call it his sixth sense. But if he ever tries to announce, to declaim, to explain what’s coming, what’s about to happen for so many people, from so many perspectives, he moves into fast-forward and his voice . . . becomes a yap.</p>
<p>So he decides to remain silent, to become a pointer, hoping that others will see what he sees if only they follow his eye-line. There. There. And this will be his task – 24/7.</p>

<title>5.</title>
<p>The fifth we find stranded in the middle of the pedestrian precinct:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>His city is mirage: floating, glimmering, shimmering . . . And in the tricky, mirrored light, he glimpses utopia, glistening. He imagines a city of light, wears shades at dusk against the glare from skyscrapers as yet unbuilt. He envisages new buildings: traces their towers and bridges and spirals and swirls in the air like a demonic conductor.</p>
<p>He paces new footpaths, new tram-tracks in the midst of the traffic. He plans glittering spectacles, with casts of thousands, rehearsing texts and gestures out loud, on view, at a table on Hayes Island, in the Gents toilet below. He imagines a city with all ills erased. He conceives new kinds of social relationship . . . and regularly gets beaten for trying to forge them. He longs to animate the multitude. But more often than not he is defeated by his own frailty and lack of nerve. So he leaves it to skateboarders to do the imagining: ‘California Dreaming’, on Callaghan Square, while he just drifts . . . in the haze.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ed next:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>To him it’s normal. It’s amazing how you adapt . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Me finally:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He likes the brush of others. He feigns nonchalance. But their slightest touch makes him tremble. He never looks them in the eye – ‘Who are you looking at?’ – or bounds up to them seeking attention or rubs himself against strangers in bars. And he knows that others will never rush up to him; pat him on the back; ruffle his hair.</p>
<p>But there are places, particular places, strategic points, where pedestrians come close. He thinks they are drawn to him, magnetically – feels the hairs on his arm rise at the swish of a passing nylon anorak. And these he will seek out. And he will make a circuit, a marked-out patch – a lamppost here, a street corner there –to follow through the day, through the seasons.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These texts appeared in <italic>Raindogs</italic> – ‘a performance work for the city of Cardiff’ – conceived by artist and designer Mike Brookes, playwright Ed Thomas and myself and presented in Chapter Arts Centre, Cardiff on 8–10 November 2002: ‘A meditation on the <italic>unhomely</italic> nature of the contemporary city’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474474011412130">1</xref></sup> They relate to five of the 10 male actors present in the work – five invited by Thomas, five by me; and several well-known for their film and television work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474474011412130">2</xref></sup> But none would perform live on-stage; they were present only on pre-recorded video footage.</p>
<p>In the sequences above, Thomas’s actors were instructed to take up position at five particular points in the city centre. In appearance, in their dark suits and boots, they resembled the figures in artist Robert Longo’s long-term project <italic>Men in the Cities</italic>. In the original phase of 1976–1982, Longo photographed men and women on a rooftop in Manhattan, jumping, turning and hurling themselves: ‘I counted off one, two, three, and the models would have to jerk, fling, twist, fall.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474474011412130">3</xref></sup> Seeking ‘the high impact moment’, he likened their movements to ‘[v]iolent gestures like Pollock throwing paint’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1474474011412130">4</xref></sup> Several of his figures seem to be impaled or hanging, others take flight, arrested in a single frame from a motor-drive photographic progression. They are all action. This is the vigorous, body-slamming spasm of punk in its downtown New York ‘No Wave’ manifestation: the models include artist Cindy Sherman and musician Glenn Branca. Their captured postures Longo later reproduced as larger than life drawings, in fine pencil detail.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1474474011412130">5</xref></sup> Later still, they become iconic sources for physical theatre: to emulate their extreme positions, to project and animate them backwards and forwards in time, is a favoured creative strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1474474011412130">6</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In <italic>Raindogs</italic>, at a time of increased quotidian circumspection, they are stilled, their energy restrained: reserved, in repose, yet alert and vigilant; their clothes ‘almost anonymous as a uniform’, closer to ‘a costume which inhibited vigorous action, and which action ruffled, uncreased and spoilt’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1474474011412130">7</xref></sup> After John Harvey’s <italic>Men in Black</italic>, their black apparel is perhaps ‘associated at once with intensity and with effacement: with importance, and with the putting on of impersonality’. It is the older black too of (reflexive) mourning, of spiritual grieving: ‘for grief is another way of discovering, as it were behind the daylight, a universe of absence and insatiable want’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1474474011412130">8</xref></sup> The actors were required to remain erect, without moving or speaking, while being recorded for three minutes by CCTV cameras. But they never knew from which of multiple available viewpoints they were being observed, and exactly when: they were asked to survive in the public domain, stationary for a bracketed period of up to 10 minutes, before receiving a telephone message to relax or move on. Without either precise direction or resort to rhetorical devices, they were obliged to use all their actorly skill simply to be present: refraining from express display, mute. Preserving their anonymity, they were to make no attempt to <italic>ostend</italic> themselves towards any one camera or particular audience.</p>
<p>For the first, an elderly performer, the imperative for inactivity was inconceivable within his tradition of dramatic production; on screen, he was indeed accompanied by a <italic>Big Issue</italic> magazine seller whom he had asked to sit and talk to him, to engage in ‘patter’, or ‘business’ in the <italic>patois</italic> of theatre. The second was recognized almost immediately, and approached by fans whom it would have been impolite for him to hustle out of shot. After all, which shot? The third wore dark glasses in some attempt at disguise: either to protect himself from identification and closer scrutiny, or to restrict the ingress of the full impact of this situation of exposure. In large part, they remained un-remarked. Perhaps their black attire, the day wear of <italic>homo urbanis</italic>, was redolent of camouflage; or perhaps disattended by the observing eye – as in Japanese <italic>kabuki</italic> theatre where the stage is sometimes populated by numerous shadowy assistants, or <italic>bunraki</italic> where black-garbed puppeteers hover around their charge – it induces a sense of invisibility. More likely it was because they were not making a scene, an exhibition of themselves.</p>
<p>At ground level, passers-by passed them, often closely, without further note. But the CCTV cameras found them immediately, monitoring as they perforce do the lack of participation: the figures as points of potential disruption to public order and circulation in the management of ‘what should happen, and who should be, in the spaces and times of cities’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1474474011412130">9</xref></sup> In the theatre studio, a new perspective is made available, from the privileged eyrie of the South Wales Police control centre. If the site-specific performances of the 1980s and 1990s were primarily <italic>architectonic</italic> in nature, taking audiences into unfamiliar places<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1474474011412130">10</xref></sup> – largely unfeasible now under the ever-watchful Health and Safety Executive – here inaccessible places are brought to the audience, or rather familiar places of the urban everyday presented in different aspects. The figures are both embedded within and aesthetically distinct from the urban flux, quietly resisting the circulations around them: a provocation to surveillance itself. And their very stillness draws all that surrounds it into a frame of representation. With the actors present yet palpably restrained, attention is deflected towards the crowd and its make-up, to the kinetics and choreographies of public mobility, to the details of architectural style, composition and fabric, apprehended by a spectatorial eye turned <italic>forensic</italic>. As the frame of the camera approximates to the cordon of the scene-of-crime, everything is potentially important: ‘a potentially overwhelming “harvest of clues”’;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1474474011412130">11</xref></sup> ‘a surplus and a simultaneous dearth of meaning’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1474474011412130">12</xref></sup> What here is significant? Is this loitering an aftermath of acts unwitnessed, or a presentiment of those to come? Who is the criminal-in-waiting? They do of course also look like the suited protagonists in Quentin Tarantino’s film <italic>Reservoir Dogs</italic> (1992): Mr Pink – ‘Why can’t we pick out our own colour?’ Joe—‘I tried that once, it don’t work. You get four guys fighting over who’s gonna be Mr Black.’ And is this interrogative mode of apprehension the consequence of our already having witnessed too much surveillance – ‘the endless recycling of violent images <italic>collected through</italic> CCTV into people’s living rooms’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1474474011412130">13</xref></sup> – a more apposite way to regard such fragmented performance, in which narrative coherence is forfeited?</p>
<p><italic>Raindogs</italic> occurred at a particular moment in the history of surveillance when the accent at least locally was upon transparency and accessibility. In the Pearson/Brookes production <italic>Carrying Lyn</italic> (2001), a disabled performer was carried across Cardiff twice in a single day, the differing day and night time journeys recorded on video and still photographs. So as not to draw undue attention to this discrete activity, BBC Wales secured police cooperation in documenting the work for an item broadcast on the regional arts programme ‘Double Yellow’; significantly, the whole itinerary from the Cardiff Central railway station to Chapter Arts Centre, a distance of 2 km, was always in view. Ed Thomas subsequently collaborated with South Wales Police on <italic>Dal: Yma/Nawr</italic> [<italic>Still: Here/Now</italic>] (2004), an episodic film in which contemporary imagery was set against the reading of canonical Welsh poetry; in Thomas’s section, a semi-naked actor was recorded running across the city at night by a number of CCTV cameras.</p>
<p>These figures of <italic>Raindogs</italic> pretend <italic>indifference</italic> to their surroundings. In this, they enact one of theoretical architect Bernard Tschumi’s key relationships between built environment and action. In his critique of characterizations of architecture as the history of style, as the articulation of surfaces or as functionality, Tschumi suggests that spaces are qualified by actions just as actions are qualified by spaces. To examine this proposition, he has long espoused models that portray the entangled nature of object, human subject, and event.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1474474011412130">14</xref></sup> The essentially melodramatic aspect of his schema – ‘To really appreciate architecture, you may even need to commit a murder’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1474474011412130">15</xref></sup> – suggests approaches for both the dramaturgical composition and critical apprehension of performance.</p>
<p>In <italic>The Manhattan Transcripts</italic> (1994) he outlines a series of ‘theoretical projects’ that simultaneously direct and witness activities and incidents projected onto autonomous spatial architectures: intrusions into the architectural stage set, a creative model for understanding, animating and taking responsibility for the relationship between actions and space. He adopts the discrete <italic>frame</italic> as a structuring and representational device, juxtaposing maps, plans, axonometric projections, news photos, line drawing choreographic diagrams, and photographs of people and places in sequences of frozen, temporally suspended moments to better examine, express and document our discontinuous experience of the city. In these <italic>programs</italic> he uses a tripartite mode of notation to represent three disjointed levels of reality – the world of objects, the world of movements and the world of events – in shifting relationships of <italic>reciprocity</italic>, when events and spaces are totally interdependent and fully condition each other’s existence; <italic>indifference</italic>, when spaces and events are functionally independent of, or neutralize, one another and <italic>conflict</italic>. Through sequences of jump cuts, he supposes that the viewer will maintain memory of the previous frame in the creation of imaginary narratives. He claims to introduce the order of experience and the order of time – moments, intervals, sequences – into exploration of the limits of architectural knowledge. He also envisages transformational techniques – aspects of media such as cinema – that can be applied equally and independently to spaces, events or movements: ‘formal strategies such as repetition, superposition, distortion, dissolve, and insertion; techniques in which the content of contiguous frames can be mixed, superimposed or faded in, elaborating endless relational possibilities’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1474474011412130">16</xref></sup> He has a fascination for the dramatic: his explorations frequently involve violence and crime. For him, moments of passion, acts of love, and the instant of death have their own momentum and are rarely the consequence of their surroundings: ‘there is no architecture without event, without program, without violence’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1474474011412130">17</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Tschumi’s <italic>programs</italic> are conceptual and inciting – they envisage and propose action; at the same time – as ‘architectural inquest’ – they document what are also past occurrences. In this they resemble the filmic storyboard and the theatrical scenario. The relationship with performance is suggestive. The <italic>programs</italic> provide models for conceiving and documenting performance, and informing narrative structures enacted as a series of distinct frames or moments. In <italic>Raindogs</italic>, Tschumi’s frames were referenced by the precisely painted screens for projection upon which the discontinuous sequences of discrete actions and events of precise durations appeared: linked through appearance and locale, the spectator nevertheless had both to scrutinize them and to engage them imaginatively in order to discern connections and to create links between places, figures and occurances.</p>
<p>Site-specific performance itself might best manifest the multiple articulations of event and space that he conceives, the transformational techniques he craves. What performance offers Tschumi is <italic>time</italic>: it gives dynamic to the frame, and duration to the event. It can conspire simultaneity – difficult to represent on the page – and it draws attention to all that the frame marginalizes: sound, odour, climate; social milieu; historical depth; all that is adjacent; all that is hidden behind the façade; all that makes a place distinctive. Without either pointing to this or that, or attempting to re-enact the million, million things that have already happened here, performance reveals places anew, through its singular moment of extra-ordinary visitation, through its contiguous existence, incidentally throwing the spectator’s attention from the ‘cinematic flow’ to what is beside it.</p>
<p>Thus far we have encountered only five of 10. In a second sequence, we see the other actors travelling. They appear on candidly shot footage: observing the passing city from a bus, a train, a taxi, a water-taxi; and forlornly through a window in the airport. For one I write:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In a city not his, he saw this.</p>
<p>They had fallen like fruit, Newtonian. Thirty-two feet per second per second; sixty-four feet in the second second; one hundred and twenty-eight in the third. Gravity, irrefutable.</p>
<p>Some had leapt in hope – hitch-kicking to slow themselves; holding billowing skirts, clutching an umbrella. Some swimmers dived, plunged, all elegance. Controlled to the end. And others just jumped, hurled themselves, already gone: ‘This is best’.</p>
<p>For some it was swift and clean. Others bumped and tumbled, unanticipated torment. But all were impelled to flee, take wing from horrors unimaginable. Set free, let loose, ten seconds of flight. Become Icarus, melted.</p>
<p>They said the priest administering last rites to someone at the foot of the building was killed by falling debris. It was a woman.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ed Thomas writes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He has a photographic memory. At night he runs the pictures through his mind. Twenty-four frames a second. He controls time. The journey from the Bay to Queen’s Street by train is exactly three minutes. In that time four thousand three hundred and twenty images will be up there in his head waiting for night to come.</p>
<p>He labels them one by one. He dreams up captions for them.</p>
<p>Like Gary Larson in black and white.</p>
<p>Soon he will exhibit them. Modestly. In the front room of a terraced house in Splott. It will be a place where strays from far and wide come to recognize themselves. In black and white. Looking for a home.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All 10 actors were subsequently registered in close-up – a head-and-shoulders shot with their eyes closed; then sitting alone in an empty room; and finally speaking directly to camera. All recordings lasted precisely either three minutes, or four minutes 33 seconds. In shooting this material actors were held apart, never party to what each other was doing nor to how the footage would be included in performance, preventing temptations to bring dramatic coherence – homogeneity of expression – to 10 separate biographies, glimpsed in pieces and being played out in the city, of uncertain scale and on the fringes of our ability to apprehend them.</p>
<p>The demands of <italic>Raindogs</italic> have significant implications for the endeavour of the actor. Performance begins to be constituted as an <italic>interrupted practice</italic> of different modes of expression, of varying types and intensities – ‘Now I perform, now I don’t’; as a <italic>discontinuous activity</italic> including changes in style, mode, material – ‘Now I stand, now I rest, now I speak’; as momentary <italic>tactical engagement</italic> – ‘Here I go, whatever else is happening here’; as a kind of <italic>incoherent behaviour</italic> – ‘Now this, then that, what’s next?’; as <italic>mediated acting</italic> – ‘I have no idea who will watch this, or where.’ What are forfeited are all those conventional mechanisms that ensure coherence, continuity and direction in drama: character, motive, plot, crisis orientation . . .</p>
<p>Convergences of time, narrative and location – the figures’ similarity in dress, the interlocking nature of their stories, their simultaneous presence in the same landscape – were only apparent in performance, through the combination and ordering of footage. And the precise juxtaposition and transition of material in both visual and audio media was feasible only with the adoption of digital recording technology, and its associated precise <italic>time-line</italic>. Time becomes a key organizing principle: site-specific performance in this context is as much schedules-to-be-met as places-to-be.</p>
<p><italic>Raindogs</italic> was staged in a ‘black box’ studio, a ubiquitous feature of theatre construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the empty rectangular space, the audience sat hard against one long and one short wall; all technical apparatus – DVD players, sound equipment – was present and in view on tables along the second short wall. Projections appeared on the other long wall, on two perfectly painted white screens above head height, to enhance the clarity and vividness of the images. The effect was that of a <italic>camera obscura</italic>, with pictures of the city, documents of ephemeral events, entering the theatre: ‘a series of panoptic visions, offering us a recognisable view of the world (our world) that lay just outside of the theatre walls, and yet locating us firmly outside of its frame, thus making us share the performers’ sense of displacement from it’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1474474011412130">18</xref></sup> But they do not pretend to completeness; these are moments in an event or narrative or sets of relationship that may be as big as the city itself, and that may be continuing off camera. The studio resembles rather an <italic>oligopticon</italic>: ‘the opposite of panoptica: they see much <italic>too little</italic> to feed the meglomania of the inspector or the paranoia of the inspected, but what they see, they <italic>see it well</italic>’. ‘From oligoptica, sturdy but extremely narrow views of the (connected) whole are made possible – as long as connections hold.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1474474011412130">19</xref></sup>
</p>
<p><italic>Raindogs</italic> contests theatre historian David Wiles’s characterization of the ‘black box’ as ‘a depoliticizing space in the sense that no body politic can be placed on view, whatever the overt political content of works performed’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1474474011412130">20</xref></sup> For Wiles, the ‘black box’ cuts itself off from ‘an implicitly corrupt and false social world outside, and attempts to obliterate all social signals from its interior’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1474474011412130">21</xref></sup> ‘isolating it from other social practices’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1474474011412130">22</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In performance the various short segments of video, combined in a total length of 75 minutes, were projected in parallel with other views of the city – a 45 minute night-time tracking shot from a car for instance – and accompanied by a soundtrack of timed phases commissioned from composer John Hardy. There was no dramatic or plot development, although the soundtrack did suggest or support increasing tension towards a sense of resolution. Heike Roms suggests that <italic>Raindogs</italic> demonstrated ‘a loss of faith in historical development: narrative progression is replaced by a cyclical structure that circles through a series of repetitions back to its beginning’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1474474011412130">23</xref></sup> Performance as a purposeful <italic>assemblage</italic> of mediated fragments created elsewhere, at some other time, from locations unavailable to the audience, such as the control room of South Wales Police.</p>
<p>Dramaturgy – the ordering and orchestration of dramatic matter – is in the form of a <italic>mix</italic> of various components, the efficacy of which is predicated upon the quality of the constituent material, the expertise of its editors, and the alacrity of audiences. But where then is ‘the work’, the performance object: in one place or many places? Through such disjointed aesthetics, performance might demonstrate the partiality of our understanding of the inhabitation of the city: it might be redemptive and therapeutic in engendering a sense of communality, however provisional. But equally it could be disquieting and disruptive: in indicating that which rarely enters the theatrical domain; in divulging that lurking on the periphery; in laying bare and pulling into momentary focus those details of urban experience that lie adjacent to this transient, aesthetic practice.</p>
<p>Ed Thomas and I had begun a conversation in June 2001; for 18 months we met every Friday afternoon at 4.30 pm. Initially our talk rambled: it was the <italic>schedule</italic> of discussion that was significant. Our meetings were set against preparations for Cardiff’s bid to become European City of Culture 2008: the slogan ‘Take me somewhere good’ was taken from Thomas’s play <italic>Song from a Forgotten City</italic> (1995), which is ‘firmly located in a real, existing topography: the text mentions famous landmarks in Cardiff, from the Hayes Island public toilets to the Angel Hotel’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1474474011412130">24</xref></sup> How might the bid, in its extravagant, politically driven espousal of the role of art, provide the context and set a timetable for artistic pursuits? Could it provide a platform, an officially sanctioned platform, while in its inherent myopia admitting the critical and the dystopian? Our estimation of the city was orientated around two persistent concerns: the increasing intrusion of surveillance into the civic space, and the surrender of such space to specific constituencies, particularly at night with the emergence of cultures of profligate alcoholic consumption. And around civic inconsistency: as the city sought a post-industrial/commercial identity, hurriedly disguising or dismantling its past, large parts of the dockside were redeveloped as leisure amenities; yet in a failure of civic will, Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid’s winning design for a new opera house went unbuilt.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1474474011412130">25</xref></sup> Our stratagems for creative intervention were manifold.</p>
<p>In the end – and in attempting to address the problematic of writing for ‘post-dramatic’ theatre; theatre not reliant upon the naturalistic staging of dramatic literature, of the play script<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1474474011412130">26</xref></sup> – we challenged each other, initially at least, to write 10 one-minute texts, as a pretext for the first videos: 10 each for us, one each for the actors. After viewing the recorded footage, we wrote additional texts, developing further shards of the stories of these men. Then it was that we decided to appear ourselves, to enunciate our own writings.</p>
<graphic id="img3-1474474011412130" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1474474011412130-img3.tif"/>
<p>From time to time in performance, we read at microphones placed off-centre in the open room. We were the only live performers, speaking texts over, in reference to, on behalf of the figures on video – who increasingly then began to speak for themselves, commencing with the same words previously heard in the third person. The arrangement of scenic elements – asymmetrical in the seating of audience and the distribution of projections, monitors, sound sources and live performers – conspired oblique views of the city. The presence of a group of damaged men – both haunted and haunting – and played by uncertain performers served to present recognizable places in unfamiliar ways, from unexpected viewpoints; and to reveal unfamiliar places, rarely visited but just adjacent to the everyday. The assemblage of video, text and music was orchestrated by Mike Brookes, who was present on the studio floor rather than sealed away in a lighting control box and clearly at work; it brought order in its rhythms and repetitions to material dramatic, documentary and ambient. <italic>Raindogs</italic> conspired in its overlays and conjunctions simultaneously to evoke the city, and to render it <italic>disconcerting</italic>: resisting both the <italic>pedagogical</italic> impulse to indicate, authoritatively; or the <italic>dramatic</italic> urge to annex urban facades as filmic backdrops. Performance fleeting, transitory, quickly erased . . .</p>
<p>The texts – in the form of poetic stanzas, proper psalms, personal narratives, descriptions, confessions and testimonies – interpenetrated fiction with allusions to the vernacular details of place, theoretical insights, and particular moments in civic history: this was as much a ‘reading onto’ as a ‘reading from’. In modes of <italic>performance writing</italic>, they encompassed the anecdotal, the ambiguous, the appropriated. They drew upon a range of critical approaches – translated from the work of Luce Giard, Michel de Certeau and Situationist International into a form of ‘theory-lite’. And upon <italic>local knowledge</italic>, in the inclusion of references appealing to different individuals or groups of the audience. The texts were written separately by Ed Thomas and me, in cognizance of the particular actors to whom they referred; several eventually found their way into Thomas’s most recent play <italic>Stone City Blue</italic> (2004).</p>
<p>On a fundamental level, the texts delineate and commemorate an – albeit recently – disappeared urban geography and town plan: they recall the circuit of public houses now demolished; venues such as the Capitol cinema where emergent rock bands performed in the early 1960s; the Cory Hall, sponsored by the Cardiff-based shipping magnate John Cory; streets named for the women of the Bute dynasty. The figures stand on the footprint of former streets that survives ghostly in the orientation of new malls and pedestrian walkways. On Queen Street pedestrians do indeed walk on the road that was, until the early 1970s, the main route to and from west Wales. Old atmospheres too are summoned: the sickly sweet odour of Brains’ Cardiff Brewery. Texts allude to significant events: from the farewell banquet held on 13 June 1910 at the Royal Hotel on St Mary’s Street to celebrate the departure of Robert Falcon Scott for Antarctica on <italic>Terra Nova</italic>; to the murder of prostitute Lynette White in the early hours of 14 February in Flat 1, 7 James Street above the ‘Kingsport’ bookmakers. White had been stabbed 51 times and her head was all but severed from her body. It was a killing on the cusp, a crime redolent of old ways; there was pressure to solve it quickly in the urgent push towards regeneration. Although several witnesses saw a single, white male with bloodied hands on James Street, the event became notorious for the wrongful arrest and trial of the Cardiff Three.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1474474011412130">27</xref></sup> In the ensuing furore Lynette all but disappeared from accounts. In an earlier solo performance – in a text including details from family memories, character testimony, media articles, eyewitness accounts, police interviews, pathologist’s reports, scene-of-crime reconstructions – I would say:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Sure, there were lies, contradictions, changes, additions. At first, it was as if everyone was trying out stories to see if they would stick, to other stories – editing, trimming, rewriting. But then it moved on and James Street became a stage-set upon which everyone was free to choreograph and direct the behaviours, actions, and motives of the protagonists: to create the scenario; to write the dialogue; to give oneself a starring role; to use scenes and characters from other times, other places. Eyewitnesses did it. Defendants did it. Police did it. I do it too. (<italic>The Body of Evidence</italic>, 1995)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Texts refer too to notable individuals, such as legendary docklands jazz guitarist Victor Parker and multi-instrumentalist John Silva; to those occasions when the city itself became the ground or backdrop for artistic endeavour, as in the feature film <italic>Tiger Bay</italic> (1959); to those small talismans of local taste, such as Clark’s meat pies. And to that which survives, against the odds: Ashton’s fish stall in Cardiff Market, ‘established 1866’. And they exist on the landscape evoked in the ‘Cardiff noir’ literary milieu of authors Bill James (writing as David Craig) and John Williams. Craig’s ‘Brade and Jenkins’ novels <italic>The Tattooed Detective</italic> (1998), <italic>Torch</italic> (1999) and <italic>Bay City</italic> (2000) and Williams’ trilogy <italic>Five Bars, Three Pubs and a Nightclub</italic> (1999), <italic>Cardiff Dead</italic> (2000), and <italic>The Prince of Wales</italic> (2003) are all set in a changing city, against the backdrop of docklands development. The mythical Butetown treasure of <italic>Cardiff Dead</italic> is a collection of the street nameplates from the demolished Tiger Bay; fragments of the area’s vernacular detail – cornices, pediments, doorsteps – now lie in ranks in the city reclamation yard. Williams’ memoir <italic>Bloody Valentine</italic> (1995) relates the terrible death of Lynette White, an event impossible to erase from the local cultural imagination and which forever haunts – for those who know – performances enacted there.</p>
<p>In the range of its concerns and allusions, some historical, others recent, <italic>Raindogs</italic> highlights the overlaying and overlapping temporalities of both urban topography and experience: ‘a city awash with rain and litter, lost loves and disappeared locations’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1474474011412130">28</xref></sup> And at scales that escape the closest attention of surveillance. As such, it may represent both an example of, and an active agency within ‘archaeologies of the contemporary past’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1474474011412130">29</xref></sup> – an archaeology of us. A ‘relationship of proximity maintained regarding places, objects, ways of life or practices that are still ours and still nourish our collective identity’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1474474011412130">30</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>With the accent on the local, the specific, the particular, performance may provide as a means of indicating for the popular imagination how we are ourselves creating the <italic>archaeological</italic>. At the most intimate of scales we inscribe the urban fabric, with varying degrees of permanence. Both private and public domain are marked by our presence and by our passing. Inadvertently, quietly, continuously – in the touch of flesh on metal and stone – we also leave signature <italic>traces</italic>: the prints of our bodies. Through our passage, movements, moments, actions, encounters, we constantly mark our material surroundings. These are the authentic marks of the performance of everyday life: the result of routine, tradition, habit, accident, event, social ritual – of long-term evolution and unconnected short-term ruptures and singularities; of nearness; of dwelling.</p>
<p>In posing the question ‘Who made these marks?’ performance addresses social and ethic issues, engaging with questions of identity, community, class and gender; revealing the inarticulate, unregarded or disregarded practices – anonymous, silent, silenced suppressed, forgotten, ignored. Leading to a fuller appreciation of the micro-chronologies and polyphonic geographies that make up the urban present, to the city as a temporal as well as spatial construct. How we are ourselves creating the <italic>geographical</italic>.</p>
<p>Performance itself as a form of <italic>deep mapping</italic>: an attempt to record and represent the substance, grain and patina of a particular place, through juxtapositions and inter-weavings of the historical and the contemporary, the political and the poetic, the factual and the fictional, the academic and aesthetic depth not as profundity, but as density of both topics and modes of address, and in full cognisance of local and personal knowledge: ‘further glosses on an already deeply layered text’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1474474011412130">31</xref></sup> Site-specific performance as place-making as much as site-occupying.</p>
<p>In sum: in expositionary mode, in concatenations of word and image, of factual and fictive, of dramatic and mundane, of aesthetic and ordinary, of hidden and overt, performance might actively encounter and reveal that which escapes the attention and concerns of instrumental discourses of urbanism: the daily lives of citizens in all their disconcerting complexity. The effect is to open a new kind of analytical space in performance that can encompass varying degrees of spectatorial interest and competence, in its rapidly shifting citations, asides and allusions rather than ensuring the singularity of attention to the motives and actions of the context-less figures conspired by the black box. The city is drawn into the studio, a locale – once defined by its exclusivity, cutting itself off from ‘an implicitly corrupt and false social world outside, and attempts to obliterate all social signals from its interior’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1474474011412130">32</xref></sup> – now become porous.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And on the street corner, dogs sniffed urgently, cocked their legs, left a jumble of prints in the wet concrete . . .</p>
