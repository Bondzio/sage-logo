<p>Serving as the Guest Editor for this issue of the <italic>Journal of Pharmacy Practice</italic> has allowed me to work with practitioners from different areas of clinical expertise with a common focus on pulmonary disease. Pulmonary disease is any disease or disorder causing improper lung function. The main types of pulmonary disease include airway, lung tissue, vascular, or a combination. Airway diseases affect the flow of oxygen and other gases into and out of the lungs. Lung tissue disease involves the structure of the lung, resulting in inflammation and an inability of the lungs to fully expand. Disorders involving the circulation within the lungs are due to clotting, scarring, or inflammation affecting the ability of the lungs to take up oxygen and exchange with carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of mortality worldwide. It is an irreversible disease characterized by chronic airflow limitation and a range of pathological changes in the lung. Smoking cessation is the single most important step in COPD treatment to diminish disease progression. Other interventions such as pharmacotherapy and nutrition will not reverse the disease process but are effective at improving symptoms and preventing exacerbations. The article authored by Drs Metzger and Lundquist summarizes COPD treatment options and highlights key clinical trials published within the last 5 years. The article discusses two new treatment options, indacterol and roflumilast, and potential uses for them in therapy. Drs Wynn, Stroman, Almgren, and Clark address the issue of smoking cessation in their article as well as discussing new treatment modalities. They describe the effectiveness of combining cognitive therapies with conventional pharmacological treatment options. The article by Drs DeBellis and Fetterman reviews nutritional interventions that are effective in preventing morbidity in patients with COPD.</p>
<p>Pulmonary infections account for over 1.2 million hospitalizations per year. Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and acute bronchitis are common pulmonary infections that are reviewed in this journal edition. The article by Drs DeBellis, Jones, and Kincaid presents CABP and two new treatment options, ceftaroline fosamil and tigecycline. The article authored by myself and Dr Atkins reviews and discusses the evidence in treatment of acute bronchitis and recommendations based upon patient presentation.</p>
<p>The authors of the articles within this issue worked toward providing the reader with a current and comprehensive review of topics related to pulmonary diseases. I would personally like to thank all the authors, and my consulting editor Dr Andrea McKeever, for all their hard work in preparing this edition.</p>
