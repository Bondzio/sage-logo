<p>One of the most powerful teaching tools I have ever found is to have students tell stories to illustrate various kinds of problems. These can be especially effective to those of us inured to PowerPoint presentations of data dump, where speakers endlessly read to us a bunch of numbers or show us bullet points of text. It is remarkable how a simple story can persuade an audience to take action, when other rhetorical devices have not worked. Our lead article in this issue makes this point extremely well. As the author states, “storytelling is one of the hardwired instincts of our species and probably the most natural—meaning that it is evolutionarily designed—way of human communication and learning.” He goes on to demonstrate how powerful narrative can be, and students can learn a great deal by collecting and reflecting upon their stories. To make his case, the author draws on the storytelling performance in the context of two different ecological conditions: those of the Ju/wasi hunter-gatherers of the Kalahari desert in South Africa and those of modern industrial workers.</p>
<p>Our second feature article examines website headings used by Fortune 500 companies in their efforts to inform stakeholders about corporate social responsibility (CSR). The author provides guidelines for how CSR-related activities can be articulated to consumers, employees, and stakeholders, thereby giving a students and users a vocabulary with which to create and design appropriate communication vehicles. Our third article is a case study of writing-across-the-curriculum (WAC) activities in a business school in a non-English-speaking country. One interesting conclusion from her work is how a review of syllabi can serves as a nonintrusive means of determining the extent to which WAC principles have had an impact on curriculum and, for that matter, whether instruction in writing is present at all.</p>
<p>In this issue we also have two themed sections. Our first concludes a two-part series on writing for the workplace, which we began in the March 2013 issue. This section focuses on engaging students with their own learning. BCQ readers will find many helpful strategies and approaches; most important, students need to write if they are going to improve.</p>
<p>Our second themed section addresses the complicated issues involved in motivating employees in the workplace. The authors suggest that this notion of engagement is useful for teachers of business communication as well. By appealing to certain work-related values, instructors (and managers) are more likely to gain the emotional involvement of this generation, known as Millennials.</p>
<p>Thus, with these two sections we continue a conversation we have had for some time in BCQ about the role of engagement at all levels. I expect that we will be hearing more from BCQ authors about these important areas of inquiry.</p>
