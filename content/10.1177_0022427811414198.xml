<sec>
<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>This study seeks to identify the effects of travel distance on treatment noncompletion for juveniles attending community-based offender programs.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A population of more than 6,000 juvenile offenders adjudicated in Philadelphia’s Family Court is analyzed using hierarchical linear models. Distance to treatment is operationalized with Euclidean distance. Treatment noncompletion is disaggregated by type to distinguish between noncompletion due to dropout and expulsion.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Results indicate that distance to treatment influences noncompletion due to dropout, but not due to expulsion. In the cross-classified models, an increase of approximately 3 miles to treatment is shown to increase the odds of treatment noncompletion due to dropout by nearly 100 percent.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Implications of this research suggest that Euclidean distance is an appropriate measure with which to estimate the travel of young offenders in urban space and that juvenile justice policymakers should consider distance to treatment when matching young offenders to treatment facilities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most adjudicated juvenile offenders are monitored in communities, rather than in residential facilities. As a result, “professionals in juvenile justice and behavioral health are responsible for supervising and managing nearly a half a million youths who may be at risk for delinquency or violent offenses,” while they remain at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427811414198">Borum 2003</xref>:115). For many of these juvenile offenders, a condition of their probation requires that they attend treatment programs within their communities. There is currently no known study that has examined the impact of travel to treatment for juvenile offenders. With such large numbers of juveniles attending community-based programs, it is imperative that the potential effects of distance to treatment for juvenile offenders attending community-based programs be identified in order to most effectively rehabilitate delinquent youth and prevent future offending.</p>
<p>Researchers are just now beginning to consider the impact that distance to treatment may have for delinquents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022427811414198">Guerra, Kim, and Boxer (2008</xref>:98) are among the first to describe the importance of treatment location through the formation of their “closer to home principle,” which asserts that juveniles attending treatment near their homes will allow for their families to contribute to their treatment progress and for those juveniles to “retain ties with their home communities in order to develop a positive support system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022427811414198">Guerra et al. 2008</xref>:99). If community-based programs are thought to be more effective than out-of-community programs due to increased support from family and the community, this principle can be extended to hypothesize that community-based programs located closer to a juvenile’s home are more likely to achieve successful outcomes.</p>
<p>A treatment-related outcome of utmost importance, when studying juvenile offenders, is treatment noncompletion. There is a clear connection between failure to complete treatment and recidivism: Juvenile offenders who do not complete treatment are more likely to reoffend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427811414198">Daly and Pelowski 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022427811414198">Van Voorhis et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022427811414198">Wormith and Olver 2002</xref>). Additionally, juvenile offenders who fail to complete treatment are more likely to be subsequently placed in residential facilities, which the “closer to home principle” suggests can further inhibit the rehabilitation of young offenders by denying them the support of their family and community. Considering that hundreds of thousands of juvenile offenders receive some form of treatment within their communities each year, reducing treatment noncompletion is a vital step toward reducing juvenile offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427811414198">Borum 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite a growing interest in considerations of space by criminologists in recent decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022427811414198">Sampson, Morenoff, and Gannon-Rowley 2002</xref>), few studies have estimated the effects of spatial indicators on outcomes within juvenile justice. Of those that have, findings indicate that community context does indeed influence the likelihood that juvenile offenders will both offend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811414198">Bursik 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427811414198">Sampson and Groves 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022427811414198">Sampson, Morenoff, and Earls 1999</xref>) and subsequently reoffend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811414198">Grunwald et al. 2010</xref>). Little research has examined the effects of distance to treatment for offenders, while other disciplines, such as education, healthcare, and geography, have examined distance-based effects on the receipt and completion of various treatment and services. This study intends to estimate the effects of distance to treatment on the odds of juvenile offender treatment noncompletion by analyzing a population of juvenile offenders attending community-based treatment in Philadelphia. By simultaneously controlling for several levels of contextual effects, the influence of distance to treatment will be identified net of predictors that have been found to significantly influence juvenile outcomes in prior research.</p>

<title>Predictors of Treatment Noncompletion</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022427811414198">Orlando, Chan, and Morral (2003</xref>:339) note that “Relatively few studies of adolescents examine factors associated with treatment program attrition ….” Much of the work examining correlates of program noncompletion has involved adult offenders. Of the few studies that have analyzed young offenders, most have been conducted on subgroups of offenders, including alcohol and substance abusers, children with mental health needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427811414198">Armbruster and Fallon 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427811414198">Dakof, Tejeda, and Liddle 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022427811414198">Kazdin and Mazurick 1994</xref>), and sex offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427811414198">Hunter and Figueredo 1999</xref>). Very little research has examined the factors that impact treatment noncompletion for juvenile offenders in the general population. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427811414198">Table 1</xref> highlights research that has identified individual-, program-, and neighborhood-level factors that influence the likelihood that both adults and juveniles will fail to complete various forms of treatment. Unsurprisingly, the bulk of this literature has focused on individual-level predictors of treatment noncompletion, with studies concluding that demographic variables such as age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427811414198">Mateyoke-Scrivner et al. 2004</xref>), gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427811414198">Chou, Hser, and Anglin 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427811414198">McCaul, Svikis, and Moore 2001</xref>) and ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427811414198">Jacobson, Robinson, and Bluthenthal 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427811414198">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427811414198">McCaul et al. 2001</xref>) influence the likelihood of treatment attrition. Many other indicators have also been found to influence treatment noncompletion of adults, including: alcohol and drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427811414198">Hiller, Knight, and Simpson 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427811414198">Lang and Belenko 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022427811414198">Mertens and Weisner 2000</xref>), employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427811414198">Hiller et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427811414198">Mateyoke-Scrivner et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427811414198">McCaul et al. 2001</xref>), psychiatric problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427811414198">Hiller et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427811414198">Lang and Belenko 2000</xref>), and marital status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427811414198">Beyko and Wong 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427811414198">Mateyoke-Scrivner et al. 2004</xref>). The few studies that have examined predictors of treatment noncompletion for juveniles indicate that factors such as low SES (socioeconomic status), family issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427811414198">Armbruster and Fallon 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022427811414198">Kazdin and Mazurick 1994</xref>), mental health issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022427811414198">Carney and Buttell 2003</xref>), educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427811414198">Dakof et al. 2001</xref>), and substance abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022427811414198">Orlando et al. 2003</xref>) influence the likelihood of juvenile treatment noncompletion. Of greatest interest to the current study is the work that has identified distance-based predictors of treatment noncompletion. These studies indicate that distance to treatment is negatively associated with both substance abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427811414198">Beardsley et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427811414198">Jacobson et al. 2007</xref>) and mental health treatment completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427811414198">Fortney et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022427811414198">Schmitt, Phibbs, and Piette 2003</xref>).</p>

<p>An even smaller body of literature has inquired about the neighborhood- and program-level effects of offender treatment noncompletion. Researchers have identified a positive relationship between neighborhood disadvantage and failure to complete both alcohol and drug treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427811414198">Jacobson et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427811414198">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022427811414198">Stahler et al. 2007</xref>). Looking specifically at juveniles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022427811414198">Weisman and Gottfredson (2001)</xref> similarly concluded that children living in communities with higher levels of social disorganization are more likely to drop out of after school programs. Regarding the effects of program context on treatment attrition, Hatcher notes (2009:201), “…there is little work that has assessed the impact of the intensity of the delivery of offending behaviour programmes on attrition or treatment outcomes.” This is not to say that treatment-related factors are unrelated to treatment attrition, as researchers are certainly cognizant of the role that program effects can play in determining whether individuals will complete treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022427811414198">Shadish, Cook, and Campbell 2002</xref>). The majority of studies that have examined this relationship have examined substance abuse treatment and concluded that programs characterized by smaller size and higher levels of staffing and expenditures are associated with lower rates of attrition. One of the most consistent findings within this literature concludes that longer treatment duration is associated with a decreased likelihood that clients will fail to complete substance abuse treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022427811414198">Stark 1992</xref>). The sparse literature on adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427811414198">Hatcher 2009</xref>) and juvenile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022427811414198">Orlando et al. 2003</xref>) offenders have uncovered inconsistent evidence of the effects of program-based correlates on treatment noncompletion.</p>
<p>Researchers are well aware of the need for more work to uncover the full effects of spatial predictors on treatment noncompletion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427811414198">Jacobson (2004)</xref> argues that theories explaining the influences of spatial predictors on program completion are currently underdeveloped. In a subsequent editorial note entitled “Where is the ‘Where’ in Considerations of Treatment for Substance Abuse?” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022427811414198">Putnam (2006)</xref> similarly calls for future research to investigate geographic factors that might influence the rate at which clients complete treatment. As has been illustrated, the study of offender treatment attrition is still in its relative infancy, but researchers have begun to take note of the influence that geographic-based predictors may have on the failure of juvenile offenders to complete treatment.</p>

<title>The Effects of Spatial Distance on Offending and Service Utilization</title>
<p>Environmental criminology posits that crime is most likely to take place in areas in which offenders are familiar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427811414198">Brantingham and Brantingham 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427811414198">1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427811414198">1991b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427811414198">1993</xref>). As such, the concept of activity space is believed to be the most appropriate framework with which to explain the effects of distance on treatment noncompletion of juvenile offenders. Activity space comprises the physical area that individuals are familiar with and is based on the location of nodes (the locations to which individuals travel to and from) and the paths traversed between nodes. According to crime pattern theory, areas farther from the home of a potential offender are less likely to be within their activity space, and as a result, are less likely to be the locations of offenses.</p>
<p>The current study posits that the travel of juvenile offenders to treatment will be similarly limited by their activity space: juveniles will be less likely to travel to programs that require travel beyond their developed activity spaces. The selection of activity space to explain the hypothesized relationship between distance and treatment noncompletion is supported by the “journey-to-crime” literature, which asserts that the number of offenses committed by offenders will decrease as the distance from their home increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427811414198">Phillips 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427811414198">Rengert, Piquero, and Jones 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0022427811414198">Van Koppen and Keijser 1997</xref>). The most pertinent finding within this literature states that younger offenders are more acutely impacted by distance than are adults: juveniles tend to remain closer to their homes when they offend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427811414198">Baldwin and Bottoms 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427811414198">Gabor and Gottheil 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022427811414198">Turner 1969</xref>). These findings support the expected influence of distance on treatment noncompletion and highlight the increased importance of distance-based effects on juvenile offenders, relative to adults.</p>
<p>The field of healthcare, and specifically health geography, is much further along in understanding the effects of distance. Increased distance has been found to impede the utilization of healthcare in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022427811414198">Arcury et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427811414198">Beardsley et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022427811414198">Nattinger et al. 2001</xref>), England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811414198">Jordan et al. 2004</xref>), Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427811414198">Lin, Allan, and Penning 2002</xref>), and many other locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022427811414198">Muller et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022427811414198">Perry and Gesler 2000</xref>). Additionally, the phenomenon of individuals seeking less medical care due to distance is evidenced for numerous types of care, including: emergency medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022427811414198">Magnusson 1980</xref>), dental care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022427811414198">Joseph and Poyner 1981</xref>), cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022427811414198">Schroen et al. 2005</xref>), hospitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427811414198">Lin et al. 2002</xref>), and primary care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022427811414198">Gatrell 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022427811414198">Nemet and Bailey 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The literature describing the spatial correlates of educational enrollment is not as developed as that of health geography, but it nonetheless provides valuable insight for the current study. Such research has identified distance effects on outcomes such as educational attainment and the initial decision to seek educational services. The effects of distance have been found to influence the methods by which individuals travel to school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022427811414198">Schlossberg, Phillips, Johnson, and Parker 2005</xref>), the type of school attended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022427811414198">Goldring and Hausman 1999</xref>), test scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022427811414198">Talen 2001</xref>), number of years attended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427811414198">Holmes 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022427811414198">Schafer and Hori 2006</xref>), and likelihood of college and university enrollment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022427811414198">Frenette 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427811414198">2006</xref>).

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section6-0022427811414198">
<title>Data</title>
<p>This research analyzes data from two sources: the ProDES database of juvenile offenders in Philadelphia, and the Public Health Management Corporation’s (PHMC) Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey (HHS). The ProDES database contains records of all juveniles entering the Philadelphia Family Court between 1994 and 2004 and subsequently committed to residential or community-based treatment. This database was compiled to provide enhanced information to juvenile courts, treatment providers, and funding agencies regarding trends and outcomes in juvenile justice. Included in the ProDES database are measures of individual and family demographics, prior and current offense history, recidivism status, and many other items. Juvenile data analyzed in this study were collected from the year to year period between 1996 and 2002, when the data were most complete.</p>
<p>The juvenile dataset was first reduced by selecting only youths in nonresidential, community-based programs, as offenders attending residential programs were not required to travel to program locations and were therefore not influenced by distance to treatment. Next, only the first case for each youth was selected for inclusion in this analysis because there were not enough cases per youth to allow for a longitudinal analysis, resulting in a population of 6,996 juvenile offenders. A total of 731 juveniles were then removed because data regarding treatment completion were missing, further reducing the eligible population of juvenile offenders to 6,265.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022427811414198">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Juveniles in the ProDES dataset attended one of 31 nonresidential, community-based programs. Seven programs and their corresponding juvenile clients (<italic>n</italic> = 57) were removed in order to analyze only juvenile offenders attending treatment programs that catered to a sufficient number of clients over the 8-year period. With an average of only 8.14 juvenile clients, and approximately one per year, these seven programs were not thought to be representative of the community-based treatment available to juvenile offenders in Philadelphia. As a result, the final dataset of juvenile offenders includes 6,208 delinquent youths living within Philadelphia. The home addresses of those juvenile offenders and the locations of the 24 treatment programs were geocoded using ArcGIS 9.2. Although not part of the ProDES database, information regarding the structure and characteristics of the programs attended by the juveniles within the ProDES database was also collected.</p>
<p>Neighborhood-level data were derived from the PHMC HHS, a biannual telephone survey that collects information from residents on health-related issues in Southeastern Pennsylvania. The HHS survey also asks respondents to describe perceptions of safety and neighborhood quality. Households are randomly selected for inclusion in the survey, with random within-household selection utilized to further ensure a random sampling of residents. To match the period of data collection of the ProDES database, the current study uses data from HHS surveys collected in 2000, 2002, and 2004. A total of 4,119 adults were surveyed in 2000, 4,133 in 2002, and 4,415 in 2004, resulting in a mean of 4,222 adults surveyed per year. The data have been weighted to ensure that the respondents comprise a representative sample of residents within Philadelphia. Survey results have been aggregated to the 45 neighborhoods of Philadelphia defined by the PHMC.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022427811414198">2</xref></sup> Based on the average of 4,222 PHMC survey respondents per year, each of the 45 neighborhoods contains an average of 94 survey respondents. Using projected population weights for the 45 neighborhoods, the mean population of residents within each neighborhood, averaged across the three survey years, is 32,658.16. The minimum average population of the neighborhoods is 15,110.32 and the maximum average population is 53,474.97.</p>

<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<sec id="section8-0022427811414198">
<title>Treatment noncompletion</title>
<p>The ProDES database includes an item that measures whether a juvenile offender failed to complete treatment, and if so, the reason for treatment noncompletion. Nine categories for treatment noncompletion are specified in the ProDES database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022427811414198">Harris and Jones 2002</xref>). Prior research supports the disaggregation of treatment noncompletion measures so that potentially differing distance effects on type of noncompletion can be detected. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022427811414198">Nunes and Cortoni (2006</xref>:2-3) note the importance of distinguishing between type of noncompletion by stating that the use of aggregated measures of treatment noncompletion “likely limits the contribution such research can make to our understanding of treatment non-completion when there is heterogeneity among non-completers.” This analysis disaggregates treatment noncompletion into two measures: noncompletion due to dropout and noncompletion due to expulsion. Noncompletion due to dropout includes juveniles coded as “ran away from the program and/or a bench warrant was issued” and “does not attend as required.” Noncompletion due to expulsion includes juveniles coded as “arrested” and “noncompliant with the rules of the program, probation, or family.” The two noncompletion measures represent reasons for noncompletion that are hypothesized to be affected by distance to treatment. Other reasons for noncompletion, such as administrative functioning and personal circumstances, are not hypothesized to be influenced by distance to treatment, as they represent processes beyond the control of the young offenders.</p>

<title>Independent Variable</title>
<sec id="section11-0022427811414198">
<title>Distance to treatment</title>
<p>A measure representing the Euclidean distance between the homes of the juvenile offenders in the ProDES dataset and the treatment facilities they attend will be calculated. Also known as straight-line distance, Euclidean distance represents the most basic method of measuring the space between two points and is the most common method by which prior studies have operationalized distance. The decision to include only Euclidean distance to treatment was made after the calculation of three additional measures representing public transit time, street network distance, and street network time. These additional measures were not included in this analysis for several reasons. First, a bivariate analysis indicated that the three additional measures are highly correlated with Euclidean distance. Second, the autocorrelation of such distance measures is supported by prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427811414198">Fone, Christie, and Lester 2006</xref>), with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022427811414198">Haynes et al. (2006</xref>:47) concluding that: “We found no evidence, however, that GIS estimates were better than straight line distance in representing the variations in journey times ….” Although some research has identified differences between Cartesian and network-based difference measures, these differences are much less pronounced for individuals traveling within urban areas, which characterize the juvenile offenders analyzed by the current study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427811414198">Apparicio et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427811414198">Fone et al. 2006</xref>). Therefore, the inclusion of all four measures would be redundant. Some researchers have called for studies on the effects of distance to increasingly incorporate measures that calculate the distance and time spent traveling using various modes of public transportation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427811414198">Jordan et al. 2004</xref>). Such measures are especially important when estimating the effects of travel on individuals living in urban areas, who are most likely to use buses, subways, and other methods of public transportation. As mentioned, however, a measure calculated to represent public transit time is highly correlated with Euclidean distance (<italic>r</italic> = .893; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and would not likely contribute additional information regarding the effects of distance to treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022427811414198">3</xref></sup>

<sec id="section13-0022427811414198">
<title>Individual-level control variables</title>
<p>Earlier analyses of the ProDES database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811414198">Grunwald et al. 2010</xref>) and a review of the literature on correlates of juvenile recidivism have identified pertinent individual-level predictors from the ProDES database that represent juvenile and family demographics, criminal history, and current offense characteristics. Age, race, and gender comprise the predictors of juvenile demographics. Juveniles in the ProDES database are coded as either “White,” “Black,” “Hispanic,” or “other.” Dummy variables representing juveniles as White and Hispanic will be included in the analysis, with Black juveniles serving as the reference category. Parental criminality and aftercare status, an item representing whether the juvenile was not living with their parents at the time of entrance into the ProDES database, describe family demographics. Criminal history predictors measure whether the juveniles have committed a prior drug or violent offense.</p>

<title>Neighborhood-level control variable</title>
<p>Items from the 2000, 2002, and 2004 PHMC HHSs were used to create a scale-item that represents neighborhood disadvantage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022427811414198">4</xref></sup> The operationalizaton of this index is consistent with prior studies of community processes that estimate the effects of neighborhood disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427811414198">Baumer 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427811414198">Baumer et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427811414198">Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls 1997</xref>). The PHMC survey items that compose this scale include the proportion of residents on welfare, below the poverty line, unemployed, and an item that categorizes family income on a scale of 1–17.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022427811414198">5</xref></sup> The family income item has been multiplied by –1 so that higher values represent lower family income. Factor analysis, using a varimax rotation, was run to confirm the utility of combining these four items. The Cronbach’s α for this item in 2000 is .947, .871 in 2002, and .845 in 2004, indicating a high level of internal reliability. This scale was created for all three survey years so that a mean value of disadvantage from the three surveys over the 5-year period could be calculated.</p>

<sec id="section15-0022427811414198">
<title>Program-level control variable</title>
<p>An indicator representing the amount of program services, in hours per week, is included in this analysis to control for the effects of treatment context. Predictors representing average program length (in months) and hours per week of specific treatment services were also available among the treatment characteristics, but issues related to the accuracy of those measures preclude their inclusion into this analysis. Program modality was also considered, but was not entered into the subsequent models because the majority of offenders attended several large programs that did not target specific types of offenders. Further, discrepancies between the types of services offered by program and program modality also suggested that modality cannot be used to control for program context. It is important to note the lack of a treatment-level predictor representing the number of days per week that each program required its clients to attend. Not only would such an indicator be valuable in describing the duration and dosage levels of each program, but it could also be combined with distance to treatment to create a more comprehensive measure that represents the total distances traveled by juveniles, per week, to treatment facilities. Based on these considerations, treatment services in hours per week is believed to be the most appropriate variable with which to control for program context.</p>

<sec id="section16-0022427811414198">
<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>The analytic plan will proceed by first calculating the Euclidean distance between the home of each juvenile offender and the location of the program they attended. Next, univariate and bivariate analyses will be conducted to describe the variables to be modeled. Finally, hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLM) will be estimated to test the effects of distance to treatment on treatment noncompletion, while controlling for individual-, neighborhood-, and program-level contextual predictors. Hierarchical models are capable of disaggregating the variance in outcome measures by level of data and avoid issues related to aggregation bias and misestimation errors that stem from the natural clustering of units of analysis, compared to the more common method of logistic regression. Hierarchical modeling not only allows for the inclusion of multiple layers of data but also permits for the estimation of the distinct effects for each level of contextual predictors included in the models. In this analysis, juvenile offenders comprise the units of analysis at level-1 and neighborhoods (<italic>n</italic> = 45) and programs (<italic>n</italic> = 24) represent level-2 units of analysis. Three sets of hierarchical models will be estimated. To begin, two-level models will first estimate the effects of individual- and neighborhood-level predictors on treatment noncompletion, followed by similar two-level models that include individual- and program-level predictors. The results of these models will serve to build toward a comprehensive, cross-classified model that will simultaneously estimate the effects of all three levels of contextual variables. Unlike three-level hierarchical models, cross-classified hierarchical models take advantage of the dually nested nature of data to estimate the effects of individual-level and two level-2 sets of predictors. Although treatment programs are nested within neighborhoods and would accommodate a three-level analysis, the current study is not interested in examining how the neighborhoods in which treatment programs are located might influence treatment noncompletion. Rather, this study wishes to understand the effects of the juveniles' home neighborhoods on treatment noncompletion.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The descriptive statistics shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427811414198">Table 2</xref> indicate that treatment noncompletion due to dropout (20 percent) and expulsion (13 percent) occurs for approximately one-third of the juvenile population. Moving to the independent variable, the average Euclidean distance between the homes and treatment programs of the juvenile offenders is 4.33 miles. The shortest distance traveled is .02 miles and the longest distance 20.58 miles. Individual-level descriptive statistics indicate that the juvenile population to be studied is largely Black; only one-quarter of the juveniles are White (12 percent) or Hispanic (13 percent). The mean age at first arrest for the population is just over 14 years (14.21). A total of 15 percent of the population have a parent with a criminal history, 30 percent have committed a prior drug offense, and 18 percent have committed a prior violent offense.</p>

<p>A bivariate analysis reveals that there are no issues of multicollinearity between the individual-level variables to be entered into the hierarchical models. A subsequent bivariate analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between Euclidean distance and treatment noncompletion, with results indicating that the mean difference of distance traveled by juvenile offenders who failed to complete their treatment (4.5 miles) and those who did complete treatment (4.1 miles) is statistically significant; <italic>t</italic>(6206) = 5.439, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Further, a comparison of the average distance traveled between juveniles who failed to complete treatment due to dropout (4.9 miles) and expulsion (4.2 miles) suggests that distance will be found to influence those who drop out of treatment more acutely than those who are expelled. This is confirmed by the results of a similar bivariate analysis that indicates no significant difference between the mean distances traveled by juveniles who completed treatment and those who failed due to expulsion; <italic>t</italic>(3379) = –1.197, <italic>p</italic> = ns.</p>
<p>The analysis proceeds with the estimation of hierarchical models. The initial step when estimating hierarchical models with dichotomous outcomes requires the estimation of empty models that include only the outcome measures. This process allows for the calculation of intervals of plausible values (IPV) that represent the degree to which the probability of the outcome measures vary across level-2 units. The IPVs for the probability of treatment noncompletion due to dropout (.19, .21) and treatment noncompletion due to expulsion (.12, .13) across neighborhoods indicate that the two outcomes do not vary a great deal across the 45 neighborhoods. Similarly, treatment noncompletion due to dropout (.21, .23) and treatment noncompletion due to expulsion (.11, .13) exhibit little variation across the 24 programs. Regardless of the invariance of treatment noncompletion across neighborhoods and treatment programs, HGLM remains the most appropriate technique based on the nested structure of the data.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022427811414198">Table 3</xref> illustrates the results of the three sets of HGLM analyses predicting the effects of individual-, neighborhood-, and program-level effects on treatment noncompletion due to dropout and expulsion. Results of two-level models that include individual and neighborhood context are shown in models 1 and 2, results of two-level models that include individual and program context are shown in models 3 and 4, and, finally, results of cross-classified models that include all three levels of predictors are shown in models 5 and 6. Models 1, 3, and 5 display the effects of the three levels of contextual predictors on treatment noncompletion due to dropout, while models 2, 4, and 6 show those effects on treatment noncompletion due to expulsion. For each model, odds ratios from unit-specific models are reported with standard errors in parentheses. Significant odds ratios above 1.00 indicate that a one-unit increase in a predictor acts to increase the likelihood of a juvenile offender failing to complete treatment, while significant odds ratios below 1.00 have the opposite effect of reducing the likelihood of treatment noncompletion.</p>

<p>Beginning with the results of the two-level models that include neighborhood context, model 1 shows that Euclidean distance (1.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) is significantly correlated with an increased likelihood of dropping out of treatment. Specifically, the odds of a juvenile offender dropping out of treatment increase by approximately 32 percent for each increase of 3.29 miles to treatment. Interestingly, the results of model 2 indicate that distance does not significantly influence treatment noncompletion due to expulsion. Odds ratios of the individual-level control variables in model 1 show that the effects of having committed a prior drug offense (1.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and being designated as an aftercare case (1.57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) act to increase the odds of failing to complete treatment due to dropout. In model 2, those predictors, along with having a prior violent offense (1.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and having a parent with a criminal history (1.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) similarly serve to increase the odds that a juvenile offender will be expelled from treatment. In contrast, the effects of being White (.74, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), Hispanic (.80, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and female (.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) decrease the odds of treatment expulsion in model 2. Regarding neighborhood context, the results of both models 1 and 2 indicate a significant effect of neighborhood disadvantage to increase the likelihood of treatment noncompletion as disadvantage increases, although this effect is weaker for noncompletion due to expulsion (1.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) than dropout (1.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Models 3 and 4 depict the results of two-level models that estimate the effects of individual- and program-level context on treatment noncompletion. As with models 1 and 2, the most important results stem from the effects of Euclidean distance. However, when controlling for the amount of treatment services, the effects of distance are shown to no longer significantly influence treatment noncompletion due to dropout. Consistent with model 2, model 4 indicates that distance to treatment is unassociated with expulsion from treatment. Being Hispanic (1.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), an aftercare case (1.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and having committed a prior drug offense (1.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) are shown to significantly influence the likelihood of treatment dropout in model 3, while being White (.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), female (.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), having a parent with a criminal history (1.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), being designated as an aftercare case (1.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and having committed a prior drug offense (1.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) are significant predictors of treatment expulsion when controlling for program context in model 4. The effects of treatment services per week at the program-level indicates that an increase in treatment services acts to increase the odds that juvenile offenders will drop out of treatment (model 3: 1.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) but not be expelled from treatment.</p>
<p>Finally, models 5 and 6 present the results of cross-classified hierarchical models that include all three levels of contextual predictors. Compared to the two-level models, results of the cross-classified analyses indicate that there are fewer significant predictors of treatment noncompletion when controlling for three levels of predictors. In fact, only parental criminality (1.87, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) is shown to be a significant predictor within the cross-classified models, and only for treatment dropout in model 5. At level-2, hours per week of treatment services is positively related to treatment dropout in model 5 (2.01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Of greatest interest is the effect of Euclidean distance (1.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) in model 5 to significantly predict treatment dropout, indicating that juvenile offenders are nearly twice as likely to drop out of treatment for every increase of 3.29 miles between their home and the location of treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study presents evidence that distance to treatment is significantly and positively related to program noncompletion for juvenile offenders. Specifically, an increase of approximately 3.29 miles to treatment results in an increase of approximately 32 percent in the odds of treatment noncompletion due to dropout when controlling for individual and neighborhood context. Although distance to treatment does not significantly predict treatment noncompletion when controlling for program context, results from the cross-classified analysis indicate that an increase in the distance between the homes and treatment locations of young offenders will nearly double the odds that a juvenile will drop out of treatment. Together, these results can be interpreted to conclude that distance to treatment does matter when estimating the odds that a juvenile offender will fail to complete treatment.</p>
<p>Beyond the conclusion that distance to treatment matters, several other interesting findings can be gleaned from this analysis. First, distance to treatment significantly predicts only treatment noncompletion due to dropout. This was not unexpected. The causal mechanisms for juveniles who are expelled from treatment are likely different from those that cause offenders to simply stop attending treatment. Distance to treatment would certainly be among the expected correlates of voluntarily dropping out, compared to expulsion from treatment, which is commonly the result of misconduct on the part of juvenile offenders.</p>
<p>In addition to the effects of distance uncovered by the current study, notable individual-, neighborhood-, and program-level effects on treatment noncompletion were also identified. Neighborhood disadvantage was found to significantly predict the odds of treatment noncompletion due to dropout and expulsion, which is consistent with prior research on the effects of neighborhood context on delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427811414198">Bursik 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022427811414198">Sampson and Groves 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022427811414198">Sampson et al. 1999</xref>) and juvenile recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811414198">Grunwald et al. 2010</xref>). The amount of treatment services was also found to significantly affect treatment noncompletion, but only due to dropout. These results are not surprising, as they support the intuitive expectation that juveniles who are required to attend more rigorous treatment regimens are more likely to simply stop attending.</p>
<p>At the individual-level, several predictors were identified as significant correlates of treatment noncompletion in the two-level models. When controlling for neighborhood context, the gender and race of juvenile offenders was found to influence treatment expulsion, but not noncompletion due to dropout. Similarly, predictors related to criminal history are shown to be associated with both types of noncompletion and in the expected directions. When controlling for program context, several criminal history-related predictors are significantly associated with both types of treatment noncompletion, although the effect of having committed a prior violent offense is not among them and the effects of having a parent with a criminal past is associated only with treatment expulsion.</p>
<p>The findings stemming from the current study have several implications. From a methodological standpoint, the initial determination that Euclidean distance is highly correlated with public transit time, street network time, and street network distance supports prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427811414198">Fone et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022427811414198">Haynes et al. 2006</xref>) but stands as an important finding regarding the effects of distance on juvenile offender treatment noncompletion. Euclidean distance is suggested as the most appropriate method by which to operationalize the travel of juvenile offenders to treatment programs in urban locales due to the relative ease of its calculation and interpretation. This work confirms the finding that future researchers who wish to examine distance effects should not expect to sacrifice precision or accuracy by calculating measures of Euclidean distance.</p>
<p>Another methodological contribution made by the current study relates to the disaggregation of treatment noncompletion into two distinct outcomes. Earlier work that analyzed this dataset found that individual- and neighborhood-level correlates of juvenile recidivism differ when disaggregating recidivism by offense type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811414198">Grunwald et al. 2010</xref>). Although no known prior studies have disaggregated treatment noncompletion for juvenile offenders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022427811414198">Nunes and Cortoni (2006)</xref> have argued for the identification of predictors of noncompletion that might differ by type of treatment attrition. The current study confirms those concerns by finding that the predictors of juvenile offender treatment noncompletion also have divergent effects that differ by type of treatment noncompletion.</p>
<p>Theoretically, this work expands on the current literature of activity space as it pertains to juvenile offenders in urban areas. Although crime pattern theory is a prominent framework within environmental criminology, few studies have examined the effects of activity space on outcomes beyond crime. Findings from this study support the expectation that the activity space of juvenile offenders does influence the travel decisions of juvenile offenders by suggesting that they are less likely to complete treatment if they are required to travel beyond their developed activity spaces. As a result, this analysis lends support to the “closer to home principle” by finding that juveniles attending treatment farther from their homes are less likely to complete treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022427811414198">Guerra et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, these findings can inform practitioners at various stages in the juvenile justice system. Judges, program administrators, and other stakeholders responsible for the placement of juvenile offenders into treatment can now be made aware of the effects of travel to treatment on the success of juvenile-treatment clients. Although distance to treatment is certainly not the only factor that influences treatment noncompletion, the findings from this analysis can be utilized to more successfully match juvenile offenders with appropriate treatment programs. Juvenile court judges, for example, can include a consideration of distance when deciding where to send juvenile offenders whom they require to seek community-based treatment. For judges who have determined the type of treatment program they would like offenders to attend and who have multiple programs to select from, distance to treatment can be a valuable factor to consider during their decision-making process. At an even earlier stage, individuals responsible for the creation and funding of treatment programs can take distance effects into account when determining where to place programs and from what areas to target clients. This study suggests that treatment programs that target juvenile clients who live near program locations will garner better outcomes for program clients.</p>
<p>This research is not without limitations. The most serious limitation stems from the use of Euclidean distance to represent the costs of travel for juvenile offenders attending treatment programs. Although there is little reason to question the accuracy of the Euclidean distances calculated, the measure serves as a proxy to represent the travel of juvenile offenders through urban space. Without data that explicitly describe the journeys undertaken by juveniles, the straight-line distance measure employed by the current study cannot be assumed to estimate the true physical, temporal, psychological, and financial costs of travel to treatment. Similarly, this analysis assumes that juveniles required to travel farther distances are most likely to travel outside of their activity spaces. While this expectation is not unreasonable, the lack of data to describe the activity spaces of the juvenile offenders limits the ability of this study to make such a claim. For these reasons, future researchers are advised to gather data that operationalizes the activity spaces of juvenile offenders, in addition to the methods and costs of their travels. On a related note, the aforementioned lack of data to describe days per week for each treatment program similarly limits the ability to estimate the actual distance traveled by juveniles. Days per week of treatment at the individual- or program-level could be combined with measures of distance to represent the total distance and/or time spent traveling by young offenders.</p>
<p>This analysis also possesses weaknesses based on its methodology. The first of these issues is due to the use of three distinct datasets to estimate individual-, neighborhood-, and program-level context. While the inclusion of three levels of data within the cross-classified models permits for a comprehensive analysis, it also provides for increased data noise. These effects are most clearly evidenced by the inflation of standard errors in models 5 and 6 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022427811414198">Table 3</xref>, compared to the standard errors within the two-level models. The use of proxy measures at all three levels (Euclidean distance to represent travel to treatment at level-1, disadvantage to represent neighborhood context at level-2, and program dosage to represent treatment context at level-2) also contributes to the level of noise in models 5 and 6 and should be considered when interpreting the results of the cross-classified analyses.</p>
<p>Similarly, the low number of juvenile offenders per neighborhood and program exacerbates the methodological limitations of this analysis. A dataset with more than 6,000 individuals is generally not considered sparse, but the resulting cross-classified structure of 1,080 cells in a 24 (programs) by 45 (neighborhoods) contingency table contains cells with only 5.75 juvenile offenders, on average. As a result, the subsequent models may suffer from a lack of statistical power. Together, the inclusion of multiple levels of data, the use of proxy measures to represent contextual variables, and a potentially sparse level-1 dataset, indicates that the results from this analysis, and especially from the cross-classified models, should be interpreted with caution. These issues may also offer insight as to why only Euclidean distance was found to be a significant predictor of treatment noncompletion due to dropout in model 5, and why no variables were identified as significant predictors of treatment expulsion in model 6.</p>
<p>In sum, the current study has identified significant effects of distance on the odds that juvenile offenders will drop out of treatment. Specifically, increases in the Euclidean distance between the home of an offender and the location of their treatment program have been shown to increase the odds of dropping out of treatment but not of being expelled from treatment. These findings hold several implications, with perhaps the most important suggesting that juvenile justice policymakers should make efforts to place juvenile offenders into programs that are nearer to their homes. Further, the current study contributes to the literature on juvenile justice by comparing multiple measures of distance, disaggregating treatment noncompletion, and by including multiple levels of contextual predictors that provide valuable insight into the influences of treatment noncompletion for juvenile offenders.</p>

<p>Comparisons were then made between the juveniles who were missing this information and the other 6,208 juveniles in the dataset. Chi Square tests were run to determine if significant differences existed between the juveniles who did and did not have data regarding program completion on demographic characteristics, including race, gender, and age (dichotomized to capture the older half of the study population in age vs. the younger half). These tests revealed that no significant differences exist on these indicators, when comparing juveniles who do and do not have information concerning the status of their treatment completion. An independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test was then conducted to examine differences in straight-line distance between juveniles who were missing the treatment completion variable and those that did not. This test similarly indicated that there is no significant difference on distance to treatment between the two samples of juveniles. Based on these findings, the juveniles who are missing this information can be considered to be missing at random and were subsequently removed.</p>

<p>Constructed in the 1980s, the Public Health Management Corporation (PHMC) neighborhood boundaries were defined after consulting with individuals and organizations familiar with the spatial composition of Philadelphia, with the intent of identifying the distinct communities within Philadelphia. This method of neighborhood aggregation is more likely to effectively capture neighborhood boundaries, when compared to the politically drawn boundaries of the U.S. Census. The mean area of the 45 PHMC neighborhoods is 3.17 square miles, the minimum area is .80 square miles, and the maximum area is 9.77 square miles.</p>

<p>To be sure that no information regarding the effects of distance to treatment would not be lost by including only Euclidean distance as a measure of distance to treatment, hierarchical models identical to those presented in the results section of this study were estimated that included public transit time as a level-1 predictor. The results indicated that public transit time and Euclidean distance exerted nearly identical effects on treatment noncompletion.</p>

<p>This study originally entered an additional neighborhood-level predictor representing social capital, similar to the construction of social capital in prior studies of crime (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022427811414198">Messner, Baumer, and Rosenfeld 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022427811414198">Rosenfeld, Messner, and Baumer 2001</xref>) into the models estimated by this analysis. The results were nearly identical to the results produced by an earlier study that examined similar data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427811414198">Grunwald et al. 2010</xref>), indicating that the two measures of community context have nearly opposite effects on the outcomes measures. In an effort to conserve space, the results of models including social capital at the neighborhood-level are not reported in this article.</p>

<p>This scale deviates from prior conceptualizations of neighborhood disadvantage as it does not include proportion of Black residents or female-headed households. The PHMC survey does not collect information regarding female-headed households, so this item could not be included. The proportion of Black residents was not included for two reasons: the effects of race are already included by predictors at the individual-level, and the inclusion of proportion of Black residents did not improve the predictive ability of the scale. Perhaps most importantly, neighborhood constructs, such as concentrated disadvantage, can distort and confound neighborhood processes by including items that represent both cultural and economic indicators. By not including the proportion of Black residents or single female-headed households, the resulting predictor clearly represents socioeconomic status (SES) in the neighborhoods.</p>
