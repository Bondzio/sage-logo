<p>My original goal on beginning to work on the project that became <italic>The Sources of Social Power</italic> was very ambitious. I would return to the classic sociological tradition of Marx and Weber, developing grand theory on human societies in general from a firm empirical base. Since I intended, like them, to write about long-term macro-social change, I knew I would rely mainly on historical data. By that stage I had become an empirical sociologist investigating workers, factories, and labor markets. But I was also enjoying the new experience of teaching sociology, and specifically of teaching sociological theory, at Essex University in England, which as a new university, attracting students who at that time hoped sociology might give them the meaning of life, was rather exciting. Furthermore, I retained my childhood love of reading history books for pleasure. It seemed to me like an ideal match between theory, data, and history.</p>
<p>Looking back, I realize that I must have possessed enormous self-confidence, though I think that this is not a quality which has been very evident on the surface to others. I have read widely and I have been fortunate that, after my period at Essex, the London School of Economics offered me the enormous resources of the British Library, which was then located in the palatial rotunda of the British Museum, and then UCLA offered me the great resources of its research library. I was also fortunate to have been involved in a highly stimulating seminar series at LSE (along with Ernest Gellner and John A. Hall), followed by two fine seminar series at UCLA (one along with Perry Anderson and Robert Brenner, the other with Ivan Szelenyi, Rogers Brubaker, Andreas Wimmer, and Ching Kwan Lee). These have offered many fruitful discussions with scholars working at the macro-level of several academic disciplines.</p>
<p>I was initially spurred on in my foolhardy venture by my dislike of what I saw as the twin evils of contemporary sociology, abstracted empiricism and abstract theory, and also by my dislike of the economic determinism so pervasive across all the social sciences. I later grew also to dislike strong versions of the rival “cultural turn.” I retain all these dislikes today.</p>
<p>It was as a counter-puncher against these determinisms that I began to emphasize military and political power relations. Support for the campaign for nuclear disarmament in Britain and Europe during the 1970s added impetus to this, since I rejected the view of most of my leftist friends that the Cold War was fundamentally a struggle between capitalism and communism. While not denying the relevance of this struggle, I saw it as being amplified both by an ideological struggle and by geopolitical rivalry comparable to many Great Power rivalries of history. I also saw how societies might be changed fundamentally by the advent of weapons of such destructiveness that they could never be rationally deployed. Mild activism in the British Labour Party firmed up an enduring respect for the specificity of politics and an enduring respect for pragmatic social democracy (which becomes very evident in Volume Four).</p>
<p>Today, ideological and domestic political power relations are no longer so neglected by sociologists but geopolitics, war, and militarism remain woefully neglected (alas, I seem to have had very little influence here). These nowadays involve a handful of sociologists compared to the hundreds who work on topics like identity, demography, or ethnicity. It is really extraordinary that military power has been so ignored by social scientists in a century containing two World Wars, a Cold War involving a nuclear weapons race, and an enduring and militaristic American empire. Americans get annoyed when I suggest that this country is profoundly militarist. Yet no other conclusion can be drawn from general national pride in American military power, the general assumption that force should be threatened or used abroad to secure freedom and other desired values, the reverential view of American troops, the prevalence of guns, and the power of a gun lobby which can argue successfully that semi-automatic assault weapons are an essential part of the freedom of Americans.</p>
<p>Such were the sources of my sources. Almost from the beginning I decided I would trace the interactions of the four power sources in human society. I naively believed that I could accomplish this enormous task in a single volume, which would contain theoretical exploration based on three historical and contemporary case studies. Examples of my early intentions are the two articles “States, Ancient and Modern” and “The Autonomous Power of the State” (in which I developed the distinction between despotic and infrastructural power which is easily the most cited of my concepts).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094306113491546">1</xref></sup> But my historical sensitivity soon took over and I found myself immersed in a narrative history of large slices of the world. As this grew larger and larger, I split it into two volumes, then three. Then two chapters of Volume Three grew into book-size, and so I published them as <italic>Fascists</italic> (Cambridge, 2004) and <italic>The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing</italic> (Cambridge, 2005). Finally, when I presented what would have been an 800-page third volume, Cambridge University Press politely suggested I divide it into two. I soon agreed. Size does matter, but the feel of a 400-page book is so much nicer than one double that size. At that point I had the whole 800 pages ready for the press, and the division into two books plus some consequent revisions did not take long. Hence Volume Four appeared only about two months after Volume Three. I do not think I could have started out with the intention of writing four volumes—they had to happen as unintended consequences of my original bravado. Such an unintended journey resembles that of Immanuel Wallerstein, as described by him in his recent contribution to a symposium on his work in this journal last year (Volume 41, Number 1, 2012). However, I do have an edge over him (and over Perry Anderson, too) in that I have actually <bold>finished</bold> my narrative. What a relief! It has turned out being almost my life’s work.</p>
<p>The bulk of <italic>Sources</italic> comprises detailed historical narratives in which my conceptual scheme and my conclusions are embedded, though they intermittently emerge explicitly. I am asking a great deal of sociologists when I ask them to read most of this narrative in order to get to the point. On the contrary, it is the concepts that tire historians. I should add that I am definitely a sociologist, not an historian, but a sociologist of the old school. I am actually quite proud of my more theoretical chapters: Chapter One of Volume One explaining my model, Chapter Three of Volume Two presenting a theory of the modern state, and Chapter Nine of Volume Four presenting a theory of revolutions. But for the most part I expect my readers to divine my broader arguments through detailed empirical materials and explanations of specific situations. For example, my theory of class develops especially through several chapters of Volume Two, of empire through three chapters of Volume Three, of the impact of war through four chapters of Volumes Three and Four.</p>
<p>The reissue of Volumes One and Two has allowed me to write new introductions for them which contain some general reflections, especially on my methodology and in response to my critics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094306113491546">2</xref></sup> I am pleased that the press has now designed more attractive covers for all four volumes. My favorite is Volume Two which features the magnificent 1839 painting by J.M.W. Turner, “The Fighting Temeraire,” a renowned battleship of the line, veteran of Trafalgar and many other naval battles, being towed against a fabulous sunset by a tiny coal-fired tug to her last berth to be broken up. The painting brilliantly symbolizes the sunset of the pre-industrial era rendered obsolete by the power of the Industrial Revolution. That is, of course, the theme of Volume Two.</p>
<p>The initial idea that I might produce a much grander theory, including a ranking of the relative strengths of the four sources, fell by the wayside some years ago. In the final chapter of Volume Four, I do generalize about the distinctive nature of each of the four power sources, but not about their relative importance. As I say there, that all depends on time and place. Mine is not a very strong theory; it is more an orienting model. That is the main reason why I have not had to change it much over the years, for a model cannot be falsified. Hopefully it is useful—though that is up to the reader to decide.</p>
<p>Yet when dealing with the contemporary period, illuminated by an enormous body of day-to-day evidence, I became more aware of the ability of individuals and small groups placed in positions of power to affect outcomes. I have also become more conscious that they, and indeed all of us, are emotional and often irrational creatures, so that outcomes may be unpredictable and sometimes devastating. This is most obviously true in decisions to go or not to go to war. But it is characteristic of all fields of human action. I have also modified the model to situate geopolitical power in terms of either political or military power, according to the degree of violence involved and I have clarified the nature of military power in order to better identify its difference from political power. But my volumes are stuffed full of more particular explanations of social developments—of capitalism, states, wars, ideologies—which are seen through the prism of my model. Obviously these explanations can be refuted, and some of them will be.</p>
<p>At the least, my model is an assertion that a full explanation of major historical phenomena must normally include analysis of all four sources of power. Even where military power is largely absent (it is the least consistent of my sources), as in my chapters on neoliberalism in Volume Four, I deal with three sources. Even that is more than most sociologists attempt. In addition my work contains an assertion that all four sources have a relative autonomy from each other. While interacting with and influenced by the others, each has a certain distinctive logic of development. They are in fact orthogonal to each other, interacting but not in a systematically determinant way. This can be comprehended most easily by perceiving that each generates its own distinct geographic networks of interaction. Like Margaret Thatcher, I say there is no such thing as society. But my sense of this is very different from hers. I mean that “societies” are not singular, bounded entities. Human society is composed of overlapping, intersecting networks of which the primary ones form around my four power sources. Economic and ideological power relations can diffuse broadly and somewhat transnationally across the world. Political power relations confine people over bounded territories. Military power relations may be largely in the service of states, or they may not be (in the case of terrorists, for example), while military striking ranges have become truly and terrifyingly global. We must not neglect any of them or the differences between them.</p>
<p>The fact that I call my approach the IEMP model of power should not be taken as meaning that I think that ideological power is the most important source, followed by economic, military, and political networks. The order has no significance. Indeed, I now think that I picked the worst possible combination of these four letters, since it produces an acronym that cannot be easily pronounced. Better MIPE or PIME, which at least readers could remember! But an ordering which would make more theoretical sense and which could be pronounced would be MEPI, since I believe that military and economic power in a sense come first, while political power is their institutionalization over a given territorial space, and ideologies emerge to cope with the interactions of these three sources. However, temporal priority is not the same as importance. Durkheim noted the phenomenon of “emergence” in human societies, and I see both political and ideological power as having emergent properties which then act back on societies and transform them. But I cannot change labels so late in the day.</p>
<p>Finally, a word is in order concerning what I fail to discuss in these volumes. One cannot discuss the whole world, and much of it is seen only indirectly, for example as the butt of imperial power. This is mostly true of Latin America, while Africa gets even less attention. My focus was broadest in the first half of Volume One when discussing ancient empires. Then it narrowed to Europe before adding on America in Volume Two. Volume Three broadens out again through empires and world wars. China and Japan figure large here. Volume Four veers between a focus on the sole remaining empire of today, the United States, and broader comparative analyses both between states and between capitalism and communism. Thus I have not written a history of the whole world, as world historians might attempt to do. I focus on the leading edge(s) of power in each period, plus (to a lesser extent) those at the receiving end of their power.</p>
<p>In terms of my themes, some complain about what they consider to be my rather narrow conception of ideological power. For me, ideologies do not comprise the whole of human culture. Everything that we say and do has a cultural element and I am skeptical that we can say much about the causal power of such a diffuse all-enveloping phenomenon. Cultural sociology, even in its stronger formulations, is noticeably light on causal statements. I have chosen to focus only on major meaning systems and movements, those whose ideas, values, and rituals transform human societies—for I am interested in power, after all. So I discuss religions and recent secular ideologies like socialism, fascism, liberalism, and neoliberalism, but not the mass media, Hollywood, or rap music.</p>
<p>Second, I do not discuss gender or ethnicity much, though in Volumes Three and Four race and racism do receive quite lengthy treatment. It is obvious in those sections that I consider racism to be the outcome of certain configurations of the four sources of social power. I would suggest that the same might apply to gender and ethnicity. I would seek to explain their transformations (gender relations have been fundamentally transformed in recent times) in similar fashion. Though I have not undertaken serious research on these matters, I hope that others deploy my model, flexibly, to investigate them. Yet I must finally admit that every model, every approach to human societies, including my own, pushes some actors and institutions onto front stage, under the spotlights, while pushing others to walk-on parts or even to backstage. That is because human societies are always more complex than our theories.</p>
