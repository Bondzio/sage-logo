            <p>Since 2010, discussions about more risk-proportionate trial authorization and supervision procedures gain momentum in the European Union and the United States. This article provides an overview of the current situation and analyses existing proposals for the risk-based assessment and categorization of clinical research. Experiences gained so far with the risk-based categorization and classification of trials and products in the pharmaceuticals and medical devices sector are described: they indicate that strict trial categorization systems would add burden to the whole process and could deliver benefit only within a very flexible regulatory framework. In contrast, partial exemptions from regulatory requirements for well-defined types of trials may respond better to the current expectations of stakeholders. For Europe, such exemptions could be adopted in a custom-made manner with the objective of facilitating the conduct of large, simple, evidence-building clinical trials as well as of patient-focused trials in situations of recognized unmet medical need.</p>

      <p>Through the revision of the EU Clinical Trials Directive,<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512453574">1</xref>
         </sup> the European Commission intends to integrate for the first time ever “risk adapted rules” in Europe’s legislative framework for clinical trials. Collecting feedback for “insufficient risk differentiation” and “more precise and risk adapted rules for the content of the application dossier and for safety reporting” during 2 consultations disclosed in October 2009 and February 2011,<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512453574">2</xref>

         </sup> the European Commission is currently moving forward to apply a “risk-based approach” to clinical research. Although the scope and applicability of such an approach—to apply either to the whole authorization process or only to specific elements of the process—are still unclear and will be finally decided by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, some basic issues associated with the alignment of risk assessment and evaluation principles to a regulated “business” like the undertaking of clinical research must be considered and solved by the legislator.</p>
      <p>For some years, stakeholders call for such a move. Their expectations range from more risk-commensurate requirements regarding specific trial aspects—trial monitoring, drug labeling, safety reporting, and insurance cover are 4 relevant examples—to proposals for general trial categorization systems defining at a glance applicable and graduated regulatory requirements.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512453574">5</xref>

         </sup>
      </p>
      <p>It is crucial for all parties involved—investigators and trial sponsors as well as government agencies and legislators—to achieve a broad agreement about the notion of risk in clinical research, about the variables contributing to risk in a clinical trial and about the way how a categorization of risk can be achieved. However, this task is neither new nor exclusively limited to Europe’s clinical trial community. In the United States, the burden of regulation is considered a threat for the conduct of clinical research too,<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512453574">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512453574">10</xref>
         </sup> and proposals were made to simplify the conduct of trials by streamlined risk-proportionate frameworks.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512453574">11</xref>
         </sup> The need to reduce the regulatory burden is not confined to clinical drug research.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512453574">12</xref>
         </sup>
      </p>
      <p>This article is aimed to provide an overview of the current situation in the EU and intends to highlight achievements but also pitfalls for a risk-based legislation made in the medical devices sector. It will sketch the general options that could be chosen by the legislator to render the current framework for clinical trials more risk commensurate and may serve as a contribution to stimulate the discussion on the available options and its best use.</p>
      <sec id="section1-0092861512453574">
         <title>Risk in Clinical Research</title>
         <p>Clinical research professionals commonly bear in mind the introductory section of the International Conference on Harmonisation’s Good Clinical Practice guidelines (ICH-GCP)<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092861512453574">13</xref>
            </sup> when they refer to the issue of risk. The introduction chapter emphasizes the objective and purpose of the GCP standard, namely, to ensure “that the rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that the clinical trial data are credible.”<sup>13(p1</sup>
            <sup>)</sup> This 2-sided definition of risk—associating risk with the determinants “trial subjects” and “trial data”—has also directly been transposed into the internationally acknowledged definitions of clinical trial audit and inspections findings.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092861512453574">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092861512453574">15</xref>
            </sup> The distinct nature of risk in clinical research was also underpinned by a consortium of academic trial sponsors,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092861512453574">16</xref>
            </sup> adding as well the notion that, from the public health perspective, irrelevant or even misleading results from clinical trials may affect doctors’ daily treatment decision-making: the resulting risk to “public health” might therefore be considered as a third dimension of risk.</p>
         <p>A different idea of risk has been promulgated by the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Quality by Design (QbD) initiative<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092861512453574">17</xref>
            </sup> and the Quality Risk Management Q9 guideline issued by the ICH.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092861512453574">18</xref>
            </sup> Both documents aim to improve drug manufacturing process capabilities, to reduce the burden of process control and quality documentation, and to increase the overall regulatory flexibility. Although focusing beforehand on drug quality aspects, the ICH Q9 guidance and the associated guidelines ICH Q8 (pharmaceutical development) and ICH Q10 (pharmaceutical quality systems) currently gain momentum for the whole R&amp;D process.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0092861512453574">19</xref>
            </sup> Introducing the general principles developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to the pharmaceuticals sector, this new “quality paradigm” applies common risk management processes and tools, used by many other industries, to drug development.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0092861512453574">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092861512453574">21</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Originating from the quality management philosophy, the ISO approach defines <italic>risk</italic> as the “combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm,”<sup>20(p2)</sup> and <italic>risk management</italic> as a “systematic process for the assessment, control, communication and review of risks.”<sup>18(p2)</sup> It is evident that the perception of risk in this approach is different from the beforehand-described conception of risk in clinical research: the notion of risk is neutral and emphasis is put not on its avoidance but on the systematic viewing how to handle risks.</p>

         <title>Risk Assessment</title>
         <p>From the clinical research perspective, the identification of risk factors during trial planning and trial conduct is rather usual practice. However, the adequate identification of risks remains a challenge as it should include not only product-, population-, and protocol-related aspects but also a (self-)critical appraisal of the organization initiating the trial itself and its intentions why to conduct a specific trial. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092861512453574">Figure 1</xref> attempts to visualize the different hazard variables that may contribute to the notion of risk in a clinical trial; ISO guide 51:1999 defines hazards as “potential sources of harm” with harm being equalized to a “damage to health.”<sup>

         <p>From the quality risk management perspective, the identification of risk “is a systematic use of [all types of available] information to identify hazards referring to the risk question”<sup>18(p4)</sup> and must result into an estimation of the risk associated with the identified hazards. Such a risk analysis triggers a risk evaluation<bold> </bold>comparing “the identified and analyzed risk against given risk criteria”<sup>18(p4)</sup> considering as well the strength of evidence for the findings made. The overall “systematic process of organizing information to support a risk decision to be made within a risk management process” is called <italic>risk assessment</italic>; “it consists of the identification of hazards and the analysis and evaluation of risks associated with exposure to those hazards.”<sup>

</sup>
         </p>
         <p>This toolbox of process elements is instructive and describes in a systematic manner the way, many clinical research professionals and sponsors intuitively use whenever they assess risks in the context of a clinical trial. But neither in ICH-GCP nor in the current EU or US legislation has such a systemic risk assessment approach been incorporated in the past. The requirements of ICH-GCP simply rely on the weighting of “foreseeable risks and inconveniences against the anticipated benefit for the individual trial subject and society”<sup>13(p9)</sup> by the sponsor and an institutional review board (IRB) or an independent ethics committee (IEC), and—in terms of audit plans and procedures—to the “level of risk” inherent to a given trial.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092861512453574">13</xref>

         <title>Risk Categorization</title>
         <p>The reason why in the past no requirements for a systematic risk assessment were incorporated into clinical trial guidelines and legislation is easy to explain. On one hand the “level of risk” is considered as a “continuous and multidimensional variable,”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092861512453574">16</xref>(p2)
</sup> on the other hand the toolbox of risk management principles and activities as provided by the ISO was simply not yet ready for use at the time when the ICH-GCP process and, subsequently, the drafting of the EU Clinical Trials Directive took place.</p>
         <p>The challenge to induce a systematic risk assessment is mainly related to the difficulty to set up a meaningful system of distinct and graduated risk levels for clinical research. A system of distinct “overall risk levels” requires either an upfront prioritization of hazard variables (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092861512453574">Figure 1</xref>) aligning the categorization exercise to 1 or 2 variables only, or a step-by-step evaluation of each hazard variable resulting into a systematic categorization of the overall risks, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0092861512453574">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

               <p>A model for systematic risk categorization. The use of 2-dimensional risk charts is proposed in the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) guidance on risk management principles.<sup>

                  </sup> They serve as a tool for better visualization of previously identified risk severity (“severity of harm scale”) and occurrence (“probability of occurrence of harm scale”) categories with the goal to define distinct risk categories. In case of the presence of multiple and independent hazard variables, the detectability of harm may serve as a third parameter to prioritize and align hazard variables accordingly. Definitions for the severity and probability of occurrence scales are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512453574">Table 1</xref>.</p>

         <title>Experiences With Risk Categorization</title>
         <p>With the latter approach still serving at the moment as a theoretical concept for clinical drug research, examples however exist of simplified risk assessment approaches taking into account only one or a few hazard variables.</p>
         <p>In order to provide additional guidance for the conduct of noninterventional studies, the Italian legislator adopted in March 2008 an ordinance on the classification and conduct of observational studies with medicinal products in Italy.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0092861512453574">22</xref>
            </sup> Although noninterventional studies are not perceived to constitute relevant risk to patients’ safety, potential risks in terms of data protection and in relation to data reliability prompted the Italian authorities to classify such trials into 2 categories (prospective vs retrospective studies) and to set up a graduated system of public supervision (authorization vs notification—in both cases toward an ethics committee) in line with mandatory study registration. A similar approach was chosen in 2009 by the Spanish legislator, which set up a uniform supervision and classification system for all forms of observational postauthorization studies.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0092861512453574">23</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Although the Italian approach implies just 1 hazard variable, the Spanish approach combines 2 variables: the data collection time point (prospective vs retrospective) and the trial intention/purpose (authority-mandated study conducted by a marketing authorization holder vs evidence-driven study conducted by a publicly financed trial sponsor). As a result of factorial combinatorics, 4 categories for a graduated public supervision are generated within the current Spanish system using 2 hazard variables.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0092861512453574">23</xref>
            </sup> The extension of such an approach to a third hazard variable would result in much more (ie, 3 · 3! = 18) possibilities.</p>
         <p>In the regulation of medical devices, such a complex risk assessment and classification system is in use for several years, forming hence an excellent showcase for comparison. The risk-based classification of medical devices—in terms of the products, not in terms of clinical investigations with medical devices—has evolved in accordance with the above-described ISO principles. Set up under the auspices of the Global Harmonisation Task Force (GHTF)—ICH’s equivalent in the medical devices sector—the implementation of risk management principles and activities within a quality management system has been applied accordingly.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0092861512453574">24</xref>
            </sup> The approach used for the risk assessment of medical devices includes risk analysis and evaluation tools/methodology as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0092861512453574">Figure 2</xref>, and provides definitions for the severity of harm and the probability of occurrence of harm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512453574">Table 1</xref>). As an outcome of the GHTF process, an established system for the risk-based classification of medical devices was agreed among the drug authorities in North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia using a few common internationally acknowledged risk categories for medical devices: classes III (high risk), II (moderate risk), and I (low risk).<sup>

            </sup> prepared the methodological ground for the MHRA paper. Both groups concluded that trials should be categorized trough a maximum of 3 (ADAMON) or 4 (OptiMon) risk levels. Full results for both studies—intended to include 3200 and 1800 patients, respectively—are not expected before 2013. Recently, the US FDA seized a closely related issue regarding trial monitoring. In its draft guidance from August 2011, the FDA encouraged trial sponsors to make more use of risk-based approaches to monitoring through centralized monitoring via electronic data capture systems, a proposal that is applicable for investigations with drugs, biological agents, and medical devices.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0092861512453574">35</xref>
            </sup> The US agency decided therefore to withdraw its 23-year-old guidance on monitoring of drug trials and device investigations, which stated that the “most effective way” to monitor an investigation was to “maintain personal contact between the monitor and the investigator throughout the clinical investigation.”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0092861512453574">35</xref>(p4)
</sup> In its new guidance, the FDA suggests that remote monitoring should be used not only to replace or augment on-site monitoring, but also for identifying “higher risk clinical sites (e.g., sites with data anomalies or a higher frequency of errors, protocol violations, or dropouts relative to other sites).”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0092861512453574">35</xref>(p8)

         <title>Overall Legislative Approaches to Risk</title>
         <p>Will these new proposals and ideas be considered by the European legislator? How and to what extent may an EU-wide approach for the risk-based regulation of clinical trials be adopted? These questions are yet unanswered. Any change will imply a modification of the current legal framework for clinical trials in Europe. At a glance, the European Commission has to choose between 2 concepts: on one hand a <italic>top-down approach</italic>—introducing instruments in order to establish a systematic classification system (option A)—and on the other hand, a <italic>bottom-up approach</italic>, implementing new principles to foster the inherent use of total quality management tools throughout the overall study design, planning, and conduct process (option B). Both options are analyzed in the following.</p>
         <sec id="section7-0092861512453574">
            <title>Option A: Risk-based overall trial authorization and supervision</title>
            <p>Similar to the British project run by the MRC, DH, and MHRA,<sup>

               </sup> the European Commission could define distinct risk categories of trials and specify areas suitable for a risk-based management. At a multistakeholder workshop held in July 2011 in Brussels, a favorable vote for a 3-level risk categorization based on the marketing status of the active ingredient of the investigational medicinal product (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0092861512453574">Figure 3</xref>) was given.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0092861512453574">38</xref>
               </sup> However, it must be questioned if such a concept is feasible in practice, as the use of the hazard variable “marketing status” can be misleading for the so-called “type B” trials: an existing authorization of a medicine for a completely divergent patient population must be considered differently than an authorization for an indication segment close-by the one under investigation (eg, treatment of the same patient population, but with varying precedent therapy). Accordingly, the risk assessment of a “type C” trial might be different when an extensive postmarketing experience is available from other markets for a medicine not yet authorized anywhere in the EU. Among the ICH regions, delays of 1 to 3 years for the authorization of drugs are common<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0092861512453574">39</xref>
               </sup>—an effect even accentuated for rare disease indications or for drugs where MAH are small companies.</p>
            <p>The above-described experiences with the medical devices regulation show that such an overall classification approach comprises perils: a 3-step risk classification requires a very clear and comprehensive definition of borderlines between the (risk) levels. Especially in the European context with its decentralized approval and supervision of clinical trials at member state level, implementing a harmonized system of classification rules will be demanding. An overall classification system may bear the risk of creating a rigid, lengthy and burdensome procedure of transposition across the EU, reducing hence the potential benefit of a risk-proportionate approach.</p>

            <p>A second option would need an agreement on quality management principles for the trial design and conduct process. In August 2011, the GCP Inspectors Working Group of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) released—in close cooperation with the Clinical Trials Facilitation Group (CTFG) representing Europe’s national competent authorities—a reflection paper devoted to that issue.<sup>

Obviously, the future framework for clinical drug research in Europe will induce the “quality by design” concept to clinical research. To some extent, this would align the clinical drug development process with the clinical development process of medical devices. Risk assessment, risk control, and risk communication processes are intrinsic elements of decisions how and to which extent medical device investigations should be conducted in order to generate additional clinical evidence prior to approval decisions.<sup>

By referring to one risk category of trials only, the complex issue on how to define borderlines among risk levels could be eased. Also, the need to provide risk-commensurate provisions for practical trial management issues when several risk-based categories of trial exist could be met more easily.</p>
            <p>In fact, such an a priori limitation to one well-described category of trials would result into the establishment of an “exemption.” Type A trials, associated per definition with “potential risks not higher than that of standard care” and interventional in their character, comprise therapeutic strategy trials as well as postmarketing trials aimed to define the best use of a medicine in medical practice. For such trials often performed by large academic cooperative groups, special facilities for their initiation and conduct could prove to be very beneficial and would indeed respond to the tremendous criticism expressed by this stakeholder group.<sup>

            <p>However, none of the legislators in these 3 countries have opted so far—albeit they belong to the GHTF and are familiar with the principles of risk-based classification as outlined for the medical devices sector—for an overall classification system for either the categorization of medicines itself or clinical drug trials. The US approach to introduce tailored regulatory exemptions in specified “areas of medical need” serves as a meaningful example how the shortcomings of the current EU legislation could be solved. The US exemptions are set exactly in those areas where the criticism of stakeholders in the EU was most intensive: emergency care research,<sup>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Intensive discussions among the EU institutions, the member states, and the stakeholders about the role and relevance of a risk-based regulation of clinical trials will take place in 2012 and onward. A common perception and definition of <italic>risk</italic> in clinical research across Europe is urgently needed.</p>
         <p>In terms of <italic>risk handling</italic> (ie, the assessment of risks and its communication), the EU legislator has to consider to what extent the implementation of quality management principles in the trial planning and conduct process can help to simplify trial reporting and oversight measures and finally reduce the overall administrative burden on clinical research. In this context, the need and appropriateness of a complex risk-based trial categorization system have to be weighed against potential benefits of a pragmatic system of defined exemptions aimed first to cope with current stakeholder expectations and second to overcome the well-known shortcomings of the EU Clinical Trials Directive.</p>
         <p>A broad agreement on principles and the adoption of pragmatic legal measures could be only good news for sponsors and investigators. It would facilitate patients’ access to medicinal products and would undoubtedly increase Europe’s competitiveness in clinical research.</p>
