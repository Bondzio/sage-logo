<abstract>
<p>This case study examines the journey of a pregnant, incarcerated woman and the advocacy efforts of helping professionals from a perinatal home visiting agency. The agency worked with the mother to help her understand her baby’s development, both prenatally and postpartum, and addressed many other parenting concerns, including guardianship rights. The agency found that it is rare for pregnant inmates to maintain custody of their infants in jail postpartum, despite certain legal rights that are afforded them. The agency worked with the inmate and her family to advocate for her right to mother her child.</p>

<body>
<p>The U.S. justice system seeks to make the consequences for criminal actions predictable by stipulating punishments for particular crimes. The term <italic>justice</italic> can lead one to believe that the penalties that are established are intended to be evenhanded and unbiased; however, many social service workers have come face to face with the limitations of this system. The case study presented here portrays how the staff at a perinatal home visiting agency (PHVA) came up against this reality as they assisted an incarcerated pregnant woman in navigating various legal, social, and medical systems that were fraught with prejudice and misinformation. Despite the barriers, the PHVA learned how tenacious, informed advocacy can offer hope to a marginalized population and may lead to more just outcomes for the families they serve in the future.</p>
<p>The PHVA’s mission is to provide free, voluntary services to support pregnant and parenting families. Through home visits with participants, family support workers from the PHVA support bonding, attachment, healthy development, and positive parent–child interactions and try to increase coping skills and self-sufficiency while decreasing stressors. Women in the prison system present a unique opportunity to provide services to those who have historically been disenfranchised and often have been victims of crime and poverty.</p>

<title>Jane</title>
<p>Jane (a pseudonym), a young Caucasian woman in her early 20s, was referred to the PHVA by a staff member at the local county jail in New York State. She had been arrested on nonviolent charges, namely, unarmed robbery of private residences to support her and her boyfriend’s heroin addiction. Jane was just 8 weeks into her pregnancy when she was arrested and incarcerated at the jail. She had not been receiving prenatal care and could not go through full withdrawal from the heroin because it would have had devastating effects on the fetus. She was put on methadone maintenance for the remainder of her pregnancy. At the time of enrollment, it was known to the PHVA that Jane had committed these crimes across two counties and would need to be sentenced in the months ahead within both jurisdictions. Her eventual sentence would amount to approximately 20 months in a state prison. Jane had no prior convictions and, as a first-time mother, had no previous involvement with Child Protective Services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0886109912475173">
<title>Introduction to Services</title>
<p>Although it was not the typical “home” visiting scenario, one of the family support workers met with Jane in the enclosed visiting room of the jail, biweekly for several months, helping her to bond with the child inside her womb. At the start of the relationship, the family support worker reported feelings of anxiety and nervousness working in the jail; however, after meeting with Jane, she easily became accustomed to the restrictive environment and conducted her visits with the same dedication she afforded her other participants. The family support worker engaged Jane in health education regarding infant development, both prenatally and postpartum, and addressed many other parenting concerns, including guardianship rights. Jane was interested in the information the family support worker provided regarding child development, infant care, and planning for labor. Jane enjoyed the visits and was appreciative of the family support worker’s continued support. At each visit, the family support worker identified and discussed the stressors that Jane faced not only as a pregnant woman, but as an inmate, and focused on normalizing and validating Jane’s feelings. Using a strengths-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886109912475173">Dunst, Trivette, &amp; Deal, 1994</xref>), the family support worker offered Jane praise and affirmations for her dedication to the health and well-being of her infant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886109912475173">
<title>A Mother’s Right</title>
<p>During her stay at the jail, Jane received her prenatal care at a local hospital. As a security measure, she was never informed of the date or time of her appointments, which made it difficult for her to prepare questions for the doctor or prepare herself emotionally for some of the more invasive prenatal examinations. At about 30 weeks, the family support worker began talking with Jane about her rights as an incarcerated mother. Jane was surprised to hear that she actually had the right to maintain custody of her child within the prison system for up to 18 months (New York State Corrections Law § 611<sup>1</sup>, 2009). No one at the jail, including the jail’s social worker, had ever notified Jane of this right. According to review of the law, and further clarification with the New York State Commission of Corrections, in addition to legal eligibility to maintain custody of the child, it is the facility’s responsibility to provide a crib, diapers, and whatever else the mother may need to care for her child appropriately. This is an important law in the sphere of women’s and children’s rights because it recognizes and supports how imperative early bonding and attachment are to a child’s long-term mental and emotional well-being.</p>
<p>When the family support worker informed Jane of the law, she immediately became excited at the prospect of keeping her baby. Yet, in a meeting with the jail’s social worker, the family support worker and her supervisor found the social worker to be severe and uncompassionate toward Jane’s situation. According to Jane, the social worker and some guards had pressured her to “give up” her baby, and she believed that prejudiced assumptions were being made about her capability to mother the child on the basis only of her recent criminal past. The jail’s social worker also informed the PHVA staff members that the prison where Jane was transferring would not accept the infant. It was at this time that the PHVA staff transitioned their role with Jane from an educational and supportive model to advocacy and case management.</p>
<p>A PHVA supervisor was able to clarify with the state prison that Jane would be transferred to that as long as an application was submitted, it would be possible for Jane to keep her baby with her despite the transfer. On the same day as the PHVA’s disconcerting meeting with the jail’s social worker, the staff was able to get a copy of the state prison’s nursery application and bring it to Jane to complete during visiting hours. The PHVA staff also contacted a law firm that is dedicated to protecting the civil and human rights of New York State residents for further legal guidance. This was the PHVA’s first incarcerated participant, and the staff were discovering their own deficiencies in relevant legal savvy, as well as quickly learning the ramifications of operating under misinformation and assumptions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886109912475173">
<title>Barriers and Birth</title>
<p>Near the 32nd week of Jane’s pregnancy, the PHVA staff learned that the baby was in a breech position and therefore would need to be delivered by a scheduled cesarean section. Since her due date was dangerously close to her sentencing date, there was a fear that because of the delivery, Jane would miss her sentencing. Jane’s public defender informed the PHVA staff that he would be unable to represent her in absentia and that if she did miss her sentencing because of hospitalization, it would likely be rescheduled for weeks later. The postponement of the sentencing would mean that the jail would need to house the infant until sentencing. A PHVA supervisor contacted the commissioner of the jail to speak with him directly about what the facility’s plan would be to accommodate Jane and her infant safely and followed up with a letter to him outlining what supplies would be mandatory for the facility to provide for the hospital to consider the release of the infant as a safe discharge.</p>
<p>It was also at this time that the PHVA encountered some stiff push back from the staff at the local hospital where Jane would be delivering her baby. The PHVA staff had been in touch with the hospital to ensure that its requirements for a safe discharge would be met by the jail. When the PHVA informed the hospital staff of Jane’s intent to breast-feed, they were met with a forbidding response. It seemed that the doctors were against Jane breast-feeding because she was on Methadone maintenance and threatened to report her to Child Protective Services as going against medical advice. The PHVA staff also noted the disdain with which hospital staff discussed Jane; there seemed to be a severe lack of empathy and a lot of prejudice toward her as both an inmate and an addict in recovery. The PHVA was quick to look up the professional research on breast-feeding safe substances and found that the American Pediatric Association listed Methadone as an approved substance for breast-feeding. Methadone is in the L3 lactation risk category, meaning it is “moderately safe,” or, rather, “controlled studies show only minimal non-threatening adverse effects” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886109912475173">Hale, 2008</xref>, pp. 534–536). The dose of methadone passed to the baby via the mother’s milk is 2.8% of the dosage taken by the mother and may assist in mitigating the effects of neonatal withdrawal symptom for babies who were exposed to Methadone in utero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886109912475173">Hale, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The PHVA was also able to get the backing of a pediatrician with a major nonprofit medical organization, who said that she would be willing to write letters, make telephone calls, and even testify on Jane’s behalf concerning the safety of breast-feeding while on Methadone. Amid all the chaos of rapid-fire e-mail messages and telephone calls, on a Friday afternoon just before 5:00 p.m., the PHVA staff learned from Jane’s stepmother that Jane had been transferred from the local county jail to another county jail—out of the county and the PHVA’s jurisdiction. No specific legal reason was given for the transfer.</p>
<p>Early Monday morning, the PHVA staff contacted the supervisors of another family support agency, the sister agency of the PHVA that was located in the county Jane had been transferred to. That agency agreed to take on the case and was able to make contact with Jane within a couple of weeks at the second county jail. Both programs continued to advocate on Jane’s behalf and press for updates from both the hospital and the jails. During this time, the staff learned that Jane would not be allowed to have any support from her family or friends during her labor; she would have to be entirely alone during the delivery surgery. After the birth, she would be allowed a 1-hr visit from the father, followed by a 1-hr visit from select family members. Reportedly, these rules have been put in place so that unwieldy inmates do not try to escape from incarceration while giving birth.</p>
<p>Advocates and legal experts were contacted regarding Jane’s case. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886109912475173">New York State Department of Health’s (2010)</xref> Breastfeeding Mother’s Bill of Rights, a mother has the right to breast-feed her baby within 1 hr after birth unless it would harm the health of the baby. This legal document goes on to specify that a mother can make her own choice about whether or not to breast-feed and that she has the right to breast-feed at anytime, anywhere. Lawyers were consulted as to whether this could be a legal strategy used to help Jane retain custody of her child; it was advised against because there was no prior case law to set a precedence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886109912475173">Norz (1989</xref>) noted that most prisoners lack the resources that are necessary to sue their incarcerating facilities, thus creating a deficiency in case law on which to base future petitions.</p>
<sec id="section5-0886109912475173">
<title>After Birth</title>
<p>Immediately following the baby’s birth, the baby was taken to the neonatal intensive care unit because of methadone withdrawal. Jane was returned to the second county jail and was denied hospital visits to her baby; she was allowed only one telephone call a day to the hospital caregivers of her baby. During this emotional and stressful time, Jane pumped breast milk in her cell, and each day her stepmother picked it up and brought it to the hospital to ensure that the bond between Jane and her child endured. Just 2 weeks later, during a telephone call to the state prison to check on transfer plans, the PHVA learned from the social worker at the state prison nursery that the facility’s physicians had decided to revoke Jane’s nursery application. According to that social worker, the baby was not considered a “well baby,” as defined by prison standards. “Well baby” criteria, as the state prison nursery defined it, was never made clear to the PHVA; all that was known was that the baby’s stay in the neonatal intensive care unit apparently precluded this designation. Even though the baby would likely become a well baby within 8 weeks, the discharge time line as predicted by the neonatology staff, the social worker at the state prison nursery stated that the facility’s policy would prevent the baby from being transferred to its nursery program. The PHVA and other agency staff members were shocked not only at the decision, but at the insensitivity with which the message was delivered.</p>
<p>Despite continuous setbacks, Jane and her family felt empowered. Upon learning the state facility’s decision, Jane and her stepmother drafted an appeal letter using some of the language suggested by legal counsel. During this time, the stepmother also petitioned for legal guardianship of the baby, just in case the child could not join Jane in the state facility. With the power of information, the family had been able to take advocacy efforts into their own hands. It was imperative that they move fast, since the state facility had a policy indicating that the infant must be transferred with the mother, not afterward, and as a well baby. The weeks spent away from her child were painful and discouraging, but in her dedication to her child, Jane continued pumping her milk every day.</p>
<p>The subsequent weeks brought a series of raised hopes and deep letdowns. Legal counsel had reached out to contacts at the state facility and found out there had been a “misunderstanding” between the PHVA and the social worker at the state prison nursery and that Jane’s application <italic>had </italic>been accepted and was still in good status. Just days after she received this news, Jane received an official prison document stating exactly the opposite. The rejection of the baby to the prison nursery was a final decision, and despite her appeal efforts, was unlikely to be changed. The argument against acceptance had shifted, however, from the well-baby stipulation (the baby was now ready for a healthy discharge in just days) to concerns about a pending transfer for sentencing in a neighboring state. As the social worker at the state prison nursery put it, the state prison would not “babysit” the infant while the mom dealt with legal matters at another facility. Jane’s baby was discharged from the hospital to Jane’s father and stepmother, who reside a full 2-hr drive from the state prison.</p>

<title>A Macroperspective</title>
<p>Jane’s situation mirrors a growing trend in the United States; in the past 25 years, the United States has seen a dramatic increase in the number of women who are incarcerated. Estimates range from a 400% to a 500% increase in the female prison population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886109912475173">Chambers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475173">Vainik, 2008</xref>), with drug charges cited as one of the most common charges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886109912475173">Amnesty International, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886109912475173">Schroeder &amp; Bell, 2005</xref>), just behind property felonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886109912475173">Weatherhead, 2003</xref>). Additional research has shown that incarcerated women are more likely to have suffered from family violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886109912475173">Hutchinson, Moore, Propper, &amp; Mariaskin, 2008</xref>) and/or sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475173">Geer, 2000</xref>) and are generally “economically disenfranchised, survivors of domestic violence, homeless or inadequately housed, suffering from physical and mental illness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886109912475173">Moses &amp; Potter, 2008</xref>, p. 89). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886109912475173">Bloom (1995</xref>) estimated that nearly 8–10% of women are pregnant upon incarceration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886109912475173">Knight and Plugge (2005</xref>) noted that an estimated 9% of pregnant inmates will actually give birth before their release from prison.</p>
<p>Qualitative research has shown that incarcerated pregnant mothers express exacerbated physical discomforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886109912475173">Siefert &amp; Pimlott, 2001</xref>), have fears and increased stress regarding their infants’ health, and have heightened concerns about the attachment between them and their infants after separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886109912475173">Hutchinson et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886109912475173">Chambers (2009</xref>) found that prenatal incarcerated mothers “perceived experiences of shared love and reciprocal communications” prior to separation and that the birth of the child was not the joyous entry of a new life into this world, but instead a devastating severance to the mothers as their infants were taken into either familial or social service custody. The psychological stability of incarcerated pregnant women is greatly affected by their environmental circumstances as well as the impending transition away from their maternal role. These factors can bring on anxiety, depression, frustration, and loneliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886109912475173">Chambers, 2009</xref>). These stressors to the psyche may harm the infant in utero because prepartum depression has been shown to pose just as many, if not more, risks than postpartum depression (Diego et al., 2004).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886109912475173">Hutchinson, Moore, Propper, and Mariaskin (2008</xref>) suggested that interventions for pregnant inmates should include support that is related to pregnancy-related stressors, planning for birth, and planning for motherhood because these foundations could improve inmates’ behavior and reduce obstetrical complications. Aligned with this supposition, the PHVA was well poised to affect change in Jane’s psyche and preparation for her role as a mother, in whatever capacity that might have been.</p>
<p>It was difficult for the PHVA to find clear policy guidelines to help frame efforts for Jane’s case. Across the United States, each state has to sew its own patchwork quilt of penological policy; there is no clear federal statute or guideline regarding the treatment of pregnant inmates, their prenatal care, or what transpires in regard to child custody postpartum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475173">Vainik, 2008</xref>; Women’s Prison Association, 2009). According to the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, “cruel and unusual punishments” cannot be inflicted on prison inmates; how this stipulation is interpreted by each state’s legislature is up for serious critical analysis. In 38 states, the use of restraints, including belly chains, leg irons, belts, and handcuffs, is permitted in the third trimester for a pregnant inmate during transport, labor, and delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886109912475173">Amnesty International, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475173">Vainik, 2008</xref>). The use of such restraints contravenes the U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886109912475173">Amnesty International, 2000</xref>). In New York State, only three counties reported to the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU, 2008), Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request that they maintained actual written policies regarding the use of restraints on pregnant inmates. Many counties reported that the use of restraints was left to the discretion of the correctional staff (NYCLU, 2008).</p>
<p>The NYCLU’s FOIL request revealed that more than half the counties in New York State have specific guidelines for prenatal care; some choose to contract this care out, while others allow mothers to continue their care at their community-based providers. With regard to labor and delivery, the State Commission of Corrections issued a memorandum stipulating that pregnant inmates be transported to a medical facility within a “reasonable time before the anticipated birth of the child” (NYCLU, 2008).</p>
<p>As was stated earlier, under New York State Corrections Law, § 611<sup>1</sup> (2009), a new mother can maintain custody of her child for up to 18 months, and the custodial facility is responsible for ensuring that an adequate, healthy, and safe space is provided to the mother and child, including provisions for diapers, bottles, bedding, and clothing. Yet, as the NYCLU (2008) FOIL found, most facilities do not actually allow the mother to retain custody by citing the best interests of the child. It is a decision made solely by the jail administrators, who are likely and understandably concerned with prospective costs, limited county funding, and inadequate space.</p>
<p>Going through labor as an inmate carries uniquely stressful conditions for mothers to be and makes it difficult to obtain critical emotional support. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886109912475173">Schroeder and Bell (2005</xref>) described women giving birth under the watchful eyes of security guards and “unfamiliar” providers without any family members or informal support present. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886109912475173">Moses and Potter (2008</xref>) reported on a doula intervention program within a county jail, which based its design on collected data demonstrating “slightly shorter labor time, greater cervical dilation, higher Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, lower rates of cesarean deliveries, greater maternal bonding, reduced medication for pain relief, decreased use of epidurals, and increased breast-feeding” (p. 89) with doula support at birth. A doula is a nonmedical birth support person who is fully dedicated to the emotional support, physical comfort, and advocacy efforts on behalf of the laboring woman. Using this evidence to inform the program design, the inmates, medical staff, and jail staff all communicated “high satisfaction … with the program overall.” While jail administrators see the birthing process as a security risk, and therefore bar family members from being present to support the mother, doula support at birth can increase positive birth outcomes without undermining the security objectives of the incarcerating institution.</p>
<p>The PHVA program is connected to a growing network of community doulas that are willing to do pro bono births with at-risk mothers. Perhaps, in future collaborations with the jail system, the PHVA program may connect an incarcerated pregnant woman to one of these doula supports for her birth. Jane unfortunately could not benefit from this PHVA service and ultimately delivered her child alone through cesarean section.</p>
<p>The circumstances surrounding Jane’s pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum relationship to her son put both of them at high risk for a myriad of possible future psychosocial issues. Removing a child from his or her mother immediately after birth deprives that child of the opportunity to become securely attached and bonded with the mother. Established evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886109912475173">Schore, 2001</xref>, pp. 13–14) documented the psychological benefits to the child of becoming securely attached and bonded with the mother. These benefits include the healthy development of an infant’s regulatory systems and the development of coping skills. Byrne’s (2008) study regarding the outcomes for mothers and infants who were involved in two different New York State prison nursery programs found that infants were within “normal ranges” for their developmental milestones. It was also noted that most of the mothers “maintained custody of the children after release [from prison], with … lower recidivism rates than similar women in the community” (quoted by Women’s Prison Association, 2009, p. 22).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0886109912475173">
<title>Beginnings, Endings, Beginnings</title>
<p>After Jane’s baby was transferred from the hospital into the custody of the grandparents, that family began the enduring process of raising an infant without the mother in the first years of life. Jane faced the end of her physical connection to her baby and began to find the inner strength necessary to see herself through to the end of her sentence. The PHVA closed her family’s case, but not before visiting the baby and grandparents in the hospital at discharge. Despite the anticlimactic and painful outcome of everyone’s efforts, the family was appreciative that they had at least been given a fighting chance.</p>
<p>Over the course of her journey, Jane was at the mercy of prison officials, social workers, nurses, and doctors who all held power over the fate of her and her child—individuals who could wield this power at their own discretion because of the paucity of specific legal guidelines, state, or federal. Jane was the target of personal bias toward what constitutes privilege in parenting, deserving motherhood, and the reasonable and humane treatment of pregnant inmates. At every juncture, someone in power seemingly made a decision on the basis of little policy, evidence, or research.</p>
<p>The staff at the PHVA has since established more cooperative and collaborating relationships with the staff of the local county jail to make certain that future pregnant inmates receive the support they and their babies deserve. In fact, the agency recently collaborated with the local county jail to ensure that another pregnant inmate would be transferred to a rehabilitative group home for the length of her pregnancy, where she will stay for the duration of her sentence together with her baby. The agency is also assisting in facilitating fathers’ groups in the male section of the facility.</p>
<p>Regardless of an individual’s sentence, when an incarcerated woman is pregnant, it is a <italic>family </italic>that the prison is now responsible for. Home visiting programs can offer support and education to inmates and prison staff and can work to develop supportive relationships to bring about the best birth and parenting outcomes possible for each family. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886109912475173">Hutchinson et al. (2008</xref>, p. 441) noted that according to the World Health Organization, “social support during pregnancy and childbirth [is] one of the most important beneficial care practices.” Home visiting programs are uniquely poised to play significant roles in the lives of pregnant incarcerated women in their communities as long as open, honest dialogue and accurate information can flow freely among prison facilities, helping professionals, and the families who are served.</p>
