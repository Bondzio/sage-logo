<abstract>
<p>This paper critically evaluates the popular representation of rural decision making in India as guided by socio-cultural dynamics and as a resort from various social alignments. It investigates how decisions get taken about a decentralized governance scheme in rural India, what variables impact these decisions – namely, social, political, administrative or economic – and how these variables impact the scheme performance. Case studies and empirical analysis of performance of a decentralized welfare scheme in India, the Andhra Pradesh Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (APREGS), demonstrates significant influence of agriculture-based economic dynamics and administrative efficiency factors. Local social hierarchies and cultural complexities do not come as the main concerns. These results challenge the traditional understanding of rural dynamics as totally controlled by caste hierarchies and authority of the large land owners and are discussed in the light of the institutional rational choice framework proposed by Elinor Ostrom. The results also call for a fresh and wider debate of whether India is witnessing a longer term indirect developmental outcome of empowerment which actively started in 1993 with the recognition of local governance systems (Panchayati Raj) as a formal democratic body.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Decentralized governance leads to functional and financial devolution of authority, induces more transparency in the system and emphasizes local needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611417571">Bardhan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611417571">Bird and Vaillancourt, 1998</xref>). It creates a platform to voice and institutionalize the interests of various groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611417571">Crook and Manor, 1998</xref>) and brings administration nearer to the public by making all tiers of government accountable directly to the people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611417571">Bardhan and Mookherjee, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>However, several complexities govern this effort in India. First, implementation of decentralized systems by involving several official agencies create administrative gaps that lead to lack of coordination and fiscal complexities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611417571">Dasgupta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611417571">Ghatak and Ghatak, 2002</xref>). Second, Indian society is largely agrarian and rural, marked by divisions of class, religion, caste and politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611417571">Deaton and Drèze, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611417571">Drèze and Sen, 1997</xref>). These divisions traditionally form the basis of complex categorization used by rural societies and are building blocks of local political organization that exert significant influence on administrative outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611417571">Brass, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021909611417571">Manor, 1999</xref>). Therefore, decentralized governance can simply empower local elites and worsen the inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611417571">Blair, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909611417571">Crook and Sverrisson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611417571">Drèze and Sen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021909611417571">Manor, 1999</xref>). Moreover, the underprivileged and poor are often trapped in interlocking economic transactions with affluent landlords making it difficult for collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021909611417571">Gaiha, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0021909611417571">Vincentnathan and Vincentnathan, 2008</xref>). The lack of collective action (combined with lack of awareness) among the socio-economically underprivileged perpetuates weak societal accountability mechanisms and ensures maintenance of the status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611417571">Betille, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611417571">Gaiha et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0021909611417571">Vincentnathan and Vincentnathan, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In this paper, we critically evaluate these complex social and administrative dynamics by studying the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGREGS) in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh (AP). This scheme enforces decentralized decision making and demand-driven policy implementation and responsive administrative structures that unveil these social and administrative dynamics during implementation. MGREGS, by encouraging public disclosure of information and implementing downward accountability systems like public scrutiny, provides democratic rights and platforms for the underprivileged to ‘voice’ their interests through Gram sabhas. Hence, the implementation dynamics of MGREGS can provide a ‘reflection’ of the decentralization policy implementation dynamics in India.</p>
<p>Specifically, the paper investigates how decisions are taken in rural India about a decentralized governance scheme; what variables impact these decisions – namely, social, political, administrative or economic; and how these variables impact the scheme performance. This is done through case studies of two regions and empirical analysis of performance of a decentralized welfare scheme in India, the Andhra Pradesh Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (APREGS). <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0021909611417571">Appendix 1</xref> provides the details of the APREGS scheme. The results are interpreted under the lens of institutional rational choice framework proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0021909611417571">Ostrom (1999)</xref>. The adaptation of this framework enables us to understand the diversity of results that emerge from the analysis. Our study demonstrates that the institutional rational choice framework, though proposed to explain the common resource pool dynamics, also finds its relevance in explaining the rural decision dynamics. This framework highlights how decisions are a result of larger institutional-level rationality. While individually decisions may seem contradictory to each other, however, as an institutional choice they are rational and gel together as common working rules.</p>
<p>The paper is organized as follows: we initially review specific studies on the rural employment guarantee scheme and put forth our research questions, followed by a review of studies that debate and explain rural decentralization complexities. Next, the methodology and findings are described from the case study. After which, evidence of the case study findings is put forth through the empirical analysis. The concluding sections discuss the results and deliberate on the larger implications underlining decision-making process at the village level.</p>

<title>Implementation of the Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme</title>
<p>The Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGREGS) or APREGS in Andhra Pradesh (AP) is a decentralized conditional cash transfer scheme that provides a legal guarantee of 100 days of waged employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work at the minimum wage rate notified for agricultural labour prescribed in the state or else an unemployment allowance. The main objective of the scheme is to supplement wage employment opportunities in rural areas and, in the process, also build up durable rural assets and infrastructure. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0021909611417571">Appendix 1</xref> details the scheme.</p>
<p>Initial implementation of the MGREGS suffered from top–down implementation, delayed wage distribution, and poor work record maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611417571">Aiyer and Samji, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909611417571">Administrative Reforms Commission-II [ARC-II], 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611417571">Das and Pradhan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021909611417571">Karuna and Sowmya, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0021909611417571">Murgai and Ravallion, 2005</xref>). The exceptions were the states of Kerala, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra. The efficient implementation of the scheme in these states is attributed to high literacy and the positive role of Panchayats in Kerala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021909611417571">Jacob and Varghese, 2006</xref>), high awareness and voluntary collective action in Rajasthan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021909611417571">Bhatty, 2006</xref>), and public mobilization by all political parties in Maharashtra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611417571">Bagchee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021909611417571">Jadav, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021909611417571">Joseph, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0021909611417571">Savale, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies exploring implementation efficiency highlight the importance of vertical and horizontal administrative cooperation, conduction of regular elections and delinking politics with the scheme implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611417571">Chakrobarty, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611417571">Gopal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0021909611417571">Vaidyanathan, 2005</xref>). Conversely, in the state of Maharashtra, the scheme efficiency is attributed to political mobilization as it increased awareness and ensured good quality infrastructure development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611417571">Bagchee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021909611417571">Jadav, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021909611417571">Joseph, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0021909611417571">Savale, 2006</xref>). The importance of awareness is also highlighted by several other studies as it leads to citizen empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021909611417571">Hirway, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0021909611417571">Mukhopadhyaya and Rajaraman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0021909611417571">Srivastava et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>These studies reveal the significance of administrative efficiency and citizen mobilization/awareness. However, investigations of the ‘process’ and its impact on scheme administration and performance remain unexplored. Consequently, in this paper we investigate the following research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0021909611417571" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What is the nature of decisions made by rural populations about a decentralized governance scheme?</p></list-item>

</list>
<p>Before exploring these questions, we look at the literature addressing the issues and debates relating to the decentralization process and the related governance issues.</p>

<title>Decentralization Dynamics: Debates and Explanation</title>
<p>Decentralized governance in India, debated since the 1950s, was actively implemented in 1993 when the 73rd amendment recognized the village assembly as a formal democratic body. This constitutional change intended to empower the socially vulnerable and the poor by giving them political space to take part in governance-related decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021909611417571">Crook, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611417571">Drèze and Sen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909611417571">Johnson and Start, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0021909611417571">Vincentnathan and Vincentnathan, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies on the social and economic outcome of decentralization, however, find a weak correlation between democratic decentralization and poverty reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909611417571">Crook and Sverrisson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611417571">Golooba-Mutebi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021909611417571">Moore and Putzel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0021909611417571">Rahman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0021909611417571">World Bank, 2000a</xref>). The democratizing capacity of these institutions is severely hampered in instances where the elected representatives and elected bodies are fractured by pre-existing structures of caste, gender, and/or class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611417571">DeSouza, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0021909611417571">Narayana, 2005</xref>). However, where the government is able to maintain distance/autonomy from powerful social actors (such as large farm owners, industrialists, and politicians), the effectiveness of decentralized governance increases. This autonomy positively influences higher participation of the poor and vulnerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611417571">Blair, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611417571">Crook and Manor, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611417571">Faguet, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021909611417571">Heller et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021909611417571">Lieberman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021909611417571">Manor, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies on the dynamics highlight limited benefits accrued by the poor and the socially disadvantaged due to the presence of the powerful local elite through the process of ‘elite capture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611417571">Echeverri-Gent, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909611417571">Grossman and Helpman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0021909611417571">Tendler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0021909611417571">Vincentnathan and Vincentnathan, 2008</xref>). So can the negative impacts of the elite capture/control be nullified? Rising educational levels, intensified political competition, availability of other job opportunities, technological support in agriculture, and group mobilization were seen to counter elite capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611417571">Dasgupta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611417571">Harris, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021909611417571">Henisz, 2004</xref>). However, the most significant counter to elite capture is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611417571">Echeverri-Gent, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0021909611417571">Mukarji, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0021909611417571">Vyasulu and Vyasulu, 1999</xref>)</p>
<list id="list2-0021909611417571" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The state government, when it creates relevant institutions and structures like public participation forums, awareness campaigns and affirmative action schemes, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The local government, when its officials implement these schemes.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>However, the power struggle between the two – namely, the government and the local elite – still remains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909611417571">Crook and Sverrisson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0021909611417571">Mosse, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0021909611417571">Von-Braun et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Investigations on the responsiveness of bureaucracy and government institutions, therefore, become very significant. Literature on administrative responsiveness looks at the ability of decentralized systems to facilitate the ‘voice’ of the vulnerable; that is, long term empowerment, both psychological and material. These studies either focus on the kind of functions and resources devolved to the local level and the number of people participate, or evaluate the scope of participation as an indirect measure of responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611417571">Crook and Manor, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021909611417571">Marsden, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021909611417571">Marsden and Oakley, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021909611417571">Meenakshisundaram, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0021909611417571">Moris, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0021909611417571">Tendler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0021909611417571">Tendler and Freedheim, 1994</xref>). The focus is not so much on the ability of the institutions (the ‘decentralized system’) to impact the decision making of the vulnerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611417571">Crook and Manor, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0021909611417571">Webster, 1990</xref>). The most common argument being that decentralization, by definition, leads people to be more informed that can make the system more responsive (Crooks and Manor, 1998). However, studies show that direct participation though public meetings or similar channels neither ensure empowerment nor necessarily facilitate further ‘democratic’ processes to be followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021909611417571">Evans, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0021909611417571">Rigg, 1991</xref>). Hence, a need for further investigation into the dynamics of rural empowerment and participation in decentralized decision making is desirable.</p>
<p>Until now studies on rural dynamics have typically investigated the social and political complexities governing rural societies, their magnitude and how they impact across spaces and social groups (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611417571">Bhatt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021909611417571">Drèze, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611417571">Drèze and Sen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611417571">Gough, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0021909611417571">Shiva, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0021909611417571">World Bank, 2000b</xref>). Rural societies are largely viewed as socially hierarchical and uni- directionally dictated by caste and elite dominations. Rural relations, therefore, are believed to be largely exploitative (versus negotiated). Hence, the dominant investigative response has been to highlight these complexities and explore ways to eliminate this exploitation in order to have a more equitable and just society. Few studies have investigated how this impacts governance in a scheme which is meant to empower economically-marginalized populations and which factors significantly impact their decision making with reference to government efforts at their empowerment.</p>
<p>This paper reports a study of rural decision-making dynamics which clearly reflected negotiated social arrangements. Using a two-step methodology of case study and statistical analysis, we sought explanations on the relationship between economic opportunity (APREGS scheme) and local social dynamics. Four types of processes – namely, political, social, agri-economic, and administrative – were investigated.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>To investigate the dynamics of rural decision making, a two-fold methodology is used; namely, an interview-based field study for in-depth understanding of the dynamics, followed by statistical analysis of scheme performance to confirm the issues observed during the field study.</p>
<p>For the case study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with four groups of actors; namely, government officials who were implementing the scheme, political party representatives, the scheme beneficiaries – that is, the labourers and marginal and small farmers – and large farmers (as they are significant stakeholders of the village dynamics). Field interviews includes questions on implementation (administration, regulations, transparency, decision-making accountability, allocation and distribution of funds); stakeholders dynamics (stakes of various stakeholders, stakeholder interests and inter-relationships, political dynamics); and overall potential and success of the programme (outputs, outcomes, possible changes to the existing institutions to improve the accountability, transparency and efficiency of the programme).</p>
<p>For the statistical analysis, data were collected from various secondary sources to understand the impact of various variables on the scheme performance (measured as man-days of work provided). The dependent variable is average number of man-days of work provided under APREGS in a month and the independent variables are the different social, economic, administrative, and political variables. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021909611417571">Table 1</xref> gives the indicators and their variables.</p>

<p>The interviews were carried out in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh over a period of two months, taking 12 villages from two districts; that is, Mahabubnagar and Kurnool. The district of Mahabubnagar is an agriculture-intensive area (the main occupation is farming on personal land: 41% of the total work force is cultivators, out of which 74% are marginal and small farmers) and one of the most under developed Indian states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0021909611417571">Planning commission, 2003</xref>). The district of Kurnool is a labour intensive area (68% of workforce engaged in agriculture is labourers and also 68% of the cultivators opt for manual labour as they are small and marginal farmers) and one of the best performers of APREGS. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021909611417571">Table 2</xref> details the district wise demographics.</p>

<p>A total of 10 elected representatives of various villages, 18 medium and large farmers, six civil society organizations, 16 government officials involved with MGREGA implementation (at different tiers of governance) and 110 scheme beneficiaries (landless labours, marginal farmers and small farmers) were interviewed.</p>
<p>For performance analysis based on secondary data, all 22 districts of the state of Andhra Pradesh are considered. Data collected is in the time range of July 2007–May 2008 (a total of 14 months). Therefore, the total number of data points is 308 (14 × 22). For specific data on different regions (labour and agriculture intensive) 52 sub-district regions in Kurnool and 64 sub-district regions in Mahabubnagar are taken. Therefore, the sample size is 728 (14 × 52) and 896 (14 × 64) respectively.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Multilevel non-nested regression, with stepwise forward method, is adopted to explore the impact of variables on scheme performance. This methodology allows feature selection based on the criterion of <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> improvement and, in general, better handles multi-collinearity issues. Multi-collinearity is controlled using the Variance Inflated Factor (VIF) method. Dubin-Watson statistics for the models are around 2.0, representing no statistical evidence of auto-correlation in the data.</p>

<title>Case Studies: Salient Observations</title>
<p>The field interviews highlight the importance of politico-economic dynamics evolved due to the devolution of political power, main occupation of population (agriculture or labour), and collectivism versus fragmentation of population. First, the structure of the scheme itself encourages devolution of power; for instance, through the use of computerized systems and distribution of wages through post offices. By creating rural infrastructure, the scheme is also seen as a challenge to political patronage. Second, members of different political parties elected to different levels of the government hierarchy provide checks and balances in the implementation of the scheme. However, this is seen to work best where the targeted beneficiaries are politically empowered and united (as seen in sub-districts of Narva and Atmakur). Third, the tendency of the field assistant to favour certain groups or yield to the preferences of large farmers is also reduced in places where the beneficiaries are either organized (some of the villages of Allagadda sub-district like R. Krishnapuram and Marripalle) or have alternative job opportunities (villages like Kankanvanipalle of Atmakur sub-district, and Mutyalapadu of Chagalamarri sub-district). Fourth, significant differences can be observed between a labour-intensive economy, like Kurnool district, and an agriculture-intensive economy, like Mahabubnagar district.</p>
<p>In Kurnool, landless labourers, who constitute more than 50% of the worker population, work in groups and yield strong bargaining capacity. The average agricultural wage rate is almost equal to or more than the APREGS wage rate. However, APREGS work halts in these villages during the peak demand time for agriculture labour, with an implicit understanding between the farmers and the labourers to continue their long term relationships. In return, the local agricultural wage rates are observed to be slightly higher. The villages of Kurnool are among the best performers of APREGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611417571">MGREGS, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>APREGS work also halts during agriculture season in Mahabubnagar, which has a significantly large proportion of marginal and small farmer population, as farmers work in their own farms. During this season, the small and marginal farmers also work for large farmers, who are politically strong and organized, on a wage rate (approx. INR 40–50) substantially lower than the APREGS rate (approx. INR 70–90). In turn the large farmers support APREGS during the non-agriculture season. The villages of Mahabubnagar are one of the better APREGS performers during the non agriculture season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611417571">MGREGS, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>These field study observations highlight the presence of agriculture-based economic and negotiated political factors, as significantly influencing APREGS decision making and, in some sense, rural dynamics. The observations do not place any of the social and cultural variables in significant focus.</p>
<p>The typical depiction of rural decision making reflects significant importance of social hierarchies (of caste, class and gender) and elite dominations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611417571">Bhatt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021909611417571">Drèze, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611417571">Drèze and Sen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611417571">Gough, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0021909611417571">Shiva, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0021909611417571">World Bank, 2000b</xref>). These pre-existing structures are also seen to severely hamper the democratizing capacity of decentralized institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0021909611417571">Narayana, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611417571">DeSouza, 2000</xref>). The field study results, however, do not completely confirm this depiction of rural decision making. People are seen to balance the local and their agricultural needs, with the benefits of APREGS, keeping the traditional patron–client relationship intact. Hence what emerge are not so much social hierarchies but ‘social relations’ or ‘social arrangements’ as impacting rural group decisions.</p>

<p>Significant influence of un-irrigated land owners from privileged backgrounds (upper caste) and large farmers reflects the importance of social hierarchies. The upper caste groups, who need economic support, have the highest positive impact on performance. Presence of large farmers has a negative impact on performance, reflecting elite capture. Studies on the dynamics of participation highlight the significant influence of the powerful local elite or ‘elite capture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611417571">Echeverri-Gent, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909611417571">Grossman and Helpman 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0021909611417571">Tendler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0021909611417571">Vincentnathan and Vincentnathan, 2008</xref>). Our overall result highlights the same, but the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> is low.</p>
<p>The second set of significant variables are the administrative variables; that is, lesser wage delays (−0.201) and local wage rate (0.167). Negative influence of lower delays in wage payment may indicate the existence of strong local elite, when observed in the presence of negative influence of large farmers. Recent studies like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611417571">Blair (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611417571">Crook and Manor (1998)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611417571">Drèze and Sen (1996)</xref> highlight the positive impact of bureaucracy and government responsiveness on institutions and our results reflect the same.</p>
<p>However, season-wise regression highlights slightly different dynamics. Regression for scheme performance during agriculture months gives a high adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value of 0.887. The variables with the strongest positive influence are the marginal farmers who typically work on other farms during agriculture season, namely, un-irrigated marginal land owners (Agri-TUMa), socially-underprivileged marginal land owners (Agri-CMa), and socially-underprivileged irrigated marginal land owners (Agri-TIMa). This reflects availability of labour as a significantly-impacting factor of scheme performance during agriculture months. Along with this, results also demonstrate the presence of large farmers as negatively impacting performance. These results are illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021909611417571">Table 3</xref> (section 3.2). We argue that these two results together could reflect the negotiated dynamics that were observed in the agriculture intensive region of Mahabubnagar during the field interviews. During agriculture months landless and marginal farmers work as labour for large land owners on lower wages with the understanding of support from the large land owners during non-agriculture season, for efficient working of the scheme. Hence availability of labour would become a concern for APREGS during these months.</p>
<p>This argument is further strengthened by the results for the non-agriculture season. The results show inclusion of only the socially-underprivileged marginal land owners (Agri-CUMa, 0.537). This indicates the pure economic behaviour of supply–demand management of the labour market, for APREGS, during non-agriculture season. This is also supported by the non-inclusion of any agricultural variables like the negative effect of large farmers, as in the case during agricultural season. This can be a reflection of the fact of a smooth APREGS labour market functioning during non-agricultural season.</p>

<p>Regression results for the labour intensive region of Kurnool reflect an adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value of 0.435. The main variables impacting performance are lesser delays in payment of wages (lesser delay in wages – D) and expenditure by the government (expenditure – E). In Kurnool, landless labourers constitute more than 50% of the worker population and yield strong bargaining capacity. Field study has reflected that their bargained average agricultural wage rate is almost equal to or more than the APREGS wage rate. This collectivism and bargaining power is reflected in the significant presence of government efficiency variables of wages and expenditure, more than any social or agriculture variable.</p>
<p>However, results also demonstrate the adverse affect of the trend (progressive months – M) on scheme performance. This can be interpreted as an indication of increase in local wage rates due to bargaining capacity of labourers. This reflects the bargained equilibrium of client–patron relationship in the village.</p>
<p>Regression results for the agriculture intensive region of Mahabubnagar reflect an adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value of 0.247. The main variables impacting performance are presence of marginal farmers (Agri-TUMa and Agri-TIMa) and expenditure by the government (expenditure – E). In Mahabubnagar, which has a significant marginal or small farmer population, scheme performance is seen to be positively influenced by increasing expenditure by the government as marginal farmers join the workforce of APREGS. The villages of Mahabubnagar are one of the better APREGS performers during the non-agriculture season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611417571">MGREGS, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>These regression results also indicate the negotiated or bargained arrangements in the villages regarding APREGS, as seen in the field study observations. Another set of significant variables in the regressions were the administrative variables of wage delay, expenditure by the government and payment of wages. Literature reflects decentralized governance leading to people getting more knowledgeable in the long run, and thus the system getting more responsive to the people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611417571">Crooks and Manor, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0021909611417571">Tendler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0021909611417571">Tendler and Freedheim, 1994</xref>). The significance of administrative variables in the success of the scheme could be a reflection of this empowerment, both psychological and material, felt by the beneficiaries of the scheme (landless labour, and marginal and small farmers).</p>

<title>Discussion: Institutional Rational Choice</title>
<p>In this paper we investigated how decisions are taken about a decentralized governance scheme in rural India; what variables impact these decisions – namely, social, political, administrative or economic – and in turn impact the scheme performance?</p>
<p>The results of the study throw fresh explanations for these research questions. Results demonstrate significant influence of agriculture-based economic dynamics and administrative efficiency factors. What could account for these new explanations? Is there an explanation that could take in both the literature explanations and the study results together to draw a reliable and contemporary scenario of rural decision making?</p>
<p>We found research, albeit limited, which demonstrates similar explanations where administrative and economic premises are seen to contradict normative explanations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021909611417571">Holden, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611417571">Kaufman, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021909611417571">Lloyd and Seidman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611417571">Moe, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0021909611417571">Schwartz, 1982</xref>). Searching for explanations leads to an understanding that analyzing both results individually neglects the politics of institutional choice; that is, decision making through one set of rules that is part of a system also depends on which other rules are in effect. This configural nature of decision making drives larger group choices. Called ‘institutional’ rules, they refer to shared concepts organized by norms and strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611417571">Crawford and Ostrom, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021909611417571">Kiser and Ostrom, 1982</xref>). Analyzing decisions under institutional rules, the concept of rules-in-use is stressed rather than rules-in-form. Depending on the active status of shared beliefs and understandings, the rules-in-use are identified and decisions taken accordingly.</p>
<p>These institutional choice rules can be observed from the results of the field visit as well as the performance analysis. For example, APREGS work halts during peak agriculture season with the implicit understanding between large farmers and the labourers about large farmers’ support to continue APREGS work during non-agriculture months. Therefore, while the decision by labourers to stop APREGS during agriculture season is in line with normative considerations, it is not standing in isolation from other decisions and choices.</p>
<p>The institutional rational choice framework by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0021909611417571">Ostrom (1999)</xref> explains this more comprehensively. It explains how group decisions are taken. Given a situation, three types of decisions are made – namely, at the operational level – where actors interact in light of the incentives they face to generate outcomes directly in the world (action arena); at the policy (or collective-choice) level, where they repeatedly have to make policy decisions within the constraints of a set of institutional choice rules (broad evaluating criteria); at the institutional level, where evaluating criteria for actions are defined.</p>
<p>As seen in the APREGS scenario, three levels of decisions are taken. At the operational level, participants interact at the day-to-day level, where administration of the scheme (in terms of expenditure and payment delays) became important. At the policy (or collective-choice) level, it is decided to halt APREGS work during agriculture season and the patron–client relationship is maintained. This collective policy decision did affect the APREGS arena where beneficiaries were making operational decisions, and thus impacted directly on their economic status as well as scheme performance. However, at the third level, these decisions led to normative and economic equilibrium. This decision is also within the set of institutional choice rules (broad evaluating criteria) that honoured the importance of agriculture in their lives.</p>
<p>In this we see an explanation for the contradictions found in the results. The multi-layer, multi-arena decision-making framework clarifies two issues: (1) it gives an understanding of how agriculture dynamics and APREGS dynamics exist together, with their own rules and objectives, apparently contradictory, but leading to social and economic equilibrium; and (2) rural decisions are institutional rational choices. Moreover, it also leads to the realization how typically decisions are more open and less-constrained situations than traditionally understood and can predict pattern of outcomes such as economic efficiency, accountability, conformance to general morality, or in the case of APREGS, re-distributional equity and social efficiency.</p>
<p>The framework further illustrates two more decision-making features:</p>
<list id="list3-0021909611417571" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Social reality is composed of multiple arenas or action areas, linked sequentially or simultaneously; that is, the arenas are nested. Therefore, understanding of social dynamics comes from examining how the multiple arenas are nested within each other and how they interact to influence group decision making.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The actor (an individual or a collective) is seen to make assumptions about resources, situation, value assigned to the resources and the situation, use of knowledge and information. These assumptions lead to the rules used to define relationships, understand attributes of the world, and attributes of the community within which the decision occurs. And these rules in turn act on the selection of a particular course of action through the social space where individuals interact. Participants are motivated to select particular strategies or chains of actions that jointly lead to stable equilibriums.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In the results we see that the APREGS beneficiaries (actors in the system) make assumptions or evaluations of the resources and the situations. These assumptions then act on the selection of a particular course of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611417571">Crawford and Ostrom, 1995</xref>). However, because states of the world are in constant transformation, assumptions are also in constant change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021909611417571">Kiser and Ostrom, 1982</xref>). When these assumptions change, they change the decision-making context for the actor or actors.</p>
<p>These results also compel us to debate if we are witnessing a change in the way rural populations assign attribute to the states of the world and take decisions. Has there been a change from decisions guided purely by social dynamics to a more empowered society? Significance of administrative variables in the results, and the strategies negotiated by the scheme beneficiaries about work during agriculture and non-agriculture season, force a hard look towards the current nature of implicit assumptions and rules followed by people in the rural areas of India.</p>
<p>Social and economic disparities were extremely high until the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909611417571">Kundu et al., 1999</xref>). Governance in the rural areas derived principally from the character and power bases of the ruling elite and their relationship with the local elite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611417571">Crook and Manor, 1998</xref>). Caste hierarchies, authority of the elders and landed class defined the structures of control and their decisions had passive acceptance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0021909611417571">Vincentnathan and Vincentnathan, 2008</xref>). However, 15 years back, the government and para-statal institutions started taking several significant steps to meet the disparity in favour of economically-vulnerable regions, socially vulnerable communities and the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611417571">Gass and Biggs, 1993</xref>). Institutions of local self governance like Panchayat Raj, and democratic decentralized employment schemes like Jawahar Rozgar Yojna, were concentrated initiatives in this direction. There is a possibility of these results reflecting the change that these programmes intended; that is, empowerment, both, psychological and material.</p>
<p>Decentralization, which is meant to promote equality and facilitate all classes of people to ‘voice’, is challenging the traditional social structure of control that emphasizes submission to caste hierarchy, authority of the landed class and passive acceptance of decisions taken by them. The fact of social variables like caste not being as significant and the fact of agriculture labour actively negotiating with the large land owners to ensure economic benefit for them from the APREGS does reflect the breaking of caste and traditional authority barriers.</p>
<p>Democratic initiatives, in the long run, do break through the barriers of participation and expression of opinion by the disadvantaged towards a more inclusive growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021909611417571">Kilby, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0021909611417571">Vincentnathan and Vincentnathan, 2008</xref>). The results could be reflecting this longer term indirect developmental outcome which follows democratic initiatives. Particular configuration of globalization and empowerment initiatives seems to have produced new kinds of decentralization scenarios. The democratic local initiatives, apparently seen as small incremental initiatives, may not have substantially raised the income levels of the local poor populations, but the benefits are seen to lie in the sense of social empowerment which accompanies successful collection action around the APREGS initiative.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The findings of the study on Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme demonstrate two larger understandings of the factors influencing decision making in rural India: (1) actors are seen to take rational decisions based on local socio-politico-economic understandings of their world. These decisions are, however, at multiple levels and at multiple action spaces. Hence, often at first glance, they seem contradictory; (2) these decisions are dynamic. The changing world scenario influences these decisions and, with time, one can see larger impacts of these changes. The results of the study could reflect empowerment which has taken stronger roots in rural India, over time, led by governmental efforts and the globalizing world.</p>
<p>In this context, the way forward in social policy points to approaches more routed with the strategic changes in rural Indian society. These see a focus on a more broad-based control of developmental programmes and general acceptance of cyclicity of events as being part of development programmes. This poses some challenges to the old order of thinking which governs welfare scheme implementation but is a need of the hour.</p>

<title>National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme – Provisions and Practice<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021909611417571">1</xref></sup></title>
<p>The basic objective of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGREGA) is to enhance livelihood security in rural areas by providing <italic>at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year</italic> to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909611417571">Government of India [GoI], (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611417571">Government of Andhra Pradesh [GoAP], 2006</xref>). This work guarantee also serves other objectives: namely, generating productive assets, protecting the environment, empowering rural women, reducing rural-urban migration and fostering social equity, among others.</p>
<p>The main implementation activities are at the village and block levels, while coordination activities are mainly at the block and district levels. Planning, supervision and monitoring take place at all levels (village, block, district and state). At each level, the concerned authorities are accountable to the community. The Panchayats at each level will be the ‘Principal Authorities for planning and implementation of the Schemes under the Act’ (MGREGA, Section 13[1]). The Panchayats at different levels will need to coordinate with each other for the effective implementation of the act. Similarly, the Panchayats and the district/block administration will have to work together. The overall responsibility for ensuring that the scheme is implemented according to the act belongs to the District Programme Coordinator (DPC) at the district level, and to the Programme Officer (PO) at the block level.</p>
<p>The registration of household needs to be done and should get job cards. After getting job cards, concerned people need to apply for works. Application for the work may be either written or oral. Receipt needs to be given as soon as the application for the work is given. After the application for work, the work should be given within 15 days of application or at the date specified in the application, whichever is later. If not possible to provide, unemployment allowance will be guaranteed. Unemployment allowance will be specified as a percentage of REGS wage rate. The wage rate under the scheme will be decided based on the minimum wages specified for the agriculture as decided by the ministry of labour. The responsibility of providing the job is of Gram Panchayat and the programming officer. If Gram Panchayat cannot provide a job within 15 days of the date of application or the specified date in the application, whichever is later, it is the responsibility of PO to provide a job within 15 days.</p>
<p>REGS is mainly funded by the centre and shared by the state. The cost of wages and material will be financed by the centre whereas the unemployment allowances should be paid from the state government’s budget. The share of centre is 75% and the remaining amount needs to be deposited in the state council’s account by the state government as soon as the money is deposited by the centre. Funds to the next level will be released if and only if at least 60% of the previously-distributed funds are utilized and proper utilization certificate is produced from the technical committee.</p>
<p>The Gram Sabha will monitor all the works at the village level as well as the employment provided to each person who has applied for work. It will also monitor the registration and issue of job cards and the timely payment of wages. The Gram Panchayat will monitor works executed by other implementing agencies, muster rolls maintained by them at worksites, and the payments made. Social audits should be conducted to monitor the entire process over time.</p>
