<body>
<p>For Jonathan Lear, trained in two dialogical fields, philosophy and psychoanalysis, <italic>The Case for Irony</italic> is another expression of his long-standing commitment to understanding the relationship between the two. Exploring that relationship goes back to the early years of psychoanalysis—the minutes of the Vienna Society record several philosophers participating in those meetings—and Lear has a number of predecessors and colleagues in this enterprise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0003065113475665">1</xref></sup> His own labors span now some twenty years of publications. Among the themes running through much of his work are two that are most salient in this book: one is the question of transformation: How do philosophy and psychoanalysis each aspire to bring about profound change in mind and heart, including transformations in the social and political sphere? The second is how psychoanalysis and contemporary moral philosophy interdigitate and, especially in this book, how moral philosophy needs psychoanalysis for a richer and more realistic view of how the person as moral agent is constituted. His books, essays, and collections of essays, while always interdisciplinary in their larger purpose, have varied in the degree to which they are addressed primarily to psychoanalysts, philosophers, or more general audiences (e.g., earlier essays in <italic>The New Republic</italic>). The present book is heavily tilted toward a readership of philosophers, dealing in great depth, it seems to me, with issues of current concern in contemporary philosophy dealing with morals and ethics. Clearly, for Lear explicating the relevance of philosophy and philosophical exploration for psychoanalysts is also crucial. While the book also offers much of importance for psychoanalysts, it places some heavy demands on the psychoanalytic reader.</p>
<p><italic>A Case for Irony</italic> is based on Lear’s 2009 Tanner Lectures on Human Values at Harvard. The two lectures, “To Become Human Does Not Come That Easily” (a quotation from Kierkegaard) and “Ironic Soul,” are complemented by four formal discussions (“commentaries”), three by philosophers and one by a psychoanalyst anthropologist (Robert Paul), and Lear’s responses to these interlocutors.</p>
<p>The armature of the book is constructed of two interrelated arguments. The first argument—a philosophical one—is that there is a form of irony, “pretense-transcending irony,” epitomized in Socrates and Kierkegaard, that is indeed capable of transcending conventional categories and social norms and radically questioning the very premises of our human existence. The second argument—a statement about psychoanalysis—is that psychoanalysis can constitute a radical form of questioning the basic premises of who we are, who we think we are, and who or what we aspire to be. This capacity of psychoanalysis bears some similarities, or at least parallels, to the radical irony attributed to Socrates and Kierkegaard. A link between the realms of the more radical form of irony and the experience of psychoanalysis is the experience of the uncanny (see, e.g., pp. 15–16). Entailed are arguments about the nature of psychic unity, with Lear contending that his presentation of the organizing role of unconscious fantasy adds a new way of looking at the unity of the self. The question of the nature of the self, the unity of the self, is connected to Lear’s critique of the limitations of self-reflection in fundamentally questioning the premises of oneself and of one’s being, and hence limitations on the power of moral philosophy (at times Lear calls it “moral psychology”) as we know it, to achieve those goals. “Reflective distance” is contrasted with “ironic disruption,” and the former is limited in comparison to the latter. The arguing between Lear and his commentators is quite civil—only an occasional violent image (e.g., hitting and punching [p. 170])—but is also a “civil war,” a contest between moral philosophy and psychoanalysis as claimants for “analyzing” the human soul.</p>
<p>His first lecture takes off from the great ironists in the history of philosophy, Socrates (via Plato) and Kierkegaard (who himself draws some inspiration from Socratic irony). In brief, Lear argues that these thinkers present “ironic pretense-transcending activity,” truly radically disruptive forms of questioning the most basic assumptions, the “illusions” of the societies in which they lived. He argues for a much more robust meaning of the irony in the life’s work of these two than is accorded them by other modern philosophers, and speaks of Socrates’ and Kierkegaard’s “ironic existence.”</p>
<p>Especially in the second lecture, and in the commentaries and responses, Lear develops his thesis that the experience of psychoanalysis involves, sooner or later, comparably disruptive experiences, requiring radical rethinking, requestioning, and reexperiencing of the premises of one’s existence. I shall return to illustration and discussion of what Lear means by such radically disruptive experiences in psychoanalysis. In contrast to some of Lear’s earlier works focusing on major cultural and political transformations (e.g., <italic>Radical Hope</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065113475665">2005</xref>]), his focus here is very much on individual transformation, with examples drawn from everyday life (often, academic everyday life) and from his psychoanalytic work. His principal models of radically disruptive irony, Socrates and Kierkegaard, were very much invested in disruptions that could lead to societal transformation. As Socrates asked, “Is there a citizen in all of Athens?” so Kierkegaard asked, “Is there a Christian in all of Christendom?” (Lear’s “blunter” version is “Among all Christians, is there a Christian?” (p. 12). Nevertheless, Lear’s arguments here, even about psychoanalysis. do bear on questions of change in the collective consciousness. One of Lear’s central examples of disruptive questioning—his questioning whether or not he really is a teacher and, accordingly, what a teacher is (pp. 16–22) is an important thought experiment for both philosophical and psychoanalytic audiences. He describes how suddenly all his previous categories and formulas about teaching, such as “helping my students develop,” become hollow. Such questioning, including how he is “struck” by the experience of this question, could, if seriously followed through, have profound social and cultural impact.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0003065113475665">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lear quotes Kierkegaard’s description: “My entire existence is really the deepest irony . . . the irony of assuming Christianity exists at the same time that there are one thousand preachers robed in velvet and silk and millions of Christians who beget Christians and so on” (pp. 6–7). For Socrates, Lear chooses three questions: “Among all politicians, is there a single politician?”; “Among all rhetoricians, is there a single rhetorician?”; “Among all doctors, is there a doctor?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0003065113475665">3</xref></sup> In brief, Lear’s argument is that Kierkegaard and Socrates claim, in effect, that the socially available definitions of the above categories represent totally misguided and defective understandings, whether of being a Christian, a politician, a rhetorician, or a doctor. For Socrates, all of these “practitioners” should be addressing not the narrow definition of the craft but the question of where their craft belongs in the larger context of a life truly lived. Is the politician considering what is most valuable, or what the aim of human society is? The rhetorician what he or she should really be persuading people to do or think? The doctor, whether to alleviate and cure symptoms, or to address the causes and cures of fundamental maladies of the human soul and the body politic?</p>
<p>Lear’s examples, especially his clinical case, make much of the different kinds of states, of conscious and unconscious aspects, of what it is to be angry, including the role of words in not only expressing, but modulating, one’s behavioral expressions of affect, especially anger (see the commentary by Robert Paul and Lear’s response, pp. 164–176).</p>
<p>As an illustration of his contention that psychoanalysis at its best entails the patient’s experiencing profound disruption and reorientation, Lear presents a vignette of one of his patients, Ms. A.: “an attractive young woman in her mid-twenties . . . came into analysis because of lack of sexual feelings for her husband” (p. 47). She suggests that perhaps her husband’s acne, or his slight paunch, turns her off.</p>
<p>A story unfolds of a childhood as a tomboy, and of her great pleasure in sports as an adult that includes playing on a co-ed team that in fact has only two women on it. She behaves with a male teammate at times in ways he might easily interpret as an invitation/seduction, herself totally unaware of any such possible implication. In the course of psychoanalysis, patient and analyst discover, as it were, an unconscious organizing fantasy of being a boy “As Ms. A. is lying on the couch reflecting on, say, the pleasures of suiting up in a team uniform—pleasures she might not have thought of before—her out-loud thinking about her boyishness begins to become a boyish expression. Ironically, what is disturbing in this particular instance is not so much the content of her reflection as the vibrancy she experiences in her voice. . . . her expression is accompanied by apperceptive consciousness. The result is an uncanny jolt. This is a fractal moment . . .” (p. 58).</p>
<p>Lear summarizes her experience of realization of this aspect of her psyche:
<disp-quote>
<p>First, there is an ironic disruption of one’s conscious practical identity. . . . [As she] comes to <italic>express</italic> her unconscious practical identity verbally, this expression cannot help but to disrupt her conscious sense of practical identity. The analytic process aims to create a space in which the disruption can be playful, as opposed to scary, overwhelming, or traumatic. But there is a disruption of ordinary conscious life which, put into words, has this shape: “What does <italic>any of this</italic> have to do with <italic>being a woman</italic>?” The <italic>‘any of this’</italic> stretches out in all directions, covering not only the boyish voice that is finding expression in the analytic session but also in the feminine images that Ms. A. has, until now, lived by. This is the experience of erotic uncanniness that is irony. It is an uncanny doubling wherein Ms. A. is not only expressing herself (through her core fantasy); she is also looking over at herself as weirdly unfamiliar in her familiarity. Her question is urgent and practical, and it confronts her in the first person. It is disorienting . . . she can no longer <italic>simply</italic> appeal to received images or to standard reflections on her conscious practical identity—for that is precisely what is in question. Nor . . . can anyone else answer questions for her [p. 60].</p>
<p>the important point to notice is that in facilitating the expression of hitherto hidden parts of the self, analysis simultaneously facilitates a process of ironic disruption [p. 59].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lear further summarizes the nature of analytic disruption—the woman entered psychoanalysis not with a question about her identity, sexual or otherwise, but with a practical question about sexual attraction to her husband. But what unfold are larger questions: “Am I able to love; to allow myself to be loved? . . . Am I able to create . . .? Am I able to be a friend, a husband, a wife . . .?” Lear calls this “an uncanny . . . ballooning out of one’s sense of practical identity . . . the psychoanalytically familiar experience of not fitting comfortably into one’s own psychic skin . . .” (pp. 60–61).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0003065113475665">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>For most psychoanalysts reading (or hearing, as in the lectures) Lear’s account of the case, there is both the familiar and the unfamiliar. Moments of disruption, of astonishing recognition of a hitherto disavowed or repressed truth—at times of the uncanny—are familiar. Indeed, psychoanalysts know this from their personal analyses, as well as from their work with patients. “Apperceptive consciousness” is a phrase in the realm of the unfamiliar, but the OED definition of “apperception” as “the mind’s perception of itself as a conscious agent” brings it into the realm of the recognizable. Similarly, Lear’s characterizations of the disruptions in “practical identity” (a phrase that seems to be part of contemporary philosophical discussions) are not usual psychoanalytic terms in case reports. Yet such a way of describing the import of her realizations is an important and somewhat different way of viewing change in the psychoanalytic process. It is a characterization that also opens up a channel by which individual change might prove a pathway to social, cultural, or political change—a realization that there is something amiss in the standards by which the patient has been measuring herself, as well as something amiss in her knowledge of herself. Compare Louise Kaplan’s characterization of “perversions” as caricatures of societal stereotypes of expectable gender role and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065113475665">1991</xref>, p. 9). Though Lear does not list “reformer” or “revolutionary,” or “raising my as yet unborn daughters differently from how I was raised” in his brief catalogue of the pathways Ms. A. might follow with her new awareness and insights (pp. 59–60), these are now, after the analysis, more available actions and choices.</p>
<p>For me (wearing both my psychoanalyst hat and my “I am a sporadic student of, and consumer of, philosophy” T-shirt), there is something arresting and useful in presenting the radically disruptive facet of Socrates and Kierkegaard in parallel with the kinds of transformations that take place in psychoanalysis. While psychoanalysts have always been deeply concerned with what is transformative in the psychoanalytic process—e.g., transference interpretations; the here and now; constructions in psychoanalysis (eschewed by Lear [p.121, n. 4])—there has been less attention to articulating the changes in self and self-experience in relation to role and social norms. Such material is undoubtedly to be found in some case reports, but only a few writers have attempted to delineate the kinds of experiences of alternations of self suggested by Lear in his rendering of this case. In turn, I believe he is trying (though not always succeeding, to judge by the interchanges in this volume) to arrest the attention of philosophers: by his reframing of Socrates and Kierkegaard he augments his implicit argument with his philosophical colleagues, saying in effect, “Psychoanalysis is disruptive and thereby transforming; can you say the same about the way you practice philosophy?”</p>
<p>Here we come to an important issue about “practice”: what does it mean to practice a discipline or profession? Reading and rereading this book (having heard the first lecture), I become ever more aware of the differences between the professions of philosophy and psychoanalysis, especially the way each profession “practices.” This book is very closely argued, both by Lear himself and by his commentators, and the back-and-forth permitted by the format of the lectures (and the book) demands very close attention and sustained concentration. Philosophers in their training—if not by temperament as well—are schooled in debate, in close and continuous questioning of the logic of things, of the structure of the argument, and of the nature of evidence. While perennial issues debated by philosophers, involving justice, truth, beauty, moral integrity, and meaning, are the objects of much of philosophical inquiry, the <italic>process</italic> of arriving at conclusions and hypotheses occupies much of philosophical attention. It is not native for most psychoanalysts (and certainly for me) to have to follow such close argumentation. In fact, as psychoanalysts we are prone to be impatient with it, and are more likely to make an interpretation of why these people are spending so much time in endless debate than to actually attend to the specifics of the argument. Analysts want to know the motive, to get at “the fantasy,” “the conflict,” “the rationalization.” This is our basic training in the field and a staple of our day-to-day practice. Analysts are busy listening with “the third ear,” while philosophers are busy with close listening with “two ears.” The philosopher, I believe, could chomp at the bit (and Korsgaard in her commentary does), wanting to know more about how Lear reaches his conclusions, how he assembles the data, how he has considered (or not considered) alternative hypotheses—in short, enough to be able to philosophize.</p>
<p>These differences struck me at many junctures in the book, as I tried to follow the multiple lines of argument, both in Lear’s presentation and in the presentations of the philosopher commentators, and as I tried to grasp the essence of their disagreements. If I could say, “Oh, these are just ‘family quarrels’ among philosophers,” it would make life simpler, but would miss the essence of what was being argued (let alone disregarding the fact that as a psychoanalyst I would be attending very closely to what was being said and enacted in those “family quarrels”). Indeed, it was with a bit of relief that I read Robert Paul’s psychoanalytically based commentary and Lear’s response to it—now that’s familiar! (And “familial”—my professional family.)</p>
<p>What about analysts reading Lear’s case of Ms. A. and the brief vignette presented by Robert Paul? Lear’s report gives us just enough specifics that we get some sense of the patient. By dint of the kind of argument he is making with this case, we get little sense of the therapeutic interactions between analyst and patient. How did Lear deal with Ms. A.’s memory of seeing her parents in some kind of sexual act? How did he comment on her defensive style? These are the kinds of data psychoanalysts want to have in order to form a judgment about the nature and quality of the analysis, indeed partly in order to be able to criticize the technique! The analyst’s reflexes include, “I would have done it differently,” “You missed the aggression,” “You didn’t comment on the self-state in the dream,” and so on. There is, then, neither world enough and time nor space in print to present the kind of report that would allow both philosophers and analysts to feel that they can properly “practice” with this case. But it is salutary for psychoanalysts to confront some of the questions that are reflexes for philosophers: how do you know this, how can you be so sure, have you really considered alternative hypotheses?</p>
<p>It is clear that both sides in the dialogue reported in this book are trying hard to make sense of the other, and conveying the mutual enlargement that comes with that effort (see especially Lear’s acknowledgment of Moran’s account of psychoanalysis). “Both sides,” of course, are also in Lear, so the book is yet another step in his ongoing synthesis. His continuing effort thereby pushes the reader, of whatever discipline or hybrid of disciplines, to stretch and reach a little further in trying to understand another discipline. Good interdisciplinary work is not for the faint of heart. To be good it takes discipline and work.</p>
<p>Let us consider another question that arises from this book, the question of what other kinds of transformation take place in human existence. Assume the validity of Lear’s characterization of what kinds of ironic, or irony-like, transformations take place in psychoanalysis (admitting along the way that his account represents what sometimes happens, what could happen, and is not necessarily so in every instance). Let us also assume that some kind of full-fledged philosophically based, ironically lived method could be practiced, with transformative outcome (e.g., “philosophical counseling,” which started to emerge in the 1990s).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0003065113475665">5</xref></sup> But what other pathways are there to radical “upending” of one’s cherished assumptions, and profound personal and/or communal transformation?</p>
<p>Lear reminds us that the Platonic dialogues allow for, indeed presume, the possibility for the individual to experience progressive closeness to transcendent Forms, Ideas, at times using the imagery of merger and fusion, sexual or otherwise. Every religious tradition has its repertory of transformative possibilities, in the performance of acts of justice and kindness, or repentance, redemption, resurrection, or reincarnation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0003065113475665">6</xref></sup> Indeed, in the Judaeo-Christian tradition there is the passage from happiness and well-being to deep despair, to an appeal to God, to God’s hearkening and saving the petitioner from the pit. “From the narrow straits I called upon God and he answered me with enlargement” (Psalm 118). The threat of one’s impending death or that of a loved one is a powerful force for transformation, for valuing life, for cherishing what one has, for the freedom that can come with profound gratitude for being alive. Lear himself in <italic>Radical Hope</italic> has attempted to capture the nature of the Crow Indians’ initiatory solitary journey that was the basis for the changes in Chief Plenty Coups, changes of profound importance for survival of the tribe. In short, can we eventually somehow extract the essence, the Platonic Form of transformation? Tantalizing—but clearly <italic>The Case for Irony</italic> is a step toward another book (or two or three or more): <italic>Varieties of Transformation.</italic></p>
