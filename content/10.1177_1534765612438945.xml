<abstract>
<p>Hurricane Katrina was the third deadliest and most costly storm to the United States. Response by spiritual and faith communities played an important role in addressing the needs of evacuees displaced by the storm. The purpose of the current focus group study was to document perspectives from faith-based relief providers in Dallas, Texas responding to the needs of Hurricane Katrina evacuees. Specifically, the study aimed to document (a) the roles played by faith-based relief providers in addressing the needs of Katrina evacuees relocated to Dallas; (b) faith-based relief providers’ views of the spiritual needs of evacuees; (c) the types of religious coping that faith-based providers reported evacuees used; (d) the types of religious coping responses that faith-based providers themselves used during their service provision for evacuees; and (e) inquire about how best to conduct research within religious settings following a disaster. Focus groups were conducted with 9 participants, 5 of whom were paid staff of either a church or a Catholic school, and the rest were faith-based volunteers. Findings from the current study suggest planning for, coordinating, and supporting the role of faith-based providers in partnering with both relief organizations and mental health providers to more effectively assist with future disaster response. In addition, future research is needed on coping responses of faith-based providers as well as logistics that help to effectively coordinate faith-based networks to function best in partnership with other secular and faith-based relief organizations.</p>

<p>Hurricane Katrina was the third deadliest and most costly storm to the United States and is considered “one of the most devastating natural disasters in U.S. history” (National Hurricane Center, 2005). Estimated range from 400,000 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/social_issues/jan-june06/census_06-07.html">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/social_issues/jan-june06/census_06-07.html</ext-link>) to 1 million (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article.73098.asp">http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article.73098.asp</ext-link>) Gulf Coast residents were displaced by the hurricane. Texas received the largest number of Katrina evacuees, and Dallas was one of four primary municipalities to receive them. Within 2 weeks of the storm, 50,000 Katrina evacuees were registered to receive services from the city of Dallas, and 2,500 of these were sheltered at the Dallas Convention Center and Reunion Arena at some point during that time (Texas Health and Human Services Commission, 2006). Additional shelters were created throughout the city to accommodate the overflow. Demands on services in the cities that hosted evacuees were high, as those who remained in New Orleans following the mandatory evacuation order, and who experienced the storm and were later evacuated by bus, disproportionately represented groups with the least resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765612438945">North et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to the need for shelter, clothing, and food, evidence also suggests that levels of psychological distress were high after evacuation from Hurricane Katrina and remained high for many evacuees for as long as 1 year postevacuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612438945">Wadsworth, Santiago, &amp; Einhorn, 2009</xref>). Since many of the evacuees have remained long term in places outside New Orleans to this day, many are still in need of support services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765612438945">Horner, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>With the overwhelming demand for services placed on the city of Dallas, the religious and spiritual community, as it has many times in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612438945">Koenig, 2006</xref>), stepped in to help serve evacuees. Although the role of the religious community in response to Katrina has been documented in New Orleans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612438945">Phillips &amp; Jenkins, 2010</xref>) and Baton Rouge, Louisiana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612438945">Cain &amp; Barthelemy, 2008</xref>), it has not been extensively studied. It is important to further understand the roles of faith-based relief providers in response to Katrina so that future response and recovery efforts can intentionally plan for the involvement of faith-based providers prior to more effectively plan for future disasters. In addition, there has been a lack of research to date that has focused on the experience and support needs of faith-based relief providers who care for evacuees following disasters. The purpose of the present study is to augment the existing literature by exploring the perspectives of faith-based relief providers in the Dallas area on various aspects of their response to the needs of Katrina evacuees.</p>
<sec id="section1-1534765612438945">
<title>Roles Filled by Religious Communities and Organizations Following Katrina</title>
<p>Preexisting faith-based organizations (FBOs) as well as individual faith-based volunteers and congregations played a significant role in the response to Hurricane Katrina. A study that examined roles filled by preexisting FBOs, such as Catholic Community Services or United Methodist Disaster Relief, in New Orleans following Katrina documented that the response of FBOs included helping to rescue people from the flood, creating shelters, feeding the displaced, providing clothing and other goods, reuniting families, and managing distributions and donations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612438945">Phillips &amp; Jenkins, 2010</xref>). Viewed through FEMA’s comprehensive emergency management cycle, which includes the phases of (a) mitigation projects designed to reduce future risks; (b) preparedness efforts that include education, planning, and training; (c) response efforts that focus on saving lives; and (d) recovery work such as rebuilding (FEMA, 2007), FBOs primarily focused on the response and recovery phases, as they have in previous natural and man-made disasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612438945">Phillips &amp; Jenkins, 2010</xref>). In terms of rebuilding, religious organizations have helped to gut and rebuild houses as well as provide appliances and furniture. In addition, the psychological needs of people following Katrina necessitated case management for individuals and families that often included a combination of FBOs, voluntary organizations, and traditional service providers. Finally, in a survey of those who received services following Katrina, respondents more positively rated their satisfaction with services for FBOs than for governmental agencies or the Red Cross (Phillips &amp; Jenkins).</p>
<p>A study of 157 churches that served Katrina evacuees through voluntary congregations in Baton Rouge, Louisiana documented that the primary services delivered were providing food, financial assistance, clothing, counseling transportation, shelters, and child care. These churches also reported attempting to reunite families with loved ones outside the Baton Rouge area and that they also attempted to connect evacuees with outside resources, including FEMA, FBOs, the Red Cross, Unemployment, Medicaid, and Food Stamps. In addition, they reported providing meals, showers, and housing for relief workers. Members of these churches overwhelmingly said that their largest difficulty was providing shelters and that they also needed to provide evacuees with local Internet connections to help them search databases for evacuees outside the Baton Rouge area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612438945">Cain &amp; Barthelemy, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The incorporation of churches into response plans that address more the prevention and training aspects of FEMA’s cycle requires not only coordinating roles of religious volunteers and FBOs but also considering the support needs of these volunteers in terms of providing resources to help them address needs of evacuees as well as their own emotional needs and reactions as they respond to evacuees and others affected by disasters.</p>

<title>Individual Religious and Spiritual Responses to Natural and Man-Made Disasters</title>
<p>Individual spirituality and religiousness, religious beliefs, and the use of religion to cope with trauma have been widely studied as both potentially positive and negative factors in psychological adjustment following natural disasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612438945">Aten et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612438945">Newton &amp; McIntosh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612438945">Smith, Pargament, Brant, &amp; Oliver, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612438945">Wadsworth et al., 2009</xref>) and man-made disasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534765612438945">Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2003</xref>). Potential pathways through which spirituality can ameliorate some of the impact of a traumatic event include enhanced social support, changed cognitive processing of the event, personal empowerment, and enhanced sense of meaning and purpose attached to the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612438945">Aten et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612438945">Koenig, 2006</xref>). Studies demonstrate the use of prayer as an important method of coping among religious people of Islamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765612438945">Ai, Tice, Huang, &amp; Ishisaka, 2005</xref>) and Judeo-Christian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612438945">Smith et al., 2000</xref>) beliefs. Drescher and colleagues (2004) reviewed 32 articles pertaining to the relationship between spirituality and trauma and found four themes, namely, (a) spirituality and religion can serve as a buffer against the impact of trauma, (b) there is a positive association between spiritual well-being and quality of life, (c) there is a link between spirituality and posttraumatic growth, and (d) traumatic experiences can have negative effects on spiritual and religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Another well-documented pathway through which spirituality can influence outcomes following trauma are situation-specific religious coping strategies, referred to as <italic>positive</italic> and <italic>negative</italic> forms of religious coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612438945">Pargament, Smith, Koenig, &amp; Perez, 1998</xref>) based on their perceived relations to psychological adjustment following stressful and traumatic events. A meta-analysis of 49 studies of the impact of positive and negative religious coping strategies on psychological outcomes in response to stress confirmed that positive religious coping strategies are directly related to positive psychological outcomes, such as emotional well-being and life satisfaction, and are inversely related to negative psychological outcomes, such as anxiety, depression, and negative affect, whereas negative religious coping strategies are directly related to negative psychological outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534765612438945">Ano &amp; Vasconcelles, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies with those who experienced Hurricane Katrina demonstrate the link between religion and both positive and negative outcomes. A study with evacuees in Colorado found that negative religious coping was strongly linked to symptoms of PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612438945">Wadsworth et al., 2009</xref>). Negative religious coping was often directly linked to the severity of the stressor and to greater distress. Evidence suggests that there are additional aspects to religious beliefs that contribute to coping styles and outcomes. A study of college students on the Louisiana gulf coast who were strongly affected by Katrina found that an understanding of the relationship between religion and appraisals is crucial to understanding the overall relationship between religion and coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612438945">Newton &amp; McIntosh, 2009</xref>). Another study sheds light on how this relationship may unfold, finding that social support may be bolstered through relating to other people who share similar religious beliefs, such as similar images of God (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612438945">Aten et al., 2008</xref>). The relationship between spirituality and coping with disaster is complex and warrants further research. Although a number of studies have examined the relationship between religion and adjustment following Katrina for those who directly experienced the storm, few studies have examined the response of faith-based relief providers who served evacuees; this information is needed to understand how to better support them in their relief efforts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1534765612438945">
<title>Conducting Research With Disaster Evacuees</title>
<p>To understand more nuanced coping responses by both those affected by disasters and those who help them, such as faith-based volunteers, it is important to consider ways to ethically and responsibly study those who have been affected by disasters in their immediate aftermath. The complexities of conducting research on how best to meet the needs of individuals affected by disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, are daunting. There are ethical challenges of soliciting participation from stressed populations as well as logistical challenges of how to conduct research with participants who may be transient and in situations in which it is difficult to maintain contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612438945">Schulenberg et al., 2008</xref>). Researchers who conducted community-based mental health needs assessments and clinical research following Hurricane Katrina note the importance of preparing research questions and plans in advance of a natural or man-made disaster; embedding research within preexisting organizational contexts to help carry out the research as well as disseminate findings; collaborating with community organizations and other researchers to conduct the study; and using community-based approaches that draw on resources and strengths of the community prior to, during, and after the disaster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612438945">Flory, Kloos, Hankin, &amp; Cheely, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765612438945">Jones, Immel, Moore, &amp; Hadder, 2008</xref>). One such area of strength within communities is preexisting religious and spiritual networks. However, there is little information on how research might be carried out through these types of religious and spiritual networks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1534765612438945">
<title>Purpose of the Current Study</title>
<p>The religious and spiritual community has long played a role in responding to the needs of those affected by natural and man-made disasters. Spiritual responses by individuals have also been documented as having both a positive and a negative impact on adjustment following disasters. Furthermore, although it has been suggested that postdisaster research ought to be carried out within existing community networks, there is little research within religious contexts about responses to disasters by faith-based relief providers. The purpose of the current exploratory focus group study is to document (a) the roles played by faith-based relief providers in addressing the needs of Katrina evacuees relocated to Dallas; (b) faith-based relief providers’ views of the spiritual needs of evacuees; (c) the types of religious coping that faith-based providers reported evacuees used; and (d) the types of religious coping responses that faith-based providers themselves used during their service provision for evacuees; and to inquire about how best to conduct research within religious settings following a disaster.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-1534765612438945">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were recruited through Texas Federation of Families for Children’s Mental Health, an organization that worked with Katrina evacuees in the state of Texas. A representative of the organization invited religious workers and volunteers from several religious settings in the Dallas area to participate in focus groups. As churches with a wide variety of denominations, ethnicity, and economic status responded to Hurricane Katrina, focus groups with religious providers from different denominational backgrounds were arranged. Focus groups were conducted on October 13, 2006, approximately 13.5 months following Hurricane Katrina. Several protestant and Catholic churches in the Dallas and Denton area, including those that were both predominantly White and African American, where the researchers knew representatives were invited to participate in the study. Focus groups were held at churches that responded positively to the invitation, including (a) a Protestant church in Dallas that was centrally located among those churches that were highly active in the disaster response and (b) a Catholic church in Denton. Overall, the groups consisted of 8 White females and 1 African American male. There were 7 participants in the first group and 2 in the second. Of the 9 participants, 5 were paid staff of either a church or the Catholic school; their roles included office staff, pastoral care, a minister, a church’s director of outreach, and an administrator from the Catholic elementary school. The rest of the participants were faith-based volunteers. Also present at the focus groups were four university-based researchers who were also psychologists, one of whom moderated the focus group.</p>
<p>Informed consent for the focus group and permission to audio-record the session were gathered from each participant, and each was compensated with a US$15 gift card in appreciation for his or her time. Each group lasted approximately 1 hr. The groups were given a brief overview of how the session would be conducted and were then asked questions regarding their experiences of volunteering in response to Hurricane Katrina. The questions centered on the participants’ role in working with evacuees (“What was your role working with Hurricane Katrina evacuees?”), perceptions of the spiritual needs of evacuees (“Describe the needs of a religious and spiritual nature expressed by evacuees”), their own spiritual reactions (“Describe the reactions and changes of a religious or spiritual nature that you experienced personally in working with evacuees”; “How were your own religious/spiritual beliefs and practices impacted by the disaster?”), and religious coping of both evacuees and the volunteers themselves (“How did evacuees draw on their religion/spirituality to cope with the event?”; “In what ways did you draw on your religious/spiritual beliefs, practices or community in coping with the work with evacuees?”). The researchers also asked volunteers to share their perceptions of effective ways to conduct psychological research in the wake of widespread disasters such as Hurricane Katrina (“What key components of religion and spirituality do you think it would be important for researchers to study following disasters or terrorism?”; “How do you think research like this could be carried out following a traumatic event?”). The focus group moderator also asked follow-up questions to each major question to obtain more detailed responses.</p>
<p>The psychologists present at the focus group were also available to participants following the focus group in case the focus group material provoked any traumatic responses from participants; the researchers present also had local referrals available to participants in case long-term follow-up was needed. At the end of the focus group, the moderator debriefed focus group participants on the purpose of the focus groups, audio-recordings, and how the data were to be analyzed for research purposes. No participants requested assistance from psychologists after focus group discussion.</p>

<sec id="section7-1534765612438945">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Each focus group session was recorded live and then transcribed verbatim. Two different types of data analysis were used: (a) content analysis (Stemler, 2001) was used to determine themes that emerged from the transcripts and (b) consensual qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612438945">Hill, Thompson, &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>) was used to categorize responses that reflected positive and negative religious coping strategies within <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612438945">Pargament, Smith, and colleagues’ (1998)</xref> categorization. Coding categories for positive religious coping included (a) Benevolent Religious Reappraisal (redefining the stressor through religion as benevolent and potentially beneficial), (b) Collaborative Religious Coping (seeking control through a partnership with God in problem solving), (c) Seeking Spiritual Support (searching for comfort and reassurance through God’s love and care), (d) Religious Purification (searching for spiritual cleansing through religious actions), (e) Spiritual Connection (seeking a sense of connectedness with transcendent forces), (f) Seeking Support from Clergy or Members (searching for comfort and reassurance through the love and care of congregation members and clergy), (g) Religious Helping (attempting to provide spiritual support and comfort to others), and (h) Religious Forgiving (looking to religion for help in letting go of anger, hurt, and fear associated with an offense; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612438945">Pargament, Smith, et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765612438945">Pargament, Koenig, &amp; Perez, 2000</xref>). Negative religious coping categories consisted of (a) Punishing God Reappraisal (redefining the stressor as a punishment from God for the individual’s sin), (b) Demonic Reappraisal (redefining the stressor as the act of the devil), (c) Reappraisal of God’s Powers (redefining God’s powers to influence the stressful situation), (d) Self-Directing Religious Coping (seeking control through individual initiative rather than help from God), (e) Spiritual Discontent (expressions of confusion and dissatisfaction with God); and (f) Interpersonal Religious Discontent (expressions of confusion and dissatisfaction with clergy or members; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765612438945">Pargament et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612438945">Pargament, Smith, et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612438945">Pargament, Zinnbauer, et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>To conduct content analysis, members of the coding team, which consisted of four clinical psychology graduate students whose work was supervised by the researcher who moderated the focus group, independently read the transcripts thoroughly, and identified a list of coding themes. The coding team reconciled their findings until an overall set of themes and subthemes were agreed upon (Stemler, 2001).</p>
<p>For the consensual qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612438945">Hill, Thompson, &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>) portion of the study, responses in transcripts were compared with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612438945">Pargament, Smith, and colleagues’ (1998)</xref> religious coping categories and areas of overlap were identified. The research team came to a consensus on labeling the religious coping categories that emerged from the transcripts, which represented styles of positive and negative coping derived from Pargament’s work.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section9-1534765612438945">
<title>Roles of Providers and Populations Served</title>
<p>All participants indicated that they worked with both adult and child evacuees. An overall theme in responses about roles following the hurricane was that churches and religious institutions often have systems already established that can be quickly activated and adapted to serve the needs of evacuees. Within participants’ faith communities, more than 2 million dollars worth of food and other goods and services was raised for hurricane evacuees during the initial response. In addition, participants conducted both a diaper drive, collecting 9,000 diapers, and a school supply drive in which participants provided prospective donors with lists of what evacuated children would need when they started school in Dallas.</p>
<p>A key role mentioned by participants following Hurricane Katrina was networking with other churches within the city to consolidate relief efforts. Networking minimized duplication of effort and allowed churches to better complement each others’ work.</p>
<p>The faith-based relief providers also indicated that they believed their response was uniquely suited to address the short- and long-term relational needs of evacuees. One relief worker said, “It’s important to care and let them know we were walking with them.” “At [a different relief agency] … they had gloves on and they would hand a little zip lock bag with a diaper, toothpaste, and a toothbrush, across the table. … At the church, they walk in the door, you ask them their name, you give them a hug, … you let them cry. … you can have this relationship.” As volunteers needed training to be admitted to the “Reunion Arena,” where evacuees were staying, one church set up a meeting area outside the arena to talk and pray with people. In addition, another religious group worked with a hotel that was full of New Orleans evacuees who thought they were going to stay a few days, only to learn they would not be able to return to their homes for much longer. This church worked with the management of the hotel to set up a computer center, linking the evacuees with a faith-based housing coalition and other resources. The church members also brought 2 to 3 meals a day to the hotel, whereby it became a center and fed and housed people for no charge.</p>
<p>For their long-term response, one of the religious communities planned on traveling to the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina to repair houses that were damaged. Another church “adopted” 31 evacuee families and helped provide them with furniture and other things they needed to move into apartments and also helped them with resettlement difficulties, such as transportation, medical resources, employment needs, and schools. Instead of repairing homes, another church raised money and helped rebuild churches that were damaged during Katrina. In addition, one respondent said her church built a daycare center within a church in New Orleans.</p>

<title>Spiritual Needs of Evacuees</title>
<p>Overall, the focus group respondents’ worldviews were spiritual in nature, so they viewed their needs through the lens of their spirituality. In describing needs of evacuees, one faith-based relief worker said, “… they were just stripped down to the soul. They needed love, care, and prayer, comfort and concern, to know that some person really cared about them.” Participants mentioned a wide range of needs, including physical and relational needs, spiritual support needs, needs for counseling, and “sanctuary,” which a faith-based relief worker defined as a place where the evacuees felt “nurtured and safe.” Themes fell into the categories of physical and relational needs, both of which respondents saw as spiritual needs. In terms of physical needs, faith-based relief providers mentioned that evacuees needed pillows, blankets, transportation, food, water, gift cards, gas cards, clothing, money, and shelter. Relationally, faith-based relief providers mentioned that evacuees needed love, comfort, hugs, care, a listening ear, and connections with other families.</p>
<p>Focus group participants also mentioned that evacuees expressed the need for connection through spiritual practices, such as individual and community prayer, reading scripture, and worship in large groups. Combining the need for connection and spiritual practices, one faith-based relief worker said, “… they wanted to tell their stories … what they were doing when all this struck, and how they got here … just to have somebody listen … to not feel alone, whether it’s to tell their story or ask for prayer.” Another worker mentioned that there was immediately a connection and common ground through shared faith between faith-based providers and refugees; “the best thing was just there was such a strong bond through [shared faith]. … you just see each other as a brother and sister in Christ.”</p>

<sec id="section11-1534765612438945">
<title>Spiritual Reactions of Providers</title>
<p>Participants were deeply touched by the work they did and the reciprocal relationship with evacuees. Several participants mentioned feeling “blessed” by being able to be part of the effort to respond to the disaster. Themes fell into categories of their feelings of gratitude and their own growth through their service.</p>
<p>Faith-based relief providers mentioned a spiritual response of feeling gratitude for their own resources, for the way their church responded to the event, and for the affirmation from other churches from across the country that helped out.</p>
<p>Several participants described experiencing growth through the response effort. One worker said,<disp-quote>
<p>[the relief effort] stretched our congregation in lots of ways … [building relationships with evacuees allowed] for God to open that door to recognize what we can learn about ourselves and what we learn about God, as well as what we learn about the families and what they are dealing with. So it was a huge spiritual awakening and opening, and plowing open of our hearts for people in need.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another faith-based relief worker mentioned that this kind of growth took the form of reprioritizing and revitalizing her faith:<disp-quote>
<p>So it just kind of put my mind back on … track. It kind of got me a little more focused, because now I put God first in everything that I do, every decision that I make, every time that I drive, every time I put my children’s clothes on or go to sleep. Because that was really like a turning point in my life.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although this response was not frequent, it is worth noting that one spiritual reaction among faith-based relief providers that was interpreted by the participants as having more negative consequences was the idea of “feeling indispensable” and wanting to control the relief effort. In response to a focus group question about what led people to become burned out, one worker said,<disp-quote>
<p>when personal control issues arose … people couldn’t just give it up to the Lord and just had to be in control. … it was more about them than it was about the need. The other time, though, was when somebody just thought they were so absolutely indispensable and were doing it in their own strength.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When asked to elaborate on what “doing it in their own strength” meant, several participants in the group mentioned faith-based relief providers who would stay up all night, fuss at everybody because they were not as dedicated, and believed they were “used by God to be ‘the’ person when there were hundreds of workers.”</p>

<title>Focus Group Participants’ Views of Religious Coping Methods Used by Evacuees</title>
<p>All comments by faith-based relief providers fell into categories of religious coping established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612438945">Pargament, Smith, et al. (1998a)</xref>. Seeking Support from Clergy or Members of a faith community was mentioned most often. According to the faith-based relief providers, evacuees’ main avenue of seeking support from the providers was asking for prayer and guidance. One participant, referring to her experience with an evacuee, stated, “They may not pray, but they want you to pray with [them]” and “they wanted to be prayed for, they wanted to be prayed with. If they didn’t mention, when we mentioned it, they welcomed it. It was a great solace and comfort to them.” Participants stated that as more evacuees requested prayer, they began to have public prayer services throughout the day.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, providers said evacuees felt a sense of “sanctuary” due to the provision of help and services provided by the faith-based relief providers, which also seems to be a form of Spiritual Connection, another positive religious coping strategy. Participants stated that their help and/or the helping environment served as a sanctuary in which evacuees realized a sense of safety, nurturance, and the meeting of basic physical needs. One participant highlighted the sense of transcendence that was experienced through sanctuary, “I think initially, they [evacuees] felt that this was a place of God, it was a place where they could feel safe, even if they didn’t know why they felt safe” and “what I saw, is that this was a sanctuary for them, a true sanctuary where they felt nurtured and safe, and those types of things.”</p>
<p>Benevolent Religious Reappraisal was also perceived as a method used by evacuees to cope with trauma. Evacuees expressed thankfulness for their safety and physical health despite the traumatic circumstances and tended to reappraise their circumstances in light of God’s protection and safety over their lives during the hurricane:<disp-quote>
<p>Whatever the circumstances the individuals went through, everyone was still happy because they were thanking God that they still had their lives, they still had their health, they were thanking individuals, thanking God that [they] was just around and they would be able to have a second chance.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1534765612438945">
<title>Religious Coping Methods Used by Faith-Based Relief Providers</title>
<p>The providers overall used the positive coping strategy of Religious Helping. By virtue of their role, they practiced this coping strategy throughout the disaster response. The faith-based providers also reported religious coping in terms of Spiritual Connection through spiritual practices with their fellow providers, such as reading scripture together, praying, and worshipping.</p>
<p>A negative religious coping strategy previously mentioned by faith-based relief providers as leading to burnout was Self-Directing Religious Coping. Participants identified this coping method when they described providers who felt “indispensable” and tried to control the relief effort.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1534765612438945">
<title>Suggestions for Spirituality Research Following a Disaster</title>
<p>Participants’ suggestions for research with disaster evacuees and providers focused on understanding how to help postdisaster populations process the disaster. In addition, the relief providers had specific suggestions about timing of research. One worker responded that she “didn’t have time to brush her teeth” while she was doing her early work responding to refugees. She said that due to the enormous work demands, it would be very difficult to sit down with anybody and give them information. This worker did say, however, that it would have been helpful to her to keep a journal during the experience, and she would have liked to give that journal to the Katrina evacuees. She suggested giving evacuees and caregivers a prayer journal (a book for people to record their prayers and thoughts that can take several forms, ranging from structured guidelines to blank pages with or without scripture quotes) following a disaster. She suggested it might be possible that type of journal could be collected or copied with permission and analyzed. An alternative suggestion for conducting research was to bring religious providers who responded to the disaster together a few months after the disaster to process their experience, like we did for these focus groups. The focus groups in this study were 13.5 months following the disaster, and the providers suggested that sooner would have been helpful and would have generated data that could be analyzed as part of research.</p>
<p>Another suggestion for how to collect data following an event was to have a team of people who were “prayer warriors” set up at a table outside a work site, like the convention center in Dallas. The suggestion was to put a team of people together who were not there to meet the physical needs of evacuees who could just listen and record what they were seeing (and, presumably pray). The suggestion was to have a table with coffee with people who were willing to just listen and talk to people.</p>
<p>Finally, a worker suggested research on how religious organizations coordinate relief efforts by keeping a list of things that were needed for a response, so when the next disaster happens, they would have a ready list of supplies, such as computers, phone lines, transportation for evacuees. This list would also include the logistics of what happened. She also wanted to start a registry of faith-based disaster response groups in her area who were willing to perform different functions, such as adopting families and providing food and shelter for evacuees. She said, “Instead of having a big mess again, we’d like to have a plan.” This type of research and documentation can help other organizations and communities establish effective disaster plans and learn from what has and has not worked in previous disasters.</p>

<sec id="section15-1534765612438945" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This exploratory focus group study found that roles reported by faith-based providers primarily fell into the response and recovery phases of FEMA’s <italic>comprehensive emergency management cycle</italic>, which is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612438945">Phillips &amp; Jenkins, 2010</xref>). Although these services are very valuable, respondents also mentioned existing collaborative networks of congregations, which could potentially be recruited to participate in preparedness efforts as part of FEMA’s cycle. By identifying, coordinating and helping to train faith-based providers in effective disaster response, these relief providers could be more easily incorporated into their emergency support functions. In addition, coordinating these networks in advance could help improve communication and referral networks flow more smoothly (Pandya, 2010) and reduce duplication of service efforts.</p>
<p>Focus groups findings also suggest that many of the roles taken by faith-based providers as well as spiritual needs and coping styles of evacuees fit with several of the evidence-based five essential categories for mental health disaster response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612438945">Hobfoll et al., 2007</xref>), which are (a) reestablishing safety, (b) reducing emotional arousal, (c) developing a positive perception of both individual and community capacity for coping and recovery, (d) constructive social support, and (e) fostering hope. In terms of establishing safety, faith-based relief providers mentioned providing food, clothing, and shelter to evacuees in addition to helping to provide access to Internet connections to link evacuees with information and resources. In addition, there was an aspect to finding help from a faith-based provider that lent a sense of safety and nurture to evacuees who shared their faith, which could also help to reduce emotional arousal for evacuees. These findings are consistent with other literature that proposes faith-based providers could have a unique contribution in assisting with mental health responses to disasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612438945">Harris, Thornton, &amp; Engdahl, 2010</xref>). For example, in the New Orleans Convention Center, members of one mosque reached out to evacuated Muslims and brought them to their mosque so they could connect with people who shared their faith and provided culturally and religiously appropriate meals. In this way, they not only received social support from other Muslims but also reduced stress of having to choose between going hungry and violating dietary prohibitions of their faith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612438945">Phillips &amp; Jenkins, 2010</xref>). Intervention by faith-based relief providers can help provide a sense of safety and reduce emotional stress in ways uniquely understood by those who share their faith.</p>
<p>Closely related to social support, the spiritual reaction of evacuees most prominently discussed was the need for spiritual support, which took the forms of connection through spiritual practices and talking with those who share their beliefs. This connection with faith-based relief providers also seemed to help facilitate several positive religious coping strategies that the providers noted, including Seeking Support from Clergy or Religious Members, Spiritual Connection, and Benevolent Religious Reappraisal. Seeking Support in the form of prayer is itself a coping style that is related to positive psychological outcomes. In addition, there is evidence that prayer that incorporates active coping strategies is also related to better mental health outcomes following a stressor, such as a disaster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612438945">Harris et al., 2010</xref>). Training faith-based volunteers to incorporate active coping strategies into prayer, if it fits the faith framework of evacuees, could be a way to help prepare faith-based relief providers prior to a disaster. Constructive social support following a disaster is also only helpful if it avoids raising anxiety by sharing rumors and false information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612438945">Hobfoll, 2007</xref>). It would also be important in training faith-based relief providers to help reduce that kind of false information being spread in the settings where they serve.</p>
<p>With regard to fostering hope and a positive perception of the capacity for recovery, participants mentioned long-term efforts to help rebuild houses, churches, and communities, which could contribute to this positive perception. The participants emphasized that the goals of larger relief organizations often do not include long-term needs of evacuees, and for those that do try to address longer-term needs, funding and support often dries up after 1 or 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765612438945">Horner, 2007</xref>). The capacity of many faith-based relief providers in the Dallas community to partner for longer time frames helped them to stay in relationship with evacuees and to reestablish their lives and communities in Dallas, as many evacuees remained in the area.</p>
<p>Interestingly, participants did not mention the use of negative religious coping strategies by evacuees. It could be that evacuees did not feel comfortable talking with faith-based providers about negative coping strategies or that those who were using negative strategies did not reach out to these types of relief providers. Other possibilities are that participants did not see or did not feel comfortable stating that faith-based coping strategies could have negative outcomes for evacuees.</p>
<p>Spiritual reactions of faith-based religious providers themselves included feeling blessed by being a part of the relief effort, gratitude for their own situation, personal growth from being involved in the relief effort, and a renewed focus and prioritization on their own faith. Future research with religious relief providers could focus on posttraumatic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534765612438945">Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 2004</xref>) or on the development of their own faith and beliefs as a result of participating in a disaster relief effort. In addition, participants mentioned specific positive religious coping strategies of Religious Helping and Spiritual Connection as well as the negative religious coping strategy of Self-Directing Religious Coping, which took the form of trying to control or feeling indispensable to the relief effort. Future research with faith-based relief providers could also focus on religious coping strategies used by providers and their subsequent psychological adjustment. Furthermore, these findings suggest areas for support for faith-based relief providers in terms of encouragement for relying on their faith and community for support, rather than feeling the success of a relief effort relies on any one individual.</p>
<p>When asked about conducting research in religious settings following a disaster, participants primarily talked about data-collection strategies focused on helping those affected deal with the man-made or natural disaster, such as giving people a journal to record their thoughts and prayers or having people in a prayer station record what they saw and heard. These recordings could later be analyzed. These suggestions pose ethical challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612438945">Schulenberg et al., 2008</xref>). However, if a process were developed where evacuees could decide after a certain amount of time has passed whether to give their journal to be used in research, this kind of data could help the evacuees and providers process the event as well as serve as a way to conduct postdisaster research.</p>
<p>In terms of timing of research in religious settings, participants suggested that 2 months after the event would be a good time to conduct research with caregivers. Participants in this study said they found the focus groups helpful in terms of their own processing and said they would have found these groups more helpful if they had occurred sooner after the disaster. Participants also mentioned that a type of research that could be conducted following disasters is to document how these faith-based networks operated to determine what worked and what did not in collaborating. This type of research could also include facilitating and documenting effective communication and practices in coordinating relief efforts among faith-based and secular networks. Documenting successful logistics for delivering services would be helpful for church communities in planning for potential future disasters and terrorist events.</p>
<sec id="section16-1534765612438945">
<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>This study used a convenience sample and represents the opinions of the faith-based providers who participated. The findings must be interpreted with caution. Those with differing views or who may have had a more negative experience may not have felt comfortable sharing their views in the focus group setting. Future research is needed with both evacuees and caregivers in faith-based settings with more representative sampling. In-depth interviews may also capture a broader range of experiences than the focus group methodology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1534765612438945">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Faith-based relief providers play an important and unique role in effective response to disasters. Findings from the current study suggest planning for, coordinating, and supporting the role of faith-based providers in partnering with both relief organizations and mental health providers to more effectively assist with future disaster response. In addition, future research is needed on coping responses of faith-based providers as well as logistics that help to effectively coordinate faith-based networks to function best in partnership with other secular and faith-based relief organizations.</p>
