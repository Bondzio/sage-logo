<p><italic>Background</italic>: Although enteral nutrition (EN) is provided to most mechanically ventilated patients, the effect of specific feeding strategies on circulating markers of coagulation and inflammation is unknown. <italic>Methods</italic>: Markers of inflammation (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, interleukin [IL]-1β, interferon [IFN]-γ, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12) and coagulation (tissue factor [TF], plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) were measured at baseline (n = 185) and 6 days (n = 103) in mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients enrolled in a randomized controlled study of trophic vs full-energy feeds to test the hypothesis that trophic enteral feeds would be associated with decreases in markers of inflammation and coagulation compared to full-energy feeds. <italic>Results</italic>: There were no differences in any of the biomarkers measured at day 6 between patients who were randomized to receive trophic feeds compared to full-energy feeds. However, TF levels decreased modestly in patients from baseline to day 6 in the trophic feeding group (343.3 vs 247.8 pg/mL, <italic>P</italic> = .061) but increased slightly in the full-calorie group (314.3 vs 331.8 pg/mL). Lower levels of TF at day 6 were associated with a lower mortality, and patients who died had increasing TF levels between days 0 and 6 (median increase of 39.7) compared to decreasing TF levels in patients who lived (median decrease of 95.0, <italic>P</italic> = .033). <italic>Conclusions</italic>: EN strategy in critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure does not significantly modify inflammation and coagulation by day 6, but trophic feeds may have some modest effects in attenuating inflammation and coagulation.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation is common in critically ill patients. A recent, large prospective multicenter study found that 39% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) required ventilatory support for more than 6 hours with an overall incidence of acute respiratory failure of 149.5 per 100,000 population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111433054">1</xref></sup> The overall mortality of these patients was high at 31%. Critically ill patients with ARF, many of whom have acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are often systemically ill with disordered coagulation and inflammation. Several single and multicenter trials have shown an association with markers of inflammation and coagulation with outcomes in critically ill patients with ALI and ARDS. Elevated plasma levels of interleukin (IL)–6,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111433054">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607111433054">3</xref></sup> IL-8,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111433054">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111433054">4</xref></sup> and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–α<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607111433054">3</xref></sup> are associated with worse outcomes in these patients. Likewise, disordered coagulation and fibrinolysis as measured by decreased levels of protein C and elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) are associated with worse outcomes in patients with ALI and ARDS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111433054">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111433054"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111433054">7</xref></sup> Patients with ARDS have higher circulating and lung levels of tissue factor (TF) compared to critically ill patients with hydrostatic edema,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607111433054">8</xref></sup> suggesting that ARDS is associated with a more intense procoagulant response. Taken together, these data show that critically ill patients with ALI/ARDS have enhanced inflammation and coagulation, both of which are associated with poor outcomes. In light of the high mortality rate in ARF, novel methods for modulating these pathways in this critically ill patient population are sorely needed.</p>
<p>Enteral nutrition (EN) represents one novel approach to modulating inflammation and coagulation in critically ill patients. Enteral feeding early in a patient’s ICU course has been associated with beneficial outcomes, including decreased infectious complications,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607111433054">9</xref></sup> fewer organ failures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607111433054">10</xref></sup> and reduced mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111433054">11</xref></sup> Despite the widespread acceptance of early EN, few studies have addressed the specific timing and volume of tube feeds in this patient population, and fewer still have studied the effects on inflammation and coagulation. One small study of EN vs parenteral nutrition (PN) in patients with severe pancreatitis showed that EN was associated with a higher early complication rate but not with changes in IL-6 or IL-8.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111433054">12</xref></sup> A single-center study of mechanically ventilated pediatric head injury patients showed that an immune-enhancing enteral diet decreased plasma IL-8 levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607111433054">13</xref></sup> The same group studied children with septic shock and found that immune-enhancing tube feeds decreased IL-6 levels but increased IL-8 levels compared to non-immune-enhancing feeds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607111433054">13</xref></sup> Similar studies have not been done in a population with acute respiratory failure, so the effects of nutrition on inflammatory markers in this patient population are unknown.</p>
<p>Despite the beneficial effects of EN in the critically ill, there is little consensus as to the volume of EN necessary to confer these benefits. Furthermore, studies have shown that markers of inflammation and coagulation are associated with outcomes in critically ill patients. We designed this study as an ancillary study to a randomized, single-center clinical trial of 2 EN strategies (initial trophic vs full-calorie EN) in a heterogeneous group of intubated patients with acute respiratory failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111433054">14</xref></sup> Although there were no differences in ventilator-free days or mortality between the treatment groups, more patients in the trophic group were discharged to home vs a rehabilitation facility. To test whether EN strategy had effects on systemic coagulation or inflammation, we measured markers of coagulation (tissue factor, PAI-1) and inflammation (IL-10, IL-12, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, interferon [IFN]-γ, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α) at enrollment and at day 6. We hypothesized that a low-calorie, low-volume (trophic) EN strategy would be associated with improvements in markers of inflammation and coagulation. We found that in our heterogeneous critically ill patient population, markers of inflammation and coagulation correlate with mortality. This is consistent with prior studies in patients with ALI/ARDS. We also found that although the differences were not statistically significant, trophic EN was associated with a modest decrease in markers of inflammation and coagulation.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0148607111433054">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>Two hundred critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure were recruited in 1 academic medical center from August 20, 2003, through July 8, 2009. Details of the trial protocol and main study outcomes have been published previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111433054">14</xref></sup> Briefly, patients were included in the study if they were within 48 hours of initiating mechanical ventilation, if mechanical ventilation was anticipated to be needed for at least 72 hours, and if their primary team planned to start or continue EN. The most common exclusions were severe chronic lung disease, exceeding the time window for enrollment, patient unexpected to survive 24 hours, presence of severe liver disease, and failure to obtain consent. The study protocol was approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board (Clinicaltrials.gov registration: NCT00252616), and informed consent was obtained from all participants or duly authorized surrogates. Clinical outcomes were collected, including 28-day mortality, specific organ failure-free days, and ventilator-free days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0148607111433054">
<title>Enteral Nutrition Strategies</title>
<p>Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive trophic EN at 10 cc/h or full-energy EN started at 25 cc/h and increased per protocol to a patient-specific target of 25–30 kcal/kg/predicted body weight/d. The median time to start EN from the time of intubation was 1.0 ± 1.0 days in the trophic group and 1.1 ± 1.2 in the full-energy group. The full-energy group reached goal feeding rates in an average of 13.3 ± 12.6 hours. Feeding was continued until the earlier of day 6, death, or extubation. Immune-modulating enteral products were not used. The type of tube feed was not specified in this study. The protocol for managing feeding intolerance episodes has been published previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111433054">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0148607111433054">
<title>Sample Collection and Processing</title>
<p>Blood samples (EDTA plasma) were collected at enrollment prior to randomization and day 6. There were 15 patients who did not have a baseline sample and 97 patients who did not have a day 6 sample. In total, 10 patients in the trophic group and 7 patients in the full-calorie group died by day 6, whereas 25 patients in the trophic group and 40 patients in the full-calorie group were discharged from the ICU (<italic>P</italic> = .170 by χ<sup>2</sup>). The remaining 15 patients did not have samples available due to collection or processing issues. Plasma obtained from two 10-mL EDTA anticoagulated blood samples was divided immediately after centrifugation at 4000 <italic>g</italic> for 12 minutes into equal 1-mL aliquots in specified tubes and frozen at −70°C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0148607111433054">
<title>Biomarker Measurements</title>
<p>All biomarkers were measured in a blinded fashion in duplicate using commercially available immunoassays. Cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IFN-γ) were measured using a cytokine multiplex immunoassay from Meso Scale Discovery (MSD, Gaithersburg, MD). TF (American Diagnostica, Stamford, CT) and PAI-1 (American Diagnostica) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0148607111433054">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All analyses were completed using SPSS for Mac version 18.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Biomarker measurements and clinical parameters are nonnormally distributed. Median values were compared between groups using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test for nonpaired values and the Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired values, and values are expressed as median with confidence intervals (CIs) for the 25th–75th percentile. χ<sup>2</sup> was used to compare discrete variables. A multivariable analysis was done to determine odds ratios for quartiles of each biomarker comparing the highest to lowest quartile in both unadjusted and adjusted (age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II [APACHE II], presence of shock at admission) binary logistic regression for an association with mortality. All analyses were 2-sided with <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>As previously reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111433054">14</xref></sup> patients randomized to the trophic feeding arm received an average of 15% ± 11% of target goal calories compared to 75% ± 39% for the full-calorie group. There were no differences in survival, ventilator-free days, or organ failure–free days between arms.</p>
<p>Baseline biomarkers were lower in patients who survived vs those who died. Clinical characteristics differed between survivors and nonsurvivors. Patients who died were older (median age 67 [CI, 43–75] in nonsurvivors vs 53 [39–63] in survivors, <italic>P</italic> = .005), were more severely ill (APACHE II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607111433054">15</xref></sup> 29.5 [24.3–33.8] in nonsurvivors vs 26.0 [22.0–31.0] in survivors, <italic>P</italic> = .017), had more shock at baseline (55% of nonsurvivors vs 34% of survivors, <italic>P</italic> = .019), and had a higher minute ventilation at baseline (10.2 L/min [8.2–11.0] in nonsurvivors vs 8.2 L/min [6.9–11.1] in survivors, <italic>P</italic> = .043). There were no differences in body mass index or baseline bilirubin, platelets, or creatinine. To determine the clinical relevance of the biomarkers measured, we first examined the association between biomarkers and clinical outcomes. Overall, median baseline coagulation and inflammation biomarkers were higher in patients who died compared to those who survived by 28 days. IL-6 (106.8 [CI, 29.4–391.2] vs 34.6 [13.9–90.7], <italic>P</italic> = .001), IL-8 (43.3 [21.6–167.4] vs 14.6 [8.7–30.3], <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and TNF-α (12.1 [9.3–23.9] vs 8.9 [6.2–14.1], <italic>P</italic> = .005) were statistically significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared to survivors, whereas there were no statistically significant differences in IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-12, IL-1β, TF, or PAI-1. Patients in the lowest quartile of plasma IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels had mortality rates of 8.7%, 2.1%, and 12.8%, respectively, compared to patients in the highest quartiles with mortality rates of 37.0%, 45.7%, and 30.4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111433054">Figure 1</xref>). Baseline levels of the coagulation and fibrinolysis markers TF and PAI-1 were also associated with mortality in a dose-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0148607111433054">Figure 2</xref>). Patients in the lowest quartile of plasma TF and PAI-1 levels had mortality rates of 10.9% and 13.0%, respectively, compared to patients in the highest quartiles with mortality rates of 23.9% and 28.3%, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .049 for TF; <italic>P</italic> = .147 for PAI-1). In both treatment groups, nonsurvivors had higher levels of both TF and PAI-1 at day 6 compared to survivors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607111433054">Table 1</xref>), although this difference was only statistically significant in TF levels in the trophic EN group. In models adjusted for age, APACHE II, and presence of shock at admission, IL-6, IL-8, and TF were independently associated with mortality (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607111433054">Table 2</xref>). In addition to mortality, lower baseline levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α were also associated with more ventilator-free days, ICU-free days (except for TNF-α), hospital-free days, shock-free days, hepatic failure–free days, renal failure–free days, and hematologic failure–free days (data not shown). Day 6 levels of IL-6 were lower in patients who survived compared to those who died (<italic>P</italic> = .003). TF levels at day 6 were also associated with mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0148607111433054">Figure 3</xref>), and patients who died had increasing TF levels between day 0 and day 6 (median increase of 39.7) compared to decreasing TF levels in patients who lived (median decrease of 95.0, <italic>P</italic> = .033).</p>

<title>Feeding Formulas and Glucose Control</title>
<p>The EN formulation was chosen at the discretion of the treating physicians and was not specified in the study protocol. In total, 147 of the 200 patients (73.5%) received a formula that had 1.2 kcal/cc, whereas 48 of the remaining 53 received a formula that had 2 kcal/cc, 3 received a formula that contained 1.0 kcal/cc, 1 received an unknown formula, and 1 did not receive EN. The main reason for use of the higher calorie formula was to minimize fluid intake in patients with renal failure. Overall, 38% of the patients received Osmolite, 17% received Isosource, 16% received Diabeta source, 14% received Novasource™ renal, and the remainder of the patients received other EN. The types of EN did not differ between the treatment groups, and the EN formulations by calories per milliliter were similar between groups (<italic>P</italic> = .66). A tight glucose control strategy was used for all patients who had 2 glucose readings above 200 mg/dL. There were no differences in baseline glucose levels between trophic and full-calorie groups (median [95% CI], 134 [107–168] vs 131 [101–182] mg/dL, respectively, <italic>P</italic> = .772). Day 6 glucose levels were also similar between the 2 treatment groups (109 [85–144] vs 116 [90–179] mg/dL, respectively, <italic>P</italic> = .514). Day 6 glucose levels were associated with mortality, with patients who lived having lower blood glucose levels compared to those who died (108 [85–132] vs 145 [105–170] mg/dL, <italic>P</italic> = .004). There was no association between either baseline or day 6 blood glucose level and biomarker levels (data not shown).</p>

<title>Comparison of Biomarkers Between Enteral Feeding Treatment Groups</title>
<p>There were no differences in median biomarker levels measured at baseline or day 6 when comparing the trophic group to the full-energy EN group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607111433054">Table 3</xref>). However, trophic EN was associated with modest changes over time in coagulation and inflammation biomarkers. Among the cytokines, circulating levels of IL-12, IL-1β, and IL-6 dropped significantly by day 6 compared to day 0 in patients receiving trophic EN (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148607111433054">Table 4</xref>), whereas only IL-6 decreased in the full-energy group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0148607111433054">Figure 4</xref>). The trophic EN strategy was associated with a reduction in plasma TF levels between days 0 and 6, whereas TF levels rose slightly in the full-energy group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0148607111433054">Figure 5</xref>). A similar pattern was observed for PAI-1 levels, and overall, PAI-1 levels fell in 58.8% of patients in the trophic EN group compared to 39.6% of patients in the full feeding group, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = .056).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite expert recommendations advocating <italic>early</italic> initiation of enteral feeding because of its association with improved clinical outcomes, the optimal amount of feeding for intubated ICU patients with acute respiratory failure is unknown. Furthermore, the mechanism(s) by which a particular feeding strategy might improve clinical outcomes remains uncertain. Therefore, we measured the effects of the amount of EN on markers of inflammation and coagulation in a randomized, controlled single-center study of early trophic vs early full-energy enteral feeds in critically ill mechanically ventilated ICU patients with acute respiratory failure. The 2 enteral feeding strategies resulted in similar clinical outcomes, including ventilator-free days, hospital-free days, organ failure–free days, and hospital survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111433054">14</xref></sup> Our current study defines the effects of these 2 different feeding strategies on systemic markers of inflammation and coagulation. Our patient population was critically ill, with a median APACHE II score of 26.5 and a mortality rate of 20%, slightly lower than what has been reported in a large prospective cohort study of patients with acute respiratory failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111433054">1</xref></sup> Furthermore, the cytokine profiles in patients who lived vs those who died are consistent with published data showing higher levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α in patients who died vs those who survived.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607111433054">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111433054">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607111433054">16</xref></sup> Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines not only are markers of disease but are also thought to be pathogenic. In fact, the ARDS Network lower tidal volume ventilation study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607111433054">17</xref></sup> showed that lower tidal volume ventilation not only improves mortality in patients with ALI but also attenuates markers of inflammation by day 3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111433054">2</xref></sup> Given the lack of current therapies and the unacceptably high mortality rate for patients with acute respiratory failure, interventions in the ICU that modulate inflammation might be beneficial.</p>
<p>In our study, TF was an important predictor of mortality. Elevated levels of both baseline and day 6 TF levels were associated with increased mortality, as was the change in TF levels between day 0 and day 6. TF is the most potent initiator of the extrinsic coagulation cascade and is elevated in cancer-associated thrombosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607111433054">18</xref></sup> cardiovascular disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607111433054">19</xref></sup> obesity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607111433054">20</xref></sup> and sepsis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111433054">21</xref></sup> In addition, TF levels are elevated in patients with ARDS compared to those at risk for ARDS who did not develop disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607111433054">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607111433054">23</xref></sup> However, no previous studies have shown a relationship between TF levels and outcome in patients with acute respiratory failure. TF upregulation and activation of coagulation are central to the pathogenesis of sepsis and ARDS, and multiple animal models have shown beneficial effects of TF blockade in sepsis and multiorgan failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607111433054">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607111433054">25</xref></sup> Therefore, modulation of coagulation is an appealing therapeutic target in critically ill patients.</p>
<p>With regards to enteral feeding strategy, our data suggest that in a population of patients with acute respiratory failure, trophic enteral feeds may modulate inflammation and coagulation to a greater degree than do full-energy feeds. Although there were no statistically significant differences in markers of coagulation and inflammation between the 2 treatment groups at day 6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-8, and TF were nonsignificantly lower at day 6 in the trophic EN group compared to the full-energy EN group. Furthermore, in patients with paired day 0 and day 6 samples, all markers of coagulation and inflammation were nonsignificantly lower at day 6 compared to day 0 in the trophic group, whereas many of the markers of inflammation and both coagulation markers were higher at day 6 in the full-energy group. Finally, a larger percentage of patients in the trophic group had falling PAI-1 levels.</p>
<p>Why might enteral feeding modulate inflammation? Preclinical and clinical studies suggest links between nutrition and inflammation. It is well established that caloric restriction modulates both the innate and adaptive immune system by warding off immune senescence, maintaining naive T cells, and modifying the host response to infection or autoimmunity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607111433054">26</xref></sup> Interestingly, chronic caloric restriction also prolongs life in organisms, from fruit flies to humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607111433054">27</xref></sup> How these effects relate to critical illness are unknown. Although the data on enteral feeds in critically ill patients are limited, several studies have shown that inflammatory markers can be modulated by diet in ambulatory populations. Hermsdorff et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607111433054">28</xref></sup> placed obese individuals who were otherwise healthy on a hypocaloric diet and found that markers of inflammation, C-reactive protein, complement C3, and TNF-α were reduced compared to baseline after 8 weeks. Other studies have not shown any effect of diet or nutrition on markers of inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607111433054">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148607111433054">30</xref></sup> In addition, there are genetic links between metabolism and inflammation. A polymorphism of the IL-6 gene promoter is associated with higher levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, as body fat increases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148607111433054">31</xref></sup> suggesting an interplay between metabolism and response to inflammation.</p>
<p>Our study shows that TF levels increased slightly on average in the full-energy group, whereas levels decreased in patients on trophic tube feeds. It is worth noting that only half of the patients had a day 6 sample and thus were included in the day 6 analysis, so the study was underpowered to detect a difference in day 6 TF levels. The current findings suggest that volume of EN may have some modest effects on circulating TF levels in critically ill patients. Although several studies have demonstrated the effects of nutrition and antioxidants on circulating markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis, none have examined these in an ICU population or where patients receive continuous enteral feedings. In healthy adults who consume a 40% fat meal, there is a 56.2% increase in circulating TF levels 3.5 hours after the meal, and levels are still 34% above baseline at 6 hours without a change in tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607111433054">32</xref></sup> One study in diabetic patients showed a transient increase in postprandial TFPI at 4 hours that decreased to baseline by 8 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0148607111433054">33</xref></sup> This study did not measure TF levels, so the effect of this transient increase of TFPI on TF procoagulant activity in this population is unknown. Plasma levels of PAI-1 are increased after starch and fat meals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148607111433054">34</xref></sup> and after an oral fat load in patients with coronary artery disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0148607111433054">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>EN may modulate inflammation and coagulation by several potential mechanisms. Changes in gut flora are associated with septic complications and death in critically ill patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0148607111433054">36</xref></sup> Enteral feeding can modulate the microbial flora of the intestinal tract.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0148607111433054">37</xref></sup> In addition to changes in gut flora, critical illness and sepsis are associated with changes in intestinal barrier function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0148607111433054">38</xref></sup> EN has been shown in several experimental models and some human studies to promote the maintenance of intestinal barrier function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0148607111433054">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0148607111433054"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0148607111433054"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0148607111433054">42</xref></sup> Furthermore, changes in intestinal immune function are deranged in critical illness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0148607111433054">43</xref></sup> and EN can restore gut immunity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0148607111433054">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0148607111433054">45</xref></sup> Although EN may modulate inflammation by several potential mechanisms, less is known about the effects of volume of tube feeds on these pathways. Overfeeding in critical illness can cause hyperglycemia and alter oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production, and underfeeding has been linked with an increased risk of ICU complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0148607111433054">46</xref></sup> Our study attempts to address some unanswered questions by studying the effects of different feeding strategies on inflammation and coagulation in critically ill patients.</p>
<p>Our study has some limitations. First, it is a single-center study of a deliberately heterogeneous patient population who may have very different inflammation and coagulation profiles depending on their reason for developing acute respiratory failure. This could have biased us toward the null hypothesis and caused us to overlook an important effect of EN on systemic inflammation and coagulation in important subgroups of patients. Second, we collected plasma samples only from patients who were still receiving enteral feeds or were still in the ICU on day 6. By day 6, half of the patients had either died or been extubated and not available to provide specimens, although these numbers were similar between the 2 groups. Without blood samples from these patients, it is impossible to know what effects the enteral feeding strategy had on inflammation and coagulation on patients who were extubated or died prior to day 6. Future studies should either look at earlier time points or measure biomarkers even in patients who were extubated by day 6.</p>
<p>In summary, we have shown that trophic EN may have some modest effects on markers of inflammation and coagulation in a more favorable way compared to full-energy EN. A number of these cytokines and markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis were associated with mortality in this and other studies in critical illness. Although the randomized clinical trial did not show a benefit to either strategy in ventilator-free days, the primary end point, patients who received full-energy EN were more likely to be discharged home with or without help vs to a rehabilitation facility (68.3% for the full-energy group vs 51.3% for the trophic group, <italic>P</italic> = .04).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111433054">14</xref></sup> Our findings of modestly attenuated coagulation and inflammation suggest a potential protective role for trophic EN compared to full-energy EN in the acute setting that may or may not translate into long-term clinical outcomes. Thus, the effects of enteral feeding strategy on systemic inflammation and coagulation may result in small changes in clinical outcomes in larger studies with more power or specific subgroups of critically ill patients. Future studies in the modulation of inflammation and coagulation using enteral feeds should be conducted to identify the specific patient population, proper timing, and duration of intervention to maximally modulate systemic inflammation and coagulation.</p>
