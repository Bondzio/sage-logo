<body>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a safe, very effective and protective immunomodulatory drug used in autoimmune connective tissue disorders and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), but not widely prescribed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313490239">1</xref></sup> Two retrospective studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313490239">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313490239">3</xref></sup> have shown that combined treatment with HCQ and prednisone may be effective in secondary ITP associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or antinuclear antibodies (ANA). The authors suggested that HCQ should be systematically considered in ITP associated with SLE, but there have been no subsequent studies confirming this statement. On the other hand, some authors consider that the results of splenectomy in lupus patients differ from those of patients with primary ITP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313490239">4</xref></sup> Splenectomy is still commonly used for patients with ITP who do not have long-term response after the first-line treatment, including oral or intravenous corticosteroids, immunoglobulin, or rituximab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313490239">5</xref></sup> Although it has been proposed as gold standard therapy, it is an invasive procedure with some patients relapsing, even after several years.</p>
<p>A 43-year-old lady with severe ITP attended our unit due to menstrual bleeding with 15,000 platelets/uL. She had been diagnosed with ITP and remained stable under 50,000 platelets/uL for 10 years. However, she began suffering from complicated refractory severe thrombocytopenia (&lt;20 000 platelets/uL and bleeding) 2 years before the admission. She had received therapy with cyclic pulses of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids, without sustained remission, and splenectomy was offered. Re-evaluated, the patient had asthenia, Raynaud’s phenomena, oral aphthae, urticaria, malar rash, photosensitivity, chronic polyartrhitis, leukopenia, repeatedly moderate titers of ANA, and mild hypocomplementemia (C3). She also had a history of autoimmune thyroid disease without current treatment. She was diagnosed with SLE. HCQ plus prednisone was started at a daily dose of 400 mg and 5 mg respectively, followed by a rise of platelets up to 100,000/uL in the first 15 days. One month later, prednisone was stopped and HCQ reduced to 300 mg daily. Follow-up during the next 2 years revealed a regular platelet count &gt;130,000/uL and HCQ was discontinued. After 2 months, she suffered again with bleeding and platelets fell to &lt;70,000/uL. HCQ alone was reinitiated and the platelet count recovered quickly. Over the next 5 years, under this therapy alone she demonstrated a sustained response, without new episodes of bleeding and with a platelet count &gt;160,000/uL.</p>
<p>A case of severe refractory ITP associated with SLE has been described. Combined treatment with HCQ and steroids induced a quick response, followed by a sustained remission with HCQ alone. Therefore, HCQ alone may be a useful alternative in the maintenance treatment of refractory ITP, preventing splenectomy. Although ITP is variable and spontaneous remissions are not uncommon, the good response in this case seems to be the result of HCQ therapy, since HCQ withdrawal was followed by recurrence and HCQ alone restored the platelet count. From this perspective, I hypothesize that HCQ may even be used as first-line therapy, but more case series are needed to support this suggestion. Finally, since secondary ITP may benefit from other approaches, underlying SLE or associated autoimmune disease should always be investigated in ITP.</p>
