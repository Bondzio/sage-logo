<p>The book is divided into six parts, namely, Macro Perspective; Merchandize and Services Trade; Regional Connectivity and Trade Facilitation; Development Issues; Drivers of Regional Cooperation; and Climate Change and Regional Cooperation. These areas are the diversified dimensions of South Asian nations, which through the book intend to diagnose the inherent problems and offer modalities for policy interventions at the domestic and regional level.</p>
<p>The editors provide historical perspectives of economic integration in South Asia. They state that inadequate and unsatisfactory achievements from the regional agreement are complicated when country-specific additional areas of regional priorities emerge in the agenda without concrete strategy. With regard to the existing dilemma, the editors recommend the examination of the current shortcomings and future challenges to develop appropriate policy interventions at the regional level.</p>
<p>Chapter 2, entitled ‘Changing Face: The Trials and Fortunes of Regional Cooperation in South Asia’, is by Saman Kelegama, an editor of the book. He reinforces the market potential in intra-regional cooperation and reiterates the need for intra-regional infrastructure development projects, the establishment of a Common Investment Area and the sharing of resources to increase regional competitiveness. This strengthens the idea of comparative advantage if an effort is made to make each of the SAARC member a regional hub of identified sectors, where each of the nations has comparative advantage. For instance, Nepal can be made the regional hub for hydro power, Bangladesh can be thought of as the regional hub for natural gas and India as the regional hub for automobiles.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 is on the ‘Pruning of India’s Sensitive Lists under SAFTA’, by Nisha Taneja, Saon Ray, Neetika Kaushal and Devjit Roy Chowdhury. The authors inform the reader that the provision for reducing the number of items in the sensitive list every four years is voluntary, not mandatory. This has created problems. Some economists point out that 53 per cent of the total intra-regional import trade was excluded from the tariff liberalization programme, and countries like India has restricted up to 52 per cent (by value) of its total imports from SAFTA members under the sensitive list category. The chapter offers an approach and economic rationale to policy-makers for pruning these lists.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 is entitled ‘Non-tariff Barriers in South Asia: Nature, Implications and Measures to Address the Challenges’ by Mustafizur Rahman. The author observes that despite the fact that non-tariff barriers (NTBs) removal is acknowledged as essential for stimulating trade by SAARC member countries, exporters in the region complain about their difficulties when doing business. The chapter recommends that SAARC member countries should apply their collective wisdom for addressing the issues under NTBs, since it not only constrains regional trade expansion but also add tensions to bilateral relations.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, by Rajan Sudesh Ratna, entitled ‘Services Trade in South Asia: Contours of Liberalization and Modalities in SAFTA’, observes that in regional trade agreements (RTAs), services sector has now become a key product for building a long-term development plan. The chapter states that the World Bank, in 2005, estimated the trade moving through RTAs to be around 40 per cent of total world trade. Although there is a constraint to services trade due to domestic regulatory environments, it was easier to export services of the professionals to other countries, compared to importing from other countries. Besides identifying the importance of services, the chapter also offers the summary of an ADB/UNCTAD study conducted in 2008, which quantifies the benefits of economic cooperation, especially with regard to services trade.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, titled ‘Air Services Liberalization in South Asia’, by Anushka Wijesinha, opines that transport connectivity is key to increasing the exchange of goods and people-to-people connections, which would ultimately stimulate investments and business transactions. The link between air connectivity and increases in labour productivity, link between liberalization and increased air services with increased civil aviation employment, link between the removal of air services restrictions and the opening up of new markets for international businesses, and the reference to a gravity model to show the relationship between tourism and development of air services are useful contributions to be gained from this chapter.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 is devoted to ‘Improving Transport Connectivity in South Asia’, by M. Rahmatullah. This chapter, while explaining the surface transport network, also suggests that logistics costs in South Asia range between 13 and 14 per cent of the commodity value, compared to 8 per cent in the US. North-east India, Nepal and Bhutan may have an advantage as soon as the priority projects identified by Bangladesh are complete, which cover the broader areas of connectivity, such as water sharing, removal of non-tariff barriers, and resolving maritime boundary and land boundary demarcations.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 is on ‘Role of Government Regulations in Trade Facilitation: Case of Nepal’ by Pushpa Raj Rajkarnikar. Trade facilitation, says Rajkarnikar, is trade reform. The aim is to reduce transaction costs to enhance competitiveness. The strength of trade facilitation is that it reduces uncertainties by making trade transaction predictable. The chapter not only elaborates trade transaction procedures but also recommends policies to improve trade procedures.</p>
<p>Chapter 9, titled ‘The Financial Crisis in the Gulf and Its Impact on South Asian Migration and Remittances’, is authored by S. Irudaya Rajan and D. Narayana. This chapter investigates the impact of the financial crisis in the Gulf, and its impact on South Asian economies. Key issues raised in the study include the impact on the demand for South Asian migrant workers; emigrant’s strategies to cope with the situation at their place of work; and its impact on the home country. The chapter clearly exhibits the link between economic growth and labour flow.</p>
<p>Chapter 10, ‘LDC Integration Fund in South Asia’, by one of the editors of the book, Ratnakar Adhikari, is of the view that there are asymmetric benefits from any regional cooperation arrangement because of the scale of economy, economic structures and policy-intervention mechanisms. The strength of the chapter lies in its identification of reasons for such anomalies. As hypothesized in this chapter, it is noted that LDCs have been marginalized from the regional trade mainstream, largely due to supply-side constraints. The author thereon elaborates the rationale for the establishment of a relatively large-sized LDC Integration Fund.</p>
<p>Chapter 11, ‘Roles of Peoples’ Representatives and Non-state Actors in Strengthening Regional Cooperation’, is authored by former Secretary-General of SAARC, Nihal Rodrigo. It assumes that, although many of the scepticism, sarcasm and cynicism about SAARC holds true, it is indispensable for the region, and therefore, its stated goals should be pursued with greater dedication, political commitment and coordinated action. Of late, SAARC has given recognition to professional and other associations with region-wide membership. Such associations have been demonstrated as a means to fruitful economic, professional, cultural and other regional interactions and cooperation. Except for business organizations, SAARC has formally accorded recognition to many associations, including the Foundation of SAARC Writers and Literature.</p>
<p>Chapter 12 is entitled ‘Private Sector in South Asia: Stumbling Blocks or Building Blocks to Regional Cooperation?’ The author of this section, Anura Ekanayake, asserts that the case for strengthened intra-regional trade in South Asia has become even stronger than in the past. The author’s message is to start with immediate neighbours and then move further eastwards. The costs of trade liberalization are immediate, but the benefits are accrued over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>In Chapter 13, ‘Trade and Climate Change: South Asian Agenda at the UNFCCC and the WTO’, Nitya Nanda states that there has been an understanding among SAARC leaders for climate resilience that would promote both development and poverty eradication in a sustainable manner. The Thimpu Statement on climate change intends to make South Asia a world leader in low-carbon technologies and renewable energy.</p>
<p>Chapter 14 on ‘WTO Negotiations on Environmental Goods and Services: South Asia’s Interests’ is contributed by Fahamida Khatun. The author observes that trade and environmental policies need to be formulated in a manner which can ensure sustainable economic growth. Keeping in mind the state of the economies of four LDCs, namely, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal, the author suggests that growth without domestic innovation, and capacity building through free trade, would not be environmentally and economically sustainable for the LDCs in the long run.</p>
<p>Compiling and harmonizing the scattered papers of the conference is not a simple task which becomes more challenging when the editors have to maintain the flow and guarantee the quality of standard editing norms. From this perspective, the book has been a readable and handy document. The minor edits such as the clubbing in Chapter 6, in Part 2, and replacing the word development issues with financial issues in part four, could have added more value with regard to selecting chapters and putting them under the relevant section.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the review on SAARC initiatives shows that some are of the view that the constellation of geographical, ethnic, historical and political factors has held the organization in gridlock. This is the reason why SAARC has failed to fulfil the expectations of member countries. Some observe that SAARC has been relegated as an organization of little value, both within and outside the region. The reason for failure according to Prof. Samuel Huntington in his book <italic>The Clash of Civilizations</italic>is cultural diversity, unlike the EU where members belong to similar culture.</p>
<p>India possesses 76 per cent of the total region, 77 per cent of the total population and 71 per cent of the GDP. As a result, some seriously consider India’s vastness as a constraint, because it has been translated into an acute sense of insecurity in the neighbouring member countries. India, on the other hand, has viewed it as a sort of joint conspiracy hatched by all other countries of the region to use SAARC as a joint platform to pressurize India in the question of several bilateral issues.</p>
<p>I strongly feel that this book is the answer to all such allegations. The strength of this book is that it encompasses diversified issues facing South Asian nations. The issues raised in the book offers alternative policy interventions at the regional and domestic level. These issues include sharing of resources for increasing regional competitiveness; non-tariff barriers; services trade; air services liberalization; transport connectivity; government regulations; financial crisis in the Gulf and its impact on South Asia; LDC Integration Fund; role of people’s representations and non-state actors strengthening regional cooperation; private sector in South Asia; trade and climate change; and WTO negotiations on environmental goods and services. Therefore, the book will be able to help SAARC present itself as a viable and effective regional organization in the future.</p>
