<p>The Plan Puebla Panamá (PPP) is a development program for the modernization of southern Mexico and Central America through the construction of transnational urban networks. The implementation of the PPP in Chiapas provides a significant example of the relationship between depoliticization and planned urbanization in the context of contemporary neoliberal governance. The production of space embodied in the PPP advances the consolidation of capitalist social relations and the extension of state power while representing this process as a pragmatic response to economic necessity in the interest of the common good. This project, however, is undermined by the constitutive antagonisms of neoliberal urbanization, as demonstrated by multiple place-based resistances and the ongoing development of the Zapatista autonomous territories.</p>

<p>Urbanization is generally equated with the growth and transformation of cities, but, in the words of Karl Marx, “The modern age is the urbanization of the countryside” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0094582X12470378">1973</xref>: 479). Marx himself did not elaborate on this point, but Henri Lefebvre later built on his suggestion. According to Lefebvre, the survival of capitalism has become increasingly dependent on the expansion of an “urban fabric” through which the rural/urban dichotomy has been subsumed by a “fusion of urban society with the countryside” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0094582X12470378">Lefebvre, 1996</xref>: 120). In Lefebvre’s words, “The urban fabric grows, extends its borders, corrodes the residue of agrarian life,” replacing it with “large-scale urban projects, new towns . . . roads and highways” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X12470378">Lefebvre, 2003a</xref>: 3, 79). This process extends capitalist social relations and the territorial power of the state while generating increasingly polarized and multiscalar relations of domination and inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X12470378">Lefebvre, 1976</xref>: 17–18). The production of space embodied in this process functions not only to guarantee state power and the expanded reproduction of capital but also to depoliticize this project through appeal to the commonsense understanding of space as an apolitical container of social processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X12470378">Lefebvre, 1991</xref>: 393; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0094582X12470378">2009</xref>: 192).</p>
<p>This paper explores this intertwined process of urbanization and depoliticization in the case of Chiapas, Mexico. On September 14, 2009, Juan Sabines Guerrero, the governor of Chiapas from 2006 to 2012, delivered a speech to the Mexican Congress to celebrate the 185th anniversary of the state’s annexation from Guatemala. As the 2010 centenary of the Mexican Revolution loomed on the horizon, the speech provided an opportunity to emphasize Mexico’s social harmony and territorial integrity. Chiapas is of particular significance in this regard because of its belated accession, its poverty and marginality, and the continued presence in the state of the Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (EZLN). Sabines accordingly used his speech to affirm the political stability of Chiapas and the patriotism of its citizens. According to Sabines, Chiapas was a beacon of “democracy and peace,” populated by “a proudly Mexican people, professing faith and love for the nation,” and his administration was characterized by its “solidarity . . . with the indigenous population” and its determination to “eradicate poverty, not with magic formulas, but following the recommendations of the experts.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094582X12470378">1</xref></sup> These sentiments typify the discourse of the Sabines administration, which has emphasized consensus and unity, denied the existence of substantive contradictions, and rejected political ideologies and party banners in favor of pragmatic policy making based on “expert” advice. This discourse embodies the modality of depoliticization that Slavoj Žižek and others have conceptualized as “post-politics,” in which “the conflict of global ideological visions . . . is replaced by the collaboration of enlightened technocrats . . . in the guise of a more or less universal consensus” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0094582X12470378">Žižek, 1999</xref>: 236).</p>
<p>Within the Sabines administration, this postpolitical consensus has legitimated a rapid expansion of the urban fabric. In his speech to the Mexican Congress, Sabines presented an ambitious development program, including the construction of infrastructure networks, agro-industrial clusters, tourist resorts, and new towns, which together constituted a comprehensive strategy for the urbanization of the countryside. Though Sabines did not mention it, these projects were all part of an earlier development strategy, the Plan Puebla Panamá (PPP), which had been officially abandoned in 2008 in response to widespread resistance from peasant and indigenous social movements in the region. Based on field research conducted in Chiapas between 2008 and 2010 and drawing on the literature on postpolitics, this paper interprets the continued implementation of the PPP in Chiapas as a significant example of the relationship between depoliticization and the urbanization of the countryside. The paper begins by sketching the outlines of this relationship in the case of the PPP and exploring the postpolitical character of the Sabines administration. The remainder of the paper focuses on the implementation of key elements of the PPP in Chiapas—infrastructure networks, economic corridors, and the Rural Cities project. Despite their distinctly neoliberal orientation, these projects of rural urbanization are promoted through a depoliticized discourse that represents them as a pragmatic response to economic necessity and social need and is underpinned by an appeal to the commonsense naturalization of social space as politically neutral. The substantive contradictions of these projects are revealed through their impact on the Zapatista autonomous territories and through the fragmented resistances of those excluded from the postpolitical consensus of the Sabines administration.</p>
<sec id="section1-0094582X12470378">
<title>The Postpolitical Modality of Depoliticization</title>
<p>Neoliberal governance is increasingly dominated by techno-managerial structures and consensus-based decision making and claims to have transcended the ideological divisions of the cold war era. An emergent literature across the social sciences has characterized this tendency as “postpolitics” or “the postpolitical.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094582X12470378">2</xref></sup> Strategies of depoliticization have of course always been central to the construction and maintenance of capitalist hegemony, and contestation and resistance continue to undermine such strategies today. The concept of the postpolitical, then, does not suggest that we actually live in a historically unprecedented “postideological” era. Instead, it denotes a specific modality of depoliticization that operates <italic>as if this were the case</italic> even as it facilitates processes of neoliberalization that intensify the material contradictions of global capitalism. The fact that postpolitics is a strategy as opposed to an achieved reality should not, however, blind us to its very real political effects. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0094582X12470378">Jacques Ranciére (2004</xref>: 4) argues, the absence of an alternative to global capitalism in the post–cold war era, combined with the hegemony of free-market economics and the proliferation of technocratic governance, has indeed threatened a “liquidation” of politics, to the extent that the nominally democratic institutions of the liberal state are increasingly reduced to a set of techno-managerial mechanisms committed to “the administration of economic necessity.”</p>
<p>In this context, Ranciére concludes, the properly political moment of “dissensus”—in which the antagonistic relations of capitalist society are revealed and contested—is effectively excluded from the arena of legitimate political engagement. Despite presenting itself as “the erasure of conflicts for the benefit of common interests,” postpolitics thus implies “erasing the contestatory, conflictual nature of the very givens of common life. It reduces political difference to police-like homogeneity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0094582X12470378">Ranciére, 2004</xref>: 7). However, as with previous utopias of depoliticization, the postpolitical condition is ultimately unrealizable as a consequence of the substantive contradictions of inequality, marginalization, dispossession, and exploitation that characterize the social relations of global capitalism. For Ranciére, the “essence of politics” in the current conjuncture is therefore contained in the moments in which those excluded from the postpolitical consensus assert forms of difference and collective identity that disturb the postpolitical arrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0094582X12470378">Ranciére, 2001</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>The postpolitical modality of depoliticization is evident in the formulation of the Plan Puebla Panamá, which was designed to foreclose the space of dissensus that had been opened by the Zapatista uprising of 1994. The uprising was motivated by the neoliberal reforms implemented by Carlos Salinas de Gortari as president of Mexico (1988–1994), including the abolition of land reform and the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which exacerbated the marginalization and impoverishment of the nation’s peasant and indigenous population. The stark social contradictions of this project had been depoliticized through a technocratic discourse that emphasized the need for national unity in response to conditions of economic necessity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0094582X12470378">Hilbert, 1997</xref>). The Zapatistas challenged this discourse by demonstrating the radical nonconformity of the indigenous peoples that it silenced and presumed to speak for. As “the ones making visible the fact that they belong to a shared world the other does not see” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0094582X12470378">Ranciére, 2001</xref>: 14), the Zapatista uprising embodied Ranciére’s understanding of an authentically political moment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0094582X12470378">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Over the following years, the state responded with a range of counterinsurgency strategies, including military violence, development projects, the negotiation of peace treaties, and, it is alleged, complicity with paramilitary organizations. In this context, however, the Zapatistas succeeded in consolidating the autonomous territories obtained in the 1994 truce agreement, in which they installed their own administrative systems, rejecting any inclusion in state mechanisms and constructing an autonomous network of schools, clinics, and production cooperatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X12470378">Garcia de León, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0094582X12470378">Stahler-Sholk, 2007</xref>). In this sense, despite having been forced to abandon their ambitions for national revolution, the Zapatistas again challenged the depoliticizing project of the Mexican state through the construction of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12470378">Alain Badiou (2010</xref>: 13) describes as “politics at a distance from the State,” characterized by “an obligatory refusal of any direct inclusion in the State, of any request for funding from the State, of any participation in elections, etc.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0094582X12470378">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0094582X12470378">Žižek (2004</xref>: 310) has pointed out, an ironic consequence of the Zapatista movement is that it motivated a democratization of the Mexican state that arguably functioned to consolidate its depoliticization. In ending the 71-year rule of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (Institutional Revolutionary Party—PRI), the election of Vicente Fox Quesada of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional (National Action Party—PAN) in 2000 served to facilitate and legitimate the ongoing process of neoliberalization. While the PRI had remained in power, the neoliberal project had been rendered contingent by a tension within the party between neoliberals and those still clinging to the prior state form of corporatist authoritarianism. The PAN, for its part, was fully committed to “orthodox” economic policies, and its arrival in power guaranteed the continued hegemony of neoliberal governance while providing it with a veneer of democratic legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0094582X12470378">Morton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0094582X12470378">Rodríguez, 2010</xref>). It also adopted a new strategy toward the Zapatistas, replacing the previous administration’s attempts to crush the movement with a more consensual approach based on regional development, the partial demilitarization of Chiapas, a promise to ratify the San Andrés Accords guaranteeing indigenous autonomy, and a denial of substantive contradictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X12470378">Harvey, 2001</xref>: 1048; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0094582X12470378">Washbrook, 2007</xref>: 4). The following section identifies the Plan Puebla Panamá as a central component of this postpolitical strategy.</p>

<title>Depoliticization and The Production of Space</title>
<p>Depoliticization and the production of space have always been intertwined in the political economy of Mexico. The ideology of <italic>indígenismo</italic> and the spatial form of the ejido were closely connected, for example, and were integral to the hegemony of the postrevolutionary state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X12470378">Craib, 2004</xref>). Similarly, the discourse of “social liberalism” functioned in conjunction with the public works programs of Solidaridad to legitimate the rapid neoliberalization of the Salinas administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12470378">Aubry, 2003</xref>). The Plan Puebla Panamá (PPP) combined with the postpolitical discourse of the Fox administration to constitute a particularly ambitious form of this intertwined practice. The PPP was launched by Fox in 2001 in collaboration with the Inter-American Development Bank and seven Central American states and aimed to fully incorporate southern Mexico and Central America into the global economy through the urbanization of the countryside.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0094582X12470378">5</xref></sup> This strategy was built around the creation of a network of transnational energy, transportation, and communications infrastructures, combined with the construction of new urban centers and a structural shift in economic activity from peasant agriculture to agro-industrial plantations, maquiladoras, and high-end tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0094582X12470378">Presidencia de la República, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>For the Fox administration, the PPP was not only an economic strategy but also the “logical corollary” of peace in Chiapas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0094582X12470378">6</xref></sup> When questioned about the EZLN at the time of its launch, Fox responded, “There is no longer any conflict. We are in holy peace (<italic>santa paz</italic>)” (quoted in <italic>La Jornada</italic>, June 15, 2001). The PPP therefore constituted a key element of the Fox administration’s postpolitical engagement with the EZLN, based not on the destruction of the movement, which previous administrations had failed to achieve, but on the denial of its continued significance and the assertion that its demands were being attended to. The utility of the PPP in this regard was due to the peculiar facility with which the production of space can be promoted as a depoliticized response to economic necessity in the interest of the common good. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X12470378">Lefebvre (1991</xref>: 375) argues, our commonsense understanding of space as void, backdrop, or container disguises the extent to which space has become an instrumental medium through which social relations are produced, reproduced, and transformed. Space is therefore both apolitical in appearance and supremely functional for the accumulation of capital and the territorialization of the state:
<disp-quote>
<p>The production of space is carried out with the state’s intervention, and the state naturally acts in accordance with the aims of capital, yet this production seems to answer solely to the rational requirements of communication between the various parts of society, as to those of a growth consistent with the interests of all “users.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This helps to explain the appeal of the PPP within the broader postpolitical strategy of the Fox administration. The PPP would extend the space of state and capital while allowing this process to be represented as a response to the demands of the EZLN in the interest of the common good. However, like Ranciére, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X12470378">Lefebvre (1976</xref>: 90) insists that such totalizing projects are necessarily limited by the fact that “the ‘real’ cannot be enclosed.” From its inception, the PPP was rejected by the Zapatistas and met with resistance from a network of social movements across southern Mexico and Central America, who interpreted it as a neocolonial strategy for the exploitation of the region’s natural resources and the destruction of its indigenous cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X12470378">Foro Mesoamericano, 2002</xref>). In April 2001, following the Mexican government’s failure to ratify the San Andrés Accords, the EZLN suspended all dialogue with the state and retreated to its autonomous territories. It reemerged in 2003 to announce the expansion of its territorial autonomy through the construction of the <italic>caracoles</italic> (five regional administrative centers within Zapatista territory), which constituted a scaling-up of the movement. Meanwhile, the network of social movements resisting the PPP was growing in strength and becoming increasingly organized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0094582X12470378">Wilson, 2009</xref>: 142–149). Confronted with such widespread opposition, the Mexican and Central American governments ceased to discuss the PPP in public, and in 2008 it was officially terminated and replaced by Proyecto Mesoamérica, which reduced the PPP’s original roster of 100 projects to 20 and had a much lower public profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X12470378">Comisión Ejecutiva del Plan Puebla Panamá, 2008</xref>). Despite appearances, however, the implementation of the PPP has continued in all but name. The remainder of this paper assesses the unfolding of this project in Chiapas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0094582X12470378">
<title>The New Phase of the Plan Puebla Panamá in Chiapas</title>
<p>Chiapas has been described as “the geographical center of the Puebla-Panamá region”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0094582X12470378">7</xref></sup> and the “greatest ally” of Proyecto Mesoamérica.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0094582X12470378">8</xref></sup> During the Fox administration (2000–2006) the governor of Chiapas, Pablo Salazar Mendiguchia, implemented a range of PPP projects, including the Ángel Albino Corzo airport outside the state capital Tuxtla Gutiérrez, the Chiapas Bridge over the Malpaso Reservoir, the completion of the Tuxtla Gutiérrez–San Cristóbal and Ocozocoautla–Las Choapas highways, the modernization of Port Chiapas and the Arriaga–Tapachula highway, the integration of Mexico into the Central American Electricity Interconnection System, and the construction of a fiber-optic system between Tuxtla Gutiérrez and Hidalgo City. Other PPP-related projects included the promotion of eucalyptus and African palm plantations, an increase in state support for tourism projects, and the opening of a maquiladora in San Cristóbal de las Casas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0094582X12470378">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>This expansion of the urban fabric has accelerated during the Sabines administration (2006–2012), in collaboration with Felipe Calderón Hinojosa of the PAN as Mexican president. It is perhaps surprising that Sabines, as a representative of the center-left Partido Revolucionario Democrática (Democratic Revolutionary Party—PRD), should be collaborating so closely with a right-wing president in the continued implementation of the PPP, particularly given the opposition that the PPP had initially faced from politicians and intellectuals of the Mexican left. Prior to becoming the PRD candidate for governor of Chiapas in 2006, however, Sabines had been a central figure in the highly conservative local branch of the PRI, representing the PRI as mayor of Tuxtla Gutiérrez before abandoning the post to compete unsuccessfully as the PRI candidate for governor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0094582X12470378">Wilson, 2008</xref>). The PRD presidential candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador then encouraged Sabines to run for the PRD in Chiapas in the hope that his personal reputation in the state would win support for López Obrador’s own campaign.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0094582X12470378">10</xref></sup> Once in power, Sabines dissociated himself from López Obrador and built a strong alliance with Calderón. As an ex-Priísta representing the PRD in close collaboration with the PAN, Sabines thus embodies the increasingly consensual acceptance of neoliberal norms across Mexico’s main political parties. From the outset, Sabines has emphasized the post-ideological character of his administration as “a government without a party” that “attends to everyone without regard for ideological, political, or party affiliations.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0094582X12470378">11</xref></sup> In this concerted attempt to establish what he describes as a “unique social and political climate, in which ideological affiliation is unimportant,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0094582X12470378">12</xref></sup> Sabines thus typifies the specifically postpolitical modality of depoliticization, which functions to eliminate the possibility of dissensus from the sphere of legitimate political engagement.</p>
<p>The political-economic program of the Sabines administration is entitled Chiapas Solidario, the very name of which emphasizes social consensus and the absence of substantive contradictions. In Sabines’s words, “It is possible to overcome poverty as long as we can count on everyone, as long as we all unite behind a single cause.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0094582X12470378">13</xref></sup> In contrast to this depoliticizing rhetoric, however, the Sabines administration is committed to an ambitious agenda of neoliberal urbanization, and Chiapas Solidario reproduces the policy prescriptions of the PPP without referring to it by name. This continued support for the PPP and Proyecto Mesoamérica is shared by the federal government and the Inter-American Development Bank, and policy documents for the region produced by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0094582X12470378">World Bank (2003)</xref>, the United Nations Development Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0094582X12470378">UNDP, 2006</xref>), and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0094582X12470378">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, 2006)</xref>, all include the majority of the projects contained in the PPP. The level of consensus permeating the multiscalar structures of global governance demonstrates both the increasing significance of the production of space within the neoliberal project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0094582X12470378">Wilson, 2011a</xref>) and the extent to which this project is orchestrated through technocratic networks insulated from political contestation. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0094582X12470378">Erik Swyngedouw (2008)</xref> observes, “The space of the political is increasingly colonized and saturated by the spaces of policies. . . . These glocal forms of governance, operative at a range of articulated spatial scales, are expressive of the postpolitical configuration.”</p>
<p>The following sections interpret the Sabines development program as the implementation of a new phase of the PPP in Chiapas, extending beyond the consolidation of infrastructure projects to include the development of productive projects and new towns also included in the original planning documents. Focusing on infrastructure networks, economic corridors, and the Rural Cities project, I argue that in each of these cases the production of space functions to deepen capitalist social relations and extend state power while facilitating its own depoliticization through the representation of such projects as apolitical responses to economic necessity in the interest of all sectors of society. This representation in turn rests on the commonsense understanding of space as a politically neutral container of social processes. In this sense, I suggest, the production of space can be seen both as materially functional for capital and state and as discursively instrumental to the postpolitical modality of depoliticization.</p>

<title>Infrastructure Networks</title>
<p>The expansion of transportation networks is fundamental to the urbanization of the countryside, functioning to deepen and extend capitalist social relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0094582X12470378">Harvey, 2010</xref>: 50) and allowing the state “to introduce its presence, control, and surveillance in the most isolated corners (which thus cease to be ‘corners’)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X12470378">Lefebvre, 2003b</xref>: 86). The construction and modernization of transportation and communications infrastructures is the central element of the PPP and Proyecto Mesoamérica, and Sabines has repeatedly emphasized the need to “integrate Chiapas with . . . the national transport arteries . . . and improve the roads that lead to the indigenous municipalities and the most marginalized regions.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0094582X12470378">14</xref></sup> Infrastructure projects announced by Sabines include the internationalization of the Ángel Albino Corzo and Palenque airports, the development of Port Chiapas, the modernization of the Arriaga–Tapachula and Villahermosa–Escarcega railway lines, and the construction and/or expansion of several highways (Tapachula–Ciudad Hidalgo/Talismán, Ocozocoautla–Arriaga, Ocozocoautla–Las Choapas, Ocozocoautla–Tuxtla, San Cristóbal–Palenque, Motozintla–Villaflores, and Villaflores–Ángel Albino Corzo.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0094582X12470378">15</xref></sup> The majority of these projects are included in the PPP, and together they contribute to an integrated logistics system of multimodal infrastructures connecting the main commercial route between Mexico and Central America with deep-water ports on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, international airports, and transport arteries to the U.S.A.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0094582X12470378">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>This system of large-scale transport infrastructures is complemented by a network of rural roads that function to extend the urban fabric to the most isolated indigenous communities of the region, including the construction of paved roads toward the Zapatista caracoles at Roberto Barrios, Morelia, La Garrucha, and La Realidad.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0094582X12470378">17</xref></sup> The Margaritas–San Quentín–Ocosingo road, for example, will pass through both La Realidad and La Garrucha. It is included in both the PPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0094582X12470378">Presidencia de la República, 2001</xref>: 164) and a more overtly political federal government strategy that calls for the modernization of a series of roads in “the Chiapas jungle and the Conflict Zone . . . with the aim of linking this network to the principal infrastructure of the Plan Puebla Panamá” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12470378">Comisión Especial del Sur Sureste, 2001</xref>: 4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0094582X12470378">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The infrastructure projects of the Sabines administration thus contribute to the continued implementation of the PPP, although all reference to it has been dropped from public discourse. These projects thus contain a clear political-economic logic both as a strategy for further exposing the region of Zapatista influence to military control and as a means of integrating Mesoamerica into transnational circuits of capital. Furthermore, while such projects have the depoliticized appearance of economic necessity typical of the production of space, the infrastructure networks of the PPP in fact function not only to expand and accelerate the circulation of capital but also to open previously isolated regions to the disciplinary forces of the world market. As the World Bank makes clear in a policy document for southern Mexico, “once located in highly accessible areas, firms are more exposed to competition and are thus forced to improve productivity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0094582X12470378">World Bank, 2003</xref>: 19). In the case of Chiapas, of course, “firms” predominantly denotes the peasantry, and exposure to global competition in the context of the termination of agricultural subsidies and the abolition of land reform implies an acceleration of the process theorized by Marx as primitive accumulation—the separation of the peasantry from the land that forms the basis of capitalist social relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0094582X12470378">Marx, 1977</xref>: 873–940).</p>
<p>In contrast to their underlying political-economic rationale, however, these infrastructure projects have been publicly legitimated through a postpolitical discourse that utilizes the apolitical appearance of social space. Speaking at the inauguration of one of the new highways, for example, Sabines appealed to the seemingly objective materiality of the highway itself as the embodiment of an equally objective “national interest,” announcing that “the commitment of the President to his territory, to his people . . . is reflected in this road, in this asphalt” (quoted in <italic>Expreso Chiapas</italic>, August 18, 2010). Similarly, despite the fact that these infrastructure projects are designed to strengthen the very forces of global competition and primitive accumulation that generated the Zapatista uprising, the possibility of a substantive contradiction between the interests of transnational investors and those of the local peasantry is discursively precluded by the assertion that these projects will transform Chiapas into a “paradise of investment opportunities” while “responding to the popular demands of the indigenous communities.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0094582X12470378">19</xref></sup> According to Sabines, this consensual harmony of interests demonstrates that “today our differences are far less significant than our commonalities. The cause that unites everyone is the well-being and development of the indigenous <italic>pueblos</italic> of Chiapas, for whom we bring good news: We are going to continue investing in infrastructure programs with the government of President Calderón.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0094582X12470378">20</xref></sup></p>

<title>Economic Corridors</title>
<p>The accumulation strategy of the PPP in southern Mexico was originally based on the transformation of a rural economy characterized by communal property and semisubsistence agriculture into an urbanized capitalist system organized around “clusters” of agglomerated economic activity that were to focus on light manufacturing, high-end ecotourism, and agro-industrial plantations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0094582X12470378">Presidencia de la República, 2001</xref>: 174). Although the maquila sector in the region has since proved unable to compete with export-processing zones in China and Central America, there has been considerable expansion in tourism and agro-industry in recent years. Both these sectors have been aggressively promoted by the Sabines administration in Chiapas through the creation and expansion of “economic corridors” that reproduce the PPP’s cluster strategy and that are integrated into the infrastructure networks of the PPP.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0094582X12470378">21</xref></sup> Three “agro-industrial corridors” have been created to attract transnational investment in intensive beef, poultry, and biofuel production,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0094582X12470378">22</xref></sup> and a “tourism corridor” is also under construction. The tourism corridor incorporates the Palenque–Agua Azul Integrally Planned Center, a luxury eco-tourist resort that is being promoted as “a new Cancun in Chiapas” and is, again, included in the original blueprint for the PPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0094582X12470378">Presidencia de la República, 2001</xref>: 183–184). Plans for the Center incorporate the archaeological site at Palenque and the waterfalls of Agua Azul, as well as a resort complex, “commercial zones,” a “PGA-standard golf course,” and a “nature theme park” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X12470378">FONATUR, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X12470378">2004</xref>), all of which are to be integrated into the arteries of transnational tourism through the internationalization of Palenque Airport and the construction of the San Cristóbal–Palenque Highway.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0094582X12470378">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The construction of these economic corridors, however, is being obstructed by the continued prevalence of communal land tenure in Chiapas. The implementation of the Center has been complicated by the presence of Zapatista communities on the land alongside the waterfalls near Agua Azul and is the alleged motivation behind a series of paramilitary attacks on these communities from 2006 on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X12470378">Fray Bartolomé de las Casas, 2010</xref>). The expansion of biofuel plantations has also been opposed by peasant communities facing dispossession and has been connected to the forced eviction of Zapatista and non-Zapatista communities from the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve undertaken during both the Salazar and the Sabines administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X12470378">Harvey, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0094582X12470378">Wilson, 2009</xref>). In anticipation of such conflicts, the PPP originally called for the full privatization of communal land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0094582X12470378">Presidencia de la República, 2001</xref>: 151). Despite the official end of land reform on a national scale in 1992 and the beginning of land privatization in 1993, the privatization of land has been largely unsuccessful in Chiapas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X12470378">Maderas del Pueblo, 2006</xref>: 15). Sabines, however, has publicly announced the definitive termination of the sporadic land redistributions that have occurred in Chiapas since the Zapatista uprising and has vowed to reclaim illegally invaded land and prevent any further land invasions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0094582X12470378">24</xref></sup> Faced with organized opposition to the direct privatization of communal property, the Sabines administration is implementing a new strategy, the “Productive Reconversion,” according to which peasant farmers retain their communal land but change its use from the production of maize, beans, and vegetables for subsistence to the production of biofuels and other cash crops for export.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0094582X12470378">25</xref></sup> Participation in state agricultural programs and the Rural Cities project is being made contingent upon acceptance of the Productive Reconversion, for which communities are rewarded with tools, fertilizers, and other gifts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0094582X12470378">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Productive Reconversion is not a strategy of primitive accumulation as such, since it does not directly separate the producer from the means of production. However, it nonetheless brings the peasantry within the control of the state while rendering them increasingly dependent on the market in terms of both production and consumption. It thus functions to advance commodification and extend state power in a context in which direct primitive accumulation remains highly contested. As in the case of the infrastructure networks, however, this political functionality is obscured by a postpolitical discourse celebrating “the construction of an inclusive Chiapas . . . with a human face”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0094582X12470378">27</xref></sup> and appealing to consensus-based decision making founded on expert knowledge. In a speech celebrating the Productive Reconversion and the rapid expansion of palm oil plantations in Chiapas, for example, Sabines declared that “in the countryside politicians are not required. What is required is a government of experts that can work together and understand what the producer needs and also occasionally persuade [the producer] to change his product.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0094582X12470378">28</xref></sup> Here the traditional exclusion of a supposedly “backward” countryside from the political realm of the polis is reproduced in order to legitimate the expert management of production and the state-led transformation of social relations, thus again demonstrating the utility of spatial discourses in the process of depoliticization.</p>

<sec id="section6-0094582X12470378">
<title>Rural Cities</title>
<p>The Rural Cities project is the flagship development program of the Sabines administration. Its very name embodies the urbanization of the countryside, while its implementation again demonstrates the potential for the production of space to extend the power of state and capital while concealing this functionality within its seemingly apolitical form. Launched by Sabines in 2007, the Rural Cities project includes the planned construction of 25 new towns, in which elements of the dispersed rural population of Chiapas are to be relocated. According to official statistics, of Chiapas’s 19,386 communities, 14,346 (74 percent) have fewer than 100 inhabitants. Many of these communities lack basic services, and poverty levels are high.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0094582X12470378">29</xref></sup> The stated objective of the Rural Cities project is therefore “the reduction of population dispersal, the generation of employment, and the elevation of the productivity of the countryside” through “the creation of cities that . . . will radically improve the quality of life of the inhabitants of isolated rural communities.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0094582X12470378">30</xref></sup> However, the blueprint for the Rural Cities project is in fact contained in the Plan Puebla Panamá, which identifies the “highly dispersed population” of southern Mexico as one of the region’s principal “weaknesses” and “proposes the construction of a network of rural integration centers, the objective of which will be to provide these zones with infrastructure and basic services, and to then concentrate the dispersed communities within them, thus achieving a more efficient form of territorial organization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0094582X12470378">Presidencia de la República, 2001</xref>: 192). In contrast to the socially progressive public discourse of the Rural Cities project, the motivation for it is therefore strictly economic, responding to what David Harvey has identified as capital’s requirement for “the increasing concentration and expansion of the proletariat in . . . urban centres” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X12470378">Harvey, 1982</xref>: 418). A central platform of the Rural Cities project is the Productive Reconversion, through which the relocated peasants are granted their new houses on the condition that they cease to produce for subsistence and enter into the state-organized agro-industrial production of biofuels and other cash crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X12470378">Gobierno del Estado de Chiapas, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X12470378">2009</xref>). It is anticipated that these plantations will only require one or two days’ labor per week to maintain, and the remainder of the peasants’ time is to be spent on productive projects established within the Rural Cities themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0094582X12470378">31</xref></sup> The Rural Cities thus function in conjunction with the Productive Reconversion to commodify the produce of communal land without its direct privatization while ensuring the semiproletarianization of the peasantry.</p>
<p>To the extent that there is a social component to the Rural Cities project, it is arguably more concerned with social control than with social development, producing lived spaces in which the material contradictions of the project itself are physically erased. The Rural Cities are laid out in a rigid grid formation, within which diverse communities are thrown together, fragmented into individual families, and reconstituted in homogeneous rows of identical houses. Through this spatial form, combined with wage labor, taxation, state education, and the commodification of social reproduction, the relative autonomy of the peasant community is replaced by the normalized space of the national state. As one member of the Sabines administration has explained, the Rural Cities “do not only concern the construction of houses, they also concern the construction of society, citizens, identity.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0094582X12470378">32</xref></sup> The Rural Cities thus embody the relationship between primitive accumulation and urbanization described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0094582X12470378">Nicos Poulantzas (2003</xref>: 72), in which “the direct producers are freed from the soil only to become trapped in a grid—one that includes not only the factory but also the modern family, the school . . . the city and the national territory.”</p>
<p>In this sense, the Rural Cities project is also reminiscent of counterinsurgency projects such as the New Villages in Malaya, the Strategic Hamlets in Vietnam, and the Model Villages in Guatemala, through which potentially rebellious populations were relocated in spaces designed to foster subjective identification with the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12470378">CIEPAC, 2008</xref>). This similarity intensifies when the proximity of the Zapatista autonomous territories is considered. The first Rural City, Nuevo Juan de Grijalva, has been constructed in the northwest of the state, which is not included in the conflict zone. Completed and inhabited in September 2009, Nuevo Juan de Grijalva was constructed to house communities displaced by severe flooding in the region in 2007 and is intended to serve as a model with which to persuade other communities to relocate to Rural Cities either planned or under construction. The second Rural City, however, has since been completed in Santiago El Pinar, which is located in the midst of one of the centers of Zapatista activity, near the caracol of Oventik and the autonomous municipalities of San Juan de la Libertad and San Andrés Sakamchen. Santiago El Pinar itself is a product of counterinsurgency as one of seven municipalities created in 1999 by the state government to counter the proliferation of the Zapatista autonomous municipalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X12470378">Leyva and Burguete, 2007</xref>). The choice of Santiago El Pinar as the location for the second Rural City therefore indicates a counterinsurgency component to the Rural Cities project.</p>
<p>The Rural Cities project thus demonstrates the centrality of the production of space in the extension of capitalist social relations and state power. Equally, the political content of the project is again concealed by appeal to the apolitical appearance of social space. In his praise of the Rural Cities project Calderón has repeatedly invoked the bourgeois ideology of the small town as a place of peace and harmony, describing the Rural City as offering “a new beginning, to live in peace . . . in order, with respect” (quoted in <italic>El Heraldo de Chiapas</italic>, April 8, 2008) and announcing that “today we can write a different history. Today we can know the meaning of unity, of solidarity, of working together.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0094582X12470378">33</xref></sup> As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0094582X12470378">Žižek (1999</xref>: 224) observes, such discourses are depoliticizing to the extent that they appeal to the communitarian fantasy of “a close, organically structured, homogeneous social space that allows for no void in which the political moment can emerge.” In contrast to this utopian vision, however, the material contradictions of neoliberal capitalism remain operative within the Rural Cities and are beginning to assert themselves. In Nuevo Juan de Grijalva, inhabitants have accused the state of attempting to privatize ejidal property in the lands from which they were displaced, holding demonstrations and land occupations to which the state has responded with arrests and detentions (<italic>La Jornada</italic>, June 3, 2011). In the region surrounding Santiago El Pinar, the Rural City has been strongly opposed by local peasant and indigenous organizations. Las Abejas, whose members were massacred by paramilitaries in Acteal in 1997, have described the Rural Cities project as a strategy to “control our organizations in order to acquire our lands” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X12470378">Las Abejas de Acteal, 2010</xref>), and the community of San Pedro Chenalhó near Santiago El Pinar has announced that it “definitively reject[s] the construction of the Rural Cities, because it is clear that this project encourages us to abandon our lands. . . . Once we are concentrated [the government] can control us” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0094582X12470378">SIPAZ, 2010</xref>). The Rural Cities project is thus already marked by the cracks and fissures that necessarily undermine the production of a space that aims to exclude political antagonisms from the terrain of capitalist social relations.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This paper has illustrated the significance of the urbanization of the countryside in contemporary strategies of capitalist development and the functionality of the production of space in the postpolitical modality of depoliticization characteristic of contemporary neoliberal governance. The new phase of the PPP in Chiapas has been facilitated by the postpolitical discourse of the Sabines administration and has itself been instrumental in the efficacy of that discourse. The infrastructural networks, economic corridors, and Rural Cities currently under construction in Chiapas not only function to further subordinate the territory to the expanded accumulation of capital but also permit this process to appear as a pragmatic response to economic necessity in the interest of the common good, while simultaneously pacifying recalcitrant populations through their incorporation into the normalizing spatial structures of the national state.</p>
<p>The success of this project was demonstrated by the 2010 municipal elections, in which the PRD-PAN coalition made significant gains against the PRI, the postpolitical irony, of course, being that the Sabines administration is itself dominated by ex-Priístas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0094582X12470378">34</xref></sup> At the margins of this consensus, however, the implementation of the Sabines development program has met with numerous resistances, including opposition to the forced displacement of communities from Montes Azules, the blocking of the construction of the San Cristobal–Palenque Highway in Mitziton, and the resistance of the Zapatista community of Bolon Ajaw, which occupies part of the proposed site of the Palenque–Agua Azul Integrally Planned Center. In each of these cases, the government has been accused of complicity with paramilitary forces, and confrontations have occurred in which people have lost their lives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0094582X12470378">35</xref></sup> For now, the struggles in Mitziton and Bolon Ajaw have succeeded in obstructing the implementation of the projects they are opposing. Ultimately, however, the capitalist state has proved itself very adept at marginalizing all resistances that remain at the level of isolated particularisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0094582X12470378">Swyngedouw, 2009</xref>: 609). Even the Zapatista autonomous territories are increasingly infiltrated by the roads, plantations, and Rural Cities of the PPP and are in danger of being reduced from seeds of an alternative socio-spatiality to mere zones of confinement within an expanding urban fabric.</p>
<p>This scenario is reflective of the broader political landscape. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094582X12470378">Adolfo Gilly (2010</xref>: 44) observes, “At present, in Mexico as elsewhere, the space for a revolutionary left simply does not exist. . . . Politics has become the exclusive domain of capital and its negotiators.” However, this expulsion of dissensus from the space of politics is accompanied by “an expansion of the space occupied by rage and fury.” In December 2008 and January 2009, to mark the fifteenth anniversary of the Zapatista uprising, the EZLN held the first international Festival of Dignified Rage (Festival de la Digna Rabia). Attended by social movements and activists from around the world, the Festival constituted a space of dissensus, in the sense of an “interruption of the ‘natural’ . . . order of domination through the constitution of a place of encounter by those who have no part in that order” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X12470378">Dikec, 2005</xref>: 172). Speaking at the event Subcomandante <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0094582X12470378">Marcos (2009)</xref> mocked the hypocrisy of the postpolitical consensus:
<disp-quote>
<p>For those above us (<italic>los de arriba</italic>), nonconformity is . . . a cerebral pathology to be cured. . . . For these violent pacifists we are all human . . . Carlos Slim and the waitress . . . who must travel three or four hours to arrive at work . . . Calderón . . . and the peasant dispossessed of his land . . . López Obrador and the <italic>indígena</italic> murdered in Chiapas . . . in sum, the men and women who have wealth and power and the women and men who have nothing more than dignified rage.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From this perspective, the postpolitical modality of depoliticization is revealed as an ethico-political code that naturalizes and conceals the generalized violence implicit in the profound inequalities of neoliberal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0094582X12470378">Žižek, 2010</xref>: 88–89). In Chiapas, the urbanization of the countryside advances the dispossession of the peasantry while making possible the construction of shopping malls and luxury condominiums in the state capital of Tuxtla Gutiérrez. In Mexico as a whole, the urban fabric underpins a political economy in which Carlos Slim can rise to the top of the <italic>Forbes</italic> list in the context of an economic crisis that has deepened poverty and inequality and caused the Mexican economy to contract at the fastest rate of all countries in Latin America (<italic>La Jornada</italic>, July 9, 2010). On a global scale, the PPP locks Chiapas into a profoundly subordinate position in a world system that operates without any concern for the region or its people beyond the surplus value to be accrued from their intensified exploitation. Under these conditions, in which the possibilities for radical change and genuine contestation have been evacuated from the arena of “legitimate” political activity, a politics of dignified rage may increasingly appear as the only remaining starting point for “an authentic politics . . . that is, the art of the <italic>impossible</italic>, [which] changes the very parameters of what is considered possible in the existing constellation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0094582X12470378">Žižek, 1999</xref>: 237).</p>
