<p>In the last twenty years, gender has become an important issue within archaeological debate. Material evidence allows insights into human experience not afforded by textual sources, but archaeology has rarely been at the forefront of feminist thought outside the discipline. Joyce’s engaging study examines how gendered and sexual identities in past societies challenge assumptions of an atemporal male/female dichotomy. She presents her own work and that of other archaeologists in the form of interesting case studies, from Palaeolithic Europe to nineteenth-century America, which offer alternatives to the two-sex/two-gender model of society. Written in an accessible and lively style and divided into thematic chapters with Joyce’s own speciality of Mesoamerican Classic Maya communities acting as a point of reference, the book cleverly negotiates huge spans of time and place using the human body and its representation as a key focus.</p>
<p>While previous generations of archaeologists looked for exceptional female experience – full-figured statuettes of the ‘Mother Goddess’ became signifiers of highly rated female fertility and warrior women graves offered an actualisation of mythological Amazons – Joyce calls for an understanding of ancient cultures based on status, skill, age and wealth as well as gender. Sixteenth-century European texts describe marked labour divisions between men and women in Maya civilisation with men working outside the home and women involved in domestic production. But a study of textile making reveals that in a society where cloth was a standard of value, Maya women who wove textiles were important members of their communities and were more likely to be defined by the high status that this activity conferred than by their gender. In the same communities, monumental art depicting the Maya ruling elite provided aspirational imagery for the whole population with idealised and ageless representations of the aristocratic class. Here, far from emphasising gender difference, artworks united men and women as members of the ruling group. Likewise, an investigation of burial objects found at Tlatilco in Mexico establishes that age rather than gender is the major basis for gauging how members of society were differentiated, with older adults, regardless of gender, having fewer items included in their burials.</p>
<p>Drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464700113483268b">Butler (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464700113483268b">1993</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464700113483268b">Grosz (1995)</xref>, Joyce applies feminist theory to archaeological interpretation. The notion of gender and sexuality as an ever-changing performance is used to comprehend women warrior graves in Native Indian and Iron Age Central Asian sites. Here, women buried with weapons and gear for horses were not exceptions to the rule of female domesticity, but representative of gender fluidity in which male and female roles became interchangeable. Not only was gender an unstable category, but sexuality, too, was in a state of constant flux. With the exception of the well-studied ancient Greek practice of pederasty which authorised sexual relationships between men and boys, archaeologists have often interpreted sexualities in ancient societies in terms of contemporary heteronormativity. Joyce, however, selects case studies which offer alternative interpretations of sexual practice and identity based on the analysis of artworks and artefacts. For example, the figures in Swedish Bronze Age cave paintings of copulating couples are usually identified as men and women. Men are recognised by armour and erect phalluses and women by long hair and cup marks. Yet a reinterpretation of these figures suggests that they can all be perceived as male and their visual differences representative not of masculinity and femininity but of different forms of masculinity. The homosocial culture among young men in the Central Mexican Aztec or Mexica state has long been acknowledged, but perhaps such male bonding led to the sanctioning of same-sex relationships as in Classical Greece. Another comparison with the ancient Greeks is found in the imagery of young male bodies on display in painted Classic Maya pottery which Joyce suggests could point to same-sex relationships between Maya males. Sexually explicit pottery from the Moche community in Peru also illustrates an understanding of sexual expression as diverging widely from reproductive heterosexuality. But, once again, just as individuals cannot be explained solely by their gender, so sexuality is not the determining factor of identity. In the archaeology of the more recent past, searches into rubbish pits of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century American brothels uncovered evidence for the everyday reality of women’s lives beyond their profession as sex workers.</p>
<p>The book consistently questions assumptions about how we view the past. An initial look at European Palaeolithic figurines shows stylised women with large breasts, but when turned upside down, these same objects become male genitals. Even ancient Greece, known as a fiercely patriarchal society from the evidence of classical texts which tell us that women were relegated to private quarters of the domestic home, is subject to revision. Archaeological studies of the Greek house determine that the ideal of female sequestration was not often a reality; instead house-plans uncover a two-part separation based on a division between public and private rather than male and female.</p>
<p>Joyce’s final chapter explains that while archaeology is a significant resource in the quest to uncover the past, it can also offer ways of confronting the present. Just as a single model of human society cannot explain ancient cultures, so too it is an equally unhelpful way of comprehending the contemporary world.</p>
