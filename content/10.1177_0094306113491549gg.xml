<p><italic>Odd Couples</italic> is the first substantive sociological study of friendships between straight women and gay men, and lesbian women and straight men. The research is based on semi-structured interviews with 53 participants. Broadly a work of symbolic interactionism, microlevel interactions are linked to macrosocial conditions via script theory in a feminist framework. The author, Anna Muraco, argues that these “intersectional friendships” challenge but also reproduce heteronormative assumptions about intimacy, that these relationships hold the potential to dislodge the monolithic notion of “the family,” and that they constitute an important relational innovation toward the societal acceptance of diversity.</p>
<p>The introduction and Chapter One set the scene: they clarify the terminology; set out the aims, approach, and objectives; discuss the characteristics of friendship; and canvass the literature on same-sex, cross-sex, and intersectional friendship. The substantive discussion begins with the following chapter where Muraco identifies common and disparate elements that mark intersectional friendships. At times, however, she overstates her case. Muraco frequently presents universal friendship norms and practices as if they were specific to intersectional friendships. For instance, one of the three relationships examined in Chapter Two hardly qualifies as close friendship: while for Emily, Patrick is a “brother,” to him they are not “bosom buddies” (p. 38). There is, however, a noteworthy conceptual yield here: like in “straight” cross-sex friendships, a (love-like) jealousy may develop because prevailing assumptions about the naturalness of cross-sex erotic attraction also contaminate intersectional friendships.</p>
<p>According to Muraco, these relationships blur the line between friendship and family. They are sometimes viewed as long-term commitments, and some gay men’s desire to be involved in the lives of children born to their straight women friends lends extra solidity to a relationship type that is usually seen as especially fragile. While acknowledging the political problems that arise from using the term, Muraco uses “family” confidently with all connotations intact because she believes that to use family “simply as a metaphor … is a disservice to their [respondents’] strong connections” (p. 75). This is perplexing. Not only does she reiterate the family’s centrality, we could just as well mount the argument that even in a mainstream context “family” does its ideological work <italic>primarily</italic> as a metaphor that connotes, but by no means always lives up to, expectations of intimacy. Also, family is different from friendship in one important respect: despite conceptual contestations and alternative practices, it remains strongly institutionalized and thus continues to have political purchase. Ignoring structure, Muraco takes what respondents say at face value, presses agency into the service of hope and on that basis concludes that “expanding the definition of family to include a multiplicity of relations can also be a political act, as it offers an alternative to the monolithic ideal of family life” (p. 76). This assertion becomes problematic when viewed from the standpoint of friendship, the book’s central concept: expanding family to include friendship would impose the normative constraints of family on friendship. This would spell the end of friendship’s essential noninstitutional characteristic and augur the end of friendship itself. Greater inclusivity in Muraco’s terms would thus only be possible if the normative codification of the family as an institution were to cease; and that is highly unlikely.</p>
<p>Intersectional friends “police” stereotypes of sex, gender, and sexual orientation, but according to Muraco also act as “gender outlaws” who challenge mainstream norms. For example, friends “police” when gay males turn straight women friends into mothers, or when straight women turn gay friends into paragons of masculinity while simultaneously valuing their feminine qualities. The evidence supporting “outlaw” behavior is thin, however: women engaging in shared activities that are traditionally assigned to masculinity (playing pool), gay male friends raising their straight women friends’ esteem by commenting favorably on their bodies and encouraging “sex positive” attitudes are taken to signify acts of defiance. Actually, “outlaw” behavior is virtually absent. There is a sense here that Muraco strives for balance despite her intuition, and unnecessarily so since she concludes that “the straight men and straight women … reaped the greatest benefits in terms of support for gender nonconformity in intersectional friendships” (p. 99). Surely this says more about the triumph of heteronormativity—and heterosexuals—than norm-breaking innovation.</p>
<p><italic>Odd Couples</italic> gains considerable strength when Muraco turns to the problem of sexual attraction. She shows how for some friends the absence of sexual attraction fosters closeness, but also how the irreducibility of sexual orientation to a straight/homosexual dichotomy conjures erotic desire as “both a nuisance and a threat to friendship” (p. 116). The absence of a script specific to these friendships leaves a void that is frequently filled by heteronormative scripts. For instance, straight women friends of gay men may interpret intimacy as romance. Aside from showing that sexual tensions may be present in intersectional contexts, Muraco convincingly marshals these relationships as evidence for the fluidity of sexual orientations, the efficacy of heteronormative assumptions across genders and sexualities, and the depth of the platonic friendship norm. Her assessment that sexual practices and the intimacy of friendship are irreconcilable in cross-sex friendships whatever the sexual orientations can also be used to shed light on the heterosexual “friends with benefits” phenomenon: it appears to signify little more than a trend toward nonintimate, goal-oriented relationships of convenience.</p>
<p>In the final two chapters Muraco engages with questions concerning the political purchase of intersectional friendships and their future. On the first question she remains ambivalent. We learn that intersectional friends may be more accepting of diversity, and that this may or may not extend beyond the small world of the dyad, that is, become political. On the second question, Muraco reiterates her hope for the future, namely that the “chosen family” model will challenge the traditional family with intersectional friends as a vanguard. Surprisingly, she evaluates intersectional friends’ normative exclusion of sex as reflecting “a social order that gives primacy to monogamous, married families headed by straight men” (p. 152), inferring that her respondents reproduce the heteronormative order. This assessment is surprising because it is here, in fact, that these friendships’ liberating potential is explicit. Not only do they problematize sexual practices because of their very intersectionality; despite frequent tensions, sexuality—the normative core of cross-sex relationships <italic>per se</italic>—is either sidelined or quarantined while intimacy is preserved. The potentials come to the fore when compared to “friends with benefits” relationships in straight “hook up” culture, where the inclusion of sex often reaffirms masculine domination.</p>
<p>Some logical inconsistencies could have been avoided if a more distanced, “second order” approach had been taken to the data. That should not, however, detract from important conclusions: heteronormativity is alive and well, is in fact hegemonic; it orients meaning even though—and because—intersectional friends break the mold and, through their practices, show up the fallacy of the straight/homosexual binary. <italic>Odd Couples</italic> is therefore a significant analysis of how people negotiate the vicissitudes of sex, gender, and sexual orientation in everyday life as well as a much-needed contribution to the sociology of friendship. It should be read by anyone interested in the complexities of contemporary intimacy.</p>
