<abstract>
<p>This article argues that photographs can make a particular and independent contribution to historical research, but that their value is limited unless contextualized and verified using other sources. A comparative study of Saint-Henri, Quebec and Lowell, Massachusetts employs historical photo-analysis to discern shifting patterns in transportation and sociability on early 20th- century North American city streets. Specific class and gender transformations were tied to the advent of the department store and to the introduction of municipal policies restricting commercial and ‘inappropriate’ activities in the first decade, to a significant rise in tram use after World War I, and to restricted automobile travel in the interwar period. The comparative and visual methodology reveals a gradual decline accompanied by increasing segregation in the social usage of commercial and residential streets during this period.</p>

<p>For the first time in the process of pictorial reproduction, photography freed the hand of the most important artistic functions which henceforth devolved only upon the eye looking into a lens.</p>

<p>Contemporary social and urban historians have recognized the importance of integrating photographs and other visual representations with written sources as crucial pieces of historical documentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470357211434028">Borchert, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470357211434028">1998</xref>). This point has been observed by Peter Burke who has recently attributed more use of images as historical evidence to the widening of interests ‘to include not only political events, economic trends and social structures, but also the history of mentalities, everyday life, material culture, and the body and so on’ in the last generation or so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357211434028">2001</xref>: 9). Current theoretical tendencies and intellectual orientations may have broadened the spectrum of sources in this way, yet urban and social historians more often employ photographs, sketches, and maps to illustrate or supplement histories of modern cities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470357211434028">1</xref></sup> This disciplinary inclination stands in contrast to art and architectural historical practices employing visual representations as central forms of evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357211434028">Kostof, 1992</xref>). The argument here is for a rigorous method of historical photo-analysis that collects, selects, and classifies photographs, and applies contextualizing approaches. The study treats historical photographs as vital and fragmentary traces of history, mimetic (telling) representations which can be analysed as a record of facts about material reality and as a mediated representation reflecting class and gender distinctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357211434028">Berger, 1972</xref>: 17–18; 24–9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470357211434028">Schwartz, 1998</xref>: 25). Because these fragmentary moments in time are subject to interpretation and to specific methods of analysis, the study contributes to an expanding urban literature that thinks through the ‘dynamic connections between the material and spatial articulations of the city and the everyday social and psychic excursions of its citizenry, much of this reinforced by the adroit reading of visual texts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357211434028">Bailey, 2002</xref>: 197).</p>
<p>The argument for contextualizing photographs and for combining them with other sources to more accurately reflect historical reality is part of a broader discussion in visual history. This article first considers these theoretical controversies and the visual research methods devised by social scientists attentive to context. The paper then employs historical photo-analysis and a comparative approach to argue that in this case study, photographs can nuance an urban historical issue.</p>
<p>The growing attention to images as valuable sources of information has incited controversy amongst theoreticians, historians, social scientists and scholars of educational research. Whereas Benjamin and Burke have emphasized their significance, John Tagg is sceptical of their use as social documents because they distort reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470357211434028">1993</xref>). Susan Sontag has observed that as a function of spectacle in capitalist industrial society, photographs both objectify and subjectify reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470357211434028">1977</xref>: 57). John Berger has tempered the interpretation of the photograph as a mediation between seeing and looking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357211434028">1972</xref>: 17–18, 24–9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357211434028">1980</xref>: 48–63). W.J.T. Mitchell has suggested that because images are subject to these limitations, it is important to consider them together with words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470357211434028">1986</xref>: 50).</p>
<p>As a partial representation of social reality, the photograph poses a challenge for historians attentive to historicity. Historicity can be viewed as the contextualizing of a document as a critical piece of evidence. In <italic>The Disciplinary Frame</italic>, Tagg addresses this contradiction between history and photography by stating that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[T]the closing of the rhetoric of historiography at the level of the fact and the closing of the meaning of the photograph at the level of its indexicality have operated in fields of historical and photographic discourse they have never saturated. Whatever their ambitions, they have remained local ploys, whose grounds have always been in dispute. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470357211434028">2009</xref>: 213)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The argument here is that in the treatment of a documentary photograph, the historian attempts to reduce the gap between the <italic>object</italic> which records and supplies information and the interpretation of the popular representation of the photographic image as <italic>subject</italic>. The subjective elements are dependent on several factors, including the genre, the photographer’s selection or choice, the technical apparatus and reproduction, and the archival collection. Subject to analysis are both the contents of the photograph and the factors instrumental to its representation.</p>
<p>The historian can then recognize the merits and limitations of treating a photograph as a social document where the context is subject to an analysis which requires words. In his treatment of a photograph of a second grade public school student in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Gustavo E. Fischman, for instance, has observed that the photograph is not merely an illustration, as when ‘placed in its historical context the details of this picture acquire a different significance’. His argument is that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . it should be noted that if a picture is worth a thousand words, in order to understand it, reflect on it, or explain it, we might need to use a thousand and one words. And, even then, there is nothing transparent or inherently truthful in the world of images. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357211434028">2001</xref>: 31)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Historians of education, in particular, have engaged in an active controversy regarding the relevance of the visual in scholarly research. The 1999 publication of the book <italic>Silences and Images: The Social History of the Classroom</italic> triggered much research activity around the visual that has incited an ongoing methodological discussion. In these articles, educational historians have suggested that to recreate the social culture and relations of the classroom, one must piece together diverse sources such as photographs, oral history, architecture, letters and diaries. Ian Grosvenor has claimed that photographs are particularly useful sources, especially when critical questions are raised about their production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470357211434028">Grosvenor et al., 1999</xref>: 85–104).</p>
<p>Grosvenor has pointed to the importance of establishing context in the treatment of the visual. This questioning of the academic use of the photograph has become a principal dispute between scholars who ignore contextualizing information and others who are critical of those practices. In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470357211434028">2005</xref> publication <italic>Visual History: Images of Education</italic>, European scholars have challenged the non-contextualizing approach. These scholars are often visual anthropologists and sociologists who have employed photographs, as well as films and documentaries, in the history of education and devised their own visual research methods based on their studies.</p>
<p>Karl Catteeuw, Kristof Dams, Marc Depaepe and Frank Simon have made a substantial argument for contextualizing practices. The considerable research attention to the image in Cultural Studies has prompted them to examine films in their study of primary schools in Belgium from 1880 to 1960. They have argued that these visual sources raise speculative questions only answered by written sources, and that the films themselves did not reveal any new conclusions. Their claim is that the emphasis on form and abstract generalities in Cultural Studies is not attentive to the content and to the empiricism of educational history. The written text is necessary for the interpretation of the visual, rather than the reverse. This is because most communication in the 19th and 20th centuries was written and not visual.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470357211434028">Eric Margolis (n.d.)</xref> has devised his own visual research methods based on the contextualizing practices of educational history. His three-fold approach to photographs of US urban schools first explores the ‘evidence objective, the factual, documentary information provided by the photograph or its context’. He then discerns the ‘interpretation deductions built on circumstantial evidence and context that can be clearly verified to and by others’. Finally, he speculates on the ‘subjective attributions that extend the interpretation based on less concrete evidence, or emotional reaction to the image’. He is also careful to consider the process of selection on the part of the photographer, the archival collection, and the historian.</p>
<p>In a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470357211434028">2007</xref> article in <italic>History of Education</italic>, Margolis and Fram critically responded to Catteeuw’s reliance on written sources. They stressed the significance of photographic interpretation to reveal the hidden curriculum of classroom surveillance, discipline and punishment. Their argument is that visual imagery makes up for the deficiencies, the information lacking, in written data such as formal curricula and school board minutes. They applied the photographic theory of Roland Barthes, Alan Sekula and others to depict the physical arrangements, postures and facial expressions of bodies within socially constructed spaces.</p>
<p>The visual research methods employed by Margolis and other visual anthropologists and sociologists have influenced the historical photo-analysis employed here. The reasoning is that, similar to the deficiencies Margolis has noted in written sources for hidden classroom curricula, few written descriptions of the urban streetscape exist. Because photographs reveal more about the unique social character of street sociability than written sources, this paper employs the concrete methods for testing these sources and determining results devised by James Borchert. His photo-analysis is a contextualizing approach that encourages researchers ‘to learn as much as possible about each photograph, its content, context, and photographer, as well as to use all other available kinds of sources for the research topic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357211434028">1981</xref>). An urban social historian, Borchert devised these photo-analytical methods in the early 1980s based on his study of documentary photographs of alley life in Washington DC, commissioned by the Farm Security Administration during the 1930s Depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357211434028">1980</xref>).</p>
<p>Attentive to the treatment and analysis of photographs, this case study also has an inherent spatial agenda in the comparative treatment of two specific locations and socially constructed street spaces. This disciplinary inclination has more often been the preserve of cultural geographers inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470357211434028">David Livingstone’s (1992)</xref> conceptualization of the geography of space than of urban social historians. Of note in this respect is the attention given to the photographic interpretation of cultural landscapes by Joan M. Schwartz and James R. Ryan in <italic>Picturing Place</italic>. Similar to my argument, the editors argue that ‘photographs cannot be studied in isolation from, but must rather be linked in multiple and complex ways to other forms of material evidence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357211434028">2003</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>This paper employs a case study of the commercial and residential streets of the Montreal industrial <italic>quartier</italic> of Saint-Henri and the francophone district of Lowell, a New England mill town. A textual analysis of photographs traces relations between the physical environment and social interaction from 1905 to 1945. The paper treats the timing and the nature of the alleged street use decline in the 1920s and 1930s to question how and why the transition from convivial avenues of sociability to urban ‘through-streets’ occurred. The contention is that a vibrant street life and considerable pedestrian traffic persisted in both urban core areas until the end of the Second World War, despite several circumstances purported to have led to decreased use. These factors include the advent of the department store and the introduction of municipal policies restricting commercial and ‘inappropriate’ activities (drinking, gambling, smoking, prostitution and criminal gangs) in the first decade, a significant rise in tram use after World War I, and the introduction of the automobile in the interwar period.</p>
<p>The study indicates that the transformation of street life was more gradual than has been suggested, at least during the decades until the1940s, though this period did see a greater segregation in the social usage of commercial and residential streets. The effective decrease of the street as a site of working-class sociability appears to have taken place in a later period, with the highway construction projects, urban renewal programmes, and with the much increased use of the automobile and suburban expansion in the 1950s and 1960s. Combined with written records such as censuses and newspapers, images of early 20th-century Saint-Henri and Lowell suggest that department stores, motorized vehicles, and municipal reforms may have altered, though not diminished, social interaction on main thoroughfares. On the other hand, adjoining streets in working-class neighbourhoods remained sites of social interaction and recreation – lingering spaces that connected home and work. The focus on social usage rather than the advent of new technologies indicates that the character of street sociability was dependent on daily patterns of life and work conditioned by economic cycles and differences of class, gender, ethnicity and age.</p>
<p>The research is situated within a central debate in North American urban history on the timing and degree of continuity and change in the history of streets. Spiro Kostof has argued that the death of the modern street in Western Europe took place in the 1920s and 1930s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357211434028">1992</xref>: 239). For US cities, Jane Jacobs’ <italic>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</italic> and Mike Davis’ <italic>City of Quartz</italic> ‘emphasize a change, or more specifically, a decline that has transformed US streets from once-vibrant public spaces to environments devoid of diversity or life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470357211434028">Kahan, 2000</xref>). Jane Jacobs, William H. Whyte, James Kunstler, Mike Davies, as well as several technology historians, ‘find a sharp decline of this intense and diverse street life in the post-World War II period. They link these changes to redevelopment and highway projects designed to accommodate the automobile’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357211434028">Borchert, 2002</xref>: 491). Still other urban US historians stress the continuities in the history of the streets, although they are divided on the extent to which streets reflect class and gender cleavages.</p>
<p>In his study of the transformation of the public space of the street in Hartford, Connecticut from 1850 to 1930, Peter Baldwin has claimed that there is a blend of continuity and change based on earlier reform movements, and not just automobile technology. He has interpreted late 19th-century middle-class male and female reform attempts to domesticate or purify public space as conflicting with the working-class definition and use of public space. Male middle-class Hartford politicians enhanced this prosperity and propriety by eliminating vice, by getting working-class children, peddlers, and other undesirable elements, off the streets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357211434028">Baldwin, 1999</xref>: 46).</p>
<p>These reform efforts resulted in a more segregated city emerging by the first two decades of the 20th century: a public space more clearly demarcated on class and ethnic lines. In the estimation of Goheen, Baldwin has demonstrated that ‘this logic was subsequently used by others who extended the idea to justify creating segregated public space as protection of middle-class neighbourhoods’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357211434028">Goheen, 2005</xref>: 874–5). He acknowledged the role of new transportation technology, road surfacing, and eased zoning as shaping more street segregation. He has stated, for example, that ‘although residential streets remained unpaved, permitting active uses’, main thoroughfares were more often designed for high-speed traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357211434028">Borchert, 2002</xref>: 492). In his estimation, all of these factors served to diminish the reform spirit by the 1920s.</p>
<p>Comparative research on early 20th-century Saint-Henri and Lowell concurs with Baldwin’s general conclusions about Hartford, particularly with regard to the timing in the decline of the street as a multi-functional space, and in the increased segregation of high-speed commercial traffic and quieter residential streets. His work is an important contribution to North American urban history and to the history of public space, but my perspective differs from his in three major regards.</p>
<p>First, his close examination reveals the increasing segregation of street space in the first decades of 20th-century Hartford, yet the implications of his study for other North American cities are unclear. Certain general patterns may apply to different cities, but they are still subject to the unique circumstances of each specific city. Goheen points to this weakness in a recent review where he has observed that Baldwin’s ‘interest is radically local’, given the failure to make broader comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357211434028">Goheen, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, there is a difference in disciplinary perspective and theoretical approach. Baldwin is writing a history of urban reform on the beautification of public space, not a social history of the street. His focus is on an elite of liberal reformers, and his history, to a large extent, takes on the class and gendered bias of those planners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357211434028">Goheen, 2005</xref>). He does not view the street as a contested space, nor do working people or the poor have a human agency. The class, gender, ethnic and racial harmony espoused by reformers such as Horace Bushnell overwhelmingly drives his history. For example, although he acknowledges that the Bushnell park project reconfigured class and ethnic boundaries within the city, he does not treat how those differences shaped street life in this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357211434028">Baldwin, 1999</xref>: 28). My own work points to the anti-democratic exclusion of social use of the street based on class, property and gender restrictions on the part of the local state. Baldwin’s work does not examine the spontaneous nature of the social use of the street, whether in the form of the vagrancy of homeless people, street protests or demonstrations, or urban crime, that is often at variance with local by-laws. His work suggests, but does not examine the nature of the locational conflict, the conflict between the democratic social use of public space and the anti-democratic or exclusionary control of public space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470357211434028">Mitchell, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, primary visual sources, such as photographs and sketches, are invaluable in that they play an essential role in revealing the nature of street life when viewed critically. Promotional photographs, for instance, usually present class harmony, yet the historian must rely on newspaper accounts and sketches, as well as on municipal archival documents and popular literature, for depictions of class conflict and crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470357211434028">Lord, 2005</xref>). Baldwin employs promotional photographs, such as a postcard view of Main Street in 1899 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357211434028">1999</xref>: 41) and people lingering on residential streets such as Charles Street in 1906 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357211434028">1999</xref>: 43), Gold Street in the 1890s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357211434028">1999</xref>: 72), and children playing in State Street in 1906 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357211434028">1999</xref>: 155) without an analytical approach. His reliance on certain selected written sources appears to narrow his focus considerably.</p>
<p>I argue here that photographs can speak more directly and with less bias to the issues of social use of street space. For images not only represent a crucial source for behaviour, but they also clarify the nature of class and gender representations. As independent sources of new information, photographs can make several contributions to our understanding of the urban streetscape for the following reasons. For as precise traces of spatial phenomena, with a sensory impact of a direct type, photographs convey physical dimensions and body language through the physical character of the technology. This cannot be described easily, if at all, in words because detailed verbal descriptions of the urban streetscape are rarely available.</p>
<p>What becomes increasingly apparent is that while photographic evidence can make a particular contribution to historical research, especially in terms of class and gender, the value of photographic evidence is limited unless contextualized and verified using other sources. Photographic evidence and interpretation is highly subject to a number of factors, including the nature of the photographic collection, the evolution of photographic technology and techniques, the purpose of the individual photographic event, and the historian’s method of selecting photographs. This paper focuses on what photographs can provide for historians interested in the use of street space, and what these images and data provide that written descriptions lack, as well as what shapes their interpretative bias.</p>

<title>Theory And Methodology</title>
<p>Contemporary urban scholars have turned their attention to the streets, lanes, markets, squares, parks, and other public spaces of Canadian and US cities. Goheen has observed that public space is differentiated from private space in that it is owned by the municipality whereas the private domestic space of the home is owned by an individual or a group of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357211434028">1995</xref>: 245). Property ownership is thus a distinguishing characteristic between private and public space. The private space of the home is the domain of the property owner(s), whereas public space is governed by the <italic>polis</italic>, and subject to the control and regulation of the municipal government.</p>
<p>In the present context, I consider the urban streetscape to be essentially social space. Social space is composed of all public space (the exterior spaces of sidewalks, streets, lanes, parks, and so on) plus the accessible privately-owned interior spaces of commercial and industrial buildings. These are all public in the sense of being available or accessible to social use and interactions. All of the photographs employed record events that occur in social space, both privately and, mainly, publicly-owned.</p>
<p>This study applies the photo-analytical methods of Borchert through the classification of 133 photographs of any streetscape in early to mid 20th-century Saint-Henri and Lowell under three broad headings: (1) Human Behaviour; (2) Street Environment; and (3) Interaction between Human Behaviour and Street Environment. In the case of the Saint-Henri collection, I selected anything related to the streetscape in this period from Canada’s Digital Collection, and for Lowell, I chose all photographs related to Little Canada in this same period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470357211434028">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Human behaviour includes the uses of space in three subcategories: (a) the commercial space of shops and restaurants, both interior and exterior; (b) the industrial workplace; and (c) cultural and recreational space. The street environment includes buildings, and the interaction between human behaviour and street environment treats how groups of people use space, and spans: (a) commercial streets; (b) residential streets; and (c) transportation technology. The photographs tend to be clustered into two broad time periods: 1905–1920, from the date of annexation of the former suburb of Saint-Henri to the City of Montreal, thereby establishing both this <italic>quartier</italic> and the francophone district of Lowell as ethnic enclaves within a larger metropolis in the electric streetcar era; and the early automobile and truck era, from 1920 to 1945.</p>
<p>Photographs are images or data providing substantial information for historians interested in the use of street space. Often taken for other reasons than my use of them here, photographs are more likely than written documents to form raw unobtrusive data, as they are perhaps less influenced by the author’s thesis. To establish the social process and context of the photographic images, I consider the various subjective choices involved in producing and interpreting each individual photograph on the part of (a) the photographer, (b) the subjects, and (c) the historian. In principle, one tries to find information on the photographer, the setting, and the technology, to give a greater understanding of the orientation, goals, and working conditions behind the individual photograph.</p>
<p>Two methods mitigate the problem of the limited number of photographs and the minimal information on the photographers and subjects. The first is to employ more fully what information I have on the photographers and their relations to the subjects in order to determine how and in what ways we can ‘trust’ or believe the evidence or facts in the images. The second is to classify the photographs by photographic genre (using Barbara Rosenblum’s study) and then to make statements about them based on other information provided by the archive or on the photograph itself. Both of these methods are employed in the photo-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470357211434028">Rosenblum, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357211434028">Becker Ohrn, 1980</xref>: Chapter 7).</p>

<title>Photographic Collections</title>
<p>This article is based on photographs from one collection for Saint-Henri and four collections for Lowell. The Saint-Henri Historical Society collection is an eclectic mix of approximately 40,000 photographs dating from the 1870s to the present, comprising promotional photographs, professional and amateur shots. Some photographs promote industries, shops, restaurants and transportation companies, while amateurs and the professionals Alphonse Dubuc and Conrad Poirier more often depict recreation and leisure activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470357211434028">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Historical photographs of the Little Canada of Lowell draw from four principal sources: the photographic collections of the Lowell National Historic Site and the University of Massachusetts Centre for Lowell History, and several photographs that appear in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357211434028">George Kenngott’s 1912</xref> study, as well as the publication <italic>Images of America: Lowell</italic>, Volumes I &amp; II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470357211434028">Pendergast, 1996, 1997</xref>). The Lowell National Historic Site collection consists of 4500 photographs from the Proprietors of Locks and Canal Records (1813–1962); 2500 photographs collected for permanent and rotating exhibitions of the Boots Mill Museum, a Historical Photo Print Collection, and private collections. Photographs of Little Canada are contained in the Proprietors of Locks and Canals where the photographer employed a Bellows camera to produce larger format 8 x 10 and 5 x 7 photographs from 1897 to the late 1910s. Roll film and a Brownie snapshot were used until the 1940s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470357211434028">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The University of Massachusetts Centre for Lowell History Photographic Collection consists of two principal sources on Little Canada: the City Engineers and the General Collections. The City Engineers photographed streets and canal bridges that required repairs and were indexed by street names. Quality photographs of Little Canada in the late 19th century also exist within the General Collections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470357211434028">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The two volumes of <italic>Images of America</italic> are part of an urban historical series that draws from several public and private photographic Lowell collections. These photographs were taken for commercial promotion and by professional photographers and families to document street life from the late 1800s to the 1960s. Kenngott’s <italic>The Record of A City: A Social Survey of Lowell, Massachusetts</italic> was originally written as a doctoral dissertation in the Department of Social Ethics of Harvard University. Calling for better housing and social conditions, Kenngott was part of a growing urban social reform movement at the time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470357211434028">5</xref></sup> Hope’s photographs supported Kenngott’s findings regarding the deplorable housing conditions and strained economic circumstances of Franco-Americans in New England mill towns.</p>

<title>Saint-Henri And Lowell</title>
<p>My study is bounded by a comparative analysis of two specific types of industrial and majority francophone communities. I have chosen to compare the early 20th-century streets in Saint-Henri with those of the francophone district of Lowell because the cities share at least five major similarities: their economic base, demography, tenancy rate, social history, and physical layout (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1470357211434028">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The textile industry was dominant in both communities. The Merchant’s or Dominion Textile factory and the Lawrence, Merrimack, and Boots Mills were the largest employers in Saint-Henri and Lowell in this period. The francophone populations of both communities were comparable, with a majority francophone population of 30,335 in 1921 for Saint-Henri, and the ethnic enclave of Little Canada and surrounding Franco-American neighbourhoods numbering roughly 24,000 in 1920. Both Saint-Henri and Lowell had a 75 percent tenant population and a main commercial street that served the consumer needs of their communities (rue Notre-Dame and Moody Street respectively), with other main streets (rue Sainte-Catherine, and Central and Merrimack Streets) serving the entire cities of Montreal and Lowell. The downtowns of both Saint-Henri and Lowell were bustling centres at the beginning of the 20th century. Saint-Henri was situated 1.5 miles to the southwest of the city core of Montreal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470357211434028">Figure 1</xref>), and Lowell was a regional hub for commercial and social activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470357211434028">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470357211434028">3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470357211434028">Marston, 1991</xref>: 215).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1470357211434028">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Photo-Analysis</title>
<p>To illustrate my approach, this paper has selected 18 photographs from the category of transportation technology to show how tramways, automobiles, trucks, carriages, carts and bicycles transformed patterns of sociability on the early 20th-century streets of Saint-Henri and Lowell. A close reading of the photographs helps to demonstrate the nature and complexity of the decline, the competing uses of the street, and the gradual segregation in the use of commercial and residential streets in ways that undermined working-class sociability.</p>
<p>The photographs have been selected to characterize different types of technology and are categorized into four groups according to photographic genre or the original purpose of the photograph: (a) commercial promotion (10); (b) engineering documentation (2); (c) newspaper coverage (1); and (d) family portraiture (5). They are organized in broadly chronological order, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1945.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1470357211434028">
<title>Commercial Promotion</title>
<p>The analysis begins with a 1905 rue Notre-Dame photograph at the corner of rue Saint-Philippe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470357211434028">Figure 4</xref>). Possibly taken to promote the introduction of the streetcar on this relatively new portion of the street, this photograph attests to the transformation of public space, social interaction, and a built environment. Although the precise location and direction of the image is known, the photographer’s name, as well as the day and month, are not. The photograph also reflects the slow nature of the photographic process (probably a large format camera on tripod with glass plate negatives). This produced a ‘camera-influenced’, if not posed image; most everyone seems to be turned towards the photographer and camera in expectation. The photographer may have paid for their picture, but we do not know.</p>

</fig>
<p>The likely promotional context reflects the desires of the male local-propertied elite to establish and extend a well-ordered, well-managed, and spacious central commercial street, a street that enhanced their profits and votes, a street largely free of social, political and criminal disturbance. This male-structured street tolerated a female and male public presence only in so far as these activities (strolling, shopping, conversing, and gossiping) were conducive to their business and political purposes. It is also important to consider what is not in the photograph. For instance, one notices from the fire insurance maps the proximity of work and homes on the main street, yet I can find no photographs from this period of people returning from work, or of pedestrians involved in accidents between trains and trams, or of workers participating in political parties or labour protests, or of women, men, and children engaged in flirtatious or sexual or criminal activities, or of homeless people. The overall impression this photograph conveys is of a contrived moment, one of respectability and a conservative female and male sociability in what is a predominantly industrializing working-class city.</p>
<p>As a small and highly selected sample of the real world it represents, this photograph has limited historical usefulness for understanding the class and gendered street sociability, and raises as many questions as it answers. For instance, we do not know who commissioned the photograph, but also, who was the intended audience, the Montreal Street Railway Company (MSRC), the local elite, the working population, men, women, or children, people from outside the community? My noting of the technology, social relations, and built environment is also inherently different from its intended purpose. The goal may be promotional, to highlight the introduction of the electric tram as an innovative element or change, but the photograph also emphasizes the continuity of respectable and harmonious sociability conducive to the 19th-century walking city. The camera’s eye may be directed at the tram rails in the foreground, yet the photographer has chosen not to demonstrate the active usage of the streetcar.</p>
<p>The first decades of the 20th century were characterized by more competition over street space as the use of mechanized forms of transportation intensified. The 1905 photograph of rue Notre-Dame indicated a possible compatibility of pedestrian traffic with the introduction of the electric tramway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470357211434028">Figure 4</xref>). The photograph of Central Street in Lowell taken in 1909 reveals a developing hierarchy of street use, such as the clearer definition of lanes, the wider and more clearly defined sidewalks, and the possible compatibility of horse-drawn carts with pedestrian and tramway traffic, given greater traffic congestion on a main business street (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1470357211434028">Figure 5</xref>). A tramway retreats into the distance while another approaches in the oncoming lane, and horse-drawn carriages respectfully negotiate the outer peripheries. This photograph is part of an extensive postcard collection, so it conveys the prosperity and functioning of the main commercial street, probably to attract tourists and outside business.</p>

<p>We cannot always suppose that there is a simple linear progression in the use of the street space by new forms of technology, as is sometimes espoused by technological determinists. In a sample of two photographs from Saint-Henri, one might suppose that the second was taken earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1470357211434028">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1470357211434028">7</xref>). It was in fact taken 16 years later, just prior to the Great Depression, most likely by an amateur. Deteriorating economic conditions may explain the handcart delivery of ice in the latter case, probably by an owner operating with a hired hand. In the first case, a company-owned truck, probably from outside Saint-Henri, was likely photographed by a professional during a more prosperous period. In both cases, I have not chosen to elaborate at length on these photographs because the vehicles are shown in isolation, with little clear information about the streetscape.</p>

<p>I have similarly chosen the following two photographs to denote that the introduction of technology did not necessarily follow a singular linear progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1470357211434028">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1470357211434028">9</xref>). People continued to use the bicycle even with the introduction of the motorcycle. The automobile did not immediately replace its competitor, the horse. Shop and business owners still used horse-drawn vehicles for transport and delivery until the Second World War, despite the introduction of the automobile as a recreational vehicle, and delivery trucks during and immediately following the First World War.</p>

<p>Although little is known about the purposes of these photographs, the pride and status in the acquisition of the innovative technology is a common theme, regardless of whether the use is for business or for recreational purposes. Members of the Lowell Motor Bicycle Club pose in front of the Parmentier Bicycle Shop at 705 Aiken Street in Little Canada in 1910 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1470357211434028">Figure 8</xref>). Jean-Marie Branchaud’s bicycle is photographed before A. Drolet’s grocery and restaurant on rue Palm in Saint-Henri on June 21, 1939 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1470357211434028">Figure 9</xref>). These photographs, taken together, also indicate to what extent economic cycles and social class affected ownership and usage.</p>

<p>The next five photographs, two from Lowell, and three from Saint-Henri, point to the gradual segregation in the use of commercial and residential streets over the course of this period and the nature of street activities conditioned by changes in transport technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1470357211434028">Figures 10</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1470357211434028">14</xref>).

Taken on March 31, 1924 by a municipal employee to register the need for repair, the camera’s eye is fixed on the uneven surface of a sidewalk along Moody Street. The streetscape and storefronts frame the photograph, with female pedestrians ambling amiably alongside parked automobiles, and a horse-drawn carriage navigating the paved street surface.</p>

<p>The subsequent photograph comes from the same collection and to document needed repairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1470357211434028">Figure 11</xref>). It conveys the contrasting atmosphere and environment of Aiken Street on 25 September 1923. The photograph points to the mixed use of a delivery truck, automobile and cart, and to the relatively unobstructed and relaxed freedom of movement on the part of the man on the street and the female walking on the sidewalk. This more congenial and less formal atmosphere is in part due to the warmer season, but also to the lack of traffic congestion on residential streets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1470357211434028">
<title>Newspaper Coverage</title>
<p>Busy commercial streets were more often the setting of accidents that serve to dramatize the competing uses of various forms of transport technologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1470357211434028">Figure 12</xref>). A 1944 photograph reveals a collision between a Saint-Henri tramway and a truck at the corner of rue Saint-Antoine and rue Sainte-Cecile. This conflicting use was often typical of newspaper photographs, whose purpose was to heighten interest or sensationalize events. Although the details are difficult to discern, it appears that the truck was obstructing the tramway lines, while, after the collision, contents strewn on the street surface obstructed passengers and passersby. Of note is the fact that the street was temporarily turned over to or controlled by pedestrians. There is no car or tram dominance.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1470357211434028">Figures 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1470357211434028">14</xref> examine the impact of the automobile and the delivery truck on the segregation of the urban streetscape, with a tension between the trucks and the pedestrian children. Conrad Poirier took these photographs. He was a professional photographer employed by Gabrielle Roy to promote the publication of her 1945 novel, <italic>Bonheur d’Occcasion</italic>, which takes place in Saint-Henri during the Second World War. He worked on a contractual basis in this period and was adept in what is referred to as <italic>la nouvelle vision</italic>, a social photography in advance of the times.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1470357211434028">7</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1470357211434028">Figure 13</xref> shows Poirier positioned on the busiest portion of rue Notre-Dame looking eastward towards downtown Montreal from the corner of Place Saint-Henri on August 29, 1945. Given that the opening scene of Roy’s novel is set in the United Store, it dominates the left of the image. The overall impression is that of an active street life which is consistent with the earlier 1905 photograph, yet this photograph is faster paced and with more children in the foreground. Despite the quicker speed of traffic, the heightened atmosphere is in part due to the introduction of more advanced photographic technology, smaller camera bodies with faster lenses, shutter speeds and adjustments.</p>
<p>In comparison with the 1905 photograph, the dominant features of the urban streetscape are the increased commercialization and density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470357211434028">Figure 4</xref>). The ubiquity of the advertisements and signs on buildings, the presence of chain stores, power lines, and more continuous commercialization downplays the mixed-use nature of the street. These large commercial buildings with their functional character dominate the streetcar/commercial/residential/brick canyon landscape. The eye is drawn down the canyon rather than allowed to range over the larger landscape; even if one tried, the buildings block such efforts.</p>
<p>This photograph more clearly displays the competing interests of the automobile, delivery truck, tramway, and electrical poles with pedestrian uses of the street. With the increasing use of the automobile in the interwar years, street regulation, traffic signals, policing of congested arteries, and parking limitations were introduced. The photograph, for instance, displays the possibility of parking on both sides of rue Notre-Dame on this given day; the delivery truck would have presumably ceded to the tramway.</p>
<p>The 1905 and 1945 photographs also suggest comparisons in the nature of the social interaction on the main street. Both photographs depict clusters of people of a similar gender and age in the foreground. The three men conversing in front of the commercial building in the 1905 photograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470357211434028">Figure 4</xref>) are more obvious proponents of a single group than the ostensibly diverse group of people who are stationary and walking below the store awning on the right of the 1945 photograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1470357211434028">Figure 13</xref>). To what extent are this density and diversity explained by the increased commercial development of the portion of rue Notre-Dame east of Place Saint-Henri in a more progressive era? Is this phenomenon symptomatic of a more widespread consumer culture by the 1940s or mere coincidence? More importantly, we have no way of determining whether Poirier has instructed his subjects to group together to capture a rare instance of working-class sociability as promotion for Roy’s novel, or if this behaviour was common on the street. Despite the growth of the population and the consolidation and increased commercialization of the main street, very few photographs reflect the bustle that one would expect. Both photographs generally depict the use of the sidewalk for conversing, with pedestrian movement on the commercial street itself despite the introduction of the automobile and delivery truck. A partial, occasional use of sidewalk or even street space, appears to have existed on commercial streets throughout this period. However, as a site of regular working-class male lingering or hanging out (youth or adults), the use of sidewalks and streets was probably more common on side streets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1470357211434028">Figure 14</xref>).</p>
<p>Photograph 14 was taken by Poirier of rue Beaudoin in Saint-Henri. His explicit aim in promoting Roy’s book was to portray a working-class community interacting, with little play space for children and adolescents in working-class neighbourhoods. Given its proximity to home, the street — particularly a <italic>cul-de-sac</italic> or dead-end street — was often the site of games and sports. Pick-up hockey games were common practice; nets were temporarily removed for passing automobiles. Taken together with Kenngott’s photographs of the activities of children in the tenement lanes of Little Canada, this photograph suggests a consistency of children playing on adjoining streets despite reform movements encouraging the construction and use of designated playgrounds to get working-class children off the streets.</p>

<p>Signifying the conjuncture of recreational horse and car travel, a proud proprietor stands before his Saint-Henri home at 122, rue Sainte-Marguerite in 1918, leaning on the wheel of a handsome horse-drawn carriage with his womenfolk comfortably ensconced in the vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1470357211434028">Figure 15</xref>). This trek emulates the daily sojourns by bourgeois 19th-century urbanites who moved about town in the privacy of horse-drawn carriages. Mr Joseph Albert, an undertaker, is posed stiffly upright in formal attire, reins in hand atop a closed horse-drawn carriage in front of his parlours on Aiken Street in Little Canada in May 1912 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1470357211434028">Figure 16</xref>). The selection and presentation of details by the anonymous photographer principally conveys the respectability of the profession, pointing to the promotional possibilities of the photograph.</p>

<p>The automobile was becoming less of ‘a rich man’s toy’, an oddity, or a luxury by the 1920s. Stephen Davies has noted that the average price of a car fell from $906 in 1921 to $695 by 1926 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470357211434028">1989</xref>: 124). The attendant alteration of the streetscape due to the greater speed and increasing distance of the automobile was accompanied by the introduction of delivery trucks for such products as milk, bread and ice, as early as 1912 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1470357211434028">Figure 6</xref>), with more widespread use by the 1930s. Gas rationing during the Second World War may have resulted in the horse transport of baked goods in Saint-Henri in 1943, long after the introduction of trucks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1470357211434028">Figure 17</xref>).</p>

<p>Mr Raoul Larin of Saint-Henri posed before his automobile with his extended family in 1917 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1470357211434028">Figure 18</xref>). The finery of their dress stands in stark contrast with the modesty of the ground floor dwelling, and the rope on the front of the car suggests that the car has been towed, or is about to be towed. With only 3.08 percent of Montrealers owning cars in 1921, Larin’s possession of a car was exceptional in this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470357211434028">Davies, 1989</xref>: 124). The <italic>porte-calèche</italic>, a space between two buildings used for a driveway (formerly used for the transportation of horse-drawn carriages in nineteenth-century Montreal), was adapted to the needs of the twentieth-century automobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-1470357211434028">Figure 19</xref>).</p>

<p>A vernacular adaptation of the <italic>porte-calèche</italic> also served as a car port in the backyard of the elaborate New England Descheneaux family home at 767 Moody Street in Lowell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-1470357211434028">Figures 20</xref>). As evidenced by Norman’s Barber Shop in the storefront below, Moody was a mixed-use commercial and residential street, with bourgeois francophone families inhabiting the western portion. Taken by well-known Lowell professional photographer, George Poirier,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1470357211434028">8</xref></sup> the quality of these photographs stands in contrast to that of the Larin family photo, which appears to have been taken by an amateur. Although the date of the Poirier photographs is not noted, the car is a Ford Model Touring Car from the 1920s. The fashion of the dress indicates that it was taken in the late 1920s or the early 1930s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470357211434028">Payne, 1965</xref>: 524–35; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470357211434028">Beaudoin-Ross, 1992</xref>: 40–7, 61–5, 86–7).</p>

<p>During World War I and the subsequent interwar period, women were invested with greater public power. Feminist historians have documented the political and economic advances made by many women on the home front and their participation in the workforce as a result of the absence of men, who were fighting on the battlefields of World War I, with some women working as nurses and clerks in the military (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470357211434028">Amott, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357211434028">Cott, 2000</xref>). This shifting transformation in gender roles is clearly and effectively portrayed in the Larin photograph. The car could be perceived as a male-dominant object, a symbol of freedom and independence in what was formerly regarded as the male public sphere. The woman with a duster and goggles who sits at the wheel appears to be ready for driving, and all but one person in the group are females. This female positioning at the wheel could signify women’s entrance into the public sphere, and the newfound emancipation that resulted from their increasing financial independence from men. This adjustment in male and female roles blends with the continuance of patriarchy. Both the male and female apparel in the Larin photograph, and to a lesser degree in the Descheneaux photographs, reflect the increasing informality, comfort and freedom characteristic of the 1920s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357211434028">Berger, 1980</xref>: 31–34; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357211434028">Schwarz, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470357211434028">Steele, 2003</xref>: Chapter 2).</p>
<p>With the ease of attaining greater distances at faster speeds than the horse-drawn carriages and trolleys, the automobile itself presented a greater degree of freedom and mobility for both men and women. As elsewhere in North American cities, the introduction of the automobile further transformed the urban street landscape of Lowell in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1470357211434028">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article is a case study of two locations that demonstrates why and how establishing the context of historical photographs can nuance an historical debate in early 20th-century urban history. The underlying argument is that when combined with written sources, contextualizing practices can narrow the gap between the objective and subjective elements of photographs. The conclusions do not support a dichotomous approach in visual history that argues either solely for photographic interpretation or only for the use of written sources. Moreover, the contextualizing approach argues for a joint treatment of visual imagery with written sources, given the penury of written sources on street sociability.</p>
<p>The photo-analysis is a methodological approach that collects, selects and classifies 133 historical photographs from archival collections and a social documentary survey. The value of these and other photographs is highly subject to the nature of the accompanying documentation on the photographers and to the purpose and conditions of the photographs.</p>
<p>The historiographical debate regards the timing and nature of social decline on early 20th-century North American streets. The analysis of 21 selected photographs shown here of Saint-Henri, Quebec and the francophone district of Lowell, Massachusetts from 1905 to 1945 challenges an alleged early decline largely attributed to the introduction of new forms of transportation. The premise of this study is that the decline was more gradual than has been suggested, with altered forms of sociability on main commercial streets and lingering social interaction and recreation on adjoining streets.</p>
<p>The photographs as a whole point to specific adaptations and responses to the introduction of the tramway, the automobile and motorized delivery vehicles, rather than to a decline in street activity and sociability. They reveal a persistence in the use of horse-drawn vehicles, the limited and recreational use of the automobile in the interwar years, greater pedestrian use of the street, and consistent play and movement, particularly on side streets, at least until the end of the Second World War. These findings challenge technological determinism and the influence of early 20th-century reform movements. Still, the increased vehicle activity, definition of traffic lanes, and numbers of accidents on commercial streets, in contrast with the less regimented and leisurely residential streets, show the beginnings of urban street segregation into high-traffic, auto-dominated main streets and low-traffic, multifunctional side streets, consistent with the Baldwin study. The photographs, taken together, at least show the possible lingering of street sociability and raise serious questions, if not direct counter-evidence, to the early decline hypothesis.</p>
