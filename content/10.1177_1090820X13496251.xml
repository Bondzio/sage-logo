<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The second edition of <italic>Dallas Rhinoplasty: Nasal Surgery by the Masters</italic> is an exceptionally comprehensive book edited by Drs Jack P. Gunter, Rod J. Rohrich, and William P. Adams Jr. The book consists of 72 chapters in 2 volumes written by 59 experienced rhinoplasty surgeons, the majority of them from the United States. The second edition continues the tradition of the first, with updated and revised chapters from the earlier edition, while 32 new and exciting chapters have been added that track recent advances in the practice of rhinoplasty. This version provides broad coverage of basic and advanced open rhinoplasty techniques with an emphasis on anatomy. In the preface, Drs Gunter, Rohrich, and Adams note that “although this book has grown as information in our field has expanded, [their] objectives remain the same—to assist the nasal surgeon in attaining consistent results using careful preoperative analysis, precise operative planning, meticulous intraoperative execution, and long-term follow-up with critical evaluation of results.”</p>
<p>The book’s 10 sections cover all primary and revision rhinoplasty concepts: basic perioperative strategies, basic surgical techniques, the dorsum, the tip, the alar base, the chin, secondary rhinoplasty, management of airway dysfunction, and special topics and advances. The final section presents personal approaches and philosophies from 7 leading rhinoplasty surgeons: Jack P. Gunter, Rod J. Rohrich, Dean M. Toriumi, Bahman Guyuron, Ronald P. Gruber, Mark B. Constantian, and H. Steve Byrd.</p>
<p>In addition to the text, there are 3 accompanying instructional DVDs: “Cadaveric Demonstration of Rhinoplasty Techniques,” “Open Approach to Primary Rhinoplasty,” and “Rhinoplasty: Using Autologous Rib Cartilage.”</p>

<title>Strengths</title>
<p>The book provides great descriptions of basic and advanced rhinoplasty techniques, particularly through the open approach. The text is easy to read, and the graphics are a unifying element throughout the book, providing a unique roadmap through the operative plan. Dr Gunter’s color-coded graphic diagrams, which have become the standard in demonstrating how a rhinoplasty procedure is planned and performed, illustrate the necessary steps for each case. These excellent illustrations and photographs make the text easily understandable for the novice. Each chapter also concludes with highlighted “key points” for rapid review and reference. The accompanying DVDs deliver a dynamic supplement to the written material, with anatomic dissections and demonstrations of surgical techniques.</p>
<p>In terms of content strengths, the first section of the book provides detailed information on basic terminology, nasal anatomy, preoperative analysis, and planning. The preoperative analysis and planning chapters of this section are exceptional and demonstrate how to evaluate the nose and the face to make a precise operative plan to achieve a predictable outcome. The section covering the nasal tip is the strongest portion of book. Increasing and decreasing tip projection, adjusting rotation of the nasal tip, tip suture techniques, correction of alar cartilage deformities, tip grafts, and septal extension grafts for tip control are discussed in depth. The chapters within this section are well organized and include excellent illustrations. All critical issues regarding tip surgery are addressed in a practical algorithm. Another strength is the section covering secondary rhinoplasty, which covers surgical correction of dorsal deformities, reconstruction of septal cartilage, and alar cartilage defects. The chapters about the reconstruction of nasal tip cartilages and structural grafting in secondary rhinoplasty are also outstanding.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the most interesting part of the book is the section covering special topics and advances, including correction of a long nose, lengthening of a short nose, autospreader flaps, aging noses, the male nose, cleft lip nasal deformity, management of a “cocaine nose,” and prevention and management of rhinoplasty complications. There are also 4 additional chapters on different ethnic noses. The special attention paid to these nonwhite noses makes the book a universal reference for all rhinoplasty surgeons.</p>

<title>Weaknesses</title>
<p>Although this is one of the most comprehensive textbooks written on rhinoplasty to date, some additional topics should have been covered, and there are some areas I wish were addressed in greater detail. Spreader flaps are one of the most useful recent developments in rhinoplasty surgery for restoring the dorsum after hump reduction and have became a routine tool for many rhinoplasty surgeons. Although there is a chapter in this edition on autospreader flaps, it does not show the detailed suture techniques of spreader flaps, and modifications are not discussed. Also, with increasing numbers of secondary rhinoplasty patients, a surgical emphasis is required for irregular nasal dorsum deformities. Camouflage methods using fascia grafts or diced cartilage and fascia grafts in selected primary or secondary rhinoplasty cases are not mentioned in the text. Extracorporeal reconstruction of septal cartilage is an effective technique in the correction of severe deviations, but this method is not mentioned in the text. Additionally, caudal septal replacement grafts for severe caudal L-strut deviations are not discussed.</p>
<p>Last, fascia-wrapped diced cartilage grafting is a versatile method in dorsum augmentation in both primary and secondary rhinoplasty. Additional discussion of dorsal reconstruction in complicated cases that did not benefit from the conventional block-cartilage dorsal reconstruction methods would have been helpful, but I am sure that this topic will be an invaluable addition to future editions of this book.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>I believe that the second edition of <italic>Dallas Rhinoplasty: Nasal Surgery by the Masters</italic> is an exceptional textbook that offers young surgeons a welcome resource for consistent nasal terminology, principles, and guidelines for functional evaluation and preoperative planning, as well as detailed surgical techniques for the open approach. It is probably the most comprehensive book written on rhinoplasty to date and is an essential reference book for any surgeon who performs rhinoplasty.</p>
