<p>This book offers an extremely important perspective on cosmopolitanism. By viewing it as something to be strived for, something to be achieved through human (artistic) effort, it offers a welcome antidote to the current tendency to view cosmopolitanism as something already existing and routine. It therefore eschews the temptations of cosmopolitan realism – cosmopolitanism is all around us, the key thing is to recognize it and to accept its existence – a variant of cosmopolitanism which has become popular because of the ways in which it has been appropriated by sociologists such as Beck and Delanty. The upshot is that cosmopolitanism is widely viewed as the most important intellectual framework ‘for addressing the impact of global mobility and the new modes of transnational communication’ (p. 85). On this reading cosmopolitanism becomes subordinated to mobility and takes the form of a reflexive evaluation of how our everyday experiences are shaped by transnational networks of communication.</p>
<p>This is insufficient for Papastergiadis for whom cosmopolitanism is not (only) to be found in the major tectonic shifts occurring in the contemporary period – transformations in economy and society underpinned by global networks and planetary interconnectedness. Cosmopolitanism also inheres in new ‘micro-connections’ that are always constructed in specific places. Cosmopolitanism comes into existence when we relate to ‘the Other’, and this can take the form of mundane practices and interactions with strangers. In other words, for Papastergiadis cosmopolitanism is about making common cause with distant others, framing encounters with strangers, and forging the possibility of a common, shared humanity, all of which can be accomplished at the level of the everyday.</p>
<p>The book is also excellent at identifying the problems to which the ‘cosmopolitan imagination’ may offer a solution. Papastergiadis holds that our common experience of globalization – dominated as it is by motifs of terrorism and migration – has left us with a culture of ambient fear resulting in ‘new modes of stigmatization and the collapse in the spaces for hospitality’ (p. 56). In other words, in our post-9/11 world we are encouraged to believe that we live in dangerous times characterized by the threat posed by the next wave of terrorist attacks and the ever-present dangers posed by migrants. In such a world we seek to constantly identify new Others and securitize every issue, turning humanitarian crises into potential security threats. In short, on this way of thinking our everyday lives do not easily lend themselves to genuine cosmopolitan encounters.</p>
<p>Papastergiadis is very strong on the cosmo-political role of art. Not simply offering a critical eye or merely a glimpse of emergent or oppositional practices, art offers the possibility of imagining societal alternatives – another key role for the cosmopolitan imagination. Pursuing a theme introduced across his earlier published work on cosmopolitanism, art and hospitality, Papastergiadis allows art a role in the development of cosmopolitan ideas, against the politics of fear. Artists’ engagement with politics normally takes the form of ‘revealing the flawed means by which the politics of fear are defined’ (p. 14). More constructively, in the contemporary context artists have opposed divisive politics by ‘initiating new modes of exchange between strangers and generating alternative conceptual frameworks for organizing collective action … art has become a medium for reconstituting the social’ (p. 14). In other words, contemporary art does not merely reflect the contradictions of globalization but is also a constitutive force in the production of a cosmopolitan imaginary.</p>
<p>Papastergiadis offers an extended critique of ‘network society’ and mobility-based accounts of cosmopolitanism. He is particularly keen to challenge the idea that the ‘networked world’ image is the best way of characterizing the current period. Rather than a world of networks and places, Papastergiadis offers the image of ‘lines and clusters’ (p. 199). The cluster is a gathering of lines, not formed in opposition to networks but a reorganization of forms of connectivity. The thin edges of a network are turned into ‘a thick environment of nested possibilities’ (p. 199). The cluster, imagined in this way, captures the ways in which artistic encounters create shared social spaces. This subtle critique of the network society motif, despite re-introducing an inside/outside distinction, allows for a mutually productive relationship between places and networks and one which is not in thrall to mobilities. It also allows for a high degree of human agency, clustering being the product of an experience of networked exteriority coupled with cultural encounters of a cosmopolitan kind.</p>
<p>Papastergiadis has written a book which deserves a wide readership across the social sciences. It would be a shame if the title of the book positioned it as a cultural studies text of interest only to those studying contemporary artistic practices. Papastergiadis claims not that art offers an alternative perspective on cosmopolitanism but that art, and the alternative visions of the world which it is capable of generating, are constitutive elements of the ‘cosmopolitan imagination’.</p>
