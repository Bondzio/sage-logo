<p>Evidencing the effectiveness of speech, language and communication interventions continues to be a challenge for both researchers and practitioners who work with children and young people with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN). The use of case study design as a methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions, and the value of their contribution to the evidence base, is often not recognized. In this editorial, the merits of case study design as a robust and achievable methodology for practitioners to use to evidence the effectiveness of their interventions are discussed.</p>
<p><italic>Child Language Teaching and Therapy</italic> has published a number of case studies or case series reports over the years. Some case studies have been descriptive, with the aim of explicating aspects of a child’s difficulties. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265659012457766">Carvey and Bernhardt (2009)</xref> used a framework for profiling intentional communication to describe the skills of a child with a rare genetic syndrome, thus adding to the literature on this particular disorder. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0265659012457766">Worth and Reynolds (2008)</xref> presented detailed assessment findings of a boy with Asperger’s syndrome and showed how these enabled a better understanding of the nature of his difficulties. The findings were explored in relation to the research literature and the implication for assessment practices and for intervention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265659012457766">Murphy and Dodd (2010)</xref> used assessment findings from the case of a child with a hearing impairment and a non-dominant language home background to discuss diagnostic criteria for specific language impairment.</p>
<p>Whilst this type of case study is useful for illuminating our understanding of children with SLCN, it neither aims, nor is designed, to evaluate interventions. However, case study research that includes some element of experimental control can and does contribute to the evidence base for speech, language and communication interventions. Within a hierarchy of evidence composed of five levels, the highest is systematic reviews, and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, single case studies and case study series are ranked at level 2, above observation and expert opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659012457766">Sackett et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265659012457766">Logan et al. (2008)</xref> also present levels of evidence for single case research, from those that are designed to prove causal inference of the effects of intervention, to those that can hint at or suggest causal inference. These experimental case studies are known by a number of terms, such as single subject design, single subject research, single case design/research and <italic>n</italic> of 1. The design can include more than one individual receiving the same intervention reported as a case series or case study series. Each participant serves as his or her own control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265659012457766">Horner et al., 2005</xref>). Studies such as these have been and are published in <italic>Child Language Teaching and Therapy</italic> and can make an important contribution to the evidence base.</p>
<p>Case studies aiming to evaluate interventions need to move beyond descriptive analysis to employing rigorous research methodology. They will usually have a hypothesis or research question. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265659012457766">Baylis and Snowling (2012)</xref> present three research questions, one of which is: ‘Will the programme promote gains in alphabetic skills?’ (p. 41). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265659012457766">McIntosh and Dodd (2009)</xref> ‘hypothesized that Core Vocabulary intervention would remediate inconsistency in all three children’ (the individual participants of the study) (p. 14). There is one or more dependent variable, the independent variable being the intervention and the dependent variable being the behaviour expected to change as a result of the intervention. Data is collected repeatedly before, sometimes during, and after the intervention, and is often plotted on graphs to observe changes in the dependent variable. Repeated baseline measurement before the intervention, which is stable, showing no change in the behaviour, can be particularly useful for evaluating effects of intervention in children. It can counteract the argument that change during an intervention is an effect of development or maturation. If there has been little or no change on a measure over a period prior to a particular intervention being implemented and then change during or after an intervention, a stronger claim can be made that the intervention has had an effect. Where appropriate, statistical analysis can also be applied to the data from case studies.</p>
<p>Many case studies utilize AB-type research designs. The dependent variable (A) is tracked and intervention (B) is implemented. If there is a change in the dependent variable, then the assumption is that intervention has an effect. A reversal or ABA design is considered to be more powerful than an AB study, as this can show whether the dependent variable returns to baseline when intervention is withdrawn. This design may be suitable for evaluating pharmacological interventions, but is not useful in evaluating educational or speech and language interventions, when some effects of intervention cannot be reversed (or unlearned), nor would we want them to be. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265659012457766">McNeill et al. (2009)</xref> evaluate the use of a phonological awareness programme in a case series of 12 children with childhood apraxia of speech. The dependent variables measured speech and phoneme awareness three times before the intervention started, at alternate sessions during the intervention period, and three times after the intervention. Visual representation of the data was presented for inspection, and statistical analysis was carried out to demonstrate significant change in most participants on the speech measure and for some participants on a phoneme awareness measure.</p>
<p>A multiple-baseline design across participants is an AB design with staggered starts in which the same behaviour (dependent variable) is measured in different individuals who start the intervention at different times. Measures can be plotted on a graph to show change made in the first individual to start the intervention but not in other individuals, and change in the second and third individual and so on as they also commence the intervention. Another use of a multiple-baseline design is across behaviours in the same individual. Two or more dependent variables measure different behaviours. The intervention is targeted first at one behaviour and then at another, with the expectation of change in each behaviour as intervention for that behaviour is implemented. An evaluation of the use of the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) for two children with autism spectrum disorders, using a multiple baseline across behaviours, was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0265659012457766">Travis and Geiger (2010)</xref>. The authors hypothesized that there would be an increase in requesting during Phase 1 of PECS training, an increase in length of verbal utterances at Phase IV and in commenting at Phase VI. These three dependent variables were tracked twice weekly for three weeks before intervention started, over nine weeks of intervention and for two weeks after the intervention. Graphs of the data across time clearly show an increase in requesting when Phase 1 began, whilst commenting did not increase until Phase VI commenced. Non-parametric statistical analysis confirmed the intervention effects on these behaviours.</p>
<p>An alternating-treatments design contrasts two or more interventions presented in succession, A<sub>1</sub>BA<sub>2</sub>C, in which A is the baseline or period of no intervention, B is one intervention and C is another. Use of this design evaluated melodic intonation therapy and the touch-cue method in a participant with childhood apraxia of speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265659012457766">Martikainen and Korpilahti, 2011</xref>). The dependent variables were measured twice before intervention (A<sub>1</sub>), at the end of intervention 1 (B), after a further period of no intervention (A<sub>2</sub>), again at the end of intervention 2 (C), and finally as a follow-up measure some weeks later. Measures were plotted on graphs to show changes over the time of the study, and statistical analyses were carried out to evaluate the effects of each of the intervention periods.</p>
<p>Experimental control can also be exerted in single case research by including one or more dependent variables not expected to improve as a result of intervention, such as untreated items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659012457766">Pring, 2005</xref>). In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265659012457766">McNeill et al. (2009)</xref> described above, a control measure was included of a speech error pattern that was not targeted within the phonological awareness programme. Results showed change in targeted error patterns, but not in the control measure, supporting the claim that intervention was effective. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265659012457766">Norbury and Chiat (2000)</xref> report an intervention to improve reading accuracy in an 8-year-old boy with language impairment. The dependent variable was the reading of 89 written words that were not accurately decoded prior to the intervention. Twenty-three of these words were directly targeted in intervention activities; 23 foils appeared alongside target words but no direct reference was made to them; 43 control words were not included in activities at all. Post-intervention there were significant differences in the child’s ability to read the target words versus the foils and in reading the foils versus control words. In addition, standardized assessments of skills not expected to improve confirmed a specific effect of intervention rather than maturation over the intervention period.</p>
<p>Case studies are not considered to be generalizable across the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659012457766">Pring, 2005</xref>) because one case study cannot represent a particular group of children. However, they do provide the practitioner with the opportunity to engage in evidence-based practice in ‘real life’ contexts. Case study research offers the practitioner a detailed and in-depth analysis of the effects of an intervention at the level of the individual. Interventions can be tailored to the individual’s needs and individual responses to the intervention can be analysed. Case studies are an achievable means by which practitioners can evaluate their interventions without the need to recruit large groups of children to intervention and control groups and other procedures, which are usually beyond the remit of practitioners to implement in their everyday working contexts of nurseries, schools and other health and educational services.</p>
<p>Replications of case studies across different settings and different individuals will increase external validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265659012457766">Horner et al., 2005</xref>). There are resources available to support the robust design and reporting of case studies. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265659012457766">Horner et al. (2005)</xref> provide objective criteria for evaluating single case research and guidelines about how case studies should be reported. These include:</p>

</list>
<p>Robust and rigorous case studies are a valuable component of the evidence base for children with SLCN. <italic>Child Language Teaching and Therapy</italic> encourages the publication of case study research, given the limited evidence base available for educational and clinical interventions in child speech, language and communication impairments.</p>
