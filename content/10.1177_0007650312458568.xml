<title>From the Editor</title>
<p>December 2012 contains a special dissertation forum and three research articles, which broadly concern aspects of stakeholder theory. The three finalists for the best dissertation award of the Social Issues in Management (SIM) division of the Academy of Management in August 2011 prepared abstracts of their dissertations and also a brief reflection essay on their experiences in preparing dissertations. Dr. K. Praveen Parboteeah, University of Wisconsin–Whitewater, chair of the dissertation award committee, has provided an introductory essay for the forum, which appears at the end of this issue. The abstracts represent the doctoral dissertations, in alphabetical order, of Dr. Darline Augustine (PhD, London School of Economics), Dr. Joel Marcus (PhD, Wilfrid Laurier University), and Dr. Judith Schrempf (Université de Lausanne). Dr. Augustine was winner of the 2011 award.</p>
<p>The first research article, by Edward T. Walker, of the University of California, Los Angeles, concerns “Putting a Face on the Issue: Corporate Stakeholder Mobilization in Professional Grassroots Lobbying Campaigns.” The study investigates the expanded influence of stakeholders on the strategies, legitimacy, and competitiveness of firms. Using a unique, original data source, the author assesses the determinants of adoption of grassroots lobbying by a firm. The most significant factor is the firm’s degree of inside lobbying, reflecting that politically active firms diversify sources of influence.</p>
<p>The second research article, by Christian Frankel and Erik Højbjerg, of the Copenhagen Business School, is entitled “The Political Standardizer.” The article provides a framework for demonstrating that corporate technical activity and corporate political activity can overlap substantially or intertwine in ways that prove quite difficult to tease apart analytically. A “political standardizer” is a company that uses technical standardization as a political strategy. The article provides an interesting case study of Lego, the Danish toy producer.</p>
<p>The third research article, by James Weber and Kathryn A. Marley, Duquesne University, is titled “In Search of Stakeholder Salience: Exploring Corporate Social and Sustainability Reports.” The article draws on the stakeholder salience framework (power, legitimacy, and urgency) to study the web of business–stakeholder relationships involved in the <italic>Fortune</italic> Global 100’s corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports.</p>
