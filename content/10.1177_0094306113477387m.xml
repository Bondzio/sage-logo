<italic>Chicanas of 18th Street</italic> is the result of a collaborative project documenting the activism of six Chicanas. This book is based on these women’s personal stories and their path to political activism. During the 1960s and 1970s, the demographics of Chicago’s Pilsen neighborhood began to change. Eastern Europeans left the neighborhood and Mexican-origin settlers arrived. What was once a bohemian center became Casa Aztlán, a community-based organization that housed adult-education programs, art studios, and a health clinic; and it offered a space for community gatherings crucial for the development of a political network. Even though their individual paths to Pilsen and to “el Comité” were different, all of them became involved in a Pilsen community political network during the 1970s. The network mobilized the community to political participation.</p>
<p>A unifying theme emerges from the narrative of these women. They describe how racial prejudices and segregation affected both their personal lives and their communities. They felt alienated by the U.S. mainstream, yet they did not identify with Mexico or as Mexicans. Through their political involvement and social activism, these women were empowered to carve out an identity as Chicanas. In addition to developing a collective identity, their activism provided a channel to express their discontent with the social, racial, and economic inequality they experienced in their daily lives.</p>
<p>Participating in local politics for these women meant more than marching and protesting, as they saw their community involvement as a form of political and social activism. Some of the women formed a picket line to demand the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) to hire Mexican-origin drivers. Isaura González travelled with farmworker organizers and picketed in front of grocery stores in the city. María Gamboa and Victoria Pérez became involved with “Compañía Trucha,” a theater company whose members saw themselves as popular educators. Cristina Vital and her partner founded “Librería Nuestro Continente” (Our Continent Bookstore), a Chicano bookstore in Chicago that sold books in English and Spanish. The bookstore also had a room to hold events or meetings, offered English lessons, and screened films after which the owners encouraged discussions.</p>
<p>Leonard Ramírez, et alia, produced this book with the purpose of furnishing young social justice activists and scholars with a secondary source of information to initiate the study of the political activism of this period. Their book will appeal to scholars and a general audience interested in oral history, social movements, stratification, gender studies, and Latino/a studies.</p>
