<abstract>
<p>The ethical provision of psychological aid following international disasters is influenced by cultural factors and questions about how to effectively promote social justice. A need for holistic, systemic postdisaster mental health approaches has been identified (Wessells, 2009). This article presents a systemic epistemology superimposed on a social justice framework as a model for conceptualizing ethical service delivery in international disaster psychology. Implications of three underlying conceptual perspectives in international mental health ethics—<italic>absolutism, relativism</italic>, and <italic>universalism</italic>—are discussed. A case example is provided that illustrates how a family systems epistemology offers a flexible, integrated way to understand the <italic>universalist</italic> approach while placing social justice concerns relevant to international disaster psychology into a nested model, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

<body>
<p>The increased mobility of psychologists and other mental health care professionals on a global level, and the increased use of professional psychological treatment worldwide, have begun to raise questions about the ethics of psychological delivery on an international scale. One of the engines that has fueled the increase in global mobility and service delivery of psychology has been a growing emphasis on mental health care in disaster relief. In recent years, there have been an increasing number of articles calling for an international code of ethics for psychology, a focus on multicultural sensitivity, mindfulness to the perils of creating relief aid dependencies in developing countries, and a critical eye to the delivery of mental health services in a disaster milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765612444880">Wessells, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The difficulty in addressing these multiple concerns with regard to international mental health aid is that they comprise everything from individual and family issues to issues that are more communal, regional, or national in scope. Only a systemic and ecological approach can tackle the complex problem of tying all of these disparate concerns together into a cohesive whole, recognizing that the smallest individual concerns and the largest national policies reciprocally affect one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765612444880">Engel, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534765612444880">Thoburn, Tandy, Bentley, &amp; Stewart, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the issue of intercultural differences in the societal emphasis placed on the individual and the collective, for example, can create dissonance between foreign service delivery steeped in one cultural milieu and the reception of this aid by survivors raised in a different cultural context.</p>
<p>There must be a standard to which all regions or countries are expected to adhere, while at the same time offering flexibility to allow regions their unique cultural distinctiveness. We suggest that a universalist approach with a focus on social justice, where ethics codes are similar but unique, offers general parameters for ethical conduct and leeway in how justice is carried out culture by culture. By social justice, we mean that all members of society are given fair and just treatment and that society is socially constructed to meet the needs of every population group within its purview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765612444880">Rawls, 1999</xref>). A social justice model draws from areas conceptualized as distributive, procedural, economic, and political derived from core fundamental human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534765612444880">Rohl &amp; Machura, 1997</xref>). A social justice model also uses a systems epistemology, where norms are understood to coexist as nested systems, from the individual microsystem to the regional macrosystem, each affecting the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612444880">Bronfenbrenner, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534765612444880">Thoburn et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the effectiveness of systemic mental health praxis in dealing with diverse cultural realities is strengthened when combined with a social justice stance, in sum creating a universal platform for a code that all cultures can agree on while remaining flexible enough to maintain respect for global diversity. In this article, we will explore this systemic and ecological approach to international disaster psychology by using a social justice framework.</p>
<p>To illuminate the concepts for our proposed model, we will define and discuss each of its constituent parts (i.e., international ethics, a family psychology/systems paradigm, and a social justice model) and then reconstitute the parts into a holistic model pertaining to disaster psychology. Case examples from a variety of disaster situations will be used to illustrate points, but we will rely primarily on a specific case vignette of Srebrenican dairy farmers in Bosnia throughout the article, as a means of illustrating a social justice perspective encompassed by a systems epistemology. The background of the case vignette is as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>During the Bosnian civil war of the 1990s, a group of Srebrenican dairy farmers was ethnically cleansed from their ancestral homeland. Forced into the interior of Bosnia, they eventually occupied an abandoned village, not knowing if the owner-inhabitants would return at the cessation of hostilities. The area around the village was thought to be rife with Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), and, in fact, there were incidents where sheep were killed in the surrounding fields after inadvertently detonating mines. In addition to the distress of the loss of their homeland and the loss of loved ones as victims of the war, the daily stress of squatting in a village that was not theirs, and the fear of simply walking around the land safely, the farmers were unable to pursue their livelihood because they had no dairy cattle and were forced instead to subsist by growing potatoes and onions.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<sec id="section1-1534765612444880">
<title>International Ethics</title>
<p>Ethics encompasses what is right and wrong in human behavior and conduct. A universally accepted code of ethics must be one that is culturally sensitive; the practitioner recognizes that differences as well as similarities exist between cultures and relates in a value-neutral manner. Likewise, an international code of disaster psychology ethics must be mindful of a personal code of conduct that reflects good character and also must resonate with the diversity of cultures likely to be encountered. The combination of practicing cultural sensitivity and focusing on ethical behavior from a social justice perspective creates cultural competence or the knowledge, behaviors, attitudes, and practices needed to operate in a cross-cultural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765612444880">Cross, Bazron, Dennis, &amp; Isaacs, 1989</xref>). For example, culturally sensitive delivery of disaster mental health service might recognize cultural differences in religion between caregivers and survivors and the ethical mandate to offer aid no matter what the survivor’s religious orientation is. In the case vignette, the caregivers were all Christians whereas the dairy farming villagers were Muslims. One of the issues driving the Bosnian conflict was a difference of religion, so it was important for the caregivers to be sensitive in this area.</p>
<p>Although no current psychological code of conduct explicitly addresses issues of social justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765612444880">Pettifor, 2004</xref>), psychologists and other health care practitioners are expected to acknowledge social responsibility and neither engage in or condone behavior that is abusive or that violates human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612444880">Blickle, 2004</xref>). However, ethical ambiguities in international disaster relief can present professional and clinical dilemmas for Western practitioners providing psychological support in areas of the world that may hold differing views of wellness and mental health. For example, relief organizations were presented with the dilemma of offering retraining to fishermen in southern India following the 2005 tsunami when the caste system would not allow them to change trades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612444880">Dalit Network Netherlands, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534765612444880">Fertig, Foster, &amp; Nicholas, 2005</xref>). In Japan, following the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear catastrophe of 2011, there was as much energy given to presenting a strong united, resourceful front to the public as there was to meeting survivor needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765612444880">Radford, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>One reason for this perceived discrepancy is that modern formulations of psychology are derived largely from Western concepts. Communication of research and practice is almost entirely in English. The majority of scholarly works on psychology are published in the United States; psychology has a significant presence in only 47 out of 129 countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765612444880">Adair, Coelho, &amp; Luna, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765612444880">Pettifor, 2004</xref>). However, psychology is expanding into other countries and psychologists in non-Western countries are often educated at Western universities where they learn about Western codes of ethics. Interestingly, in the revision of its code of ethics, the American Psychological Association (APA) deleted the principle of social responsibility that was included in the 1992 version of the code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612444880">APA, 2002</xref>). Some countries’ mental health codes, however, still retain a focus on social responsibility. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765612444880">Canadian Psychological Association (2000)</xref> expects psychologists to base social advocacy activities on a foundation of knowledge and ethical principles. Psychiatry’s Declaration of Madrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612444880">World Psychiatric Association, 2005</xref>) and Social Work’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612444880"><italic>International Federation of Social Workers</italic>, 2004</xref>) Second Draft Ethics in Social Work Statement of Principles are committed to promoting social justice. The Feminist Therapy Code of Ethics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765612444880">Chappell, 1999</xref>) is even more proactive and specific in addressing social change. Psychological organizations that perceive individual problems as socially constructed or that identify suffering with oppressive aspects of society are more likely to embrace issues of social justice.</p>
<p>If codes of ethics are transplanted to another culture, to what extent are the values and the standards consistent with actual practice? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612444880">Berry, Poortinga, Segall, and Dasen (1992)</xref> suggest that there are three perspectives that guide the shaping of ethics: an <italic>absolute</italic> perspective that sees no differences between cultures, a <italic>relativist</italic> perspective, which requires that each culture develop its own ethical standards, and a <italic>universalist</italic> approach which suggests that while underlying ethical issues may be similar from culture to culture, they will be apprehended differently by each culture and therefore require a similar, but unique ethical code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534765612444880">Pedersen, 1995</xref>). The apparent conflict between universality of ethical principles and respect for diversity by practitioners raises crucial questions: How to adhere to one’s own ethical guidelines and not disregard the local values and norms of those served? How to practice without disrespecting or disregarding local values? How to ensure respect for local culture and peoples, yet remain true to ethical guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765612444880">Okasha, Arboleda-Florez, &amp; Sartorius, 2000</xref>)? The following story relayed to the first author regarding the reason why foreign practitioners are not allowed to practice in some parts of India without close supervision illustrates this point.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A British psychiatrist with an expertise in couples counseling was invited to lead a couples therapy group in the Tamil Nadu region of India, where he advised one conflicted couple that there was no hope for their marriage and that they simply needed to divorce. His encouragement was all they needed; however, when they divorced there was outrage from their respective families about the ethics of his intervention (his focus on what he thought was good for the couple rather than their respective families), leading eventually to the psychiatrist’s ouster from the country and the passing of an ensuing law against outsiders who might offer advice that is radically counter to the collectivist culture of India. (J. W. Thoburn, personal communication, August 12, 2003)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Our case vignette of the Srebrenican dairy farmers also offers a similar example of cultural dissonance.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>During a meeting with the men in the village, one American psychologist began to ask specific diagnostic questions to ascertain for symptoms of PTSD. The farmers had no idea what he was talking about; he was eventually edged outside the circle. The other American psychologists focused on the farmers sharing stories about their ancestral homeland and eventually the war and their losses.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As psychology expands in non-Western countries, a process of syncretistic indigenization is taking place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612444880">Church &amp; Katigbak, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534765612444880">Mpofu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765612444880">Pettifor, 2004</xref>). The International Union of Psychological Science (IUPsyS), a tripartite union of the IUPsyS, the International Association of Applied Psychology, and the International Association for Cross-Cultural Psychology, has drafted universal principles for ethical international psychological practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534765612444880">IUPsyS, 1976</xref>). The mission of the IUPsyS is to articulate<disp-quote>
<p>Principles and values that provide a common moral framework for psychologists throughout the world, and that can be used as a moral justification and guide for the development of differing standards as appropriate for differing cultural contexts. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534765612444880">IUPsyS, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534765612444880">Russell, 1984</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The IUPsyS consists of 71 member nations and lists 44 member codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612444880">Leach &amp; Harbin, 1997</xref>). While every country’s individual ethical standard has aspirational values and codes of conduct, each varies according to culture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612444880">Leach and Harbin (1997)</xref> conducted a study analyzing the various country codes in relation to similarities with the APA’s code of ethics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612444880">APA, 2002</xref>). The IUPsyS lists the 44 codes according to percentage of similarities, and, as might be expected, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612444880">Leach and Harbin (1997)</xref> found that Western countries were most similar to APA’s code of ethics whereas Eastern or developing countries’ codes were least similar. For example, in contrast with the more individualistically oriented West, Asian cultures tend to prioritize ethics in terms of the nation, community, family, and, last, the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765612444880">Pettifor, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>With a nod to the universalist perspective, the IUPsyS is seeking through a strategic plan to develop an international code of ethics. A universalist perspective takes the position that an international code of psychological ethics must focus on the commonalities of people from diverse regions of the world. Commonalities exist for current codes worldwide, including <italic>respect</italic> for the dignity and rights of persons, <italic>caring</italic> for others and concerns for their welfare, as well as <italic>competence, integrity</italic>, professional, scientific, and <italic>social responsibility</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612444880">Gauthier, 2005</xref>). Building on this, an international code of psychological ethics must focus on character rather than principles, health as well as pathology, transcultural ideals of collectivism, and community as well as individual support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765612444880">Pettifor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534765612444880">Thoburn et al., 2007</xref>). However, the efforts of the IUPsyS have been undertaken with recognition that the development of a unified code of ethics may perpetually be confounded by historical and cultural differences among other concerns.</p>
<p>Finally, no current psychological codes speak directly to ethical conduct and guidance within disaster situations. For example, there are currently no specified rights of international disaster victims with regard to confidentiality. The Inter-Agency Standing Committee’s (IASC) task force on mental health and psychosocial support in emergency settings has recently developed a set of core guidelines for international work in disaster settings: (a) promoting human rights and equity, (b) maximizing participation of locals in disaster response, (c) doing no harm, (d) emphasizing capacity building of indigenous resources, (e) integrating systemic support, and (f) using multilayered systems of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612444880">IASC, 2007</xref>). These guidelines represent a fledgling move to bring to bear ethical practice in the disaster milieu.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1534765612444880">
<title>Family Psychology/Systems Paradigm</title>
<p>The term <italic>social justice</italic> suggests that all persons in a society are given fair and just treatment and also that society is shaped to meet the physical and psychological needs for the security of all groups within its boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534765612444880">Adams, Bell, &amp; Griffin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765612444880">Rawls, 1999</xref>). Noted among the IASC core principles was that ethical conduct in disaster settings is integrated <italic>ecological</italic> and <italic>systemic</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612444880">IASC, 2007</xref>). Social justice in a disaster setting is composed of a social ecology of interlocking factors that include human rights at a micro level, procedural justice at a mesolevel with political and economic justice at the macro level. Variables specific to a particular disaster such as preparedness, immediacy, and time as the event affect individuals as well as familial and, more broadly, community processes. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765612444880">Wessells (2009)</xref> noted, “Most seasoned emergency practitioners … take a public health approach that … recognizes not only individual needs but also the importance of intertwined social ecologies such as families, communities, and societies” (p. 846). <italic>Family psychology</italic> is often defined in terms of population (i.e., families), but family psychology actually refers to its systems epistemology, where thoughts, knowledge, and information are conceptualized under a contextual paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534765612444880">Stanton, 2009</xref>). The most efficient way to consider the needs of individuals and families, communities, and nations together is from a family psychology paradigm, which is both systemic and ecological. By systemic, we mean recognizing the interpersonal contextual world in which the individual is embedded. By ecological, we mean the recognition that social embeddedness occurs within nested environmental systems from the micro-level individual to the macro-level global community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612444880">Bronfenbrenner, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534765612444880">Stanton, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In Bosnia the issues and stressors the dairy farmers faced were (a) personal: each had lost loved ones, each grieved over the loss of his or her ancestral homeland, each displayed grief and self-esteem issues over loss of livelihood, and each had persistent fears regarding unexploded land mines as well as the possible return of the village’s owner-inhabitants (fear of being ousted again), (b) interpersonal: many couples experienced marital conflict due to both extreme daily stress and posttraumatic stress, (c) communal: the villagers shared a communal sense of helplessness and an almost tunneled community focus on obtaining dairy cattle for the village, and (d) regional: the farmers were affected by Serbia undercutting Bosnian dairy prices and driving small dairy farmers out of business.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A systems paradigm further delineates the rules that govern systems: Systems embody reciprocity, each member of a system as well as each system influences one another, and systems are organismic and adaptable to change. For example, disaster-aid organizations can inadvertently create resource dependencies in developing regions, which ironically helps those aid organizations maintain their need to exist. Systems are social constructions, that is, people create cultures and cultures create people, and each may change as the result of necessity. Systems are temporal entities, both existing in the moment and influenced by the past and by future projections. For example, in Tangshan, China, it was the custom for generations that widows refrain from remarrying, but following the devastating earthquake of 2005 resulting in a high number of deaths, the cultural imperative was relaxed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612444880">Chen, Dai, &amp; Parnell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534765612444880">Stanton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534765612444880">Thoburn et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Family psychology provides a heuristic for conceptualizing the impact of embedded sociopolitical factors such as poverty or famine as well as concurrent contextual factors specific to a disastrous event such as the reciprocal and interlocking relationship between disaster-aid entities and both survivors and nonsurvivors (i.e., those outside the disaster zone who are directly or indirectly affected by disaster aid). A systems perspective brings into stark relief the impact on individuals and families of the structures, policies, and procedures of larger organizational, political, and governmental entities, and issues of social justice, that is, issues of human rights, such as confidentiality and economic issues around the allocation of aid resources.</p>

<sec id="section3-1534765612444880">
<title>A Nested Social Justice Model</title>
<p>A systems paradigm creates a nested social justice model, which allows a greater sense of cultural competence when making ethical decisions. These social justice norms make sense when organized into nested systems, each affecting the others in reciprocal fashion, each norm adaptive (socially constructed) to the unique cultural milieu of a specific disaster region during a specific disaster phase. When political or legal institutions fail to protect individuals’ fundamental rights and liberties, members of the unjustly treated group feel disempowered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534765612444880">Wehr, Burgess, &amp; Burgess, 1994</xref>). They are likely to view the institutions that impose such conditions as unjust and thus find themselves in the midst of a justice conflict where human rights, the international norms that help protect all people everywhere from severe political, legal, and social abuses, are violated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534765612444880"><italic>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</italic>, 2009</xref>). <italic>Procedural justice</italic> refers to the idea of fairness in the processes that resolve disputes around the allocation of resources, that is, the fairness in the way decisions are reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534765612444880">Rohl &amp; Machura, 1997</xref>). <italic>Political injustice</italic> involves the violation of individual liberties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534765612444880">Wehr et al., 1994</xref>). Such injustice often stems from unfair procedures, where some but not others are allowed to have voice and representation in the processes and decisions that affect them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612444880">Deutsch, 2000</xref>). <italic>Economic injustice</italic> involves the state’s failure to provide individuals with basic necessities of life—the misdistribution of resources where some individuals suffer want whereas others do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534765612444880">Wehr et al., 1994</xref>). In a sense, procedural justice mediates the space between individual human rights and the greater body politic that represents political and economic justice policies (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534765612444880">Figure 1</xref> for a pictorial depiction of the proposed social justice model). Social justice issues that may arise in a disaster setting include misunderstandings of what role family and/or community may play in the treatment of individuals (<italic>procedural</italic>) and to what degree disclosure is necessitated (<italic>human rights</italic>). For example, there are currently no specified rights of disaster victims with regard to confidentiality, as stated earlier, nor do children who are disaster survivors have rights when their parents are not to be found which may put them further in harm’s way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612444880">Addley, 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Human rights issues regarding the misdistribution of resources embodies the concept of economic justice; when political or legal institutions fail to protect individuals’ fundamental rights and liberties, members of the unjustly treated group feel disempowered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534765612444880">Wehr et al., 1994</xref>). A good example was the Sri Lankan government’s withholding of disaster aid to the Tamil Tigers and the whole population of North Sri Lanka following the South Asian tsunami. Finally, the role of religion and attribution of God’s will for the occurrence of certain disasters and the role of understanding and treating mental illness in a given region also has social justice implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612444880">Arboleda-Florez &amp; Weisstub, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765612444880">Okasha et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The power of the proposed social justice model lies in the synergy accrued from the nested configuration derived from a systems perspective. Viewing social justice from the micro level of individual human rights to the mesolevels of community and regional aid distribution procedures to the macro levels of political and economic resource relationships that include governments, NGOs, and global relief organizations provides a viewpoint of interlocking systems that exchange power, maintain just or unjust homeostatic practices, and tend to evolve in lockstep.</p>

<p>The primary social justice issues for the Srebrenican dairy farmers were economic, procedural, and political in nature. These social justice concerns were, in part, related to the allocation of resources within the context of historical human rights violations and the continuation of suffering beyond the cessation of armed conflict. The economic implications for these Bosnian dairy farmers were significant. While armed hostilities had ceased for the most part, economic war continued. Serbia flooded the area with low cost dairy, making it difficult for Bosnian farmers to compete with the changing market in their own land. While our dairy farmers were begging for help to find livestock, they didn’t know that just up the road a Swiss aid organization had provided dairy cattle to another village whose farmers had subsequently been forced to slaughter their cows because they couldn’t sell their products.

<title>Praxis</title>
<p>The dairy farmers had no voice in their lives; they were like ghosts inhabiting a ghost town; the religious issues that fueled much of the war also created stressors where Muslim and Catholic faiths (Bosnian vs. Serb/Croatian) represented demarcation lines for just treatment. The case vignette illustrates a universalist approach to international disaster psychology, focusing on respect for the dignity and rights of each person in the village—each person’s story of loss was worthy of attention and care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612444880">Gauthier, 2005</xref>). Mental health professionals focused not only on issues of pathology (e.g., PTSD) but also on issues of character, strength, and perseverance displayed by villagers. Mental health professionals recognized the need to focus on not only individual psychological issues but also marital and family issues and community issues that included attending to social as well as psychological needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765612444880">Pettifor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534765612444880">Thoburn et al., 2007</xref>). Mental health professionals recognized the political and economic justice factors that were contributing to the plight of the village and sought interventions at the macro as well as meso- and micro levels. Foreign mental health professionals recognized that short-term interventions would merely create instability, so sought to train local mental health professionals who could work long term with the village, reconciling individual, couple, and family health issues along with political, economic, and procedural social justice issues.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The need for an ethical model in international disaster psychology is imperative, but the model needs to go beyond traditional Western concepts of psychology and ethics and must embrace the constructs of diverse cultures. A systemic epistemology that recognizes the reciprocal relationship between intrapersonal, interpersonal, and environmental stressors for survivors is most likely to provide a universal approach that will reflect the needs of diverse regions. A social justice model imbedded in a systems paradigm will assure that procedural, economic, and political issues are dealt with and that human rights are upheld. In order for this to occur, we urge mental health practitioners administering disaster-related psychological aid, as well as those training practitioners in their approach, to consider the standards outlined in this article as a model for practice.</p>
