<p>The interconnectivity of late modernity has created new opportunities and challenges alike, for both the legitimate and underground sectors. Consequently, new forms of surveillance and regulation have emerged in order to monitor and control the global flow of people and goods. In <italic>Trafficking and Global Crime Control</italic>, Maggy Lee provides an authoritative and up-to-date critique of the policing-led and punitive-based nature of contemporary international immigration control in favour of a more sociologically driven and human rights-oriented policy response, which is the thesis underpinning this thought-provoking book.</p>
<p>The Introduction states the purpose of the book as being ‘to inject more critical insights into our understanding of the complex social phenomenon of, and responses to, the problem of trafficking’ (p. 3), an otherwise ‘imprecise and highly contested term … with multiple and shifting understandings’ (p. 16). In Chapter 1 Lee attempts conceptually to untangle the origins of this complexity by outlining six approaches for understanding human trafficking, as: a modern form of slavery; an exemplar of the globalization of crime; a problem of transnational organized crime; synonymous with prostitution; a migration problem; and as a human rights challenge (p. 20), complete with a discussion of the nature and causes of each, and the policies and practices employed to tackle the problem. These diverse perspectives build on the literature from their respective domains and others, such as security, gender and victimization studies, which illustrates the complex dimensions of the problem and the range of disciplines Lee draws on throughout the book.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 describes contemporary forms of human trafficking – of sex, labour and body parts – and traces patterns in regional and global trafficking flows before considering how specific conditions contribute to the problem. These include, for example, the ‘feminisation of poverty’ (p. 49) and the presence of well-developed illegal markets to facilitate migration and the trafficking of women, the international political economy of the sex trade and conditions created by corruption, war, conflict and breakdown of governance, labour markets and restrictive immigration regimes. Victims of human trafficking are covered in Chapter 3, which includes a description of the key characteristics and circumstances of the ‘ideal’ victim in trafficking with the construction of a victim hierarchy based on these features and severity of suffering. More importantly, Lee also discusses the (un)availability of victim support and welfare services and conditions of access along with various reasons for the reparation and re-trafficking of victims.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 examines the connections between trafficking, transnational crime and state actors, along with counter-trafficking responses. After reviewing the history of and debates surrounding these crimes and describing how trafficking syndicates are socially organized and operationally executed, Lee considers the role of the State as a perpetrator of trafficking in cases of military and peacekeeping operations. She evaluates how counter-trafficking interventions are ‘narrowly framed’ with ineffective outcomes, and notes how a ‘migration-crime-security complex’ (p. 103) has emerged for preventing illegal immigration through a variety of technologies and strategies. Chapter 5 explains how a ‘war on human trafficking’ (p. 107) has taken shape, beginning with five key features – ‘anti-prostitution, securitisation, criminalisation, militarisation and privatisation’ (p. 108) – the methods and strategies employed in each, and the associated negative consequences or ‘collateral damage’, for example, increased levels of state violence, detained individuals and prisoners and discrimination of trafficked persons.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 centres on the transnational policing of human trafficking, which requires a collective response to global dangers through a variety of counter-trafficking policing efforts, such as Interpol, the United Nations, key law enforcement agencies, along with geopolitical treaties, task forces and border control and security agencies working to strengthen national security. Lastly, Chapter 7 advocates a re-thinking of both the ‘violent logic’ dominating human trafficking and mentality of viewing migrants as ‘others’ and ‘threats’, and the existing ‘criminal justice-immigration control regime’ (p. 156) which has only served to exacerbate the problem. To this end, Lee concludes by arguing for a more ‘sociologically informed approach to trafficking’ (p. 147) which views the phenomenon from a migratory perspective, and the need for states to develop a more human rights-based strategy in order to provide better protection and services for trafficked persons.</p>
<p>Lee’s book makes a timely prelude to the British Government’s strategy for human trafficking which was unveiled in July 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811435589">Home Office, 2011</xref>). Some elements of the strategy echo recommendations made by Lee while other aspects appear to reinforce practices which ensure continuance of the problem. For example, the strategy takes a more humanitarian approach towards trafficked persons, especially children, by promoting enhanced methods of prevention and identification alongside the provision of a wider range of victim support services supported by an additional £2m per year. At the same time, however, the approach places greater emphasis on increased securitization of borders and tougher penalization of traffickers, rather than on proactively engaging with source countries to develop strategies to identify and eradicate the multitude of underlying factors which render these individuals prone to trafficking, such as discrimination and oppression, political and socioeconomic instability, and so on.</p>
<p>On the whole, this book makes a strong contribution to contemporary criminology and the many other disciplines Lee weaves together in order to provide the necessary multidisciplinary perspective on a multi-faceted problem. In doing so, the analysis sheds new light on the history, causes, nature and consequences of trafficking from various theoretical, political and comparative angles. It critically examines the key debates, concerns and dilemmas facing regulators of trafficking and global crime, forcing the reader to question the increased tendency to criminalize trafficking along with the traditionally punitive responses which dominate its regulation. These efforts have culminated in a highly readable, intellectually engaging and clearly organized book suitable for a range of courses spanning the many disciplines it builds on, while serving as an insightful resource to policymakers and practitioners in search of new ideas and strategies for reducing trafficking and global crime.</p>
