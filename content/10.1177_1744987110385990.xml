<abstract>
<p>This paper compares the results of studies of ophthalmic advanced practice in two similar but distinct health economies and integrates the effects of the setting, health policy and professional regulation on such roles. A mixed method questionnaire design was used, distributed at national ophthalmic nursing conferences in the UK and in New Zealand. Participants were nurses undertaking advanced practice who opted to return the questionnaire. Data were analysed separately, and are compared here, integrated with national health policy and role regulation to provide commentary on the findings. The findings suggest that health policy priorities stimulate the areas in which advanced practice roles in ophthalmic nursing emerge. The drivers of role development appear similar and include a lack of experienced doctors and an unmanageable rise in healthcare demand. Titles and remuneration are different in the two health economies, reflecting the organisation and regulation of nursing. In clinical terms, there are few differences between practice in the two settings and it appears that the distinct systems of regulation have minimal effect on role development. Ophthalmic nursing, as a reactive, needs based profession and in common with nursing in general, evolves in order that practice reflects what is needed by patients and services.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1744987110385990" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the last 15–20 years, the role of nurses in the UK has become increasingly specialised in order to support a more efficient, effective and responsive health service. In ophthalmology, changes in nursing practice have led to reductions in waiting lists for common surgical conditions such as cataract, a reduction in emergency and outpatient waits and a much greater contribution to patient outcomes, such as improved experience and continuity of care.</p>
<p>Other health economies face similar challenges and New Zealand in particular faces ever increasing waiting lists for surgery and for outpatient appointments, with ever more challenging targets set by governments and health boards. More recently than in the UK, ophthalmic nurses in New Zealand have developed their roles to address these challenges.</p>
<p>A study of advanced practice in ophthalmic nursing in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987110385990">Marsden and Shaw, 2007</xref>) raised a number of issues for managers, educators and practitioners and others who began to question whether similar issues were extant in ophthalmic nursing in New Zealand. Although a slightly different health economy from that of the UK, many similar issues both in the organisation of healthcare and the practice of ophthalmic nursing exist. The initial study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987110385990">Marsden and Shaw, 2007</xref>) was replicated in New Zealand and is considered here. This paper compares some of the substantive findings from the two studies and considers, in particular, the policy background to the roles, the drivers of advanced practice and the education and support associated with the roles.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1744987110385990"><title>Literature review</title>
<sec id="sec3-1744987110385990"><title>Advanced nursing practice</title>
<p>The nurse practitioner (NP) role emerged in the mid-1960s in the USA largely in response to increased specialisation by physicians, fewer general medical practitioners, particularly in rural settings, the inaccessibility of medical care and the mobile nature of the American population. The serendipity of highly skilled nurses returning from Vietnam facilitated these developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987110385990">Geolot, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987110385990">Hayden et al<italic>.</italic>, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987110385990">Bigbee, 1996</xref>). Advanced practice roles, in whatever terms they are described, are emerging and being identified worldwide in response to population health needs. The International Council of Nurses (ICN) describes such a role as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>A Nurse Practitioner/Advanced Practice Nurse is a registered nurse who has acquired the expert knowledge base, complex decision-making skills and clinical competencies for expanded practice, the characteristics of which are shaped by the context and/or country in which s/he is credentialed to practice. A master’s degree is recommended for entry level. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987110385990">International Council of Nurses, 2009</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>What is clear, though, is that definitions of these roles, their scope of practice and the educational standards associated with them are varied and context sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1744987110385990">Schober, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1744987110385990"><title>The UK picture</title>
<p>The development of advanced practice roles in nursing has taken place across all sectors of healthcare in the UK, partly prompted by the Department of Health (DoH) modernisation agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987110385990">Department of Health, 2000b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987110385990">2004</xref>), but with its initial development preceding government initiatives by a number of years. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1744987110385990">Royal College of Nursing (RCN) (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1744987110385990">2008</xref>) identified these nurses as being involved in assessing patients with undifferentiated and undiagnosed health problems, engaging in autonomous decision-making and problem solving, ordering investigations and admitting, discharging and referring patients.</p>
<p>Although the ‘specialist practitioner’ role, a role theoretically at a lower level than ‘advanced practice’, has been formalised in the UK as a registerable qualification, as a requirement in primary care and associated with degree level study, it has been a little used option in other fields of practice. There are, however, as yet no nationally agreed standards for advanced practice and although the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) has undertaken extensive work to introduce a registerable category of ‘advanced nurse practitioner’ with specific competencies, but no minimal educational standards formalised, nurses working in advanced practice roles will not be required to seek specific registration. This work appears to have progressed little since the consultation was completed and the privy council asked for permission to start a new part of the register in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987110385990">Nursing and Midwifery Council, 2008</xref>). Despite the lack of recognition of the role and its registration, advanced practice flourishes in the UK.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1744987110385990"><title>Advanced practice roles in New Zealand</title>
<p>Advanced practice roles in New Zealand have, as in the UK, been around for a long time with nurses developing roles which expanded the boundaries of practice. Recognition by government with the publication of the <italic>Report of the Ministerial Taskforce on Nursing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987110385990">Ministry of Health, 1998</xref>) that nursing is an under-utilised, skilled healthcare workforce has provided nurses with opportunities that were previously not possible. Nurses now have the opportunity to develop new nursing roles that are not confined within traditional community/hospital boundaries.</p>
<p>In 2000, the Nursing Council of New Zealand (NCNZ) began to debate proposals for formalisation of a NP role to respond to the present and future health needs of the NZ population and published the first document relating to this in 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987110385990">Nursing Council of New Zealand, 2001</xref>). An advisory committee was set up in 2002 and the Ministry of Health endorsed such a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987110385990">Ministry of Health, 2002</xref>), setting out a vision for nurse practitioner roles and work. The role progressed through the necessary legal mechanisms for the next number of years resulting in the addition of a nurse practitioner scopes of practice to the previous nursing registers (Nursing Council of New Zealand, 2004).</p>
<p>The NP in New Zealand works within a specific area of practice and practices both independently and in collaboration with other healthcare professionals (HCPs) across a range of settings. They must have a minimum of four years’ experience in their area of practice and a clinically focused masters degree approved by the NZ Nursing Council. They must also pass an assessment of NP competencies by portfolio and interview. By December 2008, there were 50 NPs in New Zealand, two of whom were registered in two clinical areas. There is still only one ophthalmic nurse practitioner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987110385990">District Health Boards New Zealand, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior to the formalisation of the NP role in New Zealand, many advanced practice roles developed in response to patient and service need and some of these were named ‘clinical nurse specialist’ roles. This is defined in a number of ways, for example, as a senior clinical nursing role, specialising in one speciality or practising across a number of specialities, with, or working towards, a relevant postgraduate qualification. The clinical specialist role is defined in terms of what it achieves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744987110385990">NZNurses, 2009</xref>) but is not one that is formally recognised by the Nursing Council of New Zealand as a distinct nursing entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987110385990">Kai Tiaki, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987110385990"><title>Advanced practice in ophthalmic nursing</title>
<p>Ophthalmic nursing practice has been considered to be at the forefront of advanced practice, showing both cost effectiveness and good patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1744987110385990">Touche Ross &amp; Company, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1744987110385990">Waterman and Waterman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987110385990">Czuber-Dochan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1744987110385990">Slight et al., 2009</xref>) and ophthalmic nurses have for many years, undertaken some of the skills performed by other professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744987110385990">Royal College of Nursing, 2009</xref>). In this arena, as others, performance is at a high level, safe, effective and appreciated by patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987110385990">Marsden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987110385990">Gibbons and Frossell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987110385990">Law and Mensah, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987110385990">Lightfoot et al., 2002</xref>). As with other advanced practice roles, though, development has often been perceived to be reactive and haphazard and this highlights the paradox between muddled planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987110385990">Cameron and Masterson, 2000</xref>) and the good patient outcomes identified.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1744987110385990" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>This paper combines the data from two separate studies undertaken in the UK and New Zealand which considered issues around the advanced practice of ophthalmic nurses in the two health economies. The two research projects which provide the data for this study were designed to gain ‘snapshots’ of advanced practice roles in ophthalmic nursing, in similar but distinct healthcare environments in the UK and New Zealand.</p>
<p>A structured questionnaire using both open and closed questions was developed and piloted, taking into account the literature in this area. The two distinct sections of the questionnaire related firstly to the advanced practice role undertaken by the nurse, and secondly, the education required and undertaken in preparation for it. A number of questions were included specifically about the area(s) of work of the ophthalmic nurse, whether role(s) formed a whole or just a part of the nurses’ daily work, how the role developed and how it was supported initially and subsequent to its establishment. Opportunity was given for free text comments. The second part of the questionnaire related to the educational preparation for the role and the continuing support and education for the nurse undertaking it.</p>
<p>In both of the original studies, advanced practice was defined as a new role; not one for which the nurse received education in their general or ophthalmic training and one with greater autonomy and accountability than would normally be expected. Examples of such roles were given as part of the covering letter. Ethics committee approval was gained from the university base for each study and the questionnaires were left on delegates’ chairs before concurrent sessions on the busiest day of national ophthalmic conferences in the UK and New Zealand. Nurses who felt that they undertook such roles were encouraged to return questionnaires, which were anonymous. There were 22 respondents to the UK study and 17 in New Zealand.</p>
<p>This study considers the data from the two studies and compares the results, question by question. As similar questionnaires were utilised in each of the studies, it was possible to make direct comparisons of data. Where obvious differences of context occur, such as those in relation to remuneration and grade of the respondents in the separate health economies, comparisons are made and the contextual factors accounted for in the commentary.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1744987110385990"><title>Roles and role titles</title>
<p>There were seven role titles identified by the 17 NZ nurses and nine titles in the UK (<italic>n</italic> = 22). This diversity appears similar but when considered more closely, only three of the respondents in the UK but 10 of the NZ nurses were known by a basic registered nurse or ‘staff nurse’ title. The UK nurses’ titles reflected the advanced nature of the roles they undertook to a much greater degree than in the New Zealand study and this perhaps reflects the differences in regulation of these roles, but also the organisation of healthcare. There were six NPs identified in the UK where the title is not regulated and only one in New Zealand, and roles such as ‘matron’ and ‘deputy sister’ do not appear in healthcare settings in NZ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987110385990">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744987110385990">2</xref>). Roles in both studies were diverse but many more roles were identified in NZ, such as retinopathy of pre-maturity screening, diabetic assessment and lesion monitoring, which were not seen within the UK study. Differences were apparent in the ‘spread’ of roles as well, with only one nurse undertaking fluorescein angiography in NZ as opposed to seven in the UK. The most common role in the UK was in the field of ophthalmic emergency care whilst it was overwhelmingly cataract care in NZ. At the time of the UK study (2006) Reforming Emergency Care with its four-hour targets for emergency care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987110385990">Department of Health, 2001</xref>) was a priority in the UK while cataract waiting lists remain a priority in NZ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1744987110385990">Table 3</xref>).

<p>Within New Zealand, a government directed policy to rationalise elective surgery, within limited health funding, has led to a points-based system for cataract surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744987110385990">Riley et al., 2002</xref>). The New Zealand Ministry of Health (MoH) has considered cataract surgery a priority for a number of years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987110385990">Ministry of Health, 2005</xref>) but it is still felt that demand is increasingly outpacing available services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987110385990">Brian, 2008</xref>). Nurses have clearly moved to help to fill that gap in service in NZ. Cataract targets exist in the UK, within the DoH 18-week wait targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987110385990">Department of Health, 2004</xref>), but most ophthalmic services had already reconfigured services following ‘Action on Cataracts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987110385990">Department of Health, 2000a</xref>) and the pressures around cataract surgery are clearly less than pressures around the unplanned and often unmanageable workload (and financial penalties) of emergency care. Emergency care roles were the second largest area of advanced practice in NZ, and in the UK this category was pre- and post-operative cataract assessment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1744987110385990"><title>Grading and remuneration</title>
<p>Grading of the nurses was difficult to compare due to the hierarchical differences of the two systems but it seemed that more of the NZ nurses were on ‘basic’ nursing grades. Only three of the NZ nurses were on senior nurse or NP grades; the others were on the ‘normal’ salary bands for nurses. In the UK study, 11 nurses were on G or H grades, quite senior grades which probably equate to Agenda for Change (a recently introduced grading scale for most National Health Service employees) 6, 7 and perhaps 8A grades, equating in seniority terms to the lower end of the NZ senior nurse scales.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1744987110385990"><title>Drivers of the role</title>
<p>Drivers of the role were common to both healthcare settings. The lack of experienced doctors to undertake such roles was identified as a significant driver, as was need for demand management in terms of managing waiting lists and achieving targets set by central government, as described earlier. It was also clear that nurses also noted gaps in services which needed filling, and moved to fill them.</p>
<p>Although in general, in the UK, roles were medically driven, with medical approval and consultation in place, there seemed to be more multidisciplinary planning in the NZ study than in the UK study with seven of the respondents identifying the service as a whole as being the driver, rather than individuals. International experience of advanced practice roles and awareness of UK developments was a significant driver of role development for three of the NZ respondents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1744987110385990"><title>Changing roles</title>
<p>In the UK, expansion of the role was seen as a technical expansion, bolting on new conditions or techniques as the nurses became more proficient, whereas in NZ, role expansion was more about increasing the number of clinical sessions, and expanding the services and plans seemed to be more concrete, perhaps because of the much larger number of business case models of practice development, as opposed to the UK model where change was organic and unplanned, reflecting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987110385990">Cameron and Masterson’s (2000)</xref> contentions about the unplanned nature of advanced practice in other areas of practice. Change in NZ was managed by nurses on their own or in consultation in eight out of nine cases. This is a similar finding to the UK study and it is clear that whoever controls the beginnings of these roles, nurses drive the roles once they are in place. The single nurse in NZ who identified that she was not involved in the role change and who identified the ophthalmologist as leader, driver and controller of the role worked in private practice and this may reflect differences in the two healthcare systems. The balance between public and private practice is markedly different in New Zealand from the situation in the UK. None of the nurses in the UK sample worked in the private sector. Fewer nurses working in the private sector in the UK work exclusively in ophthalmology. They tend to be generalists rather than specialists so there is likely to be less advanced ophthalmic nursing practice. Although there are now a number of exclusively private ophthalmic hospitals in the UK, there is no shortage of ophthalmologist presence there, so no gaps in practice to fill!</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1744987110385990"><title>Education, training and competence</title>
<p>The length of training varied in each study from none (‘I got the manual and worked it out’ – NZ nurse) through short, informal sessions to masters degrees with practice built in as part of the education for a specific role. In a similar situation to that found in the UK study, one of the NZ nurses indicated that training for a post-operative cataract and follow-up role had been a single week of sitting in such a clinic and another identified that her training consisted of seeing 10 patients. In contrast to the UK study, where all nurses were trained for their roles ‘in-house’, seven of the NZ nurses identified postgraduate education as a part of the education for the role while 10 nurses undertook in-house training only</p>
<p>This difference in the utilisation of postgraduate education may be because of the NZ basic nursing qualification being at graduate level (although one of the nurses has a non-graduate nursing qualification) while that of the UK nurses has not yet universally reached that level. No post-qualification education of any sort was utilised by the UK nurses. The majority of respondents in both studies identified doctors as the trainers with nurses as the major other group. Completion of training was decided, again, generally by a consultant ophthalmologist (UK <italic>n</italic> = 14, NZ <italic>n</italic> = 8). In both studies there were two nurses who were never formally assessed for their role but just left ‘to get on with it’.</p>
<p>Difficulties in training were similar in each study with time being a critical factor, other in terms of time for training and the problems of time pressures on obtaining time for practising and refining skills as well as consolidation after training. The lack of understanding by senior nurses and service managers that formal training and assessment was even needed for these advanced roles seemed to be an issue in both studies. The NZ nurses also identified issues of lack of formality in their training; it was very ad hoc with a lack of formal teaching and a reliance on very junior doctors and this, once again, reflects the UK experience.</p>
<p>Despite issues around training, most nurses felt competent to undertake the role for which they had trained although it was significant that four of the New Zealand nurses and five of those respondents from the UK felt less than competent to perform the role which they were undertaking. Continuing education for advanced practice roles was an issue common to both studies although appeared somewhat less of a problem in New Zealand</p>

<sec id="sec14-1744987110385990" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study compares snapshots of advanced practice in ophthalmic nursing in two distinct health economies, and while in each case they are somewhat limited by the sample size (although the populations of nurses in these specialities are also small), comparison of the two sets of data identifies some interesting issues.</p>
<p>It is clear that government health policy priorities provide a key driver for the areas in which advance practice roles in ophthalmic nursing emerge. In New Zealand, one of the main drivers is a need for more cataract surgery (Brian, 2008) as well as the awareness of long waiting times in the emergency department (ED). Diabetes is a serious health challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987110385990">Ministry of Health, 2009</xref>) in both health economies, and the treatment of glaucoma, the second leading worldwide cause of blindness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987110385990">Resnikoff et al., 2004</xref>), presents major challenges and nursing roles are emerging to address these. The UK policy drivers include cataract but the largest category or role is within the emergency care setting and the achievement of the four hours target. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987110385990">Department of Health, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>It is clear from both studies that the lack of experienced doctors leads to gaps in services which are filled by nurses. In the UK, the roles appear to be more medically driven than in NZ where there is greater evidence of multidisciplinary planning of the roles with business case support to allow of time for education and training, as well as the development of the roles after they have been implemented. In the UK, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987110385990">Cameron and Masterson’s (2000)</xref> finding of an ad hoc development of new nursing roles is patently still the case, with the UK roles lacking an education and continuing education component. In contrast, in NZ there is evidence of a much more supportive infrastructure than is evident in the UK. The organisational framework continues through the development of the roles with a technical expansion model, adding on more tasks to the nurses’ role, in an ad hoc way in the UK while in NZ a much more planned expansion was evident, with an increase in sessions undertaken by the nurse and a supportive infrastructure within the specialist area.</p>
<p>The lack of education for roles may be in part a consequence of under planning of the roles but may also be due, in part, to a lack of support for post-qualification education, a situation which is reflected internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987110385990">McCarthy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987110385990">Murphy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987110385990">Canadian Nurses Advisory Committee, 2002</xref>). Despite this, a number of the New Zealand respondents managed to access education, although this was still a minority and perhaps one of the primary issues for ophthalmic nurses in general is the fragmentation of ophthalmic nurse continuing professional education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987110385990">Czuber-Dochan et al., 2006</xref>), which often means that even if nurses are proactive in searching out education, it is not available to them in a timely and accessible way. When education is primarily in the form of on the job skills acquisition, a lack of underpinning theoretical understanding can lead to practitioner compromise, both medico legally and clinically.</p>
<p>Role titles in the UK reflect the advanced practice nature of the individual roles much better than in NZ. The nurse practitioner title is protected in NZ and the job titles used there are overwhelmingly those of the basic nursing grades, such as RN. Generally, nurses in the UK are financially better rewarded for their advanced practice roles and half (<italic>n</italic> = 11) were on what might be seen to be senior nurse grades whereas only three of the 17 New Zealand nurses had achieved a similar grade.</p>
<p>Two distinct systems around advanced practice exist in the two countries. In the UK it remains unregulated. The NMC has consulted and come to a decision about advanced practice and a registerable title and only nurses who register will be able to call themselves ‘advanced nurse practitioner’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987110385990">Nursing and Midwifery Council, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987110385990">Department of Health, 2008</xref>). Standards will not be mandatory or enforced for advanced practice roles and although this document has been with the privy council since 2006, no further progress has taken place.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, a robust system of accreditation and validation exists, with the registering body and the government knowing just how many nurse practitioners are in place and in what fields they practise. In clinical terms, though, there are fewer differences between practice in the two settings. In New Zealand, before the creation of the NP role, advanced practice flourished in an informal, unregistered system of clinical nurse specialists, which continues to thrive. It is much easier to set up such a role and train or even educate a nurse to undertake it than it is to create an NP role and for the nurse to get through the many hurdles of accreditation. Similarly, in the UK, advanced practice, by whatever name, flourishes. In NZ, a salary scale exists for the NP and this may hinder the development of the role, as it becomes relatively expensive in comparison with other nurse salaries. The range of salaries in the UK for advanced practice roles is large and often does not appear to reflect the complexity or autonomy of the work. Early indications suggest that Agenda for Change has not fulfilled its promise to harmonise salaries and reward clinical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987110385990">Mooney, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1744987110385990">Staines, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1744987110385990" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It is clear that policy significantly influences nursing practice and the two systems compared here reflect this in two similar but geographically distant and distinct health economies. Nursing regulation drives how new and advanced nursing roles are developed and health policy influences the areas of clinical practice in which they develop. What is clear from this comparison of similar studies in each area is that although two distinct systems exist in the UK and New Zealand, their effects on role development are minimal. Paradoxically, a lack of coherent policy and regulation also provides drivers, but, more significantly, also opportunities for nurses to develop their practice and enhance health services. It is the lack of policy around advanced practice roles in the UK which has enabled diverse roles to develop in response to health need, with the consequent muddle of titles and payment this inevitably brings.</p>
<p>If the NMC’s avowed intent to set up a registerable advanced practice role ever comes to fruition in the UK, it may actually hinder role development and the flexibility to react to health need. Practice has evolved beyond any possibility to put barriers in place and with no compulsion for nurses to register, no educational requirement for those with grandfather rights, no salary scale or benefits for the nurse attached, there appear to be few reasons for nurses to jump through all the hoops leading to registration. In New Zealand, policy around the nurse practitioner role has facilitated its development but it is clear that there are few NPs and the path to validation and registration is long and fraught. NPs are expensive in nursing terms and this may hinder development. In the meantime, nursing, as a reactive, needs-based profession, evolves to respond to the needs of services and patients, and nurses continue to develop advanced practice roles, without a title, so that services can meet targets and deliver high quality care for patients.</p>
<p>What this piece of work demonstrates is that whatever the healthcare setting and whatever the barriers and challenges put in place for nurses and, specifically, in this case for ophthalmic nurses, practice will change and practitioners will continue to develop practice in partnership with other health professionals or on their own, with or without formal education and with or without benefits in terms of grade or remuneration, in order that practice reflects what is needed by patients and the service.</p>

<bio>
<p><bold>Janet Marsden</bold> (MSc BSc RGN OND) is professor of ophthalmology and emergency care at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU). Her background is in ophthalmic nursing, from which she moved into areas of emergency practice. She currently manages an MSc in emergency medicine. She has published extensively including two key ophthalmic nursing textbooks, and professional and research papers in areas of emergency care, ophthalmology and advanced practice in nursing. She is an editor of <italic>Emergency Triage</italic>, the textbook of the Manchester Triage System, developed in Manchester and used internationally. She chaired the ophthalmic nursing forum of the RCN and led projects for the RCN such as a wide ranging collaboration on continuing professional development and a competence framework, now introduced in Australia. Janet leads the Centre for Effective Emergency Care (CEEC) at MMU and retains a role in practice. She also has an honorary chair with City University and strong international links in both emergency care and ophthalmology.</p>
<p><bold>Mary E. Shaw</bold> (MSc BA RN RNT RCNT OND Cert Ed) is senior lecturer (teaching) at Manchester University. She began her nursing career as an ophthalmic trainee in Manchester, and went on to complete general and midwifery training, She moved into nurse education, re-entering ophthalmic nursing initially as a ‘bank nurse’ as she felt the need to re-establish clinical links from her role as a senior nurse teacher. She currently has a clinical link with Manchester Royal Eye Hospital and delivers ophthalmic nursing modules as well as unique online specialist glaucoma modules within an MSc programme which are accessed by ophthalmic professionals internationally. Mary has been a member of the steering group of the RCN’s ophthalmic nursing forum and is a trustee of the International Glaucoma Association. Her other specialist areas include management and leadership, which she teaches at all academic levels, and she has published a number of papers, chapters and a book in her specialist areas.</p>
<p><bold>Sue Raynel</bold> (MA BHSc RGON OND) has the current role of research and development manager in the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Auckland, which was preceded by a number of roles in ophthalmology and emergency care. She completed her ophthalmic nursing diploma in Edinburgh in 1982 before working in emergency departments for the next 10 years and returning to ophthalmology in 1992. Sue has had a variety of senior nursing and management roles in this area including clinical nurse specialist, nurse consultant, charge nurse operating rooms (acting) and manager of the ophthalmology department in Auckland, New Zealand. Her current role allows Sue the flexibility to continue her nursing interests, including: facilitating ophthalmic nursing education to nurses who currently work in ophthalmology at post-graduate level and those who work in other specialities such as emergency nursing, practice nursing etc but encounter ophthalmic patients and exploring the implementation of further nurse specialist roles into ophthalmic practice.</p></bio>
