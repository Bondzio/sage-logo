<p><italic>Patrons of Women: Literacy Projects and Gender Development in Rural Nepal</italic> is an ethnographic study of Hertzog’s experience as the international gender consultant on a women’s empowerment project in Nepal, a project that is never fully implemented. This organizational ethnography attempts to understand “human conduct in the context of development and bureaucratic organizations” (p. 42). Through a feminist critique of the process of establishing this project, Hertzog asserts, “gender development projects . . . do not and cannot contribute to social change in gender power relations” (p. xvi). Although her findings may not support such totalizing and controversial statements, the book does provide a detailed analysis of the subtle role that power, rhetoric, gender, and organizations play in structuring and relegating relations. In particular, Hertzog draws attention to the ways a woman’s literacy program becomes marginalized because of its female audience.</p>
<p>The book contains eight sections that engage the reader in the author’s experience and analysis of understanding how a $500,000 women’s empowerment project loan is diverted to serve other means and budgets with only enough money provided to ensure that the women receive services to the extent that the project appears to be successfully serving women. The Preface and Introduction are particularly interesting as they provide the history of the study, methodology, and author’s positionality. The literature review covers, among other things, gender development literature, neocolonialism in education, and literacy in Nepal. Adult educators may find the adult literacy portion offers a limited perspective of literacy and literacy endeavors. Furthermore, while her topic is the implementation of a literacy program and not the benefits of literacy, the author at times collapses the two.</p>
<p>Chapters 1 and 2 present evidence on “how the bureaucratic machine absorbs us and forces us to comply with moral norms that we conveniently denounce when uninvolved with and estranged from the situation” (p. 39). This key point, made through an honest inspection of her and a colleague’s behavior as international experts, informs the reader and suggests that we should examine our actions and motivations in carrying out educational work, research, or practice. Chapters 3 through 5 look closely at the use of literacy to manipulate the focus of the project, erasing women’s voices in the process. These chapters highlight how program negotiations and a teacher-training seminar were used for officials’ and the organization’s own purposes while providing the minimum required to make it seem as if the women’s empowerment program appeared to be achieving set goals. To note, Hertzog’s analysis provides a contradiction to this marginalization; the women are vibrant and employ agency where they can. Chapter 6 focuses on negotiations around the budget, underscoring that the women’s program was never really to be implemented.</p>
<p>The book ends abruptly with Hertzog’s departure from Nepal (Chapter 6). This is unfortunate; the complexity of her discussion would benefit from a concluding chapter. Because the book attempts to address multiple issues—“male domination in international gender projects” (p. xv); “hierarchical relations and ethnocentric behavior that emerge from the bureaucratically structured polarization of power between developing and developed, rich and poor, educated and uneducated, urban and rural, employers and employees, men and women, local and expatriate, consulting and consulted, and patrons and clients in Nepal” (p. xv); neo-colonial aspects of educational and development projects; “the impact of gender development projects, literacy programs in particular, on women’s empowerment and on changing gendered power relations” (p. 27)—through a detailed micro-analysis of daily events and interactions, there is a need to tie in the six chapters’ insights and findings to a coherent summation of the important central arguments. As it is, the reader must make his or her own conclusion as to how the findings inform some of the primary arguments, other studies, and theoretical work.</p>
<p>A consideration for the analysis would be the need for a more nuanced examination of gender and organizational systems. As is, the analysis is based on the literal division between men and women as opposed to how a patriarchal system structures relationships. For example, she briefly touches on colonialism when examining Nepali officials’ behavior but moves quickly back to men’s versus women’s desires. Given her neocolonial critique, the behavior, could be named as a response to paternalistic and colonizing attitudes. Regardless, this book is a solid addition to the literature that critiques the intentions behind and implementation of gendered development endeavors.</p>
<p>The book is meaningful to adult educators for a variety of reasons: it offers a detailed example of research practices; the central themes provide fodder for classroom or professional discussions examining the intent and purpose of educational endeavors; the insights about complicity are relevant to anyone working in an organization; and the documented process of the development project informs administrators, researchers, and practitioners working in the field.</p>
