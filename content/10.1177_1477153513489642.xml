<p>I am writing the first part of this on the eve of an operation to remove the cataract from my left eye. The cataract is the result of the ageing of the lens. There is nothing unusual about cataracts since we will all develop them or die first. Cataract is the yellowing (brunescence) and increasing opacification of the lens with age. The view is not unlike that through a dirty windscreen – light is scattered producing a veil of light through which the contrasts of the scene have to be detected. The apparent effect is of disability glare and less light reaching the retina. The disability is most noticeable at night when small bright sources appear as starbursts.</p>
<p>I now believe what I have taught for years regarding the ageing process on the visual system; it is not that I did not believe before, it is just that seeing is believing. Or is it? Mostly, I have been unaware of the gradual yellowing; everything is normal, as it was to Monet as he painted the pond near his home but to younger viewers his paintings showed a pond that seemed to be more yellowish as time passed. I notice the effect if something blocks part of the scene – for example, looking at a white wall with a post between me and the wall. In that case, on one side of the post I see a yellowish area where the right eye’s view is blocked and a ‘whiter’ view on the other side. If I view a scene with only my right eye it is bright and clear; with my left eye it is less bright and a bit fuzzy but white is still white. In both cases the visual system decides what is ‘white’ – in photography terms it sets the white point. And when I view the world with both eyes, another white point is set. So can I believe what I see? The answer must be yes, since there is no alternative but that does not mean that I see the same as anyone else. You can appreciate the difficulties facing those seeking a robust model of colour vision and how we perceive the coloured world.</p>
<p>It is now a few weeks after the operation. It is as if a miracle occurred; I now have clear presbyopic vision through my left eye! But now the right eye, about which I waxed so lyrically above as producing the ‘white’ image is now yellowish and the left eye produces a bluish-white image. My right eye sees hardly any blue in a gas flame but the left eye sees highly saturated blue. Now, I have the option of a ‘warm white’ or ‘daylight’ world simply by choosing which eye to view it with. The average view is less yellow than previously. My colour experience will remain confused until I have the right eye’s lens replaced after its opacification becomes too great a disability.</p>
