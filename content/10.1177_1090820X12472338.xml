   <body>
      <p>The vast array of information technology options available to plastic surgeons is continuously expanding. Recent publications in our specialty have begun to explore application functionality in plastic surgery, <sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12472338">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12472338">2</xref>
         </sup> although none have taken a comprehensive approach. The irrefutability of the Internet as a communication highway generates expectations from potential patients for a comprehensive and detailed online presence by a plastic surgeon.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12472338">3</xref>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12472338"/>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X12472338"/>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X12472338"/>

         </sup> Within all service-based industries, pictorial and illustrative representations of rendered services are necessary. The normalization and subsequent societal acceptance of social media warrants discussion regarding the role of social media and technology (especially smartphone apps) within plastic surgery.</p>
      <p>Social media have engulfed our society, engaging consumers and enticing businesses with novel and innovative direction. Cosmetic surgical services occupy a unique niche of the health care market, obliging plastic surgeons to market their practices not only by traditional means but via social media. As technology has advanced, patient expectations have followed suit and will continue to do so.</p>
      <p>The evolution of social media in medicine has established a new precedent for personalization. “Word of mouth” will never be replaced, but patients often verify what they hear from friends and colleagues via the instantaneous Google search. Although a website can only portray a static snapshot, social media engage the reader with an in-depth view—a proverbial “window shopping” experience. The propensity of plastic surgeons to embrace advances in social media through rapid integration of technology and online tools has been illustrated throughout the literature.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12472338">3</xref>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12472338"/>

         </sup> This option allows for creative marketing strategies and offers a means for surgeons to distinguish themselves from other practices and describe how their surgical services differ from those offered by practitioners from related subspecialties.</p>
      <p>Other technology and social media outlets—including Facebook, “deal” (discount) websites, and Twitter accounts—have been studied, but we predict that the next significant marketing/advertising expansion for plastic surgeons will involve smartphone applications (“apps”), particularly those offered by Apple, Inc (Cupertino, California) for its iPhone devices. iPhone applications are the “oldest” apps present in the market. Apple first instituted third-party web apps in July 2007, beginning the progress toward the more than 500 000 applications currently available through its App Store.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X12472338">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X12472338">13</xref>
         </sup> The first plastic surgery app was introduced in 2009.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X12472338">14</xref>

      </p>
      <sec id="section6-1090820X12472338" sec-type="methods">
         <title>Methods</title>
         <p>An initial review of mobile applications related to plastic surgery was performed online (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12472338">Figure 1</xref>). A search through Apple’s App Store for the term <italic>plastic surgery</italic> was performed. Ultimately, iPhone applications were chosen for this study, for their breadth and depth of content. This is partially due to Apple having been first to initiate the application “movement” but is also a result of the company’s larger device prevalence within the market. Searches for plastic surgery apps in other phone markets revealed nonapplicable apps for Nokia (Helsinki, Finland) and no plastic surgery apps available for Windows (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington), Palm OS-partner <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Handango.com" xlink:type="simple">Handango.com</ext-link> (Sunnyvale, California), Blackberry (Waterloo, Ontario, Canada), HTC (Bellevue, Washington), Android (Mountain View, California), and Samsung Markets (Seoul, Korea).<sup>

            </sup> iPhone applications were the first available on the market, and as such, we were able to obtain a wide spectrum of information helping to outline the evolution of applications within plastic surgery. Once we selected these apps as our focus, the iPhone application software program (“App Store”) was used to conduct a generalized search for <italic>plastic surgery</italic> and <italic>cosmetic surgery</italic>.</p>

         <p>Practice-based apps were selected according to an identifiable plastic surgeon(s) named within the title or application itself; in addition, the member listed must have successfully passed appropriate board examinations to gain membership into a plastic surgery society. Each app was then evaluated according to software engineer, surgeon or group practices, surgeon specialty, “star” ratings, number of raters, geographic location, application cost, and basic content, including app capabilities and surgical services rendered. Also recorded were apps that fell into several different categories: academic-based applications, patient reference applications, and nonapplicable apps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X12472338">Figure 2</xref>). Academic-based apps included academic journals, academic conferences, and patient clinical tools. Patient reference apps included geographic and procedure-based surgeon-locating tools and information about procedures. The remaining category included all apps that turned up on our search for plastic surgery-related apps but did not meet the previously stated criteria. These nonapplicable apps greatly varied from photo-morphing programs that could age an individual by 60 years or change anatomical points of the face to turn faces into caricatures, to apps offering unsubstantiated tips on looking younger through facial exercises and a rating site that would allow participants to rate whether photos looked “real or fake.”</p>

         <title>Results</title>
         <p>A total of 161 applications were initially identified through both Apple App Store searches (<italic>cosmetic surgery</italic> and <italic>plastic surgery</italic>). After accounting for applications not fitting the criteria described previously and eliminating redundant results between searches, a total of 54 practice-based apps were isolated. Within the practice-based category, 3 surgeons had created 2 or more apps for each of their respective practices. Of the 3 remaining categories, 23 academic-based apps were also identified, along with 10 patient-based apps and 27 nonapplicable apps.</p>
         <sec id="section8-1090820X12472338">
            <title>Surgeon-Based Apps</title>
            <p>The 54 apps categorized as surgeon based or practice based occupy a unique niche within the marketplace. They provide an opportunity for a surgeon to present his or her services in an engaging and informative way and convey information regarding his or her personal (or group practice) surgical outcomes. More than 98% of apps in this category were created by plastic surgeons who provide aesthetic services. Almost every application within this category offered a standard set of contents: photo-morphing software that could be used by patients who wished to upload a self-photograph to “predict” postoperative results (either in a specific, focused body area or from a full-body view), pre- and postoperative clinical examples of existing patients from the practice, and information regarding the surgeon(s) and clinic. The Boston Cleft Lip and Palate app (Boston Plastic and Oral Surgery Foundation, Boston, Massachusetts) was the only exception. It was the only application produced by an academic institution and provided solely information about cleft lip and palate surgery, as well as biographical information and contact information for surgeons and staff within the clinic.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section9-1090820X12472338">
            <title>Academic-Based Apps</title>
            <p>There were 23 academic-based applications targeting medical professionals and plastic surgeons, including several that provided access to abstracts, papers, and other scientific content. Despite so many of these apps being targeted toward plastic surgeons, very few actually possessed truly informative and useful material that could be deemed remotely relevant to plastic surgeons. The majority either were too broadly designed or intended for residents, medical students, or college students; they had a prevailing focus on anatomical drawings, terminology, or step-by-step operative guides and explanations. Some pertinent apps in this category (such as Bradow’s Plastic Surgery [Bradeaux LLC, Columbus, OH) offered study questions in a flashcard format; others offered medical glossaries.</p>
            <p>However, there were some apps pertinent to plastic surgery practice, including Handfeed (Jeffrey Wint, Springfield, MA), which featured one of several collections of searchable abstracts, with the added capacity for users to share what they were reading with friends and colleagues via social media or e-mail. The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) has developed software enabling members access to educational information from ASAPS and <italic>Aesthetic Surgery Journal</italic> regarding procedures, patient safety, practice management, and other member benefits. Both ASAPS and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) also offered apps allowing users to browse and navigate the schedule at each society’s annual conference. All of the journals in our subspecialty, including <italic>Aesthetic Surgery Journal, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery</italic>, and the <italic>Annals of Plastic Surgery</italic>, offer some form of iPhone or iPad app through which abstracts can be searched by the general public, and full content can be accessed by subscribers and society members.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section10-1090820X12472338">
            <title>Patient-Based Apps</title>
            <p>One type of patient-based app (of which there were 10 in our study) is a plastic surgeon locator tool, which provides basic information to patients regarding surgical procedures and facilitates their search efforts by locating surgeons in their geographical area. ASAPS contributed to this category twice, through its Cosmetic Plastic Surgery and Project Beauty apps. Both apps provide similar services and information, but Project Beauty offers a more interactive format that provides access to the majority of the videos, procedure descriptions, and general information available on the main site. Another app, FaceDecide MD (Orca MD, Sandy, UT), provides information to patients about conditions and operations (along with visual representations of underlying anatomy and surface changes that occur with aging), along with a specialist/surgeon search feature.</p>

         <sec id="section11-1090820X12472338">
            <title>Nonapplicable Apps</title>
            <p>Of the 27 nonapplicable apps in our search, several were from dermatology practices marketing their aesthetic procedures, as well as apps targeted to a very young audience that, again, focused on amusing or creative facial photo morphing. These are not of relevance to our discussion of smartphone apps in plastic surgery.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section12-1090820X12472338">
            <title>The Role of Ratings</title>
            <p>To assess the relative success of each application, the 1- through 5-star rating system results (as they appear in the Apple App Store) were analyzed. These results are available only to users who have previously purchased or downloaded an application. Although an insufficient number of rated applications exist for this study to achieve any statistical significance, several trends were noted. Of the 19 rated apps, the mean (SD) rating was 3.75 (1.86) stars, with an average of 35.11 (28.73) raters per application. A more complete breakdown of these results can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090820X12472338">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090820X12472338">2</xref>. The name of each application appears to play the greatest role in the success of an application being rated, since apps with titles including industry terms or surgeon names were rated more frequently and applications with titles referencing specific regions were rated the least frequently.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>With rapid technological advances in social media, an ethical duty necessitates continuous scrutiny of the role of new marketing strategies in relation to advertising surgical services to potential patients. ASAPS, ASPS, and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) incorporate a strict code of ethics into their respective membership guidelines.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090820X12472338">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090820X12472338">22</xref>
            </sup> However, governmental agencies also have begun to take interest.</p>
         <p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a press release in July 2011 concerning medical apps, stating that it was seeking input regarding a new proposal for oversight in medical smartphone and tablet applications.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090820X12472338">23</xref>
            </sup> This was followed by a request in December 2011 that all app programmers submit future app endeavors for “draft guidance.”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090820X12472338">24</xref>
            </sup> The proposed guidelines applied only to apps directly related to medical devices or devices currently regulated by the FDA.</p>
         <p>These recent guidelines should raise our awareness about the changing trends in health care, as patients become increasingly more comfortable using technology to access, navigate, utilize, and manage their health care. The Pew Research Center reported in July 2011 that one-third of Americans currently own a smartphone.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090820X12472338">25</xref>
            </sup> This serves to illustrate how these apps—with their ease of use, convenience, and simplicity of access—can potentially change how not only plastic surgery but all of health care will be managed in the future. The capacity of social media to potentially transform the dynamics of the patient-physician relationship exists, as has been illustrated in various studies.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X12472338">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090820X12472338">26</xref>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090820X12472338"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1090820X12472338">28</xref>
            </sup> With this in mind, the technological evolution should warrant caution, as potential privacy concerns are prompting a call for guidelines within the medical community.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1090820X12472338">29</xref>
            </sup> Heeding these concerns is important to protecting our patients.</p>
         <p>In a sea of plastic surgery social media marketing apps, one of the highest-rated applications demonstrated an effective means of engaging patients beyond the “window shopping” experience. Venous Injectables (Tri Valley Plastic Surgery Professional Medical Corporation, Dublin, California) offers a record of when/where past injections had occurred, a timing function that assesses when new injections should occur, and an appointment scheduling function. In addition to marketing themselves, the owners of this app managed to provide patients with a better sense of control, all while creating the much sought after “well-informed patient” and enabling better communication between patient and surgeon.</p>
         <p>With care taken to be wary of patient privacy and compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the potential exists for apps that track a postoperative course, charting pain levels, spirometry results and photos, and other parameters uploaded right from a patient’s phone for his or her plastic surgeon to evaluate. Imagine that patient A complains of pain after a breast reduction; ideally, using an app, a surgeon could evaluate the levels of pain and spirometry results over X hours and correlate them to photographs of the area. Anticipating and diagnosing postoperative courses with the potential to preemptively solve issues in patient care would result in higher patient satisfaction and better surgical outcomes. This idealized proposal suggests, in our opinion, a natural progression of smartphone applications into telemedicine, which is currently defined as “a system that electronically transports a consulting physician from a medical center to a site at a distant facility where his or her expertise is required.”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1090820X12472338">30</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Patient satisfaction is one of the main points of focus in aesthetic surgery, and smartphone apps give us yet another opportunity to engage our patients. We believe that plastic surgeons should be asking themselves not how to market their practices through social media but how to engage potential patients and increase the existing patient’s sense of control and knowledge. More interactive apps will undoubtedly help us accomplish this. Apple grasps this concept and Microsoft’s eminent release of Healthvault appears to demonstrate the same.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090820X12472338">31</xref>
            </sup> Healthvault is an application providing online storage of personal health care information with the capacity to share with other health care apps. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid also recognizes the potential in this arena, as it has recently developed a HIPPA-compliant mobile app, the Care360 application.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1090820X12472338">32</xref>
            </sup> However, as the actual providers of health care with a vested interest in outcomes, plastic surgeons must aid in the development of apps directed toward maximizing patient education, investment, interactivity, communication, and satisfaction.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>Smartphone applications present great potential for maximizing our interactive capabilities in today’s aesthetic surgery market. Initial smartphone apps have demonstrated promise, but in their current state, they do not warrant universal adoption before further refinements occur. The role of smartphone applications will be important in contributing to the future of plastic surgery, but plastic surgeons must maintain an active role in the development of these apps to ensure their value.</p>
