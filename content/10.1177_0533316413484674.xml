<abstract>
<p>Outlined is a brief description of two pieces of research into the Median Group experience in an open psychiatric outpatient service and in a closed ward. The first is about the self-definition and well being of 30 patients in three Median Groups, mostly under drug prescription, and 31 patients only under drug prescription. On nine sub scales (five levels each) of SCL (Symptom Check List)-90-R, only the field of somatization shows small differences between the experimental and the control group, whereas in all the others the differences are statistically significant, which means a better quality of life.</p>
<p>The other research has been undertaken by Laura Pozzi, who introduced the Median Group to a closed psychiatric ward of a general hospital. It shows a high level of acceptance within the group, and on the group ward level, a sudden decrease of aggressive episodes has been registered.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>I would briefly describe the outcome regarding the efficacy and satisfaction of the participants of two pieces of research into the Median Group experience in an open psychiatric outpatient service, and in a closed ward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0533316413484674">Schöllberger, 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0533316413484674">
<title>Research I</title>
<p>With the help of many colleagues in 2005<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0533316413484674">1</xref></sup>, we finished a piece of research about the self-definition of well being of 30 patients in three Median Groups, mostly under drug prescription, and 31 patients only under drug prescription.</p>
<p>The diagnosis represents a range from mid disturbances to severe psychiatric diseases in both male and female, who were quite equally divided by language.</p>
<p>The patients of the experimental group obtain more benefits in relief from suffering than the group of patients which take only prescribed drugs. On nine sub scales (five levels each) of SCL (Symptom Check List)-90-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316413484674">Franke, 1995</xref>), only the field of somatization shows small differences between the experimental and the control group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0533316413484674">figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Somatization Disorder</title>
<p>The responses provided by subjects in both groups for somatization disorder did not show much variation for the median value. However, all of the others showed:</p>

<p>The differences are statistically significant, which means a better quality of life.</p>

<title>Research II</title>
<p>The other research was undertaken by Laura Pozzi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0533316413484674">Pozzi, 2008</xref>) who introduced the Median Group to a closed psychiatric ward of a general hospital<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0533316413484674">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The Median Group has run weekly since 2006 and it has carried out research for eight months on the appreciation of the group sessions by the patients, using the Appreciation Inventory by Jagher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0533316413484674">Jagher, 2006</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0533316413484674">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>It shows a high acceptance within the group where the participants found the group a positive experience, i.e. 78%, negative; 10.5% and 11.5% neither positive nor negative. A positive feeling after the group sessions was displayed by 58%, indifferent 15%, perplexed 14%, anxiety 10% and 2.5% did not answer to this question.</p>
<p>On the group ward level there was a decrease of aggressive episodes. In fact, the introduction of the Median Group in the closed psychiatric ward was caused by the high rate (53) of violent behaviour during the four month period (between June and October 2006) before the Median Group was started; decreasing to 29 until December and to six episodes from January to March 2007 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0533316413484674">figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Therefore, there is no basis for fears that free discussion could be a danger or make trouble for participants. On the contrary, it seems that engagement in dialogue has had some influence on the closed ward culture: a humanization process.</p>

<p>Since 1978, there are no longer asylums in Italy (apart from the Justice Hospitals which will be closed within 2013); there are instead psychiatric closed wards for 14–20 patients within the other wards in the general hospital and in most regions a good organized psychiatric community service. In some of them they keep the closed psychiatric ward open.</p>

<p>Dialogue Group Appreciation Inventory in Borgo Valsugana SPDC. The questionnaire is a tool developed by the working group of the Psychiatric Diagnosis and Treatment Service of Borgo Valsugana with the objective of evaluating the views of practitioners and patients about the level of usefulness of this activity and what is the level of involvement of respondents. The questionnaire was proposed to patients (no. 85) who took part in group meetings during October 2007 to May 2008, and to practitioners (no.20) in work at the service (medical, nursing, caring and rehabilitation). (Data processed by Giuseppina Castiello-TeRP-SPDC Borgo V., Denart Professional Nurse, SPDC Borgo V. )</p>
