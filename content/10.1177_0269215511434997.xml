<title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to current estimates, more than 400 000 persons in the United States and 2.5 million worldwide live with multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511434997">1</xref></sup> This unpredictable and generally progressive disease of the central nervous system is characterized by demyelinating lesions in the brain and central nervous system as well as damage and death of axons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511434997">2</xref></sup> The effects of multiple sclerosis on cognition, which are thought to occur in 50–75% of persons with multiple sclerosis, have gained increasing recognition as ‘potentially the most disabling symptom of the disease’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511434997">3</xref></sup> While numerous studies have addressed the emotional and physical impact of multiple sclerosis, little attention has been given to strategies that might help manage the cognitive changes commonly experienced by persons with multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>Numerous neuropsychological studies with persons with multiple sclerosis have demonstrated deficits in tasks assessing recent memory, attention, information processing (including processing speed), executive functions (including verbal learning), and visuospatial abilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511434997">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511434997"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511434997">5</xref></sup> Cognitive impairment seems to have major effects on the lives of persons with multiple sclerosis including influencing role fulfillment in both work and social life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511434997">6</xref></sup> Persons with multiple sclerosis with cognitive dysfunction were less likely to be employed, required greater personal assistance and were less likely to engage in social activities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511434997">7</xref></sup> reported more difficulties parenting,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511434997">8</xref></sup> and performed significantly worse on computerized tests of driving skills and had higher rates of motor vehicle crashes than cognitively intact persons with multiple sclerosis and healthy controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511434997">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511434997">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>To date, there have been relatively few studies of cognitive rehabilitation interventions for persons with multiple sclerosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511434997">4</xref></sup> and even fewer that have incorporated computer training of cognitive skills with a strong randomized clinical trial design. Although not extensive, there is some evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511434997">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511434997"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511434997"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511434997">14</xref></sup> to suggest that computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation results in improved neuropsychological performance for persons with multiple sclerosis with subjective concerns or objective evidence of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to refine and test a novel computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation intervention, MAPSS-MS (Memory, Attention, and Problem Solving Skills for persons with Multiple Sclerosis). A group intervention focusing on use of compensatory strategies was paired with an innovative computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation component that was implemented in the participant’s home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511434997">15</xref></sup> We hypothesized that, compared to persons in the wait list control group, persons with multiple sclerosis who participate in the MAPSS-MS intervention would:</p>
<list id="list1-0269215511434997" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>demonstrate significant improvements in cognitive function on the performance measures of memory, language, spatial processing, processing speed, and executive function; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>report significant improvement in self-efficacy for control of multiple sclerosis effects, use of memory strategies, and neuropsychological competence in activities of daily living.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The effects of the intervention on the outcome variables were assessed over a five-month period, with measurements at baseline, at two months (immediately after the MAPSS-MS intervention), and at five months (i.e. three months after the intervention was complete).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269215511434997" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Following approval by our Institutional Review Board, participants were recruited over an 11-month period through physician and healthcare provider referrals and notices in multiple sclerosis newsletters and publications. A screening interview was conducted with potential participants by phone to ensure that they met the inclusion criteria (being 18–60 years of age, able to understand and comply with the study protocol including reading and writing in English, visual acuity with correction sufficient to work on a computer screen, clinically definite multiple sclerosis for at least six months that was documented by a physician and stable disease status at the time of study entry). Study staff administered the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511434997">16</xref></sup> by phone and those reporting that they experienced at least five problems ‘sometimes’ or more often were eligible to continue in the study. Subjects were excluded if they had other medical causes of dementia, other neurological disorders that might impact cognition, evidence of major psychiatric disorder, or major functional limitations that precluded them from participating in the study.</p>
<p>The persons who were initially screened as ‘eligible’ were told that we would notify them later with exact dates for the baseline neuropsychological testing and the classes. The study was a randomized design with the intervention delivered in small groups over a 15-month period. Between 20 and 22 persons were available to be scheduled for each of three study cohorts. Prior to the initiation of data collection, the data analyst for the project generated a random number sequence for randomization to intervention and control and placed each assignment in a separate, sealed envelope. Following the completion of informed consent, the baseline neuropsychological tests, and the study questionnaires, the project director opened the next sealed envelope and informed the participants of their random assignments to either the intervention or wait list control groups.</p>
<sec id="section11-0269215511434997">
<title>Study overview</title>
<p>Self-report and performance data were collected from participants at baseline, two months, and five months. The staff members conducting neuropsychological assessments were blinded to participants’ group assignment. Given the nature of the design, it was not possible to blind either participants or the group facilitators to treatment allocation once the group sessions began. However, the project director and interventionist who knew individual subjects and their group assignments were not involved in collecting, entering, or analyzing data.</p>
<p>Participants were instructed to complete the questionnaire booklet at home and return it to staff when they came for their neuropsychological tests. Participants received a small incentive (US$50) for completing each of the three data collections for a total of US$150. Using effect size estimates from prior research with a group wellness intervention for persons with multiple sclerosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511434997">17</xref></sup> a total sample size of 60 was determined to be sufficient to detect statistically significant differences between the two groups (assuming an alpha level of 0.05) in the performance outcome variables with a moderate effect size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511434997">18</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269215511434997">
<title>Intervention program</title>
<p>The overall purpose of the MAPSS-MS intervention is to help the individual acquire the highest level of cognitive functioning and functional independence. This was accomplished through teaching the use of compensatory skills, retraining skills (the computer component), and environmental/lifestyle support for cognitive functioning. The MAPSS-MS has two components: (a) eight weekly 2-hour group sessions focused on building efficacy for use of cognitive compensatory strategies and (b) a computer-assisted cognitive training program. The home-based computer component<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511434997">19</xref></sup> enabled the participants to engage in practice sessions (minimum of 45 minutes three times per week) without leaving their homes. Translation of skills practiced (e.g. remembering a series of numbers) to everyday issues was a focus of the group sessions.</p>
<p>Details of the intervention components and delivery are provided in Appendix A (online). The facilitator (interventionist) was a master’s prepared nurse carefully trained prior to the initiation of the study. Each group session was audiotaped and reviewed by the principal or co-investigator for fidelity to both the content and process aspects of the intervention. In addition, electronic logs of participant practice were monitored (which track and which skill) and participants maintained a log of their home practice.</p>

<sec id="section13-0269215511434997">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>The proposed study used both self-report and performance-based measures to provide a more complete understanding of the effects of the proposed intervention. All measures were used at the three data collection points with the exception of demographic information. A Background Information Sheet (BIS) was used to collect information on a variety of demographic (age, gender, education, computer experience, marital status, ethnicity) and disease characteristics. Length of illness was determined by using the subjects’ self-report of the year of diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Participants completed the Self-Administered Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS-S)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511434997">20</xref></sup> as a measure of functional limitations and impairment due to multiple sclerosis. Scores can range from 0 to 9.5 and the intraclass correlation between patient ratings on the EDSS-S and physician ratings on the EDSS was 0.89.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511434997">20</xref></sup></p>

<title>Performance outcomes</title>
<p>The Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in MS (MACFIMS), a recommended battery of neuropsychological tests based on a consensus of the findings of an international conference of experts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511434997">21</xref></sup> was used to measure cognitive performance. Benedict and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511434997">22</xref></sup> have presented evidence for the construct and concurrent validity of the MACFIMS battery in a sample of 291 persons with multiple sclerosis. The 90-minute battery includes seven well-known and widely used tests covering the five cognitive domains as listed below:</p>

<title>Self-report outcomes</title>
<p>The Control subscale of the multiple sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale (MSSE-Control)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511434997">29</xref></sup> was used as a measure of confidence in the ability to manage disease symptoms, reactions to disease-related limitations and the impact of disease on life activities. Respondents were asked to rate each of 9 items from 10 (very uncertain) to 100 (very certain) and scores are summed for a total score ranging from 90 to 900. Sample items include: how certain are you that you can keep your multiple sclerosis symptoms from interfering with your time spent with friends and family; and how certain are you that you can manage your multiple sclerosis symptoms so that you can do the things you enjoy? Internal consistency reliability at the three time points ranged from 0.93 to 0.95. The Strategy Subscale of the Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ-Strategy)30 was used as a measure of self-assessed use of memory strategies. The 19 items describe various memory aids and strategies such as making to-do lists and writing appointments on a calendar. Respondents indicated the frequency with which each strategy was used during the past two weeks using a 5-point scale (never, rarely, sometimes, often, all the time). Higher scores indicated more frequent use of memory strategies. The internal consistency reliability ranged from 0.83 to 0.88. Content validity is supported by expert raters and convergent validity is supported by strong correlations between scores of the MMQ-Strategy and the scores of memory strategies scales on the Metamemory in Adulthood Questionnaire (<italic>r</italic> = 0.64) and the Memory Functioning Questionnaire (<italic>r</italic> = 0.66).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511434997">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Multiple Sclerosis Neuropsychological Screening Questionnaire (MSNQ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511434997">31</xref></sup> was used as a measure of neuropsychological competence with activities of daily living. Respondents rated how often they experienced each of the 15 items during the last three months. The items include common problems reported by persons with multiple sclerosis (e.g. being easily distracted, difficulty following conversations, forgetting appointments). The Cronbach’s alpha for internal consistency reliability ranged from 0.94 to 0.95 and scores were significantly correlated with scores on a battery of neuropsychological tests and measures of whole-brain lesion burden and atrophy in prior research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511434997">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215511434997">32</xref></sup></p>

<title>Analysis of data</title>
<p>Data analyses were conducted using SPSS version 18.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Frequency distributions, means, and standard deviations (SDs) were calculated for the demographic, neurocognitive performance, and other health- related variables. The design of the study was a repeated-measures design with three time points (baseline, immediate post intervention, and three months later). Thus we used a 2 × 3 repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM ANOVA) utilizing a multivariate approach to avoid the more stringent assumptions of the univariate model. The RM ANOVA procedure partitions variance in outcomes into components related to time, treatment group, and the interaction between time and treatment. The interaction effect is the most useful test of the intervention effects because we can determine if there is significantly greater change over time for the intervention group compared to the control group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215511434997">33</xref></sup> <italic>T</italic>-tests were used to compare the change scores (baseline to time 3) between the two groups. All tests were conducted with an alpha level of <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. Separate analyses were conducted for each of the outcome measures.</p>
<p>The analyses of effects of treatment on outcome measures were based on conservative intention-to-treat methodology. Thus, the final study sample for analysis of the intervention effects included those who had completed the baseline data collection and attended at least one of the classes. Missing values were replaced with the last observation value carried forward if the participant did not complete later measurements. If participants were missing an intermediate value (immediately after the intervention at time 2), we imputed the missing value as the average of times 1 and 3. In addition, baseline scores on the SDMT for 11 participants were invalidated due to testing error. For these 11 individuals, a multiple imputation procedure was used to impute their baseline values using the SPSS add-on module for missing values (SPSS 17.0 version).</p>

<p>On average, this sample had mild to moderate impairment from multiple sclerosis as EDSS scores ranged from 2.5 to 8.5 with a mean of 5.2 ± 1.23. The length of time since diagnosis with multiple sclerosis ranged from 1 to 29 years (mean ± SD, 12.2 ± 7.4 years). To ensure that the demographic and illness characteristics associated with the intervention and control groups were comparable, we used independent sample <italic>t</italic>-tests for continuous variables to test for differences between the two groups at baseline. The only significant baseline difference on the neuropsychological battery was significantly higher control group scores on the DKEFS (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences on the self-report measures, or in age, years of education, or time since diagnosis.</p>
<p>Overall, participation in the intervention was high. The mean number of classes attended was 6.1 (SD = 1.4) for intervention participants. The majority of the participants (79–82% each week) met or exceeded the minimum times of practice sessions each week of the prescribed tracks, as well as met or exceeded the minimum number of minutes of required practice (67–82% each week).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511434997">Table 2</xref> provides the means and standard deviations for the intervention and control groups on the major study variables. An examination of the pattern of scores across time periods and between groups revealed that the intervention group typically had greater gains over time than the comparison group. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215511434997">Table 3</xref>, the change scores from baseline to time 3 (five months) were significantly different between the two groups for two of the measures – the CVLT-Total (a performance measure of learning and memory) and the Strategy subscale of the Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (the self-report of the frequency of use of compensatory memory strategies).</p>

<p>The RM ANOVA analysis revealed that there were significant time effects observed for six of the seven neuropsychological performance tests, as well as the two self-report measures of use of compensatory strategies and the MSNQ (the measure of neuropsychological competence with activities of daily living). These significant time effects indicate that scores changed significantly over the five months for participants in both the MAPSS-MS and the wait list control groups. Two significant group × time interactions were observed. The interactions effect were significant for scores on the MMQ-Strategy, the self-report measure of the frequency of using compensatory memory strategies (<italic>F</italic> = 7.23, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and the CVLT-Total, the measure of verbal memory (F = 4.25, P&lt;0.05). The effect size in the ANOVAs (partial eta squared) was generally small (0.044 or less) for five of the seven neuropsychological tests, as well as the MSSE-Control and the MSNQ. However, a medium effect size (partial eta squared 0.06 or greater) was observed for the CVLT and the SDMT – the measures of verbal memory and complex scanning and visual tracking. There was a large interaction effect (partial eta squared of 0.20) for the measure of compensatory memory strategies.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This exploratory study of the MAPSS-MS intervention provided initial evidence that this intervention can assist persons with multiple sclerosis to develop compensatory strategies to manage cognitive symptoms. Although there were only two significant interaction effects (use of compensatory strategies and verbal memory) the observed effects were medium-large. In addition, almost all changes in scores over time were statistically significant and in the desired direction – including greater self-efficacy, more frequent use of compensatory strategies, and improved performance on neuropsychological tests. Overall, the MAPSS-MS group had greater improvements than the control group on four of the seven neuropsychological tests and on all three of the self-report measures. However, the observed differences between groups were small and most of the differences in change scores between groups were not statistically significant.</p>
<p>The large effect size observed for the significant time × group interaction (indicating a significant effect of the intervention over time) observed in the scale measuring use of compensatory memory strategies is not surprising. Building efficacy and skills for these strategies was the key focus of the group component of the intervention. Anecdotally, participants reported multiple examples of how use of new strategies allowed them to function more easily in their daily lives. For example, they learned that they were able to learn and retain information more easily when there were fewer distractions present. It is notable that the mean use of strategies remained stable from the end of the actual group sessions (time 2) when strategy use was being constantly reinforced to time 3 when individuals were ‘on their own’. This finding suggests that performance accomplishment (experiencing success in use of one behavior) may have transferred to use of other strategies. In fact, learning and using these strategies may have contributed to the medium effects seen in improvement in the CVLT scores, since many of the strategies recommended and practiced (e.g. clustering of words) could generalize to the follow-up testing sessions.</p>
<p>While there was no significant impact on scores of the measure of self-efficacy, this may be because the instrument used in this study includes many other multiple sclerosis symptoms that were not addressed in this intervention. Data provided in the homework logs (comments, minutes and times practiced) supported the feasibility of the home computer training and are reported in more depth elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511434997">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Findings from this exploratory randomized controlled trial of the MAPSS-MS intervention must be interpreted with caution because of the convenience sample and the potential for selection bias. Although participants were easily recruited for the study, in fact ‘perceived cognitive deficits’ were required in order to be eligible for the study. Thus, this sample may have been highly motivated to learn and use compensatory strategies. Treatment contamination is very difficult if not impossible to control in community-based studies. Given that participants could not be blinded to their assignment once they were assigned to a group, it is possible that persons assigned to the wait list control group may have independently sought out information on compensatory cognitive strategies through the Internet or text information. There are also numerous online cognitive training programs available to the public. Such proactive efforts may explain, in part, why persons in both groups made significant gains over time. In addition, the design of the study with a multi-component intervention limits the ability to determine if one or both components were responsible for the change in outcomes and the relatively small sample limited the power to find statistically significant effects in many of the analyses.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the inclusion criteria for this study included a perceived moderate level of cognitive difficulty rather than an objective performance measure of cognitive impairment on a neuropsychological test. We would argue that perception of cognitive deficits is, in fact, the most appropriate inclusion criterion as it considers the individual’s experience of their level of functioning as it interacts with the demands in their environment. Persons in demanding vocational or other life circumstances may be in fact ‘impaired’ in their roles if they lose even small amounts of their cognitive functional abilities, and compensatory strategies are essential to support their functioning. In addition, many people with multiple sclerosis – including those in this study – are well-educated, and thus it is likely that these individuals would have had pre-existing high performance on various tests. It is likely that such individuals might be facing substantial limitations and disability in their everyday lives and still not screen as cognitively impaired based on failure on tests.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate the powerful effects of group interventions to build self-efficacy for new compensatory behaviors with individual home-based computer training. With this innovative approach to improve cognitive functioning, participants had the opportunity in the group setting to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to enact strategies that could support their cognitive functioning. Participants then engaged in structured practice exercises on the computer that allowed them to build cognitive skills, practicing at home at times they have the most energy and that are more convenient. While most tests of cognitive interventions with persons with multiple sclerosis have limited outcomes with respect to performance on structured neuropsychological tests,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511434997">4</xref></sup> we added additional outcome measures to assess self-efficacy for management of multiple sclerosis, use of compensatory strategies, and neuropsychological competence in activities of daily living to determine whether the intervention effects on neuropsychological tests translate into the everyday lives of persons with multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>Although performance-based measures (e.g. neuropsychological tests) are often assumed to be superior to self-reported ones, no extensive empirical evidence exists to support this assumption. Sullivan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511434997">16</xref></sup> argue that while self-reports of cognitive functioning often correlate poorly with neuropsychological tests, the ultimate utility of self-report measures of cognitive function and other constructs lies in the information they add to performance outcomes, rather than the degree to which they are similar. In a direct comparison of self-report and performance measures of basic and instrumental ADLs, Meyers and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215511434997">34</xref></sup> found that relative to self-report questionnaires, performance measures were not psychometrically superior or more acceptable to participants. It seems likely that neuropsychological performance tests and self-reports of cognitive functioning (or problems with such) may in fact be measuring somewhat different constructs – how one operates in a complex demanding world versus how one performs on a structured exercise/test in a controlled environment. Unfortunately, this study is limited by the lack of a strong outcome reflecting cognitive functioning in everyday life.</p>
<p>While statistically significant effects are of primary interest to researchers, meaningful clinical effects are most important for practice. The effects of the interventions on the outcome variables, measured at five months post baseline (three months after completion of the intervention), were small–medium for all outcomes except use of memory strategies and CVLT scores which had a medium–large effect. While these small and limited effects on neuropsychological tests are somewhat disappointing, they are consistent with the reports in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511434997">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511434997">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511434997">14</xref></sup> The small effects may due be to insufficient strength of the intervention; however, one might also question whether an intervention that promoted compensation and adaptation would be expected to induce changes in performance on neuropsychological tests. While there is some initial evidence to support the possibility of neuroplasiticity in persons with multiple sclerosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511434997">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511434997">12</xref></sup> it is unlikely that a modest intervention would change the underlying impairment reflected in neuropsychological tests. Since this intervention focused on changes in behavior in the context of cognitive impairment, its impact on the underlying impairment as measured by the neuropsychological battery of tests may be of limited clinical significance. However, the 14% improvement in scores on the use of memory strategies for the MAPSS-MS group (compared to 0% change in the wait list control group) reflects the focus and impact of the intervention on compensation and adaptation and is likely to have clinically significant beneficial effects on the functioning of persons with multiple sclerosis. This effect is particularly notable in that it persisted three months after the intervention ended.</p>
<p>Given the frequency of difficulties with cognitive functioning among persons with multiple sclerosis and the lack of well-established cognitive rehabilitation interventions, future studies with larger samples are needed to further test and refine the MAPSS-MS intervention. The addition of a strong functional outcome measure is essential to explore whether the intervention generates improvement of cognitive functioning in ‘real world’ activities.</p>
