<p>On behalf of the Society of Experimental Biology and Medicine (SEBM) Council, the SEBM Publication Committee and the <italic>Experimental Biology and Medicine</italic> (EBM) Editorial Board, I welcome you to the first of what will be an annual Mini-Review Issue. We know that our readership enjoys the monthly mini-reviews which will continue in each issue. In addition to the mini-reviews that appear in our regular monthly issues, we have decided to publish the annual mini-review issue in subjects that are of particular interest to our readership. We invited authors and mini-review subjects for the annual issue primarily based on the number of downloads and citations of prior articles published in EBM. This will also be our practice for future annual Mini-Review Issues. Therefore it is an honor to be invited to submit a mini-review for this issue and all submitted mini-reviews undergo our typical rigorous review process.</p>
<p>I hope that you enjoy reading these articles and welcome your feedback on the concept of the annual issue as well as the subject matter of the mini-reviews.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Steven R. Goodman, PhD</p>
<p>Editor-in-Chief</p>
