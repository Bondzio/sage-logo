<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article represents the second part of an article on Chinese outbound tourists’ destination image of America. In Part I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287512451137">Li and Stepchenkova, forthcoming</xref>), the authors reported findings about Chinese outbound tourists’ perceptions of the United States as a travel destination. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512451137">Echtner and Ritchie’s (1993)</xref> three open-ended image questions were posed to 1,600 Chinese citizens. Using multiple analytical techniques, the authors found that Chinese outbound tourists generally viewed America as a highly developed, urban, modern country featuring an advanced economy, democratic system, and high technology.</p>
<p>Included in the respondents were four groups of past and potential Chinese tourists varying in outbound travel experiences and/or destination familiarity, which may be theorized as different travel horizons (THs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512451137">Oppermann 1998</xref>). Specifically, the sample included mainland Chinese citizens who had been to the United States for leisure purposes in the past three years, who had been to non-U.S. destinations outside of Asia in the past three years, who had traveled within Asia in the past three years and were interested in traveling outside of Asia in the next two years, and who had not traveled abroad in the past three years but were interested in traveling outside of Asia in the next two years. Essentially, these four groups represent four a priori market segments of interest to American (and other non-Asian) destinations and tourism service providers. The present article attempts to build on the findings from Part I and further explore the U.S. image held by the four groups of Chinese travelers with different THs.</p>
<p>Specifically, the objective of the study is to determine if differences in destination perceptions among the groups exist, and if so, examine what these differences are and whether these differences are in accordance with the TH proposition—in this study this is formulated as “groups with more outbound travel experience will exhibit more developed and nuanced images of outbound travel destinations.” To this end, the authors introduce here the concept of destination image diversity and its three indicators – richness, evenness, and dominance, analogous to such concepts in biology as species richness, species evenness, and species dominance, and apply the analytical tools to estimate biodiversity to destination image data. Furthermore, the pattern of destination image distribution for the four groups is also explored for fitting the power law distribution often used in economic analyses. Thus, the focus of the article is not only the image content (i.e., which groups hold what images), but also the diversity and distribution pattern of images held by different groups.</p>
<p>The authors consider the potential contribution of this study to be in theoretical and, especially, methodological areas. By introducing ideas from other disciplines to the study of destination image, the authors hope that this study contributes both to the image literature and interdisciplinary research on tourism in general. Furthermore, this article links image comparison with the idea of travel horizon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512451137">Oppermann 1998</xref>), which has not yet received much empirical testing. From a practical viewpoint, this study proposes a set of innovative measures for destination marketers to benchmark their destination image internally and externally.</p>

<title>Study Background</title>
<sec id="section3-0047287512451137">
<title>Travel Horizon as a Segmentation Criterion</title>
<p>As indicated, the authors postulate that the four groups of interest in this study seem to demonstrate different THs. The conceptualization of TH is generally credited to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287512451137">Schmidhauser (1976)</xref>, who defined the term as “the furthest destination traveled to during the period of investigation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512451137">Oppermann 1998</xref>, p. 321). The central premise of the idea is that one’s travel experiences or level of cultural exposure may be reflected by the furthest destination this individual had traveled at a certain point. To operationlize the idea, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287512451137">Schmidhauser (1976)</xref> classified Swiss residents into four TH categories: Switzerland (domestic trip), neighboring countries, other Europe, and outside Europe. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512451137">Oppermann’s (1998)</xref> own study on the New Zealand travel population used seven categories: no travel, same New Zealand island, other New Zealand island, Australia, Pacific islands, Europe, and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The utility of the TH notion is in its reflection of the influence of past travel experiences on travelers’ future destination choices. Central to the idea of TH is the distance issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512451137">Oppermann 1998</xref>). While it appears geographic distance is the obvious criterion when defining THs, cultural and psychological distances also play an implicit yet important role. For instance, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512451137">Oppermann’s (1998)</xref> category, Europe, rather than the much closer Asia, was singled out as a separate category because of Europe’s cultural and historic ties with New Zealand. Not coincidentally, the critical role of both geographical and cultural distances in travel decision making has been well documented in the tourism literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287512451137">Crotts 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287512451137">McKercher and Lew 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287512451137">Reisinger and Turner 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0047287512451137">2002b</xref>).</p>
<p>Another noteworthy factor about TH is time frame. From a lifetime perspective, an individual can only follow an expanding TH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287512451137">Teichmann and Zins 2009</xref>)—one can only ascend (or halt) on this horizon “ladder,” given that TH is defined by “the maximum achieved distance zone in the past” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512451137">Oppermann 1998</xref>, p. 323). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512451137">Oppermann (1998)</xref> questioned the relevance of a lifelong TH because a trip to another continent 20 years earlier is unlikely to reflect one’s present travel pattern. His empirical research showed that travelers do not always continue expanding their TH or visiting the most distant destination zone they ever attained. More often than not, travelers may find a comfortable destination zone and continue revisiting it, a phenomenon he called “destination horizon zone loyalty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512451137">Oppermann 1998</xref>, p. 328). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512451137">Oppermann (1998)</xref> hence proposed the notion of “destination zone horizon,” which analyzes THs in shorter periods of time and accounts for the fact that travelers may ascend, stay, or descend on the horizon ladder because of changing personal circumstances and family life-cycle stages.</p>
<p>The idea of TH focuses on individual tourists’ changing vacation space. Presumably, the idea was developed for and mostly applies to tourists in developed countries, where travel behavior is mainly subject to individual circumstances rather than societal constraints or governmental regulations. It has been suggested that individuals’ travel behavior could vary substantially in markets of varying level of maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287512451137">Dolnicar and Laesser 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>At a macro level, it has been suggested that a country’s economic development (in terms of overall affluence and wealth distribution) affects its citizens’ tourism participation and, in turn, collective TH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287512451137">Burton 1995</xref>). In the present case, the Mainland Chinese outbound market is still in its infancy, where participating in long-haul travel outside Asia remains uncommon, but is gaining popularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287512451137">Li et al. 2010</xref>). One may argue that as a whole, the Chinese market’s collective TH is expanding, with a small group of adventurers spearheading travel to new and distant destinations. Within this small but growing group of elite Chinese are four subgroups with varying THs, and their perceptions of the U.S. as a destination are the focus of this article.</p>

<title>Destination Images Comparisons</title>
<p>Comparing destination images held by different groups is fairly common in the tourism destination image literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287512451137">Gallarza, Saura, and Garcia 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047287512451137">Pike 2002</xref>). For instance, researchers have investigated image variances between prospective and actual tourists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287512451137">Awaritefe 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287512451137">Fakeye and Crompton 1991</xref>), first-time and repeat visitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287512451137">Fakeye and Crompton 1991</xref>), domestic and international travelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287512451137">Bonn, Joseph, and Dai 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0047287512451137">Shin 2006</xref>), tourists and locals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0047287512451137">Witter 1985</xref>), and tourists of different nationalities and cultural backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287512451137">Brown 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287512451137">Kozak et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287512451137">MacKay and Fesenmaier 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0047287512451137">Therkelsen 2003</xref>). Underlying such comparisons are arguably two assumptions. First, experiences and familiarity with a destination influence one’s destination perception formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287512451137">Baloglu 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287512451137">Chon 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287512451137">Pearce 1982</xref>). Put differently, people with varying experiences and knowledge about a destination tend to perceive the same destination in different ways. Second, the same destination image message could be interpreted differently depending on information receivers’ own cultural and sociodemographic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287512451137">Stepchenkova and Mills 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0047287512451137">Therkelsen 2003</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0047287512451137">Tasci, Gartner, and Cavusgil (2007</xref>, p. 216) indicate, “There is no reason to suspect that the main components of image may be internalized in the same way by different populations. The potential market for a destination may, and probably does, focus on different destination attributes (i.e., cognitive), have different feelings toward that destination . . . and select different destinations (conative) than other groups with different interests and experiences.” Indeed, in both marketing and tourism literature, the idea that different groups may perceive the same product/destination differently has engendered a line of research on image-based market segmentation, where a potential market is segmented based on the intragroup homogeneity and intergroup distinction of destination perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287512451137">Ahmed 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287512451137">Gensch 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287512451137">Leisen 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287512451137">Obenour, Groves, and Lengfelder 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>From a methodology perspective, most image studies traditionally used quantitative/structured techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287512451137">Echtner and Ritchie 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512451137">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047287512451137">Pike 2002</xref>). This has changed in recent years, partly thanks to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287512451137">Echtner and Richie’s (1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512451137">1993)</xref> advocacy for more balanced methodological choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0047287512451137">Tasci, Gartner, and Cavusgil 2007</xref>). For instance, a meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287512451137">Stepchenkova and Mills (2010)</xref> identified 47 of 152 recent image studies employing qualitative approaches. Nevertheless, when comparing the destination image of different groups (or across different destinations for positioning purposes), the vast majority of studies seem to employ the conventional quantitative approach (e.g., cluster analysis), while image data collected via qualitative/unstructured approaches have rarely been used for comparison purposes. Quantitative comparison of destination image is generally made on a structured list of destination attributes, when the image components being compared are predetermined by researchers. The comparison usually involves the computing of group means on respondents’ ratings, a practice repeatedly criticized by researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287512451137">Dolnicar and Grabler 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512451137">Pan and Li 2011</xref>). Conceptually, such comparison only reflects the destination’s “performances” on those predetermined attributes perceived by respondents, whereas the respondents’ individualistic impression or knowledge of the destination is largely ignored.</p>
<p>In summary, previous studies on destination image comparison were largely cocooned by the quantitative treatment of data collected through structured methodologies. By nature, the conventional approach tends to limit the comparison to image content only. To the authors’ best knowledge, no study has compared the structure and distribution of images held by different groups. Furthermore, in most cases, previous image comparison studies are for market segmentation purpose, with image used as a market segmentation criterion. In contrast, this study goes the other way around: groups in this study were determined in a commonsense segmentation approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287512451137">Dolnicar 2004</xref>) and the focus was image comparison per se. The authors attempt to explore new and effective ways of comparing qualitative image information using ideas from other disciplines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0047287512451137">
<title>Image Diversity: Richness, Evenness, and Dominance Indices</title>
<p>To introduce a new perspective for measuring destination image, it would help to imagine a large pond housing many fish species. By definition, the total amount of fish in the pond depends on the number of fish species and the population of each fish species. Potential travelers have various images associated with a particular destination. Readers may imagine that these destination images, like fish, “swim” in a large pond. Distinct images, that is, those assigned a unique code in the data collection process, are akin to fish species, and each distinct image has its own population in this hypothetical destination image pool. The populations of distinct images differ in size depending on how many people share these distinct images. Arguably, each market, or market segment, has its own destination image pool. When researchers conduct a destination image survey in a market, it is akin to capturing fish from this pool: each species has its own probability to be captured, depending on its population size proportional to the total number of fish in the pool.</p>
<p>The destination image pool of any travel market (or segment) can be characterized by a number of distinct images, and this number may be referred to as the richness of the destination image pool. Connecting this to the TH concept, the question becomes: Does a group whose members have a broader TH tend to have a more diversified image pool (i.e., more distinct images could be found in the pool) compared with that of the group with narrower TH? Another question would be, Do the pools of various groups differ in some other ways as well? For example, if the richness indicator entails the number of distinct images in the pool, then another indicator depicting how distinct images vary in size may be useful, too.</p>
<p>The question, therefore, is how to quantitatively describe destination image pools for any group of travelers. That is, what indicators are needed to detect differences between image pools? How does one calculate these indicators? And, desirably, how does one statistically compare different image pools on meaningful and interpretable parameters? The aforementioned “destination image pool” analogy naturally led the authors to explore the applicability of methods used to assess biodiversity in natural sciences, primarily in biology, in destination image context. Notably, statistical models and methods used for estimating biodiversity have been applied to other fields as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287512451137">Carothers 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287512451137">Eddy 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287512451137">Holst 1981</xref>), particularly in linguistics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287512451137">Efron and Thisted 1976</xref> for an example).</p>
<p>Various methods exist to estimate biodiversity; the whole field started in the 1930s, with influential works by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287512451137">Fisher, Corbet, and Williams (1943)</xref>, who provided the mathematical foundation on statistical sampling approaches to estimate biodiversity (for a more detailed overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287512451137">Chao 1984</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512451137">Magurran 1988</xref>). Biodiversity consists of two main components—the variety and the relative abundance of species. Among scores of indicators describing an environmental population, three main groups of measures are as follows: (1) species richness indices, that is, how many species there are; (2) species abundance indices that relate to equitability of various species in the community; and (3) indices that integrate both richness and evenness into a single indicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512451137">Magurran 1988</xref>). The three indices used particularly often are species richness <italic>S</italic>, evenness <italic>E</italic>, and Simpson’s dominance index <italic>D</italic>. Together they succinctly describe regional biodiversity, which allows comparisons of various biocommunities.</p>
<p>When a community has natural boundaries of space and time, species richness is considered the simplest indicator of that community’s diversity, which is most often understood as the number of species present there. However, when it is impossible to survey the whole community and a sample is used instead, the species richness is calculated as the number of different species present in the sample. Typically, the larger the sample size, the greater the richness value. Thus, to account for differences in sample sizes, Margalef’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287512451137">Clifford and Stephenson 1975</xref>) and Menhinick’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0047287512451137">Whittaker 1977</xref>) richness indices are used (for formulae see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287512451137">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>However, though intuitively simple and easy to calculate, species richness <italic>S</italic> does not take into account the number of individuals in each of the species, that is, the measure does not discriminate between communities—the ones where all species have the same abundance and those with one or two dominant species. Therefore, diversity depends not only on richness but also on evenness, a measure that accounts for differences in population sizes. Given two communities with the same level of richness, the one where different species have similar abundance is considered more even and, therefore, more diverse. The formula for calculating species evenness <italic>E</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512451137">Magurran 1988</xref>) is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287512451137">Table 1</xref>. The numerator in this formula is called Shannon’s <italic>H</italic>, and the denominator is the value at which the Shannon’s <italic>H</italic> reaches its maximum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287512451137">Pielou 1969</xref>). Ideally, the Shannon’s <italic>H</italic> is calculated under the assumptions that the individuals are sampled randomly from an “infinitely large” population, and all species that can be found in the community are represented in the sample. The evenness measure <italic>E</italic> ranges between 0 and 1, reaching the value of 1 when all species are equally abundant.</p>
<p>While Shannon’s <italic>H</italic> and, consequently, the evenness measure <italic>E</italic> place a greater weight on the equitability of the population sizes of different species in the sample, the Simpson’s dominance index <italic>D</italic> is weighted toward the abundances of the most common species in the sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512451137">Magurran 1988</xref>). On a side note, a similar index was developed in linguistics to describe the vocabulary used by different authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0047287512451137">Southwood 1978</xref>). The Simpson’s <italic>D</italic> calculates the probability that two individuals randomly selected from a sample will belong to the same species; the larger the <italic>D</italic> value, the less diverse the community is. Therefore, reciprocal of <italic>D</italic> is often used instead for consistency and ease of interpretation (i.e., the larger the index, the greater a diversity). In this study, the reciprocal of Simpson’s <italic>D</italic> is referred to as dominance 1/<italic>D</italic> diversity indicator.</p>
<p>With respect to the destination image pool context, the three main indicators in destination image diversity would be (1) image richness <italic>S</italic>, the number of distinct images that a certain group holds about a destination; (2) image evenness <italic>E</italic>, which reflects how many individuals from a particular group share these distinct images; and (3) Simpson’s 1/<italic>D</italic>, a measure that reflects both richness and evenness of destination image. Taken together, these three indicators effectively describe a destination image pool of a particular market segment, or group of people, from various aspects and provide a succinct summary of its diversity. One may reason that populations of tourists with different THs would demonstrate different levels of image diversity.</p>

<title>Image Distribution</title>
<p>The distribution pattern of image terms recently discussed in the tourism literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512451137">Pan and Li 2011</xref>) may be another dimension of destination image comparison. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512451137">Pan and Li (2011)</xref> suggested that the linguistic structure of destination image held by the population may follow a power law distribution. The power law distribution is described by the formula <italic>y</italic> =<italic>ax</italic><sup><italic>k</italic></sup>, and many natural and social phenomena—the number of links websites receive from other sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287512451137">Adamic and Huberman 2000</xref>) to the fluctuations of stock prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287512451137">Gabaix et al. 2003</xref>)—follow this pattern. Another example would be linguistic studies where it is well accepted that, for large bodies of natural language utterances, the relationship between the frequency of a word and its rank based on that frequency is inversely proportional and subject to the power law distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0047287512451137">Zipf 1949</xref>). In the context of destination image studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512451137">Pan and Li (2011)</xref> reasoned that respondents’ answers (very short image phrases) to open-ended image questions can be considered as a special type of language utterance whose distribution may also follow the power law curve. Their empirical study showed that the phrases tourists use to describe their image of a destination follow the power law distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512451137">Pan and Li 2011</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether the images of different populations of tourists will exhibit similar or different patterns.</p>
<p>In business, the power law distribution is often referred to as the Pareto, or 80–20 rule: 80% of a company’s profit may come from the sales of 20% of its product items, that is, a small number of “star” products accounts for a large portion of revenue. Those most popular items (usually 10%-20% of the whole inventory) make the “head” of the sales distribution, measured as a sales volume. Niche products, that is, less popular but more numerous items, collectively account for the rest of sales volume; thus, they form the “tail” of the distribution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287512451137">Anderson (2006)</xref> argues that under certain scenarios distributions may have “long tails,” meaning that numerous niche products can collectively generate quite a large portion of the revenue. The 80–20 rule emphasizes the importance of the “head” of the sales distribution (according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287512451137">Pareto, Schwier, and Page 1971</xref>, the distribution is split 80–20 when the coefficient <italic>k</italic> is in the vicinity of −1), while the long-tail phenomenon highlights the importance of the “tail”; nevertheless, these two essentially are different materializations of the power law distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287512451137">Elberse 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512451137">Pan and Li 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>One related concept proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512451137">Pan and Li (2011)</xref> is image distinctiveness, which they used to describe the degree to which survey respondents used rare, obscure images in their answer choices. They argued that, although dominant, popular destination images are important, niche images could play a crucial role in online destination marketing too, because tourists may use them as online search keywords, and tourists who come up with less common image phrases were more likely to visit the destination. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512451137">Pan and Li (2011</xref>, p. 145) defined the distinctiveness of image phrases as “the rareness or uniqueness of a phrase in a corpus of language utterance” and computed the value as “the reciprocal of the proportion of its frequency to the number of total phrases in a text corpus.” The distinctiveness value indicates which group tends to use more rare images as answer choices and, in this sense, relates more to the “tail” of the image distribution. It seems logical to reason that tourists of different THs may exhibit different shapes of the image distribution curve and image distinctiveness.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>The foregoing review attempts to lay the theoretical and methodological foundation of this study. We started from a brief review on the idea of TH, which provides the conceptual rationale to this comparative analysis―it explains why we presumed that the four groups may hold distinctive perceptions in the first place and may also help the subsequent interpretation and discussion of the findings. We then reviewed how image comparison studies have been conducted to date. The gaps identified through the review call for more innovative measures and perspectives of image comparison, particularly when dealing with categorical image data. Hence we propose the use of measures from biology and business to examine the variety and distribution pattern of destination images held by different groups of travelers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287512451137">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>As indicated, the present article is the second of two articles focusing on image-related findings of a large project studying the Mainland Chinese outbound travel market from an American perspective. Data for this study were collected through face-to-face interviews with 1,600 citizens of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, three gateway cities of China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287512451137">Arlt 2006</xref>). Combined, the study targeted four types of past or potential Chinese long-haul outbound travelers (i.e., Chinese citizens who have traveled outside of Asia or plan to do so in the near future). The sample included four distinct groups, each containing 400 respondents: (1) the “USA” group—those who had been to the United States for leisure purposes in the past three years; (2) the “Outside Asia” group—those who traveled outside of Asia (but not to the United States) in the past three years; (3) the “Within Asia” group—individuals who had traveled within Asia in the past three years and were interested in traveling outside of Asia in the next two years; and (4) the “Potential” group—those who had not traveled outside of China in the past three years but were interested in traveling outside of Asia in the next two years. Because of a lack of baseline information and sampling frame, respondents were convenience sampled (see Part I for details of the sampling procedure). Presumably, the USA and the Outside Asia groups exceeded the Within Asia group, which, in turn, exceeded the Potential group in terms of outbound travel experiences as well as destination knowledge and familiarity with the United States.</p>
<p>The survey took an unstructured approach and asked respondents three open-ended questions adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512451137">Echtner and Ritchie (1993</xref> p, 5): (1) <italic>What images or characteristics come to mind when you think of XXX as a vacation destination?</italic> (2) <italic>How would you describe the atmosphere or mood that you would expect to experience while visiting XXX?</italic> and (3) <italic>Please list any distinctive or unique tourist attractions that you can think of in XXX</italic>. Using the terminology proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287512451137">Stepchenkova and Morrison (2008)</xref>, these three questions captured the “stereotypical image,” “affective image,” and “uniqueness image” of the United States as a travel destination. For each question, the respondents could give up to three answers, which were later professionally coded and translated into English.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0047287512451137">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>First, the analyses started with chi-square tests to compare the frequencies of the most popular images for the four groups on each of the three questions—stereotypical, affective, and uniqueness—to determine whether a particular group associated the United States with certain images more than other groups; the analyses afforded a “close up” look into the U.S. destination images held by identified four market segments.</p>
<p>Second, the researchers proceeded with calculating the diversity indicators. For stereotypical, affective, and uniqueness questions, richness, evenness, and dominance measures were computed for each group. The statistical models for calculation of the indices—for example, randomness of the sample and specific types of underlying distributions recommended for particular indices—assume the ideal conditions, which in the real world can only be approximated. For example, the Shannon index <italic>H</italic> assumes that the sample contains all species (images in the present context) that exist in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512451137">Magurran 1988</xref>). In light of the large sample size of this study, the authors would maintain that it is unlikely images with high frequencies had been missed in the data collection procedure; however, it is quite possible that not all uncommon images had been captured in the sample. The random sampling condition was not met in this study either; however, the samples were drawn from a very large, “almost infinite,” population. The diversity analysis allowed a more “distant” outlook at the image distributions of the four groups. The analysis was intended to see which group had the largest number of image classes in the destination pool, as well as in which pool the populations of the image classes were distributed more evenly.</p>
<p>Third, the analysis focused on whether the shape of image distributions followed the power law. Specifically, the study estimated the power law equation <italic>y</italic> =<italic>ax</italic><sup><italic>k</italic></sup> for each group and statistically compared coefficients <italic>k</italic> and <italic>a</italic> of different curves, following the procedure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0047287512451137">Zar (1984)</xref>. Furthermore, the authors compared the different groups with respect to the 80–20 rule, calculating the head of image distributions for each one of the three questions, using the “head-tail” definitions given in an earlier section and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287512451137">Table 1</xref>. If, for example, for hypothetical group 1 and group 2, 20% of all distinct images account for 75% and 85% of all images, respectively, it means that group 2 has a “fatter” head than group 1. The fatter head was interpreted as a distribution being more “concentrated,” since the same share of all distinct images accounts for a larger share of the immediate recall by survey participants. Finally, the authors calculated the image distinctiveness indices for each survey respondent and compared the four groups on this measure using ANOVA.</p>

<title>Respondents’ Profile</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287512451137">Table 2</xref> reports demographic profile of the whole sample and each of the four groups on such characteristics as gender, age, marital status, education, occupation, and income. As shown, the four groups differ on several sociodemographic dimensions. For instance, the Potential group had the lowest household income and education level, which is not surprising. In comparison, the USA and Outside Asia groups had the largest number of respondents with at least some college education and seemed to be wealthier than other groups. Although the respondents were convenience sampled, the demographic characteristics of the four groups seemed to be consistent with the expectation.</p>

<title>Image Content</title>
<p>The formal comparisons of the popular, or most frequent, images were conducted using chi-square tests. Each image—stereotypical, affective, and uniqueness—was analyzed separately. The initial dataset containing respondents’ three answers to each question was reconfigured to a format where for every image code each survey participant had a “1” (the subject named a particular image in their answer choices) or a “0” (the subject did not mention that image) response. A “missing response” code was added to the analysis: if a person had at least one missing answer out of three answer choices, that respondent had the value of “1” for the “missing response” code, and “0” otherwise. The most popular images were identified by calculating overall frequencies of each image code and taking top 20 images, respectively (the number of 20 was chosen arbitrarily). It was ensured, however, for statistical purposes, that each selected image had at least five mentions by each group; if not, such an image was excluded.</p>
<p>The statistical differences across the groups were found for nine, five, and eight images for the stereotypical, affective, and uniqueness questions, respectively (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0047287512451137">Tables 3</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0047287512451137"/>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0047287512451137">5</xref>). The chi-square analyses revealed that the USA and Outside Asia groups see the United States as an open democratic society, with friendly people, where one can relax, while Within Asia and Potential groups perceived the U.S. as an economically developed, scenic, and beautiful country. Overall, the Potential group had a significantly larger number of missing responses than any other group. The results of the analyses seemed to indicate that responses were not missing at random—it appears people who had not traveled abroad had more difficulty in naming images associated with the United States as a travel destination, in imagining what their mood/feelings would be while visiting the country, and were less informed about American destinations and attractions compared to members from other groups. The results of the chi-square analyses are further discussed in the Discussion section.</p>

The probability <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> of image <italic>i</italic> was computed as the frequency of this image <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> found in the sample divided by the total number of given responses <italic>N</italic> (sample size). The Margalef’s index <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>Mg</italic></sub>, a richness measure adjusted for a sample size, was also calculated. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0047287512451137">Table 6</xref>, the least experienced group—Potential—had the lowest <italic>S</italic> and <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>Mg</italic></sub> indices values across all three questions. The chi-square tests were conducted to formally compare the richness <italic>S</italic> of the four destination image pools for each question. The observed richness <italic>S</italic> was taken from the sample, and for the expected number of <italic>S</italic> the researchers used the average of the richness values across the four groups. For the uniqueness question, the difference in richness values <italic>S</italic> was found to be statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0047287512451137">Table 6</xref>).</p>

<p>With respect to the evenness measure of image diversity, pairwise <italic>t</italic>-test comparisons indicated that for stereotypical image, the evenness indices of the more experienced USA and Outside Asia groups were significantly higher than those of the less experienced Within Asia and Potential groups. For uniqueness image, the tests indicated that the four image pools significantly differed from each other on evenness measure, with the USA group having the largest and the Potential group the lowest evenness values. For affective image, no pairwise differences were detected between the groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0047287512451137">Table 6</xref>).</p>
<p>As for the dominance 1/D measure, the USA and Outside Asia groups had higher values of the index for the stereotypical and uniqueness questions, which indicates higher diversity, but not for the affective image question. The results of the diversity analyses are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0047287512451137">Table 6</xref> and seem to give partial support to the TH proposition that the more experienced travelers have a more diverse image, particularly with respect to stereotypical and, especially, uniqueness images of the United States.

<p>To find out whether the shapes of the distributions, that is, coefficients <italic>a</italic> and <italic>k</italic>, differed for any pairs of power curves, the authors applied a logarithmic transformation to both the rank and frequency variables and fitted the regression lines through the transformed data. Then, following the procedure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0047287512451137">Zar (1984)</xref>, the authors conducted pairwise comparisons of the regression lines—and, consequently, any two power curves—in terms of equality of their coefficients <italic>a</italic> and <italic>k</italic>. For stereotypical image, pairwise differences in intercepts <italic>a</italic> and slopes <italic>k</italic> of the regression lines were not detected, meaning that the shapes of all four distribution curves were the same. For affective image, the slope of the Outside Asia regression line was statistically greater (in absolute value) than the slope of the Within Asia line. With respect to uniqueness image, the slope of the Potential group regression line was larger (in absolute value) than the slopes of both the USA and the Outside Asia regression lines.

<p>With respect to the head–tail distribution split, the 20% heads were calculated for the group distributions for stereotypical, affective, and uniqueness images (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0047287512451137">Table 7</xref>). To help visualize accumulation of image responses within the groups, the authors calculated the relative shares (%) of each distinct image in the total response volume, starting with the most frequent and ending with the least frequent images. Then the authors constructed cumulative percentage response curves of each group for each image distribution—stereotypical, affective, and uniqueness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0047287512451137">Figure 1</xref>). The left-hand charts of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0047287512451137">Figure 1</xref> demonstrate that image distributions of the four groups have a similar shape: the differences between distribution heads are the largest for affective image between the Outside Asia (86.6%) and the Potential (83.3%) groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0047287512451137">Table 7</xref>); it means that the Outside Asia affective image has the largest concentration. On the right-hand charts, however, for stereotypical and uniqueness images, the Potential curve hits the 80% mark the quickest. In absolute numbers, the Potential group has the most concentrated stereotypical and uniqueness images, with 50 and 15 distinct images accounting for 80% of all responses, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0047287512451137">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0047287512451137">Table 7</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512451137">Pan and Li (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287512451137">Jurafsky and Martin (2000)</xref>, the distinctiveness value of each image was calculated. As indicated, distinctiveness was operationalized as the reciprocal of the probability of a phrase to appear in a stereotypical, affective, and uniqueness corpus of language responses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287512451137">Table 1</xref>). For every survey respondent, the distinctiveness values of his or her three answer choices were averaged, and the groups were compared on these values using ANOVA. The results indicated that for the uniqueness image question, the groups with broader THs—the USA and Outside Asia groups—had significantly larger distinctiveness values than the other two less experienced groups, meaning that these groups were more likely to use niche or oblivious images in their answers. No difference in distinctiveness values was detected for the stereotypical and affective image questions.

<p>A summary of distribution analysis offers three points. First, image distributions for various market segments seem to follow the power law. Second, shapes of image distributions for the four groups are very close, with the largest groups differences registered (1) between the USA and Potential groups and between Outside Asia and Potential groups for the uniqueness image and (2) between the Outside Asia and Within Asia groups for the affective image. Third, the Potential group has the most concentrated uniqueness image. Thus, the image distribution analysis gives some support to the TH proposition. The implications of the analysis are further discussed in the Discussion section.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article analyzes the differences in destination image perceptions of the U.S. by four distinct groups of Chinese past and potential travelers. Underlying the analysis is the notion of travel horizon—travel experience level of the respondents established at the time of the survey. The four groups—USA, Outside Asia, Within Asia, and Potential—supposedly varied in accumulated travel experiences; thus, to assess whether their different THs were reflected by their destination image was the objective of the article.</p>
<p>Methodologically, the study suggests new tools of group image comparisons. In the past, such comparisons mainly focused on image content using data generated through structured techniques. The present article addresses image comparison from a perspective of image diversity and distribution pattern. The authors tested several measures for cross-group image comparison, drawing on the ideas of species biodiversity developed in biology and the power law distribution often used in business and economics. By introducing ideas from other disciplines when exploring new research territory, this study expands the scope of destination image studies.</p>
<p>The chi-square comparisons of the most frequent images revealed that different groups do seem to prefer some images to the others. The groups with broader TH—the USA and Outside Asia—see the United States as an open, democratic, and free society, with a friendly population, where one can relax. Overall, these destination features are rather abstract and intangible. The less experienced groups—Within Asia and Potential—associated the United States with more tangible objects and perceived the country as economically developed, scenic, and beautiful. With respect to such characteristics as modernization and clean environment, the USA group mentioned these images more often, which indicated that their firsthand experience with these features was very positive. The group comparison on the amount of missing responses revealed that people with the narrowest THs, the Potential group, did seem to experience more difficulty in coming up with three images than did members of the other three groups.</p>
<p>From the perspective of image diversity, the study calculated and compared several indicators across the four groups: richness <italic>S</italic>, evenness measure <italic>E</italic>, and dominance index 1/<italic>D</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0047287512451137">Table 6</xref>). The results partially supported the TH proposition that travelers with lower horizon levels have a less diversified destination image of the United States. More experienced travelers from the USA and Outside Asia groups hold more diverse stereotypical and, especially, uniqueness images of the United States. With regard to the affective image, the findings were rather mixed.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512451137">Pan and Li (2011)</xref> first brought attention of the researchers to the distribution pattern of destination image. This article conducted a series of analyses to compare the shape of image distribution patterns of the four groups. The findings suggest that image distributions of different groups follow the power law; thus, short language utterances obtained in the survey are also the subjects of the universality of the law. Another interesting result is that the shapes of all curves were surprisingly similar, despite statistical differences found between certain groups in two of three questions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0047287512451137">Table 7</xref>). The head–tail split and cumulative distribution curves also reflected the closeness of the group image distributions, with one possible exception—the Potential group, which had the most concentrated image for both stereotypical and uniqueness images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0047287512451137">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0047287512451137">Table 7</xref>).</p>
<p>Results of affective data analysis were somewhat counterintuitive with respect to the TH proposition. For affective image, the two more experienced groups—USA and Outside Asia—had more concentrated images than the other two less experienced groups. This could mean that people who travel a lot do not need to guess what their affective states would be when on-site; they know well what their feelings will be, at least for high-profile destinations like the United States. And people who travel the least may find it difficult to imagine the affective states associated with traveling abroad; thus, the answers they gave in the survey were, to some degree, guess work.</p>
<p>By contrast, the distinctiveness analysis emphasized the differences in the use of uncommon and niche images, and, in a sense, concentrated more on the tail of the image distribution. The distinctiveness comparisons indicated no differences in use of rare images for the stereotypical and affective questions across the four groups. With respect to the uniqueness question, however, the USA and Outside Asia groups demonstrated statistically higher distinctiveness values than did the Within Asia and Potential groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0047287512451137">Table 8</xref>), meaning that members of the more experienced groups were more likely to mention rare images in their answers. The results of the distinctiveness analysis appear to lend partial support to the TH proposition: people with broader THs have more nuanced and developed destination images than those with less travel experience.</p>
<p>Overall, the TH-based segments did not exhibit as substantial image differences (in terms of magnitude and consistency) as the authors expected. It is possible that the notion of TH is a behavior-based concept, which may not predict well respondents’ attitudes such as destination image. Furthermore, in today’s highly globalized environment, many Chinese tourists, particularly the groups surveyed in this study, are highly knowledgeable about the United States regardless of their travel experiences. Particularly, this high knowledge level may be attributed to the Internet prevalence—in this sample, the level of high-speed Internet access was greater than 90% (Part I).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the authors suspect that because this study targeted only past and potential outbound travelers, the differences of their TH may not be substantial enough to cause significant image distinction. Readers are reminded that the four groups studied in this article, all presumably being China’s social elites, currently represent only a tiny portion of the Chinese population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287512451137">Li et al. 2011</xref>). Evidence from a recent study has also shown that outbound tourists from emerging markets like China may be a relatively homogeneous group at the initial stage of market development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287512451137">Li et al., forthcoming</xref>). It is possible that including other groups of the general population, whose TH is more distinctive, may generate different results. For instance, one consistent pattern emerging from this study is that groups of broader THs did demonstrate different destination images from their counterparts with narrower TH. Presumably, if nontourist groups (e.g., those who have no overseas travel experiences and no intention of traveling in the near future) are included in the comparative analysis, their destination images could be quite different.</p>
<p>Despite its strong theoretical and methodological flavor, the approach proposed in this article has practical relevance as well. The described measures could be effective tools for image benchmarking and destination competitive analysis. In the past, destination marketers usually consider image findings through unstructured/qualitative approaches interesting but of limited value. If a destination finds 60% of tourists associated it with images A, B, and C five years ago, but only 50% do so now, is this an improvement or dilution of the destination brand power? If destination X has several highly concentrated images whereas destination Y’s image is more diverse, which one has a competitive advantage? At what point will a concentrated image (i.e., a destination has a uniform image, which may be interpreted as either a clear image or a monotonous one) or the opposite (i.e., potential customers can associate the destination with many subjects, which may be interpreted as either a multifaceted image or a vague one) become a liability? All these questions are relevant to Destination Marketing Organizations’ (DMOs) branding practices, as they need to know when to work on either enriching or simplifying their brand perceptions. Answers to these questions call for valid and reliable measures on image diversity and distribution patterns, and the present study demonstrated the utility of some measures.</p>
<p>Findings of this study may also shed some light on understanding the Chinese outbound tourists and market. For American destinations and service providers, findings from this and the previous article (Part I) drew a comprehensive picture of how Chinese outbound tourists view the United States as a travel destination. Specifically, the present article suggests that the four commonsense segments included in this study shared somewhat similar destination images. Because destination image is generally considered an important determinant of travel intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287512451137">Chen and Tsai 2007</xref>) and trip evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287512451137">Bigne, Sanchez, and Sanchez 2001</xref>), this result implies that these groups might share similar behavioral patterns, and marketing communication programs for these four groups could share some similar components. Destination marketers communicating with more experienced travelers may focus more on the emotional, unique aspect of a destination’s image, while, in contrast, when communicating with less experienced groups, the focus may be general product awareness building.</p>
<sec id="section17-0047287512451137">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>Some of the limitations of this study have been reported in Part I of the article; therefore, the authors would like to point out a few issues specifically related to the analyses described here in Part II.</p>
<p>The validity of statistical analysis concerned with population diversity depends on the underlying statistical model. The statistical model, for which biodiversity indices were developed, supposes that the items in the sample are randomly selected. However, a random selection of the survey respondents was unobtainable in this study, and participants were convenience sampled from a very large population (Part I). In addition, the requirement to provide up to three image responses by each survey participant may constitute a more serious departure from the ideal statistical model. In calculating the probabilities of various images, the authors implicitly considered three images given by one person as images given by three different people, independently from one another. This treatment may have reduced the actual probabilities of certain images and increased others. Of course, when it was difficult for a person to come up with three different images, he or she often opt to provide one or two answers instead of three, which may have somewhat corrected the image probabilities toward their true levels. Thus, it is advisable to approximate the ideal statistical model for calculating the diversity indices more closely in future studies, for example, by analyzing the first answer choice only and comparing the results with the indicators presented in this study.</p>
<p>When destination image surveys are conducted, some images will invariably be missed, and the question is, How many missing distinct images are there? Several estimates exist for various statistical models of population. A well-known one proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287512451137">Chao (1984)</xref> supposes that the number of missing species (i.e., those that have not been observed) can be obtained by studying the numbers of rare species, those met in the sample only once (singletons) and twice (doubletons). Thus, another direction of further research is to estimate the richness numbers of the destination image pools, taking into account missing distinct images, preferably for various destinations and marketing segments.</p>
<p>The novelty of the analysis on image diversity and, consequently, the absence of the point of reference in destination image studies make it difficult to assess if the observed differences among groups are large enough to warrant “definite” conclusions (e.g., with respect to the TH proposition) or recommendations for any marketing action. It does seem that the range of the evenness measures is within the limits indicated by the biodiversity literature, which can serve as an indirect confirmation of the viability of the approach. For example, in this study, the value of Shannon <italic>H</italic> for the affective and uniqueness images lie within the (1.5, 3.5) interval of typical values (with the USA uniqueness <italic>H</italic>-value just slightly over 3.5); and the <italic>H</italic> values for the stereotypical image do not exceed the right-side boundary of 4.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287512451137">Margalef 1972</xref>). Research on other destination image datasets is needed to assess the range of typical values for destination image diversity indices, distribution pattern, and level of distinctiveness.</p>
<p>The conducted analyses brought up a host of questions related to potential usefulness and applicability of the proposed indicators to the real life situations. What values of diversity indices constitute “rich,” “moderately rich,” or “shallow” destination images? At what magnitudes do differences in index values indicate practically relevant distinctions in group images that would warrant a response and a marketing action from DMOs? What kind of image concentration is “desirable” from a DMO’s perspective and is there a boundary between a focused, concentrated image, which aids communications, and underdeveloped, without shades and nuances, but a highly concentrated destination image? Such complex questions support the argument that one image indicator is not enough; there should be a set of measures that describes destination image pool of a particular market or a segment of that market from various perspectives. Moreover, it is not yet clear how various aforementioned indicators interact with each other, and which ones are more sensitive in detecting image differences. Nor is it clear whether all of them paint the consistent picture of destination image held by various groups. The authors feel there was a fair degree of consistency among the methods, pointing toward the least experienced group, the Potential, having the least diversified image of the United States as a travel destination. Evidently, the proposed quantitative approach to destination image measurement needs further development. Ultimately, this line of research may lead to important benchmarks, or the optimal level/range of a destination image diversity and distribution, for DMOs to track and monitor.</p>
<p>To conclude, the study investigated a theoretical proposition first formulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512451137">Oppermann (1998)</xref> that travelers with different travel horizons’ level would exhibit different images of a particular destination. Methodologically, investigation introduced a new perspective to look at the image data by defining a notion of the destination image pool and assessing its diversity using richness, evenness, and dominance indices, as well as comparing shapes of the image distribution and its distinctiveness among different market segments. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to numerically describe the diversity and shape of destination images held by particular groups of travelers and, therefore, to objectively compare the image structure of various groups. From a practitioners’ angle, the study partially supports the proposition that less experienced Chinese travelers tend to have less rich, diversified, and distinctive destination images, while more experienced travelers are more likely to hold richer, diversified, or niche images of United States. The authors hope that with further development, the diversity indicators and distribution analyses of destination images will aid destination management organizations in their decision making regarding destination positioning, marketing, and promotion.</p>
