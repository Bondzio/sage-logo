<abstract>
<p>The concept of health literacy is evolving. The re-emergence of Freireian-inspired health literacy projects moves the conceptualisation of health literacy from merely the ability to apply functional literacy skills in a health-care context to a wider ability to exert control over the determinants of health. This article presents an example of a community-based project that adopts an empowerment education model in health literacy. Based within a small indigenous community in the Philippines, participants were engaged in critical reflection to gain a better understanding of how health is conceptualised within their socio-economic and political environment and its implications for practice, power relations and subjective experiences. The article concludes with the assertion that although developing health literacy skills is important, we must never lose sight of unbalanced power relations and unfair structures that hinder positive social change.</p>

<p>The concept of health literacy is evolving. Although it is widely recognised as the capacity to acquire, understand and use information to promote and maintain good health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105312470126">Institute of Medicine, 2004</xref>), the nature and scope of health literacy are widening and becoming more complex. Early definitions focussed on the ability to apply reading and numeracy skills in a health-care context (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312470126">Kirch et al., 1993</xref>) while later conceptualisations encompassed a range of skills, including social and communication skills (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312470126">Nutbeam, 1998</xref>). More recent definitions also include the ability to apply these skills in various settings and across the lifespan (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105312470126">Rootman and Gordon-El-Bihbety, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although health literacy is still a relatively new concept within health promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312470126">Nutbeam, 2000</xref>), literacy in general has long been recognised as a tool for empowerment. According to UNESCO’s <italic>Global Report on Education for All</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312470126">2006</xref>), literacy matters to health promotion because it can improve individual self-esteem and thereby influence personal autonomy over lifestyle choices. It can also empower individuals to participate in decision-making processes. Consequently, this can bring about system-wide benefits, such as improved efficiency and effectiveness by empowering individuals to take more personal responsibility for their health. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105312470126">Nutbeam (2009)</xref> explained
<disp-quote>
<p>the reason why we care so much about literacy is that even the most basic functional literacy skills enable people to better develop their knowledge and improve the potential to achieve personal goals, and through this to participate more fully in society, both economically and socially. (p. 303)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite these potential benefits, concerns have been raised regarding the limitations of educational and literacy programmes in promoting health. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105312470126">Schechter and Lynch (2011)</xref> argued that the level of commitment and lifestyle change required by some literacy programmes may be problematic for many mature learners, especially since traditional approaches to adult health education have little or no connection with the learners’ real-life circumstances and experiences. Critics have also warned about the potential dangers of placing too much emphasis on literacy as a health promotion strategy. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312470126">Mayuzumi (2004)</xref> argued that common discourses that support the positive link between literacy and improved health could be disempowering, since they could imply that people with low literacy skills are inferior and pose a burden on society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312470126">Mayuzumi (2004)</xref> questioned the value of literacy programmes and doubted whether these are directed towards meeting the needs of service users or whether these are being implemented simply to ease the burden off the health-care system. She also pointed out that current arguments that support the link between literacy and health tend to be Eurocentric and do not take into consideration the social and economic conditions in the Third World. She noted, for example, that some of the health issues that arise in Bangladesh do not necessarily stem from poor access to resources or knowledge, but rather from deeply rooted socio-economic, cultural and environmental problems which people, operating on an individual basis, may not easily overcome. While some researchers would consider illiteracy to be a major cause of poverty (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105312470126">Perrin, 1989</xref>), Mayuzumi contends that illiteracy is not the <italic>cause</italic> of poverty, but a <italic>reflection</italic> of social inequality [emphases added]. Thus, if illiteracy is a reflection of social issues rather than its cause, then literacy may not necessarily be the appropriate solution.</p>
<p>While these arguments are justifiable, they do present a rather narrow perception of what health literacy is all about. Indeed, as with literacy in general, health literacy can be categorised into three levels: functional, interactive and critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312470126">Nutbeam, 2000</xref>). <italic>Functional health literacy</italic> is only one of the three levels of health literacy that mainly focuses on reading and comprehension skills that are built upon traditional educational approaches. <italic>Interactive health literacy</italic> goes beyond developing basic functional skills: it seeks to improve personal skills to increase self-efficacy and motivation. Health psychologists interested in social cognition models have developed frameworks that explore the connections between health literacy and health outcomes through pathways such as health actions and motivations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105312470126">Von Wagner et al., 2009</xref>). Community-oriented health psychologists, on the other hand, have focussed on promoting health by strengthening community capabilities through social participation and dialogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312470126">Campbell and Murray, 2004</xref>) and by situating health promotion within its social, economic and political contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105312470126">Stephens, 2008</xref>). This is in line with the third level of health literacy, that is, <italic>critical health literacy</italic>, which caters for the development of social and community competencies. As such, health literacy is also conceptualised as an ‘asset’ rather than just a clinical ‘risk’ as it moves more towards the development of skills and capabilities to enable people to exert more control over the wider determinants of health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312470126">Chinn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105312470126">Nutbeam, 2008</xref>). This is in accordance with the Ottawa Charter’s definition of health promotion as, ‘the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359105312470126">World Health Organisation (WHO), 1986</xref>: 1) and one that follows a more empowerment education model in its approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105312470126">Porr et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The idea of incorporating community-based and empowerment-focussed strategies in health education has its roots within the philosophies of the Brazilian educator, Paulo Freire. In his book, <italic>The Pedagogy of the Oppressed</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105312470126">Freire (1972)</xref> critiqued the ‘banking’ concept of education where he argued how traditional approaches in education dehumanise students to become passive receivers of knowledge. In the same way, dominant members of society could impose a social reality that maintains unfair social hierarchies. It is possible for this version of reality to be accepted by disadvantaged communities by turning them into passive recipients. To promote social justice, Freire introduced the concept of <italic>conscientisation</italic> and argued the need for communities to reflect critically upon and to challenge the broader social structures that restrict them from developing their fullest potential. By engaging community members in dialogue and critical reflection, a collective understanding of their social conditions can be produced to inform and mobilise action.</p>
<p>For over three decades, community-based researchers and health educators have adapted Freire’s ideas into health education (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312470126">Roter et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1359105312470126">Wallerstein and Bernstein, 1988</xref>). Empowerment education has long been acknowledged as an effective health education model as it encourages learners to become active participants in the process. Rather than becoming passive recipients of information, learners are empowered by co-producing knowledge that is based on their social and cultural experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312470126">Airhihenbuwa, 1994</xref>). Within health psychology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312470126">Murray (2002)</xref> argued that health literacy programmes need to be situated within the broader movement of social justice in order to meaningfully contribute to the reduction of health inequities. In other words, health literacy action needs to become part of the process of raising critical consciousness within the community. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312470126">Campbell and Scott (2011)</xref> highlighted, social participation could therefore enhance and promote health by building communication networks that can provide ‘transformative social spaces’ that encourage people to engage in dialogue and to promote action.</p>
<p>Participation not only benefits the community by enabling them to redefine social realities through their own terms but also provides them with the opportunity to raise awareness and to increase social pressure concerning the need for change. This is particularly relevant in areas where extreme deprivation is common. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105312470126">Guareschi and Jovchelovitch (2004)</xref> note,
<disp-quote>
<p>In countries exposed to chronic social inequality … improving these conditions does not happen without pressure from below. Communities living in a situation of extreme deprivation need to organize themselves and develop the various competencies required for effective participation in the public sphere if they are to improve conditions of living and thus enhance health. Participation, empowerment and community development, therefore, become key strategies in reducing health inequalities and in incorporating the demands of the poor into health policy. (p. 312)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312470126">Campbell et al. (2010)</xref> demonstrated how community mobilisation can successfully achieve positive social change by enabling its members to develop their own ‘voices’ and by ensuring that the wider social environment is receptive to change. These authors highlighted that supportive material and symbolic and relational contexts need to be in place for such efforts to succeed. Without appropriate measures in place, it is unlikely that those in power will take the community’s demands seriously, thus undermining the efforts already taken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105312470126">Campbell and Cornish, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these premises, this article will present an example of a community-based health literacy project that used an empowerment education approach in health promotion. The example is drawn from a small indigenous community in the Philippines. Here, the community members were engaged in dialogue and critical reflection to gain a better understanding of how health was conceptualised within their socio-economic and political environment. Previous articles based on this case study focussed mainly on the processes and outcomes of the action research project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312470126">Estacio and Marks, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312470126">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312470126">2012</xref>) and on our critical reflections as facilitators of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312470126">Estacio, in press</xref>). Using a critical realist perspective, this article will explore some of the discourses used by the community to examine how they conceptualise health within their material, and symbolic and relational environment. In so doing, future health literacy interventions can be informed and developed in ways that recognise their culture, livelihood and way of life.</p>
<sec id="section1-1359105312470126">
<title>Context</title>
<p>The project was based within a small indigenous Ayta community in the Philippines. Also known as ‘Aetas’, ‘Agtas’, ‘Attas’, ‘Atis’ and ‘Itas’, the Aytas were the earliest inhabitants of the archipelago and have occupied the territory for approximately 30,000 years. Most Ayta tribes live within the mountainous areas of the country, although evidence suggests that they once lived in the lowlands during prehistoric times but have only gradually relocated when other migrants and colonisers occupied the land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105312470126">Shimizu, 1989</xref>). Aytas are traditionally nomadic who hunt wild animals and gather crops for daily sustenance. Their relative isolation from mainstream culture is probably one of the reasons why much of their traditions have been preserved. The Aytas have been living peacefully in their tribes, until one of the world’s worst volcanic eruptions of the 20th century struck them in June 1991.</p>
<p>After 500 years of inactivity, the major eruptions of Mount Pinatubo from 12 to 15 June 1991 caused widespread chaos and destruction across central Luzon, leading to around 200–300 deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359105312470126">Wolfe and Hoblitt, 1996</xref>) and displacing more than 10,000 families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312470126">Bautista, 1996</xref>), the majority of whom were Aytas. At that time, there was considerable local and international aid in support of the various communities affected by the eruption to help them to deal with its economic, psychological and social impact. More than two decades later, some Ayta communities are relocated permanently in government-supported resettlement areas while others have returned to the mountains to resume their lives. Unfortunately, the destruction of the ecosystem caused by the eruption impacted adversely on the Aytas’ traditional way of life. Since the eruption, Ayta communities have become increasingly exposed to social influences outside their tribes. Concerns have been raised regarding their vulnerability from cultural disintegration, as well as from economic and social exploitation owing to their lack of formal education.</p>

<sec id="section2-1359105312470126">
<title>Development of an alternative learning system</title>
<p>Under the 1987 Philippine Constitution, it is the government’s responsibility to protect and uphold its citizen’s right to quality education. Although public education is freely available to everyone, indigenous communities often have difficulties accessing these resources since the majority live in relatively remote and hard-to-reach areas. Indigenous children who live under economically deprived circumstances are also at risk of dropping out from mainstream education because of its ‘hidden costs’ (e.g. travel, daily allowance and cost of school supplies). Ayta children, in particular, are also at risk from ridicule from other students because of their distinctive appearance from the lowlanders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1359105312470126">1</xref></sup> Furthermore, Philippine education is greatly influenced by the United States educational system, which may not be culturally aligned with the Aytas’ indigenous traditions and way of life.</p>
<p>The protection of indigenous people’s cultural rights in relation to the design of literacy programmes was advocated in UNESCO’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312470126">2006</xref>) ‘four pillars to lifelong learning’. These were the right to self-identification, self-knowledge, self-development and self-determination. Indigenous communities have the right to learn in their own language, interpret their own history, develop learning systems that are compatible with their way of life and determine how they relate to the wider society. These principles are particularly relevant when designing health education and literacy programmes, since as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105312470126">Stephens et al. (2005)</xref> pointed out, health promotion targets among indigenous communities are often not reached because of their failure to recognise the difference between indigenous perspectives and western models of health. The importance of recognising how language and worldview form an integral part of indigenous peoples’ lives cannot be underestimated. These need to be integrated within proposed interventions to ensure their acceptability and appropriateness within these communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105312470126">Vass et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In consultation with the Ayta community, a local non-governmental organisation in the Philippines, called the Popular Education for People’s Empowerment (PEPE), took the initiative to develop an alternative learning system (ALS) with the Aytas to use sustainable education to strengthen individual and community capabilities. The proposed ALS aimed to adopt a community-driven framework wherein indigenous people’s rights to cultural integrity were respected. This means that while the ALS aimed to develop functional literacy skills, it also strove to preserve and celebrate indigenous knowledge, culture and tradition. The primary aim of the project described in this article was to engage the Ayta community in generating insights about their conceptualisation of health in order to inform the development of the ALS. The British charity, OXFAM, provided funding for PEPE to facilitate the process. PEPE also worked in collaboration with the Development Action for Grassroots Learning (DANGLE), the Department of Education and the local council. The author volunteered to facilitate some of the workshops as part of the community engagement process that developed over a 1-year period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1359105312470126" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Several activities were planned as part of this project to encourage community participation. The project adopted a participatory action research framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312470126">Brydon-Miller, 2004</xref>) that involved various stages to establish rapport and to generate knowledge to inform, implement and evaluate collective action. Grounded within the principles of <italic>Sikolohiyang Pilipino</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312470126">Enriquez, 1993</xref>), the methods of engagement employed in this project encouraged the exploration of Filipino values based on the Filipino cultural point of view. Although the Philippine population is not homogenous, Filipinos share common traits and values such as <italic>kapwa</italic> (i.e. shared and equal identity with others) and <italic>bayanihan</italic> (i.e. sense of togetherness in common effort). Research methods developed within the principles of <italic>Sikolohiyang Pilipino</italic> are not only culturally sensitive and appropriate but are also people oriented. With the notion of <italic>kapwa</italic> at its core, it recognises the importance of establishing good relationships with the community and treating each other fairly and equally in the research process. <italic>Sikolohiyang Pilipino</italic> also emphasises the need to make research methods adaptable and relevant to existing cultural norms and traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105312470126">Pe-Pua, 2006</xref>). Thus, community visits, <italic>kwentuhan</italic> (story-telling sessions), workshops and stakeholder meetings were facilitated as part of this project to generate knowledge with the community. Details on the methods of engagement used in this project are discussed more extensively elsewhere (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312470126">Estacio and Marks, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Notes from eight organisational meetings and seven community workshops were collated. The 13 <italic>kwentuhan</italic> sessions with 29 community members and 3 local volunteers were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Workshops for stages 1 and 3 were facilitated by the author (i.e. establishing rapport and data validation), stage 2 by trained local volunteers (i.e. data collection) and stages 4–6 by local government and community officials (i.e. action recommendation, planning and implementation). All of these events were run using local languages (i.e. Tagalog and Kapampangan). Quotes were only translated into English at write-up stage. Data were initially analysed thematically by the author and other project collaborators (i.e. PEPE, DANGLE and local government representatives). The preliminary findings were negotiated and discussed with community members during the stage 3 workshop where they were refined and used to inform action recommendations.</p>
<p>For the purposes of looking at the community’s conceptualisation of health, the author further analysed the data using a form discourse analysis that was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105312470126">Sims-Schouten et al. (2007)</xref>. This approach follows a critical realist perspective that views social reality as being shaped by both language and the material world. It combines both constructionist and realist positions and assumes that although meaning can be constructed through discourses, it can also be influenced by non-discursive elements. This approach lends itself well to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105312470126">Campbell and Cornish’s (2010)</xref> call to consider the material and symbolic and relational contexts within community development efforts. By analysing discursive (<italic>symbolic</italic>) representations using a critical realist position, researchers can situate their analyses within its extra-discursive elements, that is, material and relational environments.</p>
<p>To disentangle extra-discursive elements from the analysis, a preliminary literature and policy review were carried out to understand current legislation concerning indigenous people’s rights and the provision of public services to indigenous communities, including access to child and adult education and health-care services. Several activities were also organised to help researchers situate the extra-discursive elements within the local context. These activities included a series of community workshops designed to understand current trading and organisational and social arrangements. Using methods endorsed by <italic>Sikolohiyang Pilipino</italic>, the author also frequently visited the community (i.e. <italic>pagdalaw-dalaw</italic>) to casually observe (i.e. <italic>pagmamasid-masid</italic>) and to engage with the community’s daily activities (i.e. <italic>pakikisalamuha</italic>). It is vital that such extra-discursive elements are identified when adopting a critical realist position so that these can be taken into consideration when analysing participants’ discourses. For example, analysing a statement such as ‘there is nothing we can do about it’ from a purely discursive orientation can lead one to conclude that the participant draws upon a fatalistic discourse to justify apathy and lack of action. However, by adopting a critical realist approach, it is possible to assume that participants drew upon this discourse as a result of repeated failed attempts to mobilise action due to unjust social conditions in their environment. Thus, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105312470126">Sims-Schouten et al. (2007)</xref> highlighted, critical realism can provide a more ethical analysis of participants’ accounts by locating discourses within their material and social contexts and how these interact with each other.</p>

<title>Ayta concept of health</title>
<p>The Aytas have a holistic concept of health. Health was talked about as an overall sense of physical, mental and social well-being. Although this account is similar to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359105312470126">WHO (1946)</xref> definition, the Ayta concept of health also incorporates aspects overlooked by the WHO, which includes economic, psychosocial, environmental and spiritual attributes. For the Aytas, achieving health is a process whereby livelihood stability, good social relations, cleanliness and spiritual wellness are viewed as essential components of a good and decent way of living (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359105312470126">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The Ayta concept of health is deeply integrated within their socio-economic and political environment. The way health was talked about within this community was contextualised within matters concerning social discrimination, material deprivation and social injustice. As reflected in their accounts below, the Aytas described their lived experiences as revolving around their constant struggle for survival that continues to shape the way they conceptualise and experience health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359105312470126">
<title>‘Isang kahig, isang tuka’: the daily cycle of existence and survival</title>
<p>For the Aytas, day-to-day living is a constant struggle to find food on their plates. They likened it to how chickens repetitively scratch and peck the earth to find food scraps underneath the dirt. As they say, ‘isang kahig, isang tuka’. Literally translated, this phrase means one scratch, one peck. In the Philippines, this term is often used to describe the hand-to-mouth existence of those who live in severe material deprivation. Like chickens, people under extreme deprivation live ‘one scratch and one peck at a time’, that is, ‘scratching the earth’ to earn their wage and then ‘pecking the food’ to survive for the day. ‘Our life as kulots<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1359105312470126">2</xref></sup> just goes in repetitive cycles’, said an Ayta mother. This cycle consists of working to gain income; using this income to purchase food and then working again to repeat the process. As a result, work is considered top priority and is often regarded as more important than their general well-being. As one of the Ayta leaders said, ‘even with fever, I go to work. Of course! If you want to live, you have to work (r5:477-479)’. Everything else, as they say, is <italic>hatak</italic> (‘pulled’ r4:608) and <italic>banat</italic> (‘stretched’ r10:761) by work. They asserted that they are often <italic>obligado</italic> (‘obliged’ r4:219) to work despite the cost to their personal health.</p>
<p>Within these communities, the rising economic burden brought about by the growing size of the family is also becoming a major cause for concern (r3:288-91). Families with relatively large households are particularly vulnerable to income shortage. Despite their efforts to generate income, Aytas continue to describe their incomes as <italic>kapos</italic> (‘scarce’ r11:675-80) or <italic>kulang</italic> (‘insufficient’ r6:398; r10:287-99). Based on national statistics, although economic growth was observed in the country, indigenous regions appeared to have relatively lower levels of family income than the national average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312470126">ADB, 2002</xref>). Recent figures from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105312470126">United Nations Human Development Report (2011)</xref> also indicate that more than a quarter of the Filipino population is below the national poverty line. This level of material deprivation is reflected within this Ayta community. Our findings from the small household survey carried out as part of the action research project indicated how most families in this tribe subsisted on less than US$1/day.</p>

<title>Race for survival</title>
<p>There also seemed to be an overall sense of urgency to generate income to sustain their family’s basic needs. They expressed the need to utilise several <italic>mabilis</italic> (‘speedy’ r4:180) strategies to <italic>tapal</italic> (‘temporarily fill’ r4:180) hunger (r11:230). When one is <italic>nagmamadali</italic> (‘in a hurry’ r4:189), they try to gather resources quickly. As soon as they generate their income for the day, they find themselves <italic>tumatakbo</italic> (‘running’ r6:1266) to the store. ‘It is rare that money stays on your hands (r12:357)’. As they say, ‘if you don’t work for three days, huli ka na (you’ve already lagged behind the race), this means your pot will begin to dry up (r4:349)’. Quite often, they say that they find themselves <italic>napipilitan</italic> (‘forced’ r4:170) to engage in unfair trade arrangements because they are <italic>nagmamadali</italic> (‘in a hurry’ r4:170). In terms of discourse, survival is almost like a running game. If you want to live, you have to chase life. You have to be quick. You have to run, earn and spend quickly for your family’s survival. Fairness is no longer important. What is important is that money is generated quickly to pacify their most urgent basic needs.</p>
<p>For the Aytas, these circumstances can only be accepted as such. As they say, <italic>talagang makanyan</italic> (‘that’s just how it is’ r4:178; r12:797-805). For some reason, they have learned to accept these circumstances as given. The workshops facilitated to understand the trading structures in this community reflected how little control the Aytas had over trading arrangements. Trade occurs when buyers from the lowlands arrive in the community to purchase the Aytas’ products. The frequency of these trading visits depends on the level of demand from the consumers. Without access to capital and other resources, the Aytas are unable to sell proactively their products to the market. They are forced to wait passively for the traders to arrive at their doorstep. Prices are dictated by buyers, and Aytas often find themselves competing against each other in order to close the deal. Income was considered as an unstable object that cannot be controlled nor challenged by the ‘uneducated kulot’ (r3:698). Thus, feelings of powerlessness are prevalent within this community. As expressed by one of the leaders, ‘We are powerless. From the way I look at myself, we are the lowest in this earth. You’re asking why? Because we are illiterate. If people want to cheat us, they can. Because we are illiterate’. Clearly, their inability to read, write and count using mainstream methods has caused immense damage to their pride and identity as Aytas. ‘Because we curly-haired Aytas are illiterate, those straight-haired villagers are laughing at us’.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As the concept of health literacy continues to evolve from being a clinical ‘risk’ to a social ‘asset’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105312470126">Nutbeam, 2008</xref>), it is becoming increasingly more important to understand how health is being conceptualised by the communities we engage with, and how these conceptualisations are influenced by material and symbolic and relational contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105312470126">Campbell and Cornish, 2010</xref>). The emergence of what is being labelled as the ‘second wave’ of health literacy research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312470126">Chinn, 2011</xref>) that revisits Freireian-inspired ideologies that espouse empowerment in health education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105312470126">Nutbeam, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105312470126">Rudd, 2004</xref>) further highlights the point of how engagement and participation of community members can help future health literacy interventions to become more meaningful and relevant to those they aim to serve. In this article, a small indigenous Ayta community in the Philippines was engaged in dialogue and critical reflection to gain a better understanding of how health is being conceptualised and experienced within their socio-economic and political environment to inform the development of an ALS. As shown here, the Ayta concept of health adopts a holistic approach that is deeply influenced by their daily struggle for existence and survival. Work dominated their discourses, and the need to generate income was positioned as top priority to sustain their families’ everyday needs. Market forces were also constructed as powerful elements that are fixed and cannot be changed nor challenged by what they termed as the ‘uneducated kulot’. As such, life for the Aytas was constructed as a daily race for survival. Feelings of powerlessness and low self-worth were also said to plague this community which they attributed to their inability to read, write and count in the Western, mainstream fashion.</p>
<p>Based on these insights, it would be useful to consider how an ALS can be developed and be made more sensitive to some of the issues and potential barriers to the successful implementation of the programme. For example, considering that the need to generate income dominates the Aytas’ everyday living, it is important to recognise that attendance to formal literacy sessions may be problematic for mature learners as they need to prioritise meeting the most basic human needs of their families before they can engage in learning activities. As some of the Aytas commented, ‘how can you expect us to fill our brains when our stomachs are empty?’ Thus, the ALS needs to be flexible and should be tailored to make it directly relevant to generating income and producing resources to sustain basic needs. Within the context of this project, after careful consultation with the community and other stakeholders, the curriculum for the ALS was designed to include training on upland farming to integrate functional literacy within a sustainable livelihood programme. As such, the literacy programme can help its learners to develop literacy skills while at the same time provide them with an opportunity to harvest crops for basic everyday sustenance and additional family income.</p>
<p>Developing literacy skills however only scratches the surface of the problem. As reflected in this case study, dominant discourses that are potentially disempowering continue to persist in some communities. Within the Ayta community, for example, the discourse of ‘talagang makanyan’ or the passive acceptance of unjust social circumstances needs to be challenged and requires what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105312470126">Freire (1972)</xref> would call a social reawakening of this community. Thus, an ALS could then be designed to incorporate community workshops to foster critical reflection and the deconstruction of oppressive social discourses. This process however could potentially be more complex and subject to widespread objection as deep-seated social discourses may not be as easy to overcome.</p>
<p>Finally, although gaining new literacy skills could help the Aytas gain more confidence by defeating the notion of the <italic>uneducated kulot</italic>, it is equally important to consider the wider socio-economic and political context that could prevent them from developing their fullest human potential. As previously expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312470126">Estacio, in press</xref>), it is important to recognise the intricate links between culture, power and oppression and to understand its underlying historical, social and political context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312470126">Cruz and Sonn, 2011</xref>), especially in areas where histories can be contested such as those in indigenous communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105312470126">Smith, 1999</xref>). In the case of the Aytas, although positive social actions have been taken to promote its developmental agenda (e.g. construction of a community literacy centre, election of Ayta leaders, development of a multi-purpose co-operative programme and the development of ALS curriculum materials), progress was disrupted by violent forces that overturned the community’s efforts. Following the construction of the literacy centre, land grabbers attacked the community and burned some of the huts down. Some of the Aytas’ crops, almost ready for harvest, were also uprooted. Fortunately, no deaths resulted from this attack, but some members of the community were traumatised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312470126">Estacio and Marks, 2010</xref>). The planned evaluation of the ALS was also put on hold due to health and safety issues.</p>
<p>Advancing health equity is greatly influenced by matters of power, oppression and social injustice. Whether it is in terms of actual health outcomes or access to resources, health inequities are governed by socio-economic and political structures that influence people’s lives from micro to macro levels. The case presented here is not an isolated case of social injustice. The Aytas’ plight echoes the struggle of those marginalised and dispossessed individuals, communities and societies worldwide. The cycle of debt and deprivation that grips the Aytas’ struggle for existence and survival is fuelled by the same mechanisms of unequal distribution of power that continue to tyrannise the Third World. While greed from external forces violently disrupted the Aytas’ progress, the same greed for wealth and power remains to be the invisible force that directs this process on a global scale. Responsibility for health is preceded by control. Power is necessary to exercise control. Oppression restricts individuals to exercise control; just as oppression restricts governments to uphold sovereignty and limits their capacity to protect their citizens’ fundamental human rights. Although literacy can provide the means to empower individuals and communities to increase control over wider determinants of health, we must never lose sight of the unbalanced power relations and unfair structures that may hinder positive social change. Balancing both is a must.</p>
<p>In conclusion, health literacy and community empowerment are more than just reading, writing and counting. Literacy programmes that aim to promote health by developing community capabilities need to consider how health is being conceptualised by the local community to ensure its cultural and social appropriateness. Gaining an understanding of how health and literacy are influenced by their social, political and economic contexts allowed the development of the ALS to become more sensitive to potential barriers and opportunities that could influence the community’s engagement in the process. As far as this project is concerned, the Ayta community and their supporters can be proud of the small, yet significant steps they have taken to pursue their right to quality education. It is only a matter of time when their efforts, coupled with wider social advocacy and political support, will ensure that macroeconomic and political infrastructures are in place to sustain health literacy for generations to come.</p>
