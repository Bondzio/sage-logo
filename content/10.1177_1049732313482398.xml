<abstract>
<p>The existing knowledge of women’s experiences of living with Parkinson’s disease and fatigue is limited. To gain first-hand knowledge, we interviewed 11 women using a phenomenological hermeneutic interpretation. The results indicate that the familiar daily routines of women with Parkinson’s disease had changed in the sense that their bodily attachment to the world had been altered. The body no longer provided smooth access to the surrounding world; rather, the body served as a barrier to daily living. In practice, understanding this barrier can be significant in recognizing how to create positive conditions that support the women’s experiences and how to formulate their care in congruence with their needs.</p>

<body>
<p>People who live with long-term illness often have their daily lives disrupted and altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732313482398">Bury, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732313482398">Charmaz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732313482398">Hurd Clarke &amp; Griffin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313482398">Morse, 1997</xref>). Day-to-day living, which was once taken for granted, changes, and a loss of wholeness can become a person’s primary experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732313482398">Toombs, 1993</xref>). The bodily disruption is obvious to the ill person, and the consequence is that the body can no longer be ignored. The body is often perceived as out of the person’s control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732313482398">Carrel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313482398">Öhman, Söderberg, &amp; Lundman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732313482398">Olsson, Lexell, &amp; Söderberg, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732313482398">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732313482398">Rosenbek Minet, Lonvig, Henriksen, &amp; Wagner, 2011</xref>; Toombs). For people who live with bodily disruption, a sense of uncertainty and difficulty in understanding the body’s response to illness becomes a constant companion to everyday life (Carrel).</p>
<p>Women with long-term illness have described it as an intrusion, meaning that their lives will never be the same. In some studies this disturbance has been shown to affect self-perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732313482398">Kralik, Brown, &amp; Koch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732313482398">O’Neill &amp; Morrow, 2001</xref>). A common experience is the sense of feeling damaged when faced with changes in everyday life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732313482398">Carrel (2008)</xref> described the experience of being ill as living in a new reality. This commonly raises questions that cannot be answered with the current medical knowledge.</p>
<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive, neurodegenerative disease that strongly affects the daily life of those affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732313482398">Taylor, Ehrhardt, Trzcinski, Kille, &amp; Mount, 2003</xref>). The four main symptoms are tremors, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732313482398">Albin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732313482398">Backer, 2006</xref>). In addition to these cardinal features of PD, various nonmotor symptoms are present, such as autonomic dysfunction, cognitive changes, and sleep disturbances. PD usually begins between 40 and 50 years of age, but it can occur both earlier or later in life. The cause and pathogenesis of PD is unclear, but genetic and environmental factors have been discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732313482398">Samii, Nutt, &amp; Ransom, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732313482398">Haahr, Kirkevold, Hall, and Ostergaard (2010)</xref> showed that when living with PD, unpredictability was a primary experience among affected persons. They also determined that daily life was restrained because of the body, which was described as setting the agenda. Habitual routines of daily life present challenges for people living with PD. Because of unfamiliar sensations in the body, people are forced to structure their daily lives to struggle against uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732313482398">Bramley &amp; Eatough, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732313482398">Sunvisson &amp; Ekman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732313482398">Sunvisson, Habermann, Weiss, &amp; Benner, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>People with PD often face a variety of losses in regard to body image and sense of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732313482398">Abudi, Bar-Tal, Ziv, &amp; Fish, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732313482398">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732313482398">Todd, Simpson, &amp; Murray, 2010</xref>). The effect of bodily limitations among people with PD is described as strongly unique to each person affected, which de facto most commonly results in a variety of experiences. In relation to the unique character of bodily experiences, people with PD describe the absence of having their needs met as primarily connected to insufficient communication when meeting health care personnel (Taylor et al.). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732313482398">Thorne (1999)</xref>, the experience of not being understood or met in accordance with one’s needs is strongly related to a disregard of people’s individual experiences of being ill, a fact which has a negative impact on the ambition to provide relevant and useful care. In contrast, people who live with PD have described a renewed sense of capability when meeting health care personnel who did provide security and did not cause feelings of stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732313482398">Sunvisson &amp; Ekman, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Middle-aged women with PD described the major changes in their daily lives as a result of their illness. In general, their main concerns related to womanhood, and more specifically to body image and the ability to live up to contemporary images of being a good mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732313482398">Fleming, Tolson, &amp; Schartau, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732313482398">Schartau, 2003</xref>). Fatigue is also common among people living with PD; 42% of people affected have described this as one of the worst symptoms of the illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313482398">Friedman &amp; Friedman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732313482398">Karlsen, Larsen, Tandberg, &amp; Maeland, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732313482398">Krupp &amp; Pollina, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313482398">Karlsen, Larsen, Tandberg, and Jorgensen (1999)</xref> showed that among people with PD, fatigue was correlated with depression, although people who did not experience depression reported a high prevalence of fatigue. Therefore, fatigue can be seen as an independent symptom and not causally related to depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732313482398">Herolfson &amp; Larsen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313482398">Karlsen, Larsen, Tandberg, &amp; Jorgensen</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313482398">Friedman and Friedman (2001)</xref>, fatigue interferes with daily life among people with PD, and when it occurs, it seems to develop early and to persist. The burden of living with PD was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732313482398">Herolfson and Larsen (2003)</xref> as substantially increased by the experience of fatigue, and this also seems to be an important factor in increased distress among people with PD. Still, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732313482398">Karlsen, Larsen, Tandberg, and Maeland (1999)</xref> stated that little attention has been paid to the subjective sensation of fatigue. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732313482398">Shulman, Taback, Rabinstein, and Weiner (2002)</xref> indicated that health care personnel failed to identify the presence of fatigue among persons with PD more than half of the time during routine office visits.</p>
<p>Fatigue is a complex symptom, and it can be found in a variety of long-term illnesses such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732313482398">Krishnasamy, 2000</xref>), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732313482398">Ream &amp; Richardson, 1997</xref>), HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732313482398">Rose, Pugh, Lears, &amp; Gordon, 1998</xref>), hepatitis C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732313482398">Glacken, Coates, Kernohan, &amp; Hegarty, 2003</xref>), fibromyalgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732313482398">Söderberg, Lundman, &amp; Norberg, 2002</xref>), and multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732313482398">Olsson et al., 2005</xref>). Fatigue has been defined as an overwhelming and exhausting sense of tiredness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732313482398">Krupp &amp; Pollina, 1996</xref>), and according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732313482398">Piper (1993)</xref>, it can be considered an abnormal experience that has negative effects on bodily function as well as daily life. Studies have shown that women often define fatigue as a changed experience of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732313482398">Olsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732313482398">Söderberg et al., 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732313482398">Kralik, Telford, Price, and Koch (2005)</xref> stated that the voices of women living with fatigue are minimal in the literature, and the invisible character of fatigue is a most important issue in establishing a mutual understanding in health care encounters in which the needs of women living with long-term illnesses can be met.</p>
<p>In summary, the literature review shows a lack of knowledge concerning meanings of women’s experiences of fatigue when living with PD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732313482398">Taylor et al. (2003)</xref> showed that people with PD express fatigue as difficult to be met in accordance with their comprehensive needs, and that they considered this to be strongly connected with the high variability in experiences that is common when living with this illness. Because fatigue is a subjective symptom that does not show on the outside, there is a risk of neglecting the needs of people who are faced with PD-related fatigue.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732313482398">Abudi et al. (1997)</xref> highlighted that the discrepancy between health care personnel’s perceptions of the suffering of people with PD and patients’ self-reports can lead to a stereotyping of patients. They furthermore stressed that the needs of people with PD can only be met if caregivers respond appropriately to the individual patient. The goal of this study was to gain knowledge about how women with PD experience fatigue in their everyday lives, and our aim was to add a first-person dimension to the body of existing knowledge. Thus, the purpose of this article is to elucidate meanings of fatigue for women with PD.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-1049732313482398">
<title>Participants and Procedures</title>
<p>Eleven women diagnosed with PD participated in the study. The criteria for participation were that they were adult women diagnosed with PD, and that their daily lives were influenced by the illness and fatigue. The median age was 59 years (range 45 to 64), and they had experienced symptoms for a median number of approximately 7 years (range 2 to 18); the median time elapsed since diagnosis was 4 years (range 1 to 13). Seven women were married, 3 were cohabiting, and 1 was widowed. Six women were receiving a disability pension, 1 a state pension, 3 were working part time, and 1 was working full time. The women’s participation was arranged through a hospital in northern Sweden. At the hospital, a registered nurse contacted the women, informed them of the study, and invited them to participate. A letter was sent to the women to provide further information and obtain informed consent. This letter included information about the study, and a reply form was included. After they agreed to further contact, the first author telephoned each woman to arrange for an interview.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732313482398">
<title>Interviews</title>
<p>Individual audiotaped interviews were conducted using a narrative approach (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732313482398">Mishler, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732313482398">Sandelowski, 1991</xref>). Nine women preferred to be interviewed in their own homes and 2 preferred a quiet room at the university. The women were asked to discuss their experiences with fatigue and describe its effect on their daily lives. When needed, questions were asked to clarify their experiences. The interviews lasted between 40 and 60 minutes and were transcribed verbatim. Data collection was performed during 2010 and 2011.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732313482398">
<title>Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>All of the women gave their informed consent both verbally and in writing. The participants were guaranteed confidentiality and an anonymous presentation of the findings. According to Swedish law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732313482398">Swedish Health Care Act, 2003</xref>, p. 460), an ethical review was not necessary, but informed consent was obtained and confidentiality assured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732313482398">World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732313482398">
<title>The Phenomenological–Hermeneutic Interpretation</title>
<p>Phenomenology and hermeneutics can be viewed as prerequisites to one another, and since both approaches focus on meanings, they correspond. Phenomenology can be understood as explaining and making lived experiences explicit, whereas hermeneutics is more of a text-oriented interpretation (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732313482398">Ricoeur, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732313482398">1998</xref>). Given that our aim was to describe meanings of fatigue for women with PD, a phenomenological–hermeneutic interpretation was chosen for analysis of the transcribed interviews (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313482398">Lindseth &amp; Norberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732313482398">Ricoeur, 1976</xref>). In using this method, attempts were made to explain and, from this perspective, understand the meanings of the phenomenon through the interpretation of narratives. To gain an understanding, a constant movement between the text as a whole and its parts is a necessity. This method implies an interpretation as a certain form of understanding when applied to life expressions as a text. Through this interpretation, a deeper understanding of a phenomenon can be gained from a dialectic movement between understanding and explanation, with the aim of reaching a new comprehensive awareness.</p>
<p>The phenomenological–hermeneutic interpretation in this study consisted of three interrelated phases. The first phase began with an interpretation of a naïve reading of the text to gain a sense of its whole. The naïve understanding provided ideas for the next phase, the structural analysis. The aim of the structural analysis was to identify and explain parts and patterns in the text and validate or invalidate the naïve understanding. In the structural analysis the text was divided into meaning units. The units of meaning were then condensed into formulated equivalents. These formulated units of meaning were grouped together by similarities and differences in meaning. Based on these similarities and differences, the formulated units of meaning were then abstracted into six subthemes and two themes with the aim of explaining the text (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313482398">Lindseth &amp; Norberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732313482398">Ricoeur, 1976</xref>). We compared the themes and subthemes with the naïve understanding for the purpose of validation. Developed from and supported by the naïve reading, the structural analysis, our preunderstanding, and the literature, the text was interpreted in its totality, resulting in a new comprehensive understanding (cf. Lindseth &amp; Norberg; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732313482398">Ricoeur, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>The chosen literature of interpretation was aimed at revising, widening, and deepening our understanding of the text. When the literature was chosen, we did not force its perspective onto the interview text, but rather allowed the selected literature to illuminate the interview text, and the interview text to illuminate the chosen literature (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313482398">Lindseth &amp; Norberg, 2004</xref>). The interpretation was conducted in as open-minded a manner as possible, with an awareness of our preunderstandings as nurses and researchers in this area.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section7-1049732313482398">
<title>Naïve Understanding</title>
<p>Experiencing fatigue seemed to indicate that the women’s whole existence was affected. Their bodies were filled with unfamiliar sensations, feelings of inertia, and heaviness. The experience seemed to be comprised of contradictory feelings, such that the fatigue had taken over and served as a hindrance to daily living. Simultaneously it appeared as if the women strove to resist the fatigue and sought a means of alleviation. The fatigue always seemed to be present, although it varied in intensity. The sudden intensification of fatigue implied that it was inescapable, and resting did not always give relief. The women expressed that others had difficulty in understanding their condition, and that the feeling of fatigue was difficult to describe. The fatigue seems to have had an effect on the women’s relationships, and they described feeling isolated and not having the drive to socialize with others. They described feeling changed, and it was difficult for them to maintain their typical lives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732313482398">
<title>The Body as a Burden</title>
<p>The structural analysis resulted in two themes and six subthemes. The themes and subthemes are presented in the text below and illustrated with quotations from the interviews. The first theme, the body as a burden, was constructed from three subthemes: feeling paralyzed, having the will but lacking energy, and needing to rest and save energy.</p>
<sec id="section9-1049732313482398">
<title>Feeling paralyzed</title>
<p>Women with PD described fatigue as a whole-body experience. They described the body as embedded in a feeling of inertia and feeling “gluey,” and moreover, as if they were unable to move. They said it felt like being in a vacuum and like they had a lid on them. Their bodies felt weak and they felt feeble. They described having no power in their arms, and they could not manage to hold their bodies up straight. It was difficult to keep their shoulders up straight and their legs felt as if they were folding beneath them. The women described their bodies as shaking on the inside; there was a strange feeling of a horrible inner anxiety that brought forward a feeling of splitting into pieces and exploding internally. Their bodies felt unpredictable, and the women described fatigue, internal tremors, and dizziness as intertwined bodily sensations. They said that their bodies never felt rested or at peace:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s like weighing one hundred kilos; my feet are stuck in the floor. It’s discomforting. All the time you have to overcome something, overcome. I can stand in the shower and cry, because it’s hard to get undressed and get the right temperature and grip the shampoo, and I know that when I’m done, I’m too tired to get my clothes back on.</p>
<p>I feel it under my skin. You can shake on the inside, and it’s totally inside the body. It’s worse than shaking on the outside. It’s that feeling of uneasiness in the body; it’s like inside the membranes of my stomach.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732313482398">
<title>Having the will but lacking energy</title>
<p>Women with PD described longing for a day of energy and longing for a body with drive and spirit. They said they wanted to feel independent and did not want to ask others for help. Because of the lack of strength, ordinary, everyday life was difficult to manage, and daily tasks such as household chores, taking a shower, or engaging with children and grandchildren were consuming. The women described being on “low battery” and that nothing was fun anymore. They could not find strength to spend time with friends, and they felt frustrated when their energy was insufficient. There was a feeling of living in accordance with the fatigue, and the women felt disappointment when they were not able to follow through with everyday life as before. The women described feeling changed, and feeling unsuccessful when they could not be the person they had once been:
<disp-quote>
<p>You get really frustrated. You feel that you can’t manage, because you want to feel independent. You want to do things by yourself, to do what you want, not being forced to ask someone else to do things for you. Instead you want to feel that you can manage.</p>
<p>I can’t make a promise if someone calls me and asks if I would like to join them. I can try, but I can never tell, because I don’t know how I will feel by that time. It’s a very structured life, and quite lonely too.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732313482398">
<title>Needing to rest and save energy</title>
<p>Women with PD explained that they had to rest and sleep to manage during the day. Because their bodies felt as if they were screaming for rest, they needed to sleep a considerable amount during a 24-hour period. Their sleep varied, and it could give relief, but there were also feelings of fatigue that did not disappear after resting or even sleeping. Still, they needed to rest to endure and try to renew. The women described that they had lost much of their spontaneity when being forced to plan and structure their everyday life to manage and save their strength. They said that the family could see their fatigue and reminded them of their need to slow down. They could see this in others who shared their experience of fatigue, and this provided them with a sense of understanding:
<disp-quote>
<p>It [fatigue] is always there. If I lie down, I will fall asleep within less than a minute. It’s like a shallow unpleasant sleep that doesn’t really give me energy. It’s like closing a box.</p>
<p>I’m always prepared with medicine in several handbags. I have my medication and water several hours in advance, so that while I’m still managing, I will place it on my bedroom table, and I go to bed while I still can move.</p>

<title>Striving to Get Used to an Unfamiliar Body</title>
<p>The second theme, striving to get used to an unfamiliar body, was constructed from three subthemes: an unusual feeling of variability, a feeling of being absent minded, and feeling the necessity of becoming familiar.</p>
<sec id="section13-1049732313482398">
<title>An unusual feeling of variability</title>
<p>The women with PD described an always-present fatigue that differed from the tiredness they had felt when they were healthy. They said they did not feel rested after a whole night’s sleep, and that they never felt as spirited as before, because sleeping did not rid them of their fatigue. The fatigue appeared suddenly and led to the feeling that there was nothing left to do other than to lie down and sleep. The women said it was embarrassing to fall asleep among others and while out in public. They described that the feeling of fatigue varied in intensity during the day, and it was a feeling of nuances, with a light and also a ponderous feeling. The fatigue was said to be difficult to describe in terms that could be understood by others who did not share their experience: “But the tiredness is there all the time. Even if you have slept a whole night, you don’t wake up feeling rested; you can still feel tired.” “There’s no power. That extra power that you used to have is gone, and that’s a huge difference from before, when you could get yourself together and manage that little extra.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732313482398">
<title>A feeling of being absent minded</title>
<p>Women with PD said that the fatigue felt as if they were on low heat. Thoughts were slow, and they described not being able to think clearly or find the words when trying to express a thought. There were feelings of being distracted and not being able to organize thoughts. It was frustrating not to be able to remember things and to plan ahead. The women described themselves as being more sensitive to stressful situations. Stress increased the fatigue, and made their brains feel “jammed.” They experienced feelings of brain arrest, when they could not choose between two options. They felt strained and stressed by having people around them and by conversing with others: “It’s the tiredness; it’s the memory. You can’t get your thoughts together; you can’t plan. You get frustrated. It’s like becoming demented. It’s like, I can’t find the right words.” “It’s hard to manage several impressions at the same time. I lose the ability to sort things out, and when it’s noisy and lots [there are] of people, and when there is movement, then it gets black.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049732313482398">
<title>Feeling the necessity of becoming familiar</title>
<p>Women with PD described that they felt as if they had to become accustomed to the fatigue. Getting used to the fatigue and accepting things as they were consumed the women’s self-confidence. The women tried to resist and struggled against it by striving to endure and keep awake. Some days felt better than others, and on those days difficulties were easier to manage. The women expressed enjoying the days when they had strength to follow through. Taking care of the joyful things of everyday life, trying to have fun, and maintaining interests were said to be ways to adapt to the fatigue:
<disp-quote>
<p>You get used to it somehow, or you adjust yourself to the situation if you say, “It’s frustrating, hard, and affects your self-esteem.”</p>
<p>I am an incurable optimist. I really am. In fact, even if I have cried at times, I still believe that all this will straighten up. I know that I won’t be cured. Intellectually I can understand that, but it feels like I will manage this. It’s going to be okay.</p>

<title>Comprehensive Understanding and Reflections</title>
<p>In this article, we suggest that meanings of fatigue for women with PD can be understood as if the familiar daily life has changed, in the sense that their bodily attachment to the world has been altered. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732313482398">Merleau-Ponty (1996)</xref>, people experience the surrounding world via the body. Being human does not imply having or possessing a body; instead, the body is our anchor, which provides us with access to and gives us the means to understand and communicate with our surrounding world. Thus, being human is about understanding and interpreting the world through the body. In daily living, attention is not primarily focused on our bodies. Instead, our attention is directed toward the world; the body is, so to speak, forgotten, enabling us to engage in the world without any further thought or reflection of how we pursue our activities.</p>
<p>For women with PD, the body no longer gives a smooth access to the surrounding world, as with a healthy body. Instead, the body serves as a barrier to daily living (i.e., “the body as a burden” and “striving to get used to an unfamiliar body”). When exploring the way the body is experienced by people who are ill, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732313482398">Toombs (1993)</xref> showed that illness disrupts and likewise challenges a person’s ways of being in the world unreflectively. Therefore, illness strikes the ability to engage in the surrounding world in a habitual way. For women with PD, the body is interpreted as a burden, which serves as a hindrance, and it cannot be taken for granted. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732313482398">Haahr et al. (2010)</xref> showed that people living with PD were preoccupied with one major concern: their unpredictable body.</p>
<p>In this study the feeling of being paralyzed was a hindrance, impairing the pursuits of daily living, and with the attention pointed toward the environment. For women with PD, there was a feeling of inertia, with unfamiliar bodily sensations that were distracting when going about their daily lives. From this it can be understood that the body was most visible in their routine living. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732313482398">Leder (1990)</xref>, the illness accentuates the body and the outward focus of the person who is ill changes, so that all projects have to be reorganized to handle the ill body.</p>
<p>Women with PD expressed that their bodies felt unpredictable. They described feeling insecure in never knowing when the fatigue would emerge or in not knowing in which nuance it would appear. This could be understood in relation to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732313482398">Toombs (1993)</xref>, who described how the primary experience of illness contains a loss of wholeness. For the ill person, the unpredictable body changes from being controllable to having a will of its own. The lack of control threatens bodily integrity, and for the ill person, feelings of uncertainty arise. These feelings force the person to surrender the assumption of personal indestructibility. For women with PD, their experience of personal integrity is challenged by the unpredictable body, a challenge that implies a form of suffering. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732313482398">Eriksson (1997)</xref> described that suffering related to illness involves a decline in bodily functions, and according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732313482398">Charmaz (1999)</xref>, the loss of bodily control creates suffering for the ill person. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732313482398">Frankl (1993)</xref> described how people who are faced with an inescapable situation such as PD experience suffering. The suffering from being ill is primarily connected to an uncertainty that is characterized by being boundless in terms of the person’s ability to see an end.</p>
<p>In this study, there seemed to be a feeling of absent mindedness among the women with PD. The women described that their thoughts felt slow, and that they did not feel perceptive. This could be understood as if fatigue altered their focus of attention and hindered them from being fully rooted in their surroundings and performing at the same pace. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732313482398">Younger (1995)</xref>, feeling disconnected from oneself and the world brings forth a form of suffering related to estrangement. This estrangement means being in a disadvantageous position, wherein it feels impossible to influence and shape daily living in a feeling of connectedness.</p>
<p>The women interviewed in this study longed for a day of energy and for a body with drive and spirit. They had a will but lacked the energy to follow through with ordinary daily tasks. This finding is similar to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732313482398">Söderberg et al. (2002)</xref>, who showed that fatigue for women with fibromyalgia implied a limited everyday life in the sense that it was difficult to be spontaneous. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732313482398">Olsson et al. (2005)</xref> found that for women with multiple sclerosis, the experience of fatigue was a major frustration because they could not carry out the most common daily tasks. In the current study, women with PD, despite feeling frustrated by having to live in accordance with their fatigue, still hoped for relief. This could be understood in relation to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732313482398">Leder (1990)</xref>, who described how the experience of being ill calls for action to remove the unpleasant symptoms. This means that all projects imply striving and hoping for alleviation.</p>
<p>We found that women in this study strove to get used to a body that felt unfamiliar. They described how fatigue struck without forewarning and forced them to forsake their day-to-day projects. Still, they described days of success. This could be interpreted as if the women, despite being disconnected, did experience a sense of belonging to their surroundings. This sense of belonging could be understood in relation to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732313482398">Merleau-Ponty (1996)</xref>, who described how nothing completely determines a person from the outside. Despite the obstacles encountered, one is always free in how he or she chooses to take on the hurdles of life. Human living is thereby characterized by the possibility of carrying out the projects of life despite outer barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732313482398">Dahlberg, Todres, &amp; Galvin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732313482398">Frankl, 1993</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section17-1049732313482398">
<title>Limitations and Strengths</title>
<p>The findings presented in this article are transferable to similar situations. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313482398">Lindseth and Norberg (2004)</xref>, the transformation of findings is possible when the reader can integrate the interpretation into his or her world. Our choice of this phenomenological–hermeneutic interpretation derives from its relevance for elucidating the meanings of people’s experiences. During the interviews, the women expressed their lived experiences freely, and they indicated that they understood the meaning of the questioned areas. The interviews were rich, had depth, and gave sufficient variations of the women’s experiences (cf. Lindseth &amp; Norberg).</p>
<p>The interpretation we present in this article is the one we found to be the most unconstrained and dilated. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732313482398">Ricoeur (1976)</xref>, a text can always be interpreted in more than one way. An optimal interpretation is not contradicted by data; instead the optimal interpretation has internal consistency as it widens and deepens the understanding of a phenomenon. We considered and compared possible interpretations (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313482398">Lindseth &amp; Norberg, 2004</xref>) in critical discussions with peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732313482398">Ricoeur, 1976</xref>). The findings established one way to understand the meaning of fatigue among women with PD. When conducting the study, we paid attention to our preunderstandings and tried to keep them in check (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732313482398">Dahlberg, Dahlberg, &amp; Nyström, 2008</xref>) through critical peer discussions concerning our evolving understanding of the phenomenon (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732313482398">Ricoeur, 1976</xref>) and by the use of probing questions. This made it possible for us to bridle our presupposed approach to the world in favor of not making definite what is indefinite, and instead questioning our judgments of a certainty we had considered general (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732313482398">Dahlberg et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, this study shows that fatigue for women with PD can be understood as if the body no longer provides smooth access to their surrounding world, as it did when they were healthy. Fatigue for women with PD means living with a body that serves as a barrier to daily living. Lived experiences are always difficult to communicate to others on the basis of a shared understanding. The character of fatigue and what it means in daily living for women with PD lacks similarities with ordinary tiredness experienced when healthy. This fact might serve as an obstacle when formulating care based on the women’s lived needs. Therefore, it is important for health care personnel to question their assumptions concerning fatigue and also to avoid relating the women’s experiences of fatigue to their own experiences of tiredness. When becoming aware of the different perspectives of a single experience, it is possible to base the care on a shared understanding, which will strengthen the women’s sense of being confirmed and understood.</p>
