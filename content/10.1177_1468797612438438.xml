<p>This article examines the expanding global tourist trade for fictional places derived from popular narratives that are recreated for the tourist’s pleasure. Through a case study of a Harry Potter tour in the United Kingdom, I explore how the design of fantasy-themed ventures encourage a re-imagining of the landscape where (f)actual and imaginary geographies exist side by side. The locations function as affective, liminal spaces where the tourist anticipates and partakes in the transformation of sights/sites. Narrative and spatial engagement are crucial in producing a sense of embodied experience and an enchanted, and enchanting, reality where the realms of possibility are expanded.</p>

<p>Have you ever dreamed of going to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, or maybe of walking over the green hills of The Shire? If so, you need to go on a MAGICAL TOUR. There is simply no better way to experience enchanted Britain. Go with us and fall under the spell … (Have Magic, Will Travel; Magical Tours business card)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Cultural texts such as literature, music and movies have long been an inspired source for travel. Louisa May Alcott’s <italic>Little Women</italic> is a major impetus for sojourns in Concord, Massachusetts; Frank Sinatra’s ‘New York, New York’ provides the nostalgic trigger for perennial travels to the island city of Manhattan; and Jean Pierre-Jeunet’s <italic>Amélie</italic> (<italic>Le fabuleux destin d’Amélie Poulain</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468797612438438">2001</xref>) functions as an iconographical palette beckoning one towards quixotic Paris.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468797612438438">1</xref></sup> Orchard House, Times Square and Montmarte exist as destinations that can be physically travelled to and explored. By visiting locations featured in and associated with popular texts, the tourist is able to concretize a narrative and, in many cases, render tangible the past and place. Inhabiting a space and being in the presence of relics and artefacts is akin to giving (historical) immediacy to an experience. Helene Hanff captures this rapture when she writes, ‘I went through a door Shakespeare once went through, and into a pub he knew. We sat at a table … and I leaned my head back, against a wall Shakespeare’s head once touched, and it was indescribable’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468797612438438">Lowenthal, 2006 [1985]</xref>: 246). This sentiment is echoed in Liedeke Plate’s study of Virginia Woolf literary tours whereby the experience of place allows the tourist to re-establish links with the past (London as experienced or represented by Woolf) and to turn facts and details of fictional narratives into experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468797612438438">2006</xref>: 103, 108). These examples indicate the importance of the embodied experience of space and affective sensibility of touristic practices.</p>
<p>But what of places that are not real but fantastical constructions that belong to the realm of secondary worlds (possible non-actual worlds), such as Narnia and Pandora?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468797612438438">2</xref></sup> There is a burgeoning global tourist trade for places that do not exist except in popular culture and imagination, from J.R.R. Tolkien’s Hobbiton (filmed in Matamata, Aotearoa/New Zealand) to Luke Skywalker’s troglodyte home on Tatooine (filmed in Matmata, Tunisia). While the motives for, and satisfaction in, experiencing the Peak District in Regency England would appear apparent to most, a visit to Diagon Alley or Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry would not. The latter would more likely be regarded as escapism lacking the cultural status accorded to heritage tourism. However, this type of tourism has very real implications for the image, management and marketing of cities and sites that impact the economy and cultural identity of communities. New Zealand’s rebranding as Middle-earth and renaming of a famous mountain peak in China’s Hunan province because it inspired the floating mountains in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468797612438438"><italic>Avatar</italic> (2009)</xref> are but two examples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468797612438438">Beeton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468797612438438"><italic>Jing Daily</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This study is concerned with a form of tourism whereby imaginary, invented places, as represented in various media, are recreated for tourists with strong fan affiliations to a text. I am particularly interested in how fantasy-based tours are designed to appeal to visitors, as well as the tourist’s experience of locations. If tourism entails the suspension or inversion of everyday obligations to seek out and experience what is perceived as the extraordinary, ‘the extraordinary’ can be literally out of this world in this form of tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468797612438438">Urry, 1990</xref>: 10). Through a case study of a Harry Potter tour, I argue that the design of such ventures equalize the importance of the (f)actual and imaginary geographies to create affective, liminal spaces where the tourist anticipates and partakes in the transformation of sights/sites.</p>

<title>All aboard the Hogwarts Express: Harry Potter tourism</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Just as [<italic>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</italic>] is a tale of discovery, we hope that people will want to come to Britain to discover its magic. (Seren Welch, campaign manager for the British Tourist Authority, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468797612438438">BBC News, 2001</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Harry Potter tourism is demonstrative of a form of cultural tourism where people visit locations induced by literature, film and television. Harry Potter ventures include day-trips via buses or specialized taxi services, multi-day expeditions ranging from large ‘big bus’ cohorts to small travelling parties, and walking tours that are professionally organized or self-guided explorations using itineraries and maps freely sourced from the internet and tourism publications. A vast majority of the sites revolve around shooting locations which have rendered J.K. Rowling’s fictional wizarding world into feasible travel destinations: Glencoe <italic>transforms into</italic> the Forbidden Forest, a stairwell in Oxford’s Christ Church <italic>is</italic> the imposing staircase leading into the Great Hall of Hogwarts, and a steam-train ride over the Glenfinnan viaduct in Scotland <italic>becomes</italic> a journey aboard the Hogwarts Express. As Nick Couldry writes, such locations produce an aura ‘of the place and the process <italic>of filming itself</italic> … that can only be grasped by going there’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468797612438438">2005</xref>: 68). At many sites, Harry Potter associations are openly promoted. The significant relationship between media and tourism was exemplified when the British Tourist Authority (BTA) published an official Harry Potter map featuring prominent shooting locations to coincide with the theatrical release of <italic>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1468797612438438">2001</xref> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468797612438438">Busby and Klug, 2001</xref>). The locations provide a site where fictional places become actualized and tangible; reconceptualizing the landscape so that our experience is one of space and (popular) narrative.</p>
<p>In studying Harry Potter tourism, terminology poses certain challenges and warrants clarification. Although filming locations remain the dominant draw card for the tours, they cannot be classified strictly as ‘cinematic tourism’ or ‘film-induced tourism’ because they do not take into account the multi-dimensionality of a cultural phenomenon, such as its literary aspect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468797612438438">Reijnders, 2011</xref>: 233). Harry Potter tours are symptomatic of a postmodern culture where, as Linda Hutcheon rightly states, ‘[a]daptations have run amok’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468797612438438">2006</xref>: xi). The tours are but one adaptation of the literary and filmic texts; the films adaptations of the books; the books adaptations of previous narratives of a similar genre and style, and so forth. In other words, a vast web of texts inform the Harry Potter phenomenon. For the present purposes, ‘Harry Potter tourism’ may be the most useful descriptor. While all places and histories are culturally constructed, terms such as ‘fictional’, ‘(f)actual’, ‘real’ and ‘imaginary’ (among others) are evoked in this study to loosely distinguish between narratives that describe actual historical events, places and personages, and those that do not. This paper examines the manner in which Harry Potter tours encourage (temporary) reality-suspension and considers how tourists navigate between their knowledge, expectations, fantasies and firsthand experiences of tourist locales. I do not wish to imply that participants at any point completely lost awareness that they were tourists. However, the sense of play that was evident amongst members indicated that they had allowed themselves to imagine possibilities of fantastical, imaginary geographies (or to use Doreen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468797612438438">Maitre’s [1983]</xref> term, ‘possible non-actual worlds’).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Fieldwork was conducted during June and July in 2009 on a nine-day Spells and Charms Tour offered by the American-based company Magical Tours. Specializing in customized escorted ventures, the group has been operating Harry Potter tours since 2005. Catering for parties of no more than 20, the Spells and Charms Tour (hereby referred to as SCT) offers its members an intimate travel experience through a United Kingdom steeped in folklore, myth and history that is predominantly, though not exclusively, related to the Harry Potter narrative. For instance, references were also made to the works and lives of J.R.R. Tolkien, Lewis Carroll, C.S. Lewis and Jane Austen. According to tour operator Larry Ivy, this venture is differentiated from other Harry Potter tours because of its limited group sizes, duration, emphasis upon creating an immersive experience via atmosphere, and references to a wider spectrum of paratexts. Paratexts refer to ‘the space in between … all those objects and signs that mediate the relationships between text and reader’ which can include DVD featurettes, franchised toys and board games, and articles related to film production and the personal lives of the cast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468797612438438">Cartmell and Whelehan, 2010</xref>: 19). SCT functioned as a spin-off of the Harry Potter series while also producing its own paratextual materials.</p>
<p>Two methods were employed during the field study: conducting interviews and questionnaires, and participatory observation. The semi-structured interviews were carried out on site with the tour organizer and proprietors. They were implemented to gain information about the impact of Harry Potter tourism on local communities and economy, the design of fantasy-themed tourism and tourists’ motivations for visiting various locations. Questionnaires were distributed to tour members who either completed them before the end of the tour or sent their responses back via email. The questionnaires surveyed the general demographics of the group and level of fan activity (via numerical ratings), while a series of ten open questions gauged such things as participants’ reasons for joining SCT, notable experiences on the tour and the types of fan communities they belonged to.</p>
<p>Participatory observation and engagement was employed to deduce how tourists engage with their environments and how these locales function as affective, liminal spaces. This was necessary because of the restricted sample size and, more importantly, the <italic>embodied</italic> experience Harry Potter tourists seek. Scholars working in related fields, such as Nick Couldry (Coronation Street tourism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468797612438438">2005</xref>), Robert Peaslee (The Lord of the Rings tourism, 2011) and Stijn Reijnders (Dracula tourism, 2011), have documented the importance of the physicality of places to anchor the imagination. It logically follows that to understand an immersive Harry Potter tour is to experience it. The method of participatory observation and engagement was similar to that employed by Mike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468797612438438">Crang (1996)</xref> who embedded himself in two re-enactment societies – one recreating the British Civil War and the other Tudor domestic life – to understand heritage tourism as a type of living history. Crang dressed in costume, stayed in the same living quarters as society members and performed daily duties representative of the lifestyles of the different eras. Similarly, I embedded myself as a participant on the tour and partook in all activities, such as dressing in costume for special events and role-playing. From the outset, all parties involved were informed of my role as investigator and the objectives of the project. However, I attempted to maintain a relatively low-key profile as researcher to avoid disrupting participants’ experiences on the tour. Although this approach raises issues concerning objectivity and critical distance, participation and immersion are key to understanding the Harry Potter touristic experience. The anticipated benefits were regarded as outweighing the shortcomings. I have adopted Crang’s premise that ‘one cannot separate the practices of interpretation, research or pleasure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468797612438438">1996</xref>: 417). For instance, unrecorded conversations within informal situations provided an important source of information and insight. Both the first- and third-person speaking voice will be used in this paper, although the overlaps between myself as participant and investigator make the categories of ‘I’ and ‘them’ shifting markers on a continuum rather than hermetic categories. While I have endeavoured to provide an accurate account of the tour proceedings, any inexactitudes and errors are my own.</p>

<sec id="section3-1468797612438438">
<title>Tour demographic and design</title>
<p>There were eight participants and four staff members on the tour. Aside from the bus driver who was the only local from Bath and the author who was from Western Australia, the contingency was from the United States of America (Texas, North Carolina, Ohio, Illinois and California). Although advertised as ‘a family-friendly tour for ages 6 and up’, there was only one minor (11 years old) who was accompanied by his parents. Larry Ivy indicated that this was not anomalous; citing the largest demographic as being between 19 to 27 years of age who had ‘grown up with the characters at the same time that the characters [were] growing up’ in the books. These demographics show that tourism ventures with strong fantasy elements are not strictly aimed at, nor attractive only to, children. In several cases, the tour was a family affair. Jill said: ‘We’ve attended the book parties, dressed up for Halloween and read the books aloud together as a family with my theatrical husband doing all the voices. We also listen to the books on tape on car trips.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1468797612438438">3</xref></sup> These forms of themed tourism are essentially fan-based and offer participants the opportunity to openly share their fannish interests with others of like mind. Vicky wanted to ‘go to these places with people who were also really into Harry’, and not feel ‘self-conscious of “geeking out” on HP, [it] felt “normal” to be immersed in the HP world for a while’. Most of the tour members were also fans of the broader fantasy genre. While they rated themselves as fans of the Harry Potter novels rather than the movies (via the questionnaire and during conversations comparing the literary and film texts), most expressed that the main attraction of the tour was visiting shooting locations. Stephen stated: ‘I really wanted to see the spectacular locations depicted in the films for myself … And I got to see exactly where scenes were shot and what those places really look like.’ Samuel’s motivation was to ‘see what they saw and be where they were’ (‘they’ in this instance may refer to the actors as well as the fictional characters).</p>
<p>Participants had varying levels of investment in the Harry Potter phenomenon, ranging from those who enjoyed reading the novels to those actively involved in fandom communities. One member, for instance, hosts a Harry Potter fan website, has attended several Harry Potter conventions, midnight book releases and wizard rock parties, and has organized Harry Potter trivia parties. Throughout the tour, many participants were eager to provide details about the books and films during discussions as a way of demonstrating their knowledge and level of commitment to Harry Potter as a cultural text. Several individuals also signalled their dedication by wearing clothing that identified them as fans: sweaters, scarves and ties in the colours of the various Hogwarts school factions, and franchised t-shirts bearing logos such as ‘Muggle’ and ‘Dumbledore’s Army’.</p>
<p>Tour operators and proprietors devised situations to augment ‘the magical realism of a dramatic space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468797612438438">Crang, 1996</xref>: 429). According to Ivy, activities were ‘designed to make you feel like you’ve been to Hogwarts’. They included costumed characters appearing unannounced at locations, themed banquets, opportunities to role-play scenes from the narrative (such as running through the world’s largest hedge maze, travelling along the same steam-train route used for filming scenes of the Hogwarts Express and participating in a Sorting Hat Ceremony) and strategic use of mood music. The careful staging of events contributed to an atmosphere of the fantastical and other-worldly, and reiterated the importance of narrative and spatial engagement to the tourist experience (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468797612438438">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468797612438438">2</xref>). The ‘magical realism of a dramatic space’ was exemplified at Alnwick. After informing the group that public transport was woefully unreliable, Ivy handed his wand to the youngest group member and joked that magic would be useful in conjuring transportation. Upon the child’s waving the wand, a double-decker ‘Knight Bus’ – complete with Hogwarts banner and shrunken head in the windscreen – trundled around the corner to the amazement and amusement of the group. In that instant, the impossible had been rendered possible; the imaginary had become actualized. These elaborate schemes were integral in creating multi-sensorial, material and interactive events.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Harry Potter tourism discussed in this paper differs markedly from the experience offered by The Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park at Universal Orlando, Florida. Even though the latter also offers a multi-sensorial and interactive experience, it represents what Umberto Eco describes to be a ‘furious hyperreality’ where authenticity is visual rather than historical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468797612438438">1986 [1967]</xref>: 7, 16). The tourist can drink pumpkin juice in Three Broomsticks tavern, buy Bertie Bott’s Every-Flavour Beans from Honeyduke’s sweetshop, and see owls resting in the rafters (in the Owl Post) as the characters in the narrative do. Familiar places such as Zonko’s joke shop and Ollivander’s wand shop can be literally ‘entered into’. In this instance, ‘[e]verything looks real, and therefore it is real; in any case the fact that it seems real is real, and the thing is real even if, like Alice in Wonderland, it never existed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468797612438438">Eco, 1986 [1967]</xref>: 16). However, theme park goers know that the experience relies upon aesthetic verisimilitude of the re-creation. Authenticity of this displaced experience is based upon the success of replication; on a perfect, condensed simulation with its economy of clearly identifiable signs (settings, props and characters) that circulate within a self-referential sphere.</p>
<p>Harry Potter tourism operates on a different plane. While tourists too seek identifiable markers, the range of acceptable signs extends beyond the diegesis of the narrative and there is greater latitude for discrepancies between details of the original text (in this case, a film or novel) and the actual experience at the tourist locale.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1468797612438438">4</xref></sup> The perceived split between the actual world and representations of a fictional one is narrowed by the fact that the locations are historically authentic, if we are to continue using Eco’s terminology. For example, the dining hall of Christ Church in the University of Oxford (from which the Great Hall of Hogwarts was modelled) continues to be a fully functioning mess hall for staff and students for one of the world’s most famed educational institutions. The significance of the sites are compounded by the pre-existing historical weight and cultural context of the places themselves. The imaginary geography adds further layers to the existing landscape. This layering of landscape plays a key role in the construction of a multi-dimensional, embodied experience on SCT, as can be seen by the emphasis placed on Rowling’s backstory, and events and places that inspired (even speculatively) the books. As Ivy stated:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We pursue the backstory: where did this come from? Where did the idea come from? What experience did J.K. Rowling have in her life even as far back as her elementary school days that would have influenced her to come up with this fantastic story and be able to put it down so convincingly? I think part of the reason she is convincing and believable is that many of the things did come from her own life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1468797612438438">5</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants are not only invited to walk in the footsteps of Rowling’s renowned wizard, but also in those of the author herself. For example, in Edinburgh, Ivy draws attention to the library where Rowling conducted research for the books before leading the group to The Elephant House tea and coffee shop. The choice is not arbitrary as the establishment touts itself as the ‘Birthplace of Harry Potter’ because Rowling wrote parts of her early novels in the back room overlooking Edinburgh Castle, reputedly the inspiration for Hogwarts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468797612438438">The Elephant House, 2008–2012</xref>). In the same room that Rowling sat, the group is encouraged to see the same view that the author looked out on and re-vision the image before them; rendering the ‘ordinary’ space of the coffee shop into something extraordinary. This constituted an important aspect of the tour. Brittany wrote: ‘I was interested in being able to see real places that inspired J.K. Rowling in developing the story line, characters, and places described.’ Similarly, Jennifer commented that she wanted to gain a ‘sense of “familiarity” that is more than just knowing the story and details of the books. Having that sense of place.’ The responses reiterate how spatial navigation of a site allows the tourist to feel a greater connection and ‘familiarity’ with a text.</p>
<p>While the tour is focused on Harry Potter, local histories unrelated to the books and films contribute to the tourist’s experience of an enchanting/enchanted United Kingdom. In discussing the fantasy genre (which the Harry Potter narrative falls within), Judith Saltman argues that ‘[m]ysticism, religious faith, and the human longing for something that cannot be expressed or defined are recurring motifs in fantasy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468797612438438">1985</xref>: 811). This same principle can also be applied to the structuring of SCT, which worked to expand the realms of plausibility of its members. One of the most overt cases of this was the sojourn in Glastonbury where the group stayed in a ‘haunted hotel’ (The George and Pilgrim, which bears a likeness to the Leaky Cauldron described in the novels) and were taken to the Abbey and on a twilight tour of Glastonbury Tor. With no direct association to Harry Potter as a filming location or inspiration for Rowling, this town was functionary purely because of its old-world, medieval charm and its rich folklore. Narratives about King Arthur, Guinevere and the Holy Grail, the Faerie King, witches and wizards, and the Holy Thorn Tree that many believe to have originated from the staff of Joseph of Arimathea (on the grounds of Glastonbury Abbey) were told to tour participants by the guide with the purpose of capitalizing on the mysticism, marvel and magic (literal and symbolic) of these historic locations. It exemplifies the ways in which ‘secondary and primary worlds exist side by side, frequently overlapping with one another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468797612438438">Nel, 2005</xref>: 251).</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Entering the quaint town centre, the anticipation of arrival is intensified by the captivating orchestral score that has begun playing over the mini-bus’ sound system and Larry Ivy’s prompt: ‘Welcome to the most magical place in England.’ The location is Lacock in Wiltshire. A National Trust village dating back to the 13th century, Lacock has become a principal shooting location for period films and television series including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1468797612438438"><italic>Pride and Prejudice</italic> (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468797612438438"><italic>Cranford</italic> (2007–2009)</xref>. In recent years it has also attained, for Harry Potter enthusiasts at least, the title of Godric’s Hollow because one of the cottages doubled as the Potter family’s home in several of the films. In addition, nearby Lacock Abbey was extensively used for interior scenes depicting Hogwarts, not only for the first film but also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468797612438438"><italic>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</italic> (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1468797612438438"><italic>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</italic> (2007)</xref>. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468797612438438"><italic>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</italic> (2009)</xref>, the village was again used to film the exterior of Professor Horace Slughorn’s house.</p>
<p>During an interview with David McDowell, the proprietor and artisan of Lacock Pottery Bed and Breakfast which is adjacent to ‘the Potter house’, he explained that tourists ‘can nearly fantasise that they are really at Harry Potter’s house. It’s not a set. It’s a real house.’ When asked what it felt like to live next door to the Potter home, McDowell jestfully replied:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’m sure he’d ask me: what’s it feel like living next door to my home? The real potter. ‘Cause I am a potter. There you are. Maybe he feels that he’d like to be a potter too. He’s a fictional Potter. I am the real potter.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While McDowell distinguishes the ‘real’ from ‘fictional’, slippage between these two concepts is apparent when he describes the town of Lacock itself as ‘one of these little bits of England which is so real but it’s not real. I mean, it is real. You know the buildings are old, but most people don’t live in these sorts of [medieval] environments.’ These categories become destabilized when negotiating those in-between spaces where physical geography and representations meet. This is actually capitalized on in the Spells and Charms Tour. Ivy explained:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As the tours go along, our tour participants begin to understand it’s not so far from what’s really here in England and Scotland. It’s not just a totally made-up world. There is, as there is in the book, the cross-over between the real world – the Muggle world – and the magical world in a modern setting.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fantastical elements are woven <italic>into</italic> existing heritage to create an enriched tapestry where history and fiction have, to borrow from the cliché, been brought to real/reel life. In this cross-over, myth is ‘suddenly put into close contact with the present and shown to be real’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468797612438438">Hiley, 2004</xref>: 845). On the tour, mysticism, folklore and legend are purposely granted a comparable status to official histories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1468797612438438">7</xref></sup> The equal commitment to history and mythology was overtly pursued at filming locations. For example, a children’s map produced by Gloucester Cathedral details parts of the cathedral featured heavily in the first two films; embedding Harry Potter trivia into the (hi)story of the building. Biblical narratives and the cathedral’s own stories of malefactors, maniacs, monsters and murders overlap with the fantastical nature of the wizarding world to create a ‘mysterious, magnificent, mind-boggling world of magic, monks and mayhem … Gloucester Cathedral cloisters were once Hogwarts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468797612438438">Gloucester Cathedral, 2007</xref>). Like Hogwarts, Gloucester Cathedral becomes a place of peculiarities, mystery and secrets. In another example, Alnwick Castle’s information pamphlet proudly declares: ‘From Harry Hotspur to Harry Potter, Alnwick Castle offers history on a grand scale’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468797612438438">Alnwick Castle, n.d.</xref>). Henry Percy, the eldest son of the first Earl Percy, earned the nickname ‘Harry Hotspur’ because of his legendary courage, speed in battle and quick temper, and was later immortalized in William Shakespeare’s <italic>Henry IV: Part 1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468797612438438">Alnwick Castle, 2011</xref>). The codes and conventions of the ‘hero’s quest’ are employed to draw comparisons between the two Harrys that work to level fictional stories and historical accounts <italic>as narrative</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1468797612438438">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The shared narratological discourse is emphasized in Harry Potter tourism, and follows the basic premise that the wizarding world does not exist in a completely separate, alternate universe but is hidden from view of Muggles (non-magical persons) – they co-exist. As Philip Nel observes, ‘Rowling’s frequent juxtaposition of ordinary and extraordinary creates a fantasy that has a deliberately everyday quality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468797612438438">2005</xref>: 251). The narrative, and the tours to an even greater extent, activate a borrowed language that aims to modify our sense of what could be conceived as within the realm of believability. In this context, the ‘everyday quality’ pertains to that which could be thought as possible. To create these spaces of transformation (possibilities), Harry Potter tours depend upon a complex interplay and negotiation of paratexts. Chris Rojek refers to the latter as indices of representation that are crucial to the social construction of tourist sites; the tourist constantly references textual, visual and symbolic representations of the original entity such as television programmes, films and travel brochures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468797612438438">1997</xref>: 53). The tourist engages in a process of dragging whereby elements from separate files of representations combine to create new value for a sight/site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468797612438438">Rojek, 1997</xref>: 54). For example, during an interview with Margaret Vaughn who operates King John’s Hunting Lodge guest house and Tudor Tearooms in Lacock, it was apparent that her anecdotes of encounters with principal cast members from the Harry Potter films and autographed pictures displayed in the dining area became important indices informing the tourist’s understanding of the place. Vaughn noted:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I get the most extraordinary people of all ages coming to say, you know, ‘Was Harry Potter here?’ … I love the enthusiasm of the children. Little Samuel, who stayed with us last night, do you know he’s overwhelmed by the fact that I’ve got signed photographs of them and this kind of thing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The lodge, village and Harry Potter phenomenon become (further) steeped in real/reel history. At any one site, a tourist may not only see what is physically before them but also insert into the landscape elements of a fictional narrative and historical accounts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468797612438438">Figure 3</xref>). This dragging effect does not write over a space (replacing one image with another), but alters its <italic>meaningfulness</italic> to the tourist where the mundane may attain a symbolic meaning. Touristic practices, such as mental simulations whereby one takes on a character’s persona and simulates that character’s feelings and experiences from a story, are ways of intensifying the relationship between tourist and (con)text. This illustrates how the tourist ‘enters the hermeneutic circle in order to re-experience and reconstruct the filmic signs or objects in the real world’, finding pleasure stepping into the narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468797612438438">Roesch, 2009</xref>: 144, 130). At film locations on SCT, participants not only re-enacted scenes from various Harry Potter films (a public act), but also engaged in private acts of quiet reflection. It was not uncommon for members to break away from the others to gaze on a site that was valued as an ‘access point to something meaningful’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468797612438438">Peaslee, 2011</xref>: 50). One participant said she ‘felt contemplative’ when visiting locations used to depict fictional places. Some participants also used portable listening devices to heighten the mood. Vicky stated: ‘I brought an MP3 player loaded with all of the Harry Potter movie soundtracks to date, as well as lots of Wizard Rock (Wrock) albums.’ She added that she sometimes listened to music en route to a site: ‘That really got me psyched for the location (especially Steale [sic] Falls in Scotland).’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1468797612438438">9</xref></sup></p>

<p>The desire for the transformation of sites/sights was expressed by several tour members. For some, this entailed a playful transformation of self where participants could identify not simply with a character but also as a character: ‘I think Gloucester Cathedral was the most beautiful and most immersive place we visited. It really, really felt like being in the halls of Hogwarts’ (Stephen); ‘I felt a bit like a kid. Pretending we were on our way to flying lessons or potions class. I also loved hearing the real history of these fascinating places’ (Donna). The level of immersion, however, differed for individuals. Not all participants were equally willing to suspend reality as can be seen from Jennifer’s response: ‘While I’m a fan and really enjoy the books and movies, I also know it’s fiction. My interest was mostly in seeing the transformations of real places to fictional.’ Nevertheless, all actively sought to re-vision the landscape and see beyond the physical geography. What is of course being described here is the tourist site as an affective, liminal space with transformative potential.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1468797612438438">10</xref></sup> These spaces of play facilitate the tourist’s fervent anticipation and participation in the metamorphoses of sights/sites. This process involves the tourist’s restless movement, a continual drift from one sight/site to the next, that is ‘more important as a priority of tourism than arriving’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468797612438438">Rojek, 1997</xref>: 71). This restless movement can be attributable to the multiplicity of paratexts the tourist must negotiate in constructing a sense of place and narrative. The tourist’s performative dragging of meanings from various representational files causes ‘each site to resonate with a compounded spatial complexity’ where historical information, participants’ own recollections of representations and the immediate experience of a location come together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468797612438438">Torchin, 2002</xref>: 248). This renegotiation between spaces of actuality and virtuality remap the terrain to produce multiple landscapes. For example, Lacock can simultaneously exist as a heritage site, Meryton (from the BBC production of <italic>Pride and Prejudice</italic>), Godric’s Hollow and Hogwarts. Frissons between the diverse cartographies that can be pulled up to read a space necessitate the restless movement. The ‘performed discrepancies’ between what is and what is not (possible) provide the tourist with their destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468797612438438">Torchin, 2002</xref>: 250).</p>
<p>Spatial disjunctures between the actual and virtual create spaces of potentiality. These liminal spaces may be thought of as interstructural situations that signify transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468797612438438">Turner, 1967</xref>: 93). New information folds into, and inevitably affects, an individual’s existing body of knowledge, experience, expectation and imagination. The tourist site, by its very definition as an extraordinary place, ‘spontaneously invites speculation, reverie, mind-voyaging and a variety of other acts of imagination … myth and fantasy play an unusually large role in the social construction of <italic>all</italic> travel and tourist sites’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468797612438438">Rojek, 1997</xref>: 52, 53). As a composite construct, tourist locales are perpetually in a state of becoming and co-creation where ‘each concept carries out a new cutting-out, takes on new contours, and must be reactivated or recut’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468797612438438">Deleuze and Guattari, 1994</xref>: 18). If we can think of a location as having a loose script (disparate details provided by tour guides, books, films and so on), the tourist is like the film-maker who must select angles and perspectives to frame and imagine it, thereby adapting and changing it through the very act of interpretation. Out of this interpretation/adaptation, something new is created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468797612438438">Hutcheon, 2006</xref>: 20).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1468797612438438">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>For the Harry Potter tourist, their excessive investment does not just describe emotions evoked at a location but more importantly the affective qualities of tourist sites. Affect produces mattering maps that direct our investments and absorption in the world around us; they ‘construct the places and events which are, or can become, significant to us’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468797612438438">Grossberg, 1992</xref>: 59, 57). The tourist travels to destinations to achieve a sense of ‘hereness’ that is derived from an embodied experience in real time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468797612438438">Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, 1998</xref>: 7). This fulfils a ‘search for intimacy’ that augments the tourist’s identity as a fan who has gone beyond the (screen) surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468797612438438">Harrison, 2001</xref>: 162). This is captured by Donna’s comment that seeing the film locations ‘put the film/book in a more complete frame of reference’. However, I would argue that the tourist’s desire is not a knowingness that ‘completes’ the experience, but a knowingness that each additional piece of information expands the realm of possibility. It opens up a text further rather than closing it off. As fans, Harry Potter tourists are not content with just the books and films – the continued demand for special features on DVDs, board games, tours and so on are symptomatic of this. If the fantasy genre creates an ‘expansion of reality, to intensify the realization of experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468797612438438">Saltman, 1985</xref>: 812), we could assert that travelling to a Harry Potter associated site provides the tourist with more details and paratexts in which to create narratives and play with (even more) possibilities: ‘If <italic>I</italic> were at Hogwarts … ’. There is the acknowledgement that the story of Harry Potter goes on with each new version or adaptation. The goal is not to reach ‘the end’.</p>
<p>Tour participants liberally applied ‘magic’ and ‘magical’ as descriptions throughout the tour. Jill stated: ‘The best part of the movies for me is the incredible, magical scenery’, and reiterated several times that actual landscapes depicting fictional places were ‘magical’ destinations. In relation to film locations, Stephen remarked: ‘In some ways it felt a bit like stepping into the movie yourself but many of the places were great all on their own (castle ruins). Places we visited that were not in the movies had their own magic.’ Donna wrote that her favourite part of the tour was ‘the day at Dalhousie. Why? Because the entire day was just magical!’ Brittany commented:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I had hoped to be transported into my own imagination, and I was. Visiting the film sites placed me ‘inside’ Hogwarts, the Dark Forest, and the little town of Godric’s Hollow. It was amazing to be in the ‘real world’ but be able to look around and feel as if in a fictional world.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The language evoked by tour members – ‘magical’, ‘incredible’, ‘fascinating’, ‘amazing’ – attempts to verbalize what is difficult, possibly impossible, to fully articulate because it is beyond representation. To illustrate, I refer to the Sorting Hat Ceremony (unlisted on the itinerary) that took place on the tour. Each member was called up to take a seat in front of the others, and the Sorting Hat – a replica of the one seen in the films – was placed on their head by the Head Wizard (the tour guide in costume) to be sorted into one of the four Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytherin). The Sorting Hat ‘spoke’ about the individual’s traits before calling out the house name. This was followed by much laughter and applause and presentation of the appropriate house scarf or tie. While the literary and film texts may have provided a script for participants to correctly re-enact the ritual, the event itself was of genuine surprise to the group members. It was clear from their facial expressions that they were anxious and excited about the personalized description and verdict of the Sorting Hat. I found myself silently repeating the well-known line ‘Not Slytherin, not Slytherin’, just as Harry does in <italic>The Philosopher’s Stone</italic>. The familiarity of this ‘scene’, however, could not account for the physiological changes – tightened muscles, an elevated pulse, a nervous shiver. When Gryffindor was called, the relief and ecstasy was overwhelming. It resonated with an observation made by Robert Peaslee in his own study of the Hobbiton film location in Matamata: ‘It was a very real space of activity for many of those who experienced it – it claimed a “ritual force” – and yet it was not “real” at all’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468797612438438">2011</xref>: 40). Ariel Ducey’s concept of affect (referencing the work of Brian Massumi) is useful here in unpacking what was happening during the Sorting Hat Ceremony:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>there are two levels at play in any event: that of intensity, a state of suspense, of potential disruption; and that of semantics and semiotics, of language, narrative, and expectations. These two levels resonate with one another; their vibrations are sometimes dissonant and at other times harmonious. Affect is ‘their point of emergence’ and ‘their vanishing point’ … It is the source of the unexpected, of the unmotivated, of surprise. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468797612438438">Ducey, 2007</xref>: 191–92)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although all were aware that the ceremony was part of the tour – that we had not entered the wizarding world through some magic portal – there was an undeniable change that occurred in that space and time. This transformation takes place between pre-cognitive intensity and awareness; a point where our expectations of the real and experience of the imaginary/imagined merge (and vanish). Each place becomes a discursive system of representations where fact becomes as incredible as fiction, and fiction as compelling as reality. This produces an excess of unexpected meanings and readings.</p>
<p>Harry Potter tourism is not so much concerned with flights of fantasy as with spaces betwixt and between that are simultaneously real and unreal, constructing an enchanted and enchanting reality/present. This ‘real virtuality’ is multiplicitous (not duplicitous) and negates the compulsion for perfect synchronicity between the imagined, the represented and the actual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468797612438438">Doel and Clarke, 1999</xref>: 267). As Marcus Doel and David Clarke write:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The parallelism of the two series [the real and virtual] no longer maintains their separation through relations of mimesis, analogy, and resemblance. Since the parallel series crisscross, interlace, and become indiscernible, each deterritorialises the other in a mutual becoming or aparallel evolution. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468797612438438">Doel and Clarke, 1999</xref>: 270)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Take, for example, King’s Cross Station in London in the Harry Potter narrative. This place exists in actuality. Platform 9¾, of course, does not. Situated between Platforms 9 and 10, Platform 9¾ is, as Harry’s Uncle Vernon describes, ‘somewhere in the middle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468797612438438">Rowling, 1997</xref>: 69). Inaccessible to Muggles, it is a hidden gateway to the co-existing wizarding world. After the success of the first film and a deluge of fans in search of this site, the city of London erected a cast-iron sign reading ‘Platform 9¾’ on the arched wall between Platforms 4 and 5, and below it part of a luggage trolley was installed to simulate it vanishing into the wall. However, this installation is geographically inaccurate. Rowling explains the mistake:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I wrote Platform 9¾ when I was living in Manchester, and I wrongly visualised the platforms, and I was actually thinking of Euston. So anyone who’s actually been to the real Platforms 9 and 10 in King’s Cross will realise they don’t bear a great resemblance to the Platforms 9 and 10 as described in the book. (Rowling quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468797612438438"><italic>Harry Potter and Me</italic>, 2001</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nevertheless, this simulation replicating the representation of Platform 9¾ from the movies has become an iconic attraction. During my own observations at this site, over a period of approximately 20 minutes there was a steady traffic of people who had come to King’s Cross Station specifically to find Platform 9¾ and pose with the trolley. Platform 9¾ is exemplary of an affective, liminal space. It is literally neither here nor there, yet this does not devalue its meaningfulness and value to visitors. In fact, for many the ‘fictional 9¾ platform at King’s Cross has become a reality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468797612438438">Joliveau, 2009</xref>: 37). In this case, the tourist travels to experience reel history in the making (or the <italic>reel</italic> in the <italic>real</italic>), deriving pleasure and purpose from re-imagining spaces that cannot be contained by the descriptions of authors, tour guides, historians and film-makers alone. Rewarded for their investment, the tourist as fan looks beyond the physical aspects of a place and knows what is (potentially) in-between the tangible and imagined. As Mitsuhiro Yoshimoto claims, ‘in the new global space, the dichotomy of the real and the imaginary plays a far less important role than that of the plausible and the implausible or the actual and the virtual’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468797612438438">1996</xref>: 111–12). On Harry Potter tours, the tourist is temporarily granted entry into a world unbeknownst to ordinary Muggle folk … but always aware that beyond that there are further possibilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1468797612438438">
<title>Coda: Not ‘the end’</title>
<p>Promotional material for the final film instalment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468797612438438"><italic>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2</italic> (2011)</xref> declared: ‘It all ends July 15.’ While millions of fans around the world celebrated and heralded the end of an era and the hero’s completed rite of passage, the Harry Potter phenomenon is far from over. Part of this is because ‘Harry Potter’ is now firmly ensconced within a multi-media(ted) sphere composed of ever-expanding paratexts (tourism being just one of them) that will guarantee its longevity. The ability to walk in the footsteps of Potter (and his friends) or J.K. Rowling, to physically re-live and re-enact a moment in the narrative and its production, is but one failsafe against being forgotten and buried in the popular culture archives. Tourism involving imaginary places has the powerful ability to rework cultural identity in the national and international imagination and transform landscapes. While the wizarding world of Harry Potter is still unequivocally a familiar, nostalgic England of ‘tradition, history, antiquity, and formalities’, the parameters of what is considered lore is expanded to include legend, mythology and the fantastical that has facilitated a re-imagining of Harry Potter’s United Kingdom as an enchanted/enchanting one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468797612438438">Iwashita, 2006</xref>: 69). As with the reader of fiction literature, the tourist ‘may begin to consider anew what may be possible of the actual world and even <italic>adjust</italic> his picture of the actual world in the light of his exploration of the fictional world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468797612438438">Maitre, 1983</xref>: 37–38). Indeed, with just a little imagination, the tourist sees Hogwarts appear on a hillside by Loch Shiel, the shimmering lights of Camelot in the far distance when atop Glastonbury Tor, and the ghosts of heroes and villains lingering in darkened corners of medieval villages, castles and cathedrals. As the itinerary for the Spells and Charms Tour avers: ‘After this magical experience you’ll never think of the Harry Potter books and movies in the same way because – for a little while at least – you will have lived in Harry’s world yourself!’</p>
