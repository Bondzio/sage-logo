<title>Deeper Learning</title>
<p>With routine skills becoming less important and expert thinking and complex communication more important, “deeper learning” has become essential for success in college and the workplace. Employers and university professors want students who can think critically, solve problems, and communicate effectively. The National Research Council reported that abilities such as critical thinking and problem solving are associated with positive adult outcomes in the labor market, health, and civic engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217513487507">Pellegrino &amp; Hilton, 2012</xref>). They found that teachers can engage students in deeper learning by,
<disp-quote>
<p>using multiple and varied representations of concepts and tasks such as diagrams, numerical and mathematical representations, and simulations, combined with activities and guidance that support mapping across the varied representations.</p>
<p>encouraging elaboration, questioning, and self-explanation by prompting students to think about the author’s intent and/or to explain specific information and arguments as they read.</p>
<p>engaging learners in challenging tasks, with supportive guidance and feedback while also supporting them with guidance, feedback, and encouragement to reflect on their own learning, processes, and the status of their understanding.</p>
<p>teaching with examples and cases such as modeling procedures and using sets of worked examples.</p>
<p>priming student motivation by connecting topics to students’ personal lives and interests, engaging students in collaborative problem solving, and drawing attention to the knowledge and skills students are developing rather than grades.</p>
<p>using formative assessment to make learning goals clear to students, monitor, provide feedback, respond to students’ learning progress, and involve students in self- and peer assessment. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217513487507">Pellegrino &amp; Hilton, 2012</xref>, pp. 181-182)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Based on this research, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation has invested US$45 million to support deeper learning (visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hewlett.org/deeperlearning">http://www.hewlett.org/deeperlearning</ext-link> for more information). The Foundation is investing in organizations that develop innovative models, build capacity to affect large numbers of students, and support model K-12 schools and community colleges.</p>

<title>Effective Learning Techniques</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217513487507">Dunlosky, Rawson, Marsh, Nathan, and Willingham (2013)</xref> evaluated the effectiveness of 10 learning techniques that are used frequently and relatively easy to use. They evaluated whether their benefits generalized across four categories of variables: learning conditions (e.g., the learning environment in which the technique is implemented), student characteristics (e.g., age, ability, and level of prior knowledge), materials (e.g., simple concepts to mathematical problems to complicated science texts), and criterion tasks (e.g., memory, problem solving, comprehension). The techniques, their descriptions, and how well they worked are described below:</p>
<list id="list1-1076217513487507" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Elaborative interrogation: Generating an explanation for why an explicitly stated fact or concept is true. For example, the teacher asks the student, “Why does it make sense that . . . ?” “Why is this true?” and simply “Why?” (Moderate utility—It generalizes across variables, but evidence is limited.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Self-explanation: Explaining how new information is related to known information or explaining steps taken during problem solving. For example, students self-explain some aspect of their processing while solving a problem. (Moderate utility—It generalizes across variables, but evidence is limited.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Summarization: Writing summaries (of various lengths) of to-be-learned texts. For example, students summarize the main points of a text and capture the main idea of gist of it, excluding unimportant or repetitive material. (Low utility—It is helpful in text learning, but conditions are limited and evidence is needed.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Highlighting (or underlining): Marking potentially important portions of to-be-learned materials while reading. For example, students mark particularly important material. (Low utility—It does not consistently boost students’ performance.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Keyword mnemonic: Using keywords and mental imagery to associate verbal materials. For example, students learn French by finding an English word that sounds similar and then develop a mental image of the English keyword. (Low utility—It is difficult to implement in some contexts and benefits for short retention intervals only.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Imagery for text: Attempting to form mental images of text materials while reading or listening. For example, students draw pictures that represent the content of each paragraph. (Low utility—It is helpful in text learning but conditions are limited and evidence is needed.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rereading: Restudying text material again after an initial reading. For example, reading the same material, or parts of the material, more than once. (Low utility—It does not consistently boost students’ performance.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Practice testing: Self-testing or taking practice tests over to-be-learned material. For example, students are given a practice test, and learning is improved on the final test. (High utility—It benefits learners of different ages and abilities, and boosts performance across many criterion tasks and educational contexts.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Distributed practice: Implementing a schedule of practice that spreads out study activities over time. For example, students study their textbook, review their notes, and later use flashcards to restudy. (High utility—It benefits learners of different ages and abilities and boosts performance across many criterion tasks and educational contexts.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interleaved practice: Implementing a schedule of practice that mixes different kinds of problems or a schedule of study that mixes different kinds of material, within a single study session. For example, students read four tutorials with practice problems that identified four different solution methods using different formulas for computing the volumes of different geometric solids. (Moderate utility—It generalizes across variables, but evidence is limited).</p></list-item>

<title>Text Complexity Model</title>
<p>Current text complexity formulas tend to measure vocabulary and syntax. They are based on the assumption that a text containing many unfamiliar words and long, complicated sentences are more difficult to understand than commonly used words and simple sentences. However, scholars are suggesting that these formulas do not capture all of the dimensions of text complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217513487507">Rothman, 2012</xref>). Moreover, what students experience also affects readability. For these reasons, the Common Core State Standards lay out a three-part model for examining text complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076217513487507">National Governors Association Center for Best Practices [NGA] and Council of Chief State School Officers [CCSO], 2010</xref>):</p>
<list id="list2-1076217513487507" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Qualitative dimensions of text complexity:</p>
<list id="list3-1076217513487507" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>levels of meaning or purpose (single level of meaning to multiple levels of meaning, explicitly state purpose to implicit purpose),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>structure (simple to complex, explicit to implicit, conventional to unconventional, chronological vs. nonchronological order, simple vs. sophisticated graphics, traits of a common genre vs. traits specific to a particular discipline),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>language conventionality and clarity (literal vs. figurative or ironic, clear vs. ambiguous, contemporary vs. archaic, conversational vs. general academic), and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>knowledge demands (simple theme vs. complex or sophisticated themes; single themes vs. multiple themes; common, everyday experiences vs. experiences different from one’s own; single perspective vs. multiple perspectives; perspectives like one’s own vs. perspectives unlike one’s own).</p></list-item></list></list-item>
<list-item><p>Quantitative dimensions of text complexity:</p>
<list id="list4-1076217513487507" list-type="bullet">

<p>Based on the Common Core State Standards’ model, the Kansas Department of Education and 11 other states are developing a rubric for making qualitative judgments about text complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217513487507">Rothman, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Preparing for a Career</title>
<p>Partnering with businesses and other community agencies, schools can offer internships and courses that provide students with a close-up look at life in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217513487507">Adams, 2013</xref>). These internships can last a few weeks or more than a year and be offered in the summer, on evenings or weekends, or during part of the school day. Most are unpaid, but some offer a paycheck or school credit for work. All receive pay in experience. Successful internship programs (a) prepare students before their internship, (b) make workplace expectations clear to students, and (c) allow time for reflection. Career courses may also be offered at the high school level that might include job shadowing. This experience helps students make good decisions regarding their future careers. As one student commented, “Everyone is working hard to get good grades in high school and studying for the SAT, but not everyone is interning, and so many get to college undecided” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217513487507">Adams, 2013</xref>, p. 8).</p>

<title>Progress of Common Core Tests to Assess Learning</title>
<p>The National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing (CRESST) at the University of California, Los Angeles, analyzed the progress in the development of two tests to measure and support goals for deeper learning on the Common Core State Standards: the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (Smarter Balanced) and the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217513487507">Herman &amp; Linn, 2013</xref>). These assessments are slated for full operation in the 2014-2015 school year. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217513487507">Herman and Linn (2013)</xref> made these conclusions from their study:</p>
<list id="list6-1076217513487507" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>PARCC and Smarter Balanced summative assessments represent important goals for deeper learning, particularly those related to mastering core academic content and applying cognitive strategies of complex thinking, communication, and problem solving.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Assessment expectations reflect a dramatic increase in intellectual rigor relative to current state assessments.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Final test blueprints will determine how well higher versus lower level targets are represented on the actual tests, and validity studies will reveal how well selected items and tasks reflect their intended levels.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Because some Chief State School Officers have been concerned about time demands and cost burdens on Smarter Balanced initial plans for multiple performance tasks over several days, Smarter Balanced now plans to reduce time requirements.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In addition to costs (estimated at roughly US$20 per students for both subject areas), extended performance tasks offer challenges in comparing scores across years, which will pose difficulties in monitoring trends and evaluating performance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If costs escalate, teachers and others may need to conduct scoring, and timely assessment results may be compromised.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Both consortia have convened advisory groups to identify ways of building in accommodations for students with disabilities and for English language learners.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Individual assessment targets should focus on major learning goals and represent broad competencies.</p></list-item>

<title>Late Intervention Effects on High School Seniors’ College-Going Behavior</title>
<p>Can educators have a positive impact on college going, even late in a student’s high school career? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217513487507">Carrell and Sacerdote (2012)</xref> addressed this question in their study, which looked at the effects of Dartmouth College’s coaching program on a high school campus. Their program targeted seniors who had the ability but were failing to apply to college in 12 different New Hampshire high schools. After random assignment, half of the students were notified from their guidance counselor that they had been selected for a Dartmouth College coaching program on their high school campus intended to help them complete college applications. Students were told that the program included person mentoring, having college application and College Board (or ACT) fees paid, and a US$100 cash bonus for completing the process. Each day the students were in the program, they were excused from their high school class. To complete the program, students were required to file application, complete college essays, request transcripts and recommendation letters, send College Board or ACT scores, and start the student section of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) application. Most students finished the application process within 3 to 4 weeks. Mentors from Dartmouth University provided additional remote help beyond the program sessions. Results indicated that college mentoring helps most women and students who have less support available to them or are from schools with fewer resources. Women were more likely to attend and persist in 4-year colleges. The students also persisted in college to the same degree that other New Hampshire students did.</p>

<p>The Brown Center Report on American Education at the Brookings Institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217513487507">Loveless, 2013</xref>) has released a report that finds a resurgence of <bold>ability grouping</bold> in the elementary school (fourth grade), based on the most recent National Assessment of Educational Practice (NAEP) data. While grouping occurs between classes with different teachers and curricula and is most common in high school, ability grouping also occurs within classes and predominates in elementary school. The NAEP indicates that the practice of grouping for reading instruction at the fourth-grade level has grown from 28% in 1998 to 71% in 2009 and in math from 48% in 1992 to 61% in 2011. They explain that this resurgence may be due to accountability systems and the rise of technology-driven differentiated instruction.
