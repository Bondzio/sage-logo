<sec id="sec1-1744987112441911" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Jordan has a population of nearly 6,000,000 people with a median age of 23 years, a crude birth rate of 37 per 1000 population, a total fertility rate of 3.1, a perinatal mortality rate of 22 per 1000 total births, a neonatal mortality rate of 16 per 1000 live births and an infant mortality rate of 17 per 1000 live births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987112441911">UNICEF, 2008</xref>). It is estimated that the majority of infant deaths occur in the neonatal period, with the major causes being respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and asphyxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987112441911">World Health Organisation, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent study carried out in Jordan to assess the maternal mortality rate (MMR) showed that between 1997 and 2008 there was a significant reduction in maternal deaths from 41 in 1997 to 19.4 per 100,000. The report identified the leading causes of maternal deaths in Jordan to be haemorrhage, followed by pulmonary embolism and septicaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987112441911">Amarin et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In total, 99% of women receive some antenatal care, 99.5% were attended by a healthcare professional during labour and delivery and 97% gave birth in hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987112441911">Higher Population Council, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Observers agree that the Jordanian Government’s programmes addressing obstetric emergencies have contributed to a significant reduction in maternal deaths. However, some evidence suggests that Jordan runs the risk of over-medicalising maternal health care; a rapid increase in the use of technology to start, augment, accelerate, regulate and monitor the process of birth has frequently led to the adoption of inadequate, unnecessary interventions sometimes associated with increased risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987112441911">Hatamleh et al., 2008</xref>). This risk is illustrated by the rapid increase in caesarean section deliveries from 16% of all deliveries in 2002 to 28% of all deliveries in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987112441911">World Health Organisation, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987112441911">Higher Population Council, 2008</xref>). The available literature shows that Jordanian birth practices are interventionist and different from WHO guidelines and evidence-based recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987112441911">Khresheh et al., 2007</xref>). Jordanian women expect their birth to be a difficult and painful experience in the light of absence of social and emotional support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112441911">Abushaikha, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a scarcity of reporting, however, on women’s memories of childbirth in developing countries and it was clear after reviewing the literature that research into Jordanian women’s memories is a neglected area. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore Jordanian women’s memories of their birth experience. The results could help to further inform policy makers and care providers in Jordan and other countries that do not provide women with informed choice and psychological support in birth. The results of this study could also contribute to midwives’ understanding of differences in birthing practices across the world and in different cultures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1744987112441911" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>The research design was exploratory and descriptive. We identified a total of 200 first-time mothers giving birth in Northern Jordan’s Bade' a Hospital to be included in the study. Data were collected up to six weeks after the birth. Of the selected women, a total of 160 came back for follow-up at a postnatal clinic and were asked to complete a questionnaire that included qualitative open-ended questions on their experience of birth and life after the birth. The setting was chosen as it is the largest governmental maternity hospital and has a leading role in shaping obstetric and midwifery practices in the country through the large number of deliveries conducted and the number of students trained annually.</p>
<p>Approval to conduct the study was given by the ethical committee at the Jordan University of Science and Technology. In order to obtain access to all governmental hospitals, a letter of support was obtained from the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>Trustworthiness was enhanced by asking the women to share their memory (vision) of birth without leading questions or excessive probing comments from the researcher, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987112441911">Lincoln and Guba’s (1985)</xref> four aspects of trustworthiness: truth-value, applicability, consistency and neutrality. The researcher was also influenced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987112441911">Sandelowski (1993)</xref>, who has postulated that it is important not to be inflexible and rigid when considering rigour in qualitative research as these qualities can detract from the ‘artfulness, versatility and sensitivity to meaning and context that mark qualitative works of distinction’. In this study, truth-value was enhanced through cross-checking with two independent researchers, through triangulation, and by referring to the literature for support. To ensure consistency, two independent researchers reviewed the data trail and both of them arrived at the same conclusions. The theoretical verification process was applied, which included verification of the emerging theory with other researchers, using women’s answers to support the concepts and by looking for similar findings in related literature.</p>
<p>There was no serious risk or harm coming to the participants. The questionnaires were anonymous, therefore no name or identification information was required. All information obtained by questionnaire was kept confidential. The participants’ written voluntary consents were obtained prior to data collection. Participants were assured that they had the right to withdraw from the study at any time, without any effect on the care they received. Participants were assured that the data would be used only for the purpose of this study<bold>.</bold></p>
<p>Content analysis as outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987112441911">Burnard (1991)</xref>, with some modifications, was utilised in this study. Transcripts were read through and notes were made on general themes so that the researcher could become immersed in the data. The transcripts were read again and as many categories or headings as possible were identified and grouped together. The aim was to collapse the categories into broader and more conceptual themes. Repetitive or similar headings were removed from the list of categories and sub-categories until a final list was produced. Two colleagues were then asked to generate categories from the data independently and these two lists were then compared with the researcher’s list and any adjustments required were made. This enhanced the validity and guarded against researcher bias. Transcripts were then re-read alongside the final list of categories to check that they covered everything and final adjustments were made. Coded sections of the data were cut from their original transcript and collapsed together to produce headings and subheadings. The findings were then written up using the literature to support emerging themes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987112441911">Patton’s (1990)</xref> manifest and latent content analysis was used to present quantifiable information to support themes emerging from the qualitative analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1744987112441911" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<sec id="sec4-1744987112441911" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>Of the 160 respondents, all were married and their age ranged from 17 to 37 years. About two-thirds (64.5%) had school education and 35.5% had graduate education. The majority (72.5%) were housewives and most women (90%) had total family income of less than £360 per month. According to <italic>Addustour Newspaper</italic> on 29 April 2009, an official report issued by the Chief Statistics Bureau showed that the average monthly income in Jordan is £266.178 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987112441911">Addustour Newspaper, 2009</xref>). The overall impression from the data was that women’s recall of their memories of birth experience is fairly accurate and women described their memories in both a positive and a negative light.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1744987112441911"><title>Latent content analysis</title>
<p>Only 99 (62%) of the women described their memories of birth. All women mentioned their type of delivery, and remembered the date and time of birth and the baby’s birth-weight. The majority of respondents to this question indicated vivid recall of the birthing process (<italic>n</italic> = 82, 83%); a small proportion ‘remembered nothing’ (<italic>n</italic> = 12, 12%) and five did not want to remember.</p>
<p>Six main themes emerged from the content analysis. These were: birthing being processed technologically; having dehumanised care; vivid recall (relaxation and end of pain, seeing my baby); halo effect (where perceptions of one aspect affect another); the joy of becoming a mother; and praise for the support of Allah.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987112441911"><title>Negative childbirth memories</title>
<p>The following words were repeated throughout the transcriptions of 82 women: ‘pain’, ‘fear’, ‘exposed’, ‘worried’, ‘exhausted’, ‘lonely’ and feeling ‘powerless’. The majority of women remembered birth as painful (<italic>n</italic> = 46 out of 82; 56%), frightening (<italic>n</italic> = 20 out of 82; 24%), and difficult (<italic>n</italic> = 14 out of 82; 17%). Twenty-seven women (33%) identified specific birth technologies as being negative experiences, such as internal examinations, breaking of their waters and episiotomy.</p>
<p>Negative childbirth memories were demonstrated by the following quotes:<disp-quote>
<p>It was a horrible pain. (W1)</p>
<p>I suffered too much; I remember also the pain and exhaustion. (W2)</p>
<p>I remember the pain and fear of death. (W90)</p>
<p>I remember the pain, women’s shouting, thirsty, hunger and loneliness. (W182)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1744987112441911"><title>Women being ‘processed’ through using birth technology</title>
<p>The majority of women who gave birth followed the technological cycle described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987112441911">Sinclair and Crozier (2004)</xref>, including induction, artificial rupture of membranes, oxytocin, continuous foetal heart monitoring, analgesia and episiotomy. Birth was not seen as a social event and family were not permitted to be present for birth. Childbirth classes were not available, midwives were scarce and there was no ‘one-to-one’ care. Women were birthed in bed in the lithotomy position; during labour they were denied food and drink (water is not commonly given but may be supplied on special request and with permission from the doctor).</p>
<p>Although birth technology was not raised in questioning, a surprising number of women drew attention to it. For example:<disp-quote>
<p>I remember the artificial contractions which were so difficult they suturing me, they killed me for half an hour it was a horrible pain. (W1)</p>
<p>I remember the decision for caesarean section and the internal examination. (W33)</p>
<p>I remember the contractions and water broke. (W102)</p>
<p>I remember that I was shivering after giving birth, I remember the Foley’s catheter, urine bag, the internal examination was so bad and anaesthesia. (W63)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It is important to note that maternal and infant morbidity/mortality was also reported in this section:<disp-quote>
<p>I remember that I got infection at the wound site (operation) for one month. (W55)</p>
<p>I remember my wound was big, and I get tired and stayed for 2 hours at the operation room. (W99)</p>
<p>All my family feel sorrow with me because I lost my baby. (W161)</p>
<p>He (my baby) stayed at the neonatal intensive care unit for 22 days. (W185)</p></disp-quote>These findings depict the technological cycle and its negative impacts on Jordanian women’s memories of childbirth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1744987112441911"><title>Dehumanised birth</title>
<p>Many women provided descriptive comments about being treated as if they were not human. Sub-themes related to ‘lack of privacy, no control, no support from health professional and being maltreated by professionals’. The followings quotes are used to illustrate this point:<disp-quote>
<p>I remember the way the doctor dealt with me, he was so tough. (W73)</p>
<p>I remember the way they dealt with me as if I am a thing or machine not as a human being they tortured me. (W141)</p>
<p>I remember the tough doctors and midwives, they were dehumanised people, I remembered their shouting at me, and their carelessness. (W135)</p>
<p>There was no privacy. (W72)</p>
<p>They exposed me in front of other doctors. (W157)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1744987112441911"><title>Vivid recall</title>
<p>Following content analysis, four sub-themes emerged. These were ‘the moment of giving birth’, ‘relaxation end of pain’, ‘seeing my baby for the first time’ and ‘health professionals’.</p>
<sec id="sec10-1744987112441911"><title>The moment of giving birth</title>
<p>This is illustrated by the followings quotes:<disp-quote>
<p>I remember the moment of giving birth. (W1)</p>
<p>I remember when I delivered the head of my baby. (W31)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1744987112441911"><title>Relaxation and end of pain</title>
<p>This is illustrated by the followings quotes:<disp-quote>
<p>I remember that the best thing is when I had given birth and relaxed. (W72)</p>
<p>I was looking to finish the childbirth and got relaxed; I did not care by what they will do and how they will conduct the delivery of my baby. (W150)</p>
<p>I remember I was tired then felt relaxed when I finished. (W197)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1744987112441911"><title>Seeing my baby</title>
<p>This is illustrated by the following quotes:<disp-quote>
<p>I was waiting to see my baby. (W151)</p>
<p>I remember I was happy when I saw my baby. (W193)</p>
<p>I remember when I saw my baby and hugged her. (W37)</p>
<p>I remember the moment of finishing the operation and saw my baby. (W103)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1744987112441911"><title>Health professionals</title>
<p>Women remembered specific acts of kindness and this appeared to be something exceptional instead of normal basic good practice:<disp-quote>
<p>I remember the midwife; she was so kind with me. (W88)</p>
<p>I remember that I asked water and the doctor gave me. (W97)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1744987112441911"><title>Halo effect</title>
<p>Halo effect is where perceptions of one aspect affect another. A small number of women described birth as a positive experience:<disp-quote>
<p>I remember my childbirth was easy and not difficult. (W5)</p>
<p>I remember my childbirth was very quick in one hour. (W82)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1744987112441911"><title>The joy of becoming a mother</title>
<p>Women remembered the joy of realising they were mothers. This joy enabled them to push their pain and suffering into their memory and move forward to take on motherhood:<disp-quote>
<p>I was happy because my baby came after three years. I was tired but I tolerate the pain because of my baby. (W4)</p>
<p>I forgot all my suffering and pain when I saw my baby and hugged her. At that time I felt that motherhood is beautiful and nice. (W37)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1744987112441911"><title>Spiritual strength (praise for support of Allah)</title>
<p>Women perceived the help of Allah to be central in helping them to cope. The honour and the thanksgiving to Allah are evident in the following excerpts:<disp-quote>
<p>The most important thing that my baby is free of any congenital abnormality and I thank ‘Allah’ my baby is healthy and I found my baby as I imagine her. (W151)</p>
<p>I asked from ‘Allah’ to finish my childbirth safely. (W65)</p>
<p>My husband and I were very happy because ‘Allah’ gave us our baby after 20 years. (W64)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1744987112441911" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is no literature about Jordanian women’s memories, but there is a little information about Jordanian women’s hospital birth experiences. The findings of the available studies from Jordan about women’s childbirth experience cannot be generalised because studies were small in sample size and retrospective in design. Exploring Jordanian women’s memories of their childbirth experience is important for evaluation of maternity services provision and can affect policy and strategy development. Therefore, creating optimal birthing experiences for women regardless of the necessity or choice to use technology are worth serious consideration.</p>
<p>This is the first Jordanian study of women’s memories of childbirth. Women seemed to welcome the opportunity to write about their memories of birth experiences and contribute to improvements in maternity care, highlighted by the fact that few, if any, women refused to participate. This study focused on women’s memories of overall birth experience.</p>
<p>Negative feelings in women’s memories about their childbirth experience may be self-generated, as Jordanian women have preconceived ideas that the childbirth experience will be negative. This finding was supported by the quantitative data from the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987112441911">Oweis and Abushaikha (2004)</xref> in which 66% of participants stated that they expected their childbirth experience to be ‘frightening’ (66%), ‘very long’ (63%), ‘difficult’ (66%) and ‘painful’ (78%). The expectations of a negative childbirth experience could be explained by limited labour preparation and advice given to women.</p>
<p>Women felt ‘processed technologically’, recognising that labour pain and medical interventions contributed to their negative birth memories. The literature has suggested that the more interventions a woman experiences, such as induction or augmentation of labour and episiotomies, the more likely a stressful and painful birth will result in an unsatisfying childbirth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987112441911">Creedy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987112441911">Waldenstrom et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of inappropriate practices such as routine intravenous infusions and frequent vaginal examinations contributed to this feeling of technological processing. Induction of labour was the most common experience for these women. These findings are in keeping with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987112441911">Hatamleh et al. (2008)</xref>, who found that the majority of women (81%) underwent induction of labour, 72% had an artificial rupture of membranes, 72.5% had their labour augmented with oxytocin, 89% had continuous EFM and 66% had an episiotomy.</p>
<p>Many women provided descriptive comments about being treated as if they were not human, such as restricted mobility and not being allowed to eat and drink during labour, lack of privacy, no control, no support from health professionals and being maltreated by professionals. These findings are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987112441911">Hatamleh (2006)</xref>, who found that 54% of women reported that they had not been offered privacy during birth, and the majority of women (98%) had not been served food or drink during labour. The findings are also consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987112441911">Sweidan et al. (2008)</xref>, who found that some unnecessary procedures, including pubic shaving and enemas, are frequently practised. Women are restricted in their movement during labour, and the lithotomy position is usually adopted for delivery. Most hospitals do not allow non-medical labour attendance (such as by female family members or expectant fathers) during labour and delivery. These findings are also in accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987112441911">Hodnett et al. (2007)</xref>, who found that lack of support during labour and childbirth has raised concerns about the consequent dehumanisation of women’s childbirth experience.</p>
<p>Women remembered specific acts of kindness and this appeared to be something exceptional instead of normal basic good practice. These findings contradicted those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987112441911">Oweis and Abushaikha (2004)</xref>, who found that Jordanian women expected inadequate nursing and midwifery support during childbirth.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to the majority, a small number of women described birth as a positive experience. These positive memories might come within the phenomenon of ‘halo effect’. This is frequently observed when a successful task and significant event takes place, even though forgotten negative undertones or some disappointments are associated with it. These are temporarily overshadowed by the excitement and joy of the birth itself and seeing the product of their labour. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987112441911">Simkin’s (1991)</xref> research reported that the joy and relief felt by the mother after the birth of a healthy baby quickly overshadows any disappointment, anger, pain, unwanted or uncomfortable procedures and negative interactions with staff.</p>
<p>Women remembered the joy of realising that they were mothers. This joy enabled them to push their pain and suffering into their memory and move forward to take on motherhood. These findings are in keeping with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987112441911">Khalaf and Callister (1997)</xref>, who found that pregnancy and childbirth are generally considered positive life events in the Jordanian society, especially when parents have planned and prepared for the beginning of new life. Moreover, the birth of the baby is considered a special event and is celebrated.</p>
<p>Women perceived the help of Allah to be central in helping them to cope. Spirituality has been explicated in the literature as an important facet of women’s lives, particularly when giving birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987112441911">King, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987112441911">Sered, 1991</xref>). It would seem that the process of becoming pregnant, giving birth and entering new motherhood inherently carries the potential for raising consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987112441911">Taylor, 2002</xref>) and enhancing spiritual awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987112441911">Baker, 2000</xref>). The powerful influence of Allah in Jordanian women’s lives has already been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987112441911">Khalaf and Callister (1997)</xref>. These findings are also in keeping with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112441911">Abushaikha (2007)</xref>, who found from her explorative study that Jordanian women use spirituality as a major labour pain-coping method.</p>

<p>In conclusion, findings from these qualitative data provide evidence of the poor care that women receive during labour and birth. Women seem to be processed as objects to give birth in a technological manner. They are treated more like machines devoid of feeling than independent women requiring information, childbirth education or supportive ‘one to one’ care. Childbirth care was based on a medical model where the birth process is institutionalised, managed and controlled by the use of birth technology. There was no evidence of holistic care provided for women and little consideration of their psychological, environmental or family relationships. This situation can be addressed only with effective and targeted education. Midwives need to take a more active role in childbirth education and develop their knowledge and skill in normal birth to be able to support women to make evidence-informed choices. Until Jordanian women’s voices are strengthened it is up to midwives to speak for them.</p>
