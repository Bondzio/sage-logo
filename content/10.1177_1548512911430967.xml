<abstract>
<p>A chaff cloud is an electronic countermeasure to radio frequency emitters. The cloud immerses a protected entity in a multitude of false targets by reradiating incident electromagnetic energy from millions of thin aluminized fibers, foil strips, or elements printed with conductive ink. The elements are cut to form resonant structures to match the principle threat frequencies, making them an effective reradiator. Empirically testing chaff clouds is technically challenging, costly, and time consuming. With an increased emphasis on chaff research comes the need to characterize cloud radar cross-section performance to expand existing knowledge and explore development opportunities for future technologies. This paper describes the computational methodology and results for analyzing standard dipole chaff clouds and Koch snowflakes as a possible new chaff element.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>As far back as World War II, radar was a key factor in armed conflicts that spurred the need to develop forms of electronic protection. The idea of chaff as a protective device was developed independently by Great Britain and Germany. In late 1941 and early 1942, a Telecommunications Research Establishment researcher named Joan Curran investigated the idea of chaff, code named ‘Window’, to generate false radar echoes. A similar study was conducted by the Germans who coined it ‘Düppel’. Although both sides understood the use of chaff to jam radar, they were unaware of the other’s development. Chaff was initially withheld from use for fear of it falling into enemy hands and hence be developed against them. However, approval to use Window resulted from subsequent studies revealing to the British weaknesses of German radar, as well as intelligence reports confirming German awareness to Window principles. The results proved effective, as German radar controllers were hindered in their ability to follow British bombers, but also in following their own nightfighters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548512911430967">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Radar cross-section (RCS) is defined as ‘the area intercepting that amount of power which, when scattered isotropically, produces at the receiver a density which is equal to that scattered by the actual target’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548512911430967">2</xref></sup> The mathematical definition is described as follows:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548512911430967">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>2. Single element and array characterization</title>
<p>A chaff cloud is an evolving structure consisting of millions of underlying particles or elements. These elements are commonly either a metalized fiber or a foil strip. In either case, the elements behave as either a resonant or wideband dipole structure. The preponderance of chaff models in literature focus on the distributions of fibrous elements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548512911430967">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548512911430967"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548512911430967"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548512911430967">8</xref></sup> Studies of chaff clouds were addressed in the past using various methods. One technique using statistical means based on the RCS of a single thin-wire dipole element allows for an extension to full cloud performance. These estimates are based on the following assumptions:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548512911430967">9</xref></sup></p>

<p>The computational approach developed herein began by characterizing two second-order Koch snowflakes of diameters 0.97 cm (0.38 in) and 1.52 cm (0.6 in). The Koch snowflake shares a common trait of fractal geometries in that it possesses an inherent self-similarity to its geometrical structure. The construction of the Koch snowflake begins with a solid equilateral triangle. By iteratively adding to the structure smaller and smaller triangles, various stages of the Koch snowflake can be produced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548512911430967">10</xref></sup> Being that fractal antennas display self-similarity about a point and are symmetric about that point, they are frequency independent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548512911430967">11</xref></sup> The approach to consider inherently broadband elements was motivated by a need to evaluate the properties of chaff on a mission level. The advantage of fractal geometries to create a chaff cloud lies in their stable RCS response over a much wider bandwidth than the typical resonant dipole cloud.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548512911430967">12</xref></sup> It is common practice that a dipole chaff cloud will contain several cut lengths to produce a greater bandwidth cloud. The cloud is most effective, however, at and around the resonant frequency of the constituent lengths of each cut.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548512911430967">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is understood that the operational effectiveness of a chaff particle will be influenced by both its RCS versus bandwidth characteristics in addition to its aerodynamic behavior. In other words, the projected cross-sectional area of the proposed particle will be determined by its orientation and fundamental tumbling modes during free fall. The details of the aerodynamic performance are influenced by the physical properties of the prototype particle. These include mass, volume, and material stiffness. This paper describes the initial research into fractal chaff elements and thus an aerodynamic analysis of possible Koch flake prototypes is an area of future work.</p>
<p>The commercially available computational electromagnetic modeling software, FEKO, was used in the analysis of the single element characterizations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548512911430967">14</xref></sup> The FEKO solution kernel is based on the Method of Moments (MoM) technique. The MoM technique gives a full wave solution of Maxwell’s integral equations in the frequency domain. Other techniques have been implemented in its programming to solve electrically large problems and inhomogeneous dielectric bodies of arbitrary shape.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548512911430967">3</xref></sup> The flake geometry was created and illuminated by a plane wave incident along the face normal, or broadside. The results of the single flake analysis can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1548512911430967">Figure 1</xref>. As can be seen, a Koch flake has a flat response over a broad frequency range. Although the 0.97 cm flake was originally studied, the 1.52 cm (0.6 in) flake was chosen for subsequent models of fractal chaff clouds for its performance characteristics and limitations of the available test equipment.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1548512911430967-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To further validate the model generating capability, experimental tests were conducted. The 1.52 cm (0.6 in) Koch Flake was used. Along with the flake, an 8.1026 cm (3.19 in) sphere was modeled and measured. This provided a calibration point for the test and an initial validation of the modeling approach. The design frequency was chosen because of the availability of test instrumentation. This frequency was in the middle of the rated frequency of operation for the compact antenna range used to take the RCS measurements.</p>
<p>The technique for producing the physical flakes involved Electrical-Discharge Machining (EDM) of aluminum foil with a nominal thickness of approximately 0.0025 cm (0.001 in). The Agilent E8362B Pulsed Network Analyzer (PNA) with horizontally oriented transmit and receive horns was used in a compact range. The use of an anechoic chamber allowed for Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) processing to attain the data presented.</p>
<p>ISAR is a form of radar imaging similar to Synthetic Array (Aperture) Radar (SAR). Differences in the two forms of image processing result from their geometrical configurations. With SAR, angular-resolution distance is inversely proportional to the angle the radar moves through, while ISAR is inversely proportional to the angle the target rotates through.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548512911430967">15</xref></sup> In other words, the object in SAR mapping remains stationary while the radar is moving. Conversely, the object in ISAR mapping is moving while the radar remains stationary. An advantage is present with this experimental setup due to the location and orientation of the particle being known. This allows for the use of ISAR techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548512911430967">4</xref></sup> The experimental configuration, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1548512911430967">Figure 2</xref>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548512911430967">4</xref></sup> consists of a lattice of Koch elements to increase the total reflected signal strength.</p>

<title>3. Chaff cloud formation and initial results</title>
<p>The user interface component, EDITFEKO, of the commercially available computational electromagnetic modeling software, FEKO, was used in the modeling of the chaff clouds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548512911430967">14</xref></sup> The EDITFEKO script contained user-defined variables for the frequency, total element count, and radius of the cloud. The script utilized a built-in random number generator that served to create the random distribution for each element’s local origin and orientation within a spherical cloud envelope. Because the aerodynamic properties of the Koch flake were not fully known, a random distribution with uniform probability density function was chosen. This meant that all orientations were equally likely. The actual Koch particles may have a bias towards a more vertical or horizontal orientation. As information about the natural tendencies of the particle orientation become available, the FEKO script will be adjusted to bias the particle orientation accordingly.</p>
<p>Because Koch flakes deviate from the standard dipole chaff clouds, models of both dipoles and flakes were produced. The analysis of dipole clouds was necessary to make a proper comparison of chaff cloud behavior by initially comparing with Van Vleck estimations of cloud RCSs. The principle goal of the analysis was to compare a Koch flake-based cloud to a dipole cloud. To establish an unbiased simulation, both clouds consisted of 500 elements in a spherical volume of one meter radius centered at the origin. A spherical envelop was chosen to allow an impartial view from any observation angle. The geometry of a 1.52 cm (0.6 in) Koch flake was used for the fractal element clouds. A uniform homogeneous chaff cloud consisting of resonant half-wavelength dipoles was used for the thin-wire dipole cloud comparisons.</p>
<p>To correspond to single element models and measurements, all RCS calculations were made at 9 GHz. The models were each excited by a plane wave and solved using the numerical MoM technique. An advantage of the MoM technique is that only the structure in question is discretized, not free space. However, this means that the solver memory requirements and runtime, which scale poorly in the MoM technique, increase rapidly as the problem size increases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548512911430967">14</xref></sup> The MoM technique is also a frequency domain technique. For this reason, the cloud was treated as a static structure and resulting RCS calculations represented a single instance in time. The approach did not coherently track individual particle motions. Thus, a direct prediction of short-time-interval behavior, such as particle Doppler from scintillation, was not possible. However, by regenerating the static clouds with varying cloud envelop and density, chaff bloom can be sampled over longer time intervals.</p>
<p>A monostatic calculation of the RCS was taken in the azimuth plane from 0° &lt; φ &lt; 180° with each calculation at 5° intervals for a total of 37 plane wave excitation angles per cloud. It was understood that the static nature of the clouds meant the 37 different views were not independent of the underlying cloud structure. Five instances of each cloud type consisting of 500 elements were analyzed to account for the structural dependence. The Koch flake models were a variant of the dipole cloud models using the same cloud formation technique with Koch flakes by replacing the dipoles and re-randomizing the distribution. Model results of the dipole and Koch flake clouds can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1548512911430967">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1548512911430967">5</xref>, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548512911430967">16</xref></sup></p>

<p>The mean of all clouds over all angles was also computed along with the standard deviation of RCS computations. Although there are concerns over the dependence of each RCS calculation to the underlying cloud structure, the means still provided insight to cloud characterization. A truly independent viewpoint would have been to choose only one observation angle and re-randomize the cloud. With the chosen option for this experiment, the mean total RCS for the dipole clouds was −12.090 dBm<sup>2</sup> with a standard deviation of 3.656. The mean total RCS for the Koch flake clouds was −8.605 dBm<sup>2</sup> with a standard deviation of 4.341.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548512911430967">16</xref></sup> Overall Koch flake performance shows a greater RCS than dipole clouds on a cloud-by-cloud basis.</p>

<sec id="section4-1548512911430967">
<title>4. Extended analysis: dipole-to-flake equivalence</title>
<p>Although the previous analysis indicated that a Koch flake chaff cloud would result in greater RCS performance than a dipole cloud, additional dipoles can be used to equate to a Koch flake on a per volume basis. After analyzing the elements electromagnetically, it was appropriate to examine them volumetrically. As is seen in current chaff technology, a typical cartridge used for dispensing chaff can hold millions of dipoles. The question was how many dipoles would equal the RCS performance of a single Koch flake. It was deemed appropriate to adhere to the current modeling process rather than attempting to replicate for Koch flakes the work of Van Vleck’s theory of thin wires. The advantage of using cloud structures was the ability to consider random orientation of the elements and including spatial spreading of elements.</p>
<p>Using the same methodology described in Section 3, the experiment determined the relation between element types based on the trend of Koch flake clouds ranging from 100 to 1000 flakes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548512911430967">17</xref></sup> Using an exponential curve to describe the data, it was estimated that a cloud of 224 flakes would equal the RCS performance of a 500-element dipole cloud. However, a simulated cloud of 224 flakes proved no better than a 200-flake cloud on average. The spread of the data may be attributed to the random nature of chaff cloud formation, which would likely increase with more simulations.</p>
<p>As a result of these modeling trials, it was determined that a Koch flake is equivalent to approximately 2.5 dipoles. To confirm this relationship, another simulation was conducted for a 500-element Koch flake cloud. As expected, a dipole cloud of 1250 elements showed a similar RCS value. The most relevant results of the analysis can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1548512911430967">Table 1</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548512911430967">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>With a ratio of 2.5 dipoles to 1 flake, Koch flakes do not appear to scale well with respect to standard chaff-dispensing cartridge. For instance, the M839 25.4 mm Army Decoy Cartridge with chaff cuts measuring 2.54 cm × 2.54 cm × 20.32 cm (1 in × 1 in × 8 in) contains millions of dipoles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548512911430967">18</xref></sup> If dipoles were substituted with Koch flakes that are 1.52 cm (0.6 in) in diameter and 0.0025 cm (0.0009842 in) thick, the cartridge would only hold approximately 13,200 flakes. With the above ratio, the cartridge would only yield the effective RCS of a 33,020-element dipole cloud. As can be seen, this is far short of the millions of elements in the existing round. This simple comparison does not consider issues such as dispersion efficiency.</p>

<title>5. Broadband Koch flake characterization</title>
<p>Despite the shortcomings in Koch flake packaging for cartridge dispersion at 9 GHz, the modeled RCS for a fractal cloud over a wider frequency range was explored. A Koch flake-based cloud could still have a stable RCS over varying frequency, a property that its dipole counterpart does not share. The dipole models were kept at the 9 GHz length to simulate the single chaff length in the round.</p>
<p>With bandwidth being the only variation in this part of the experiment, the same methodology was used as described above. The clouds were analyzed over the range of 4–18 GHz in 1 GHz steps. The results for the dipole and Koch flake models can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1548512911430967">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1548512911430967">7</xref>, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548512911430967">19</xref></sup></p>

<p>The single Koch element showed a more stable RCS at the higher end of the band, while the cloud showed increased variation. However, the Koch flake cloud shows a more stable RCS response than the dipole cloud models. The stability of the single flake can be attributed to a constant broadside illumination angle. This uniformity cannot be seen in the random nature of chaff cloud formations.</p>

<title>6. Conclusion</title>
<p>Published chaff literature focuses predominantly on thin-wire dipoles or foil strips. In this paper, fractal geometry was chosen for its broadband characteristics. While this analysis simulated static cloud models, applications to various cloud sizes and shapes can also be studied to describe a typical chaff cloud bloom. There are advantages offered from this analysis technique over both existing analytical and full range measurement approaches. To begin, the experimental technique offers considerable financial savings over traditional flight test characterizations. The experimental methodology offered in this report also has several advantages over the published analytical approaches, similar to Van Vleck.</p>

<list-item><p>An understanding of chaff cloud dynamics through the variability in cloud RCS response resulted from the multiple random samples of discrete element cloud models.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>This report only presented the total RCS response of the cloud, but additional information is also available in the raw form. Data about the co-polarized and cross-polarized reflections were also produced from the analysis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Arbitrary chaff element geometries can be studied. The preponderance of published literature, including the Van Vleck figures, is specific to thin-wire dipoles. No such tabulation of coefficients is available for novel chaff shapes. Using EDITFEKO to define the chaff element shape and simulating clouds of discrete particles, any element profile can be considered.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The analysis showed that on a per cloud basis, Koch flake clouds resulted in a higher RCS than the standard dipole chaff clouds. However, the volumetric study of the traditional chaff cartridge dispense method revealed that Koch flake clouds do not scale well, with a ratio of 2.5 dipoles to 1 Koch flake to produce an equivalent RCS. An advantage of Koch flakes over dipoles though lies in their stable RCS response over a wider range of frequencies. While this analysis modeled spherical cloud envelopes, future studies will delve into various cloud sizes and formations, as well as various fractal geometries. Underlying chaff cloud behavior will also be taken into consideration.</p>
