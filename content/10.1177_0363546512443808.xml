<sec id="section1-0363546512443808">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Chlorhexidine (CLX) has been reported as a popular and effective disinfectant of contaminated tendon grafts with no biomechanical sequelae; however, its biochemical effects on tendon collagen and fibroblasts remain unknown.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512443808">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To determine whether CLX disinfection of contaminated tendon grafts has deleterious effects on tendon collagen or a toxic effect on fibroblast function.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512443808">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Controlled laboratory study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512443808">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Collagen fibrils prepared from purified bovine collagen type I were treated with various CLX concentrations (0.5%-4%) and incubation times (10-40 minutes), and the effects on fibril degradation and solubility were then examined using gel electrophoresis. Fresh bovine tendons were treated with sterile water or 2% CLX; then, fibroblast mobility and metabolic activity were evaluated using light microscopy and Alamar Blue assay, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512443808">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>No effect on collagen fibrils was observed when they were exposed to 0%, 0.5%, or 2% CLX at any exposure time. However, 4% CLX dissolved the fibrils even after short incubation times. Fibroblasts migrated out from the control tendon explants but not from explants treated with 2% CLX, and a 5-fold reduction in metabolic activity was observed throughout the tendon in explants exposed to 2% CLX, suggesting that CLX penetrated and killed cells throughout the tissue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512443808">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Four-percent CLX caused collagen fibrils to dissolve in vitro, and tendon graft disinfection with 2% CLX was cytotoxic to the cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0363546512443808">
<title>Clinical Relevance:</title>
<p>Because of its chemical effect on tendon collagen and cytotoxic effect on tendon fibroblasts, 4% CLX should not be used as a disinfectant. Two-percent CLX can be used to disinfect contaminated ACL grafts, but such treatment will drastically reduce the metabolic activity of the cells within the graft, making it similar to an acellular allograft tendon.</p>

<body>
<p>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a commonly performed procedure in orthopaedic surgery today, with more than 100,000 ACL reconstructions performed annually in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512443808">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512443808">19</xref></sup> Both tendon autografts and allografts have been used successfully in ACL reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512443808">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512443808">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512443808">32</xref></sup> Great care must be taken to avoid contamination during harvest and/or preparation of the graft for ACL reconstruction or any other surgical procedure. Handling and carrying the grafts between the operative table and side table raise the possibility of accidental graft contamination. As orthopaedic surgeons continue to increase the use of both autografts and allografts for reconstruction of soft tissues, demand for a safe, effective, and expeditious means to disinfect any accidentally contaminated tissue will increase.</p>
<p>If the graft is contaminated because of accidental dropping on the floor, graft disinfection is a viable option.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512443808">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512443808">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512443808">19</xref></sup> Different studies on disinfecting contaminated grafts have demonstrated that chlorhexidine (CLX) is the most efficient and effective protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512443808">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512443808">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512443808">26</xref></sup> Both 2% and 4% CLX concentration have been used effectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512443808">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512443808">13</xref></sup> Although data on the clinical outcomes of using CLX are still lacking, no reported cases in the literature in which CLX was used to disinfect the ACL graft developed infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512443808">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512443808">29</xref></sup> Three liters of 2% CLX power irrigation can be effectively used to disinfect a contaminated ACL graft without weakening the graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512443808">16</xref></sup> However, the biochemical effects of CLX on the tendon are still unknown.</p>
<p>The main purpose of our biochemical study was to determine if there would be any adverse biochemical effect of the ACL decontamination solution on treated ACL grafts. Because the major constituent of tendon is type I collagen (86% fat-free dry weight) and the primary cell type in tendon is the fibroblast, the focus of this study was to investigate the biochemical effects of CLX on both collagen (type I) and fibroblasts. Our hypothesis was that CLX is cytotoxic to fibroblasts and adversely affects the biochemical properties of collagen. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to test the biochemical effect of CLX on collagen and tendon fibroblasts.</p>

<p>Commercially available purified collagen dissolved in 0.012 N HCl (Vitrogen 100, Advanced BioMatrix, San Diego, California) composed of 97% collagen type I and 3% collagen type III was used to prepare collagen fibrils to study the effect of CLX on collagen degradation and dissolution.

<title>Collagen Fibril Exposure to CLX</title>
<p>Chlorhexidine was diluted in sterile reverse osmosis water (18.2 mΩ) from a 20% commercially available CLX solution (Dexidin 20, Laboratoire Atlas, Montreal, Canada). Reverse osmosis water without CLX was used as a control. The newly formed collagen fibrils prepared as described above were incubated with 50 µL of CLX at various concentrations (0%, 0.5%, 2%, and 4%) and for different incubation times (10, 20, and 40 minutes). After the incubation period, CLX was removed, and the fibrils were collected by centrifugation. A second set of collagen fibrils was prepared as described above and exposed to 50 µL of 0%, 2%, or 4% CLX for 20 minutes. After exposure, both pellets and supernatants were analyzed by gel electrophoresis as described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546512443808">
<title>Gel Electrophoresis</title>
<p>Dissolved collagen present in the supernatants was precipitated by the addition of 95% ethanol (1:9 vol:vol) at 4°C overnight and recovered by centrifugation. Protein pellets were washed twice in 75% ethanol, lyophilized, mixed with SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer, and boiled for 5 minutes. Collagen fibril pellets were directly resuspended in SDS/PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 minutes. The samples were separated by SDS/PAGE (8% NOVEX gels, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) under reducing conditions, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc, Hercules, California). The amount of collagen in both supernatants and pellets was measured by assessing the number of pixels in bands visualized using a Syngene gel imaging system (Cambridge, United Kingdom).</p>

<p>Bovine hoofs from skeletally mature animals, aged 2 years, were obtained from a local abattoir within 6 hours of death.

The deep digital flexor tendon was dissected by cutting and separating the tendon from the third phalanx. The upper part of the tendon was already freed during dismembering of the knee joint. The thin tendon sheath was dissected and removed. The tendon was cut at its junction and divided into 2 segments. One of the segments from each hoof was taken as a control and the other for experimentation (2% CLX exposure) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512443808">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Cytotoxic Effect of CLX Disinfection</title>
<p>Chlorhexidine is known to be cytotoxic to cultured monolayer cells, but it is not known if it can penetrate an intact tendon graft and affect cells inside the tissue after CLX decontamination. To determine the effect of CLX on cell viability, tendon grafts were treated with 2% CLX for 10 minutes, washed in PBS, and then maintained in explant culture for 48 hours. The medium in control wells changed color with time, indicating the presence of viable metabolizing cells. In contrast, tendon pieces exposed to 2% CLX showed reduced medium color change, suggesting compromised cell viability. Analysis of the tendon sections using the Alamar Blue assay (Invitrogen) showed that the metabolic activity of the cells in the control samples was 5 times higher than that of cells in the treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0363546512443808">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting loss of viable cells in the tendon pieces disinfected with 2% CLX.

<p>It is known that 2% and 4% CLX are efficacious in sterilizing contaminated tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512443808">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512443808">13</xref></sup> However, it is not known what is the biological and biochemical effect of CLX on tendons. This study shows that CLX is cytotoxic to fibroblasts at a lower concentration (2%) and dissolves collagen fibrils at a higher concentration (4%).</p>
<p>The management of inadvertent intraoperative contamination of an ACL graft during ACL reconstruction poses a challenging dilemma to the orthopaedic surgeon, and insufficient data are available in the literature to support the most appropriate cleansing methods. The most commonly reported mechanism of contamination is accidentally dropping the tendon graft onto the floor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512443808">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512443808">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512443808">29</xref></sup> Studies have reported positive culture rates of 58% to 60% when the graft was dropped in the operating room.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512443808">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512443808">29</xref></sup> If the graft is dropped, several possible options are available for salvage: disinfecting the graft, using an alternative graft (autograft or allograft), or stopping the procedure and completing the surgery at another time with a different graft. Cleansing the graft avoids further morbidity to the patient or the cost of an allograft but has the potential risk of joint sepsis. A previously reported survey of sports medicine specialists (196 surgeons) revealed that 25% of surgeons have had at least one such incident of graft dropping.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512443808">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, most of those surgeons (75%) chose cleansing the graft to manage the problem of a dropped graft, and chlorhexidine gluconate (CLX) was the antiseptic agent most commonly used. However, no consensus on the CLX concentration or the method and time of decontamination protocols has been achieved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512443808">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>If the graft cleansing option is chosen, the operative team must weigh the risk of an infectious complication after reimplantation against that of discarding a potentially contaminated tendon graft. A contaminated graft implanted in the knee could be a risk factor for septic arthritis, which is a rare but devastating complication after ACL reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512443808">25</xref></sup> Such concerns necessitate further investigation into the optimal cleansing protocol to avoid infection and disinfect the graft without affecting its biochemical or biomechanical properties.</p>
<p>Chlorhexidine is a cationic bisbiguanide with excellent antimicrobial action that is widely used for topical preoperative skin disinfection, general skin cleansing, and as a surgical hand scrub.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512443808">18</xref></sup> It is active against a wide range of microorganisms, being bacteriostatic at low concentrations and bactericidal at higher concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512443808">28</xref></sup> Chlorhexidine is also fungicidal but does not destroy bacterial spores or mycobacterial species,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512443808">35</xref></sup> and it shows activity against enveloped viruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512443808">22</xref></sup> Its mechanism of action involves membrane disruption and not ATPase inactivation as previously thought.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512443808">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because the reported literature about the disinfectant ability of CLX has variability in the time and concentration when used for tendon graft decontamination,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512443808">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512443808">13</xref></sup> varying concentrations and incubation times were used in this study. Our results showed that CLX at concentrations of 0.5% and 2% did not adversely affect the integrity of self-assembled collagen fibrils regardless of incubation time. No free chains were found in the supernatant as 2% CLX at this concentration does not solubilize the newly formed fibrils. This indicates that the collagen molecules remain intact as insoluble fibers in the pellet.</p>
<p>Therefore, irrigating the tendon with 0.5% or 2% CLX is unlikely to adversely affect its biomechanical properties. This finding is consistent with the results of the study by Han et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512443808">16</xref></sup> which reported that disinfecting tendons with 2% CLX power irrigation did not adversely weaken the tensile mechanical properties of the tendon. Our experiments showed that 4% CLX has the ability to dissociate newly formed collagen that is not yet cross-linked. It might thereby impair deposition of newly synthesized collagen essential for graft integration. Although the biomechanical and the in vivo biochemical effects of 4% CLX on mature cross-linked collagen that is already deposited in the tendons are still unknown, we think that the ability of 4% CLX to dissociate collagen fibrils might adversely affect the biomechanical graft tendon properties. Therefore, 4% CLX should not be used for graft cleansing.</p>
<p>Regardless of what type of tendon autograft is used (bone-tendon-bone [BTB] or bone free), viable tendon fibroblasts play an important role in early graft incorporation. Histological analysis of fibroblasts after ACL reconstruction with a BTB autograft in a human model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512443808">34</xref></sup> and with a soft tissue (bone-free) autograft in a dog model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512443808">33</xref></sup> showed that the fibroblasts play an important role in autograft incorporation (ligamentization) after reconstruction.</p>
<p>The abundance of viable fibroblasts may explain why graft incorporation is faster with autografts as compared with allografts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512443808">20</xref></sup> Recently, Scheffler et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546512443808">36</xref></sup> demonstrated significantly lower overall cellularity in ovine allograft recipients versus autograft recipients at 6 weeks. The present work demonstrates that 2% CLX can have a detrimental effect on cell viability. Thus, for tendon autografts, using CLX for disinfection may have adverse affects on graft incorporation into the bone after surgery because of the loss of viable fibroblasts, which would make the tendon autograft behave biologically like an allograft in which fibroblasts are killed during the sterilization process. Despite the lack of scientific evidence, some orthopaedic surgeons prefer to go slowly and with longer rehabilitation and more delay to return to sport with allografts compared with autografts. We think any autograft treated with CLX may considered as an allograft as regards biological incorporation to the bone; therefore, postoperative rehabilitation may need to have a longer duration and be less intense with possibly more delay to return to sport.</p>
<p>The important question of whether CLX has the ability to penetrate deep into the tendon or whether its cytotoxic effects are limited to the exposed surface of the tendon has also been addressed in this study. Despite washing the tendon after being treated with CLX, 2% CLX was not only cytotoxic to tendon fibroblasts close to cut surfaces but also was able to penetrate and kill cells throughout the tissue. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect of CLX was observed even with minimal contact time (10 minutes).</p>
<p>Both power irrigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512443808">4</xref></sup> and soaking of tendons in CLX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512443808">13</xref></sup> have been described as effective methods of tendon decontamination. In this study, we used the soaking method because we think it has better control in the amount and time of CLX exposure; however, we believe the cytotoxic effect of CLX can be seen in both methods.</p>
<p>Several studies have shown that CLX has toxic effects on a variety of eukaryotic cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512443808">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512443808">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512443808">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512443808">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512443808">21</xref></sup> Various reports have also indicated that CLX negatively affects cell proliferation. An in vitro study evaluating the mechanisms underlying CLX-induced toxicity on human dermal fibroblasts showed that CLX exerted an inhibitory concentration-dependent effect on DNA synthesis at concentrations as low as 0.0001% and that CLX concentrations of 0.005% or more were required for total cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512443808">18</xref></sup> Lucarotti et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512443808">23</xref></sup> observed 95% cytotoxicity when human fibroblasts were exposed to 0.0001% CLX for 24 hours. Cytotoxicity after 1, 24, and 72 hours in human gingival fibroblasts was also reported by Babich et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512443808">2</xref></sup> Mariotti and Rumpf<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512443808">24</xref></sup> suggest that CLX exposure for short periods of time (1, 5, and 15 minutes) induces a dose-dependent reduction in cellular proliferation. Giannelli et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512443808">12</xref></sup> investigated the in vitro effect of CLX on osteoblast, endothelial, and fibroblast cells and found that CLX affected cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner, particularly in osteoblasts. A deleterious effect of CLX on articular cartilage has also been reported previously. Several case reports have shown that exposure of human articular cartilage to CLX for prolonged periods (such as during arthroscopic surgery), at low (0.02%) as well as high concentrations, results in severe chondrolysis and subsequent joint damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512443808">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512443808">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546512443808">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast, other studies have shown that CLX in the appropriate concentrations has no negative effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512443808">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512443808">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512443808">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512443808">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512443808">28</xref></sup> At 0.05% concentration, CLX demonstrated no adverse effects on wound healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512443808">31</xref></sup> The same concentration has also been used to treat a variety of bone and prosthetic infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512443808">11</xref></sup> and has been reported to give good results when used for treating septic arthritis in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512443808">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study did not set out to test different concentrations of CLX for its disinfectant ability, that already has been previously published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512443808">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512443808">13</xref></sup> Burd et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512443808">4</xref></sup> evaluated varying concentrations of CLX to determine the lowest effective concentration of solution that was able to completely decontaminate a tendon graft. They tested concentrations of 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 4%. Only the 2% and 4% solutions demonstrated no bacterial growth. All the lower concentrations could not effectively decontaminate the grafts. The authors also showed that there was no difference in results in using either the 2% or 4% solutions. Given these findings, using a concentration lower than 2% CLX would not be clinically relevant in the setting of accidentally dropping an ACL graft and attempting to decontaminate it with a cleansing solution. With this knowledge, the next question that needed to be addressed was the one studied in our current study. Does the bacteriologically effective solution (2% and 4% CLX) adversely affect the grafts from a biochemical point of view?</p>
<p>Our study, therefore, only sought to determine the detrimental effects of exposure to 2% and 4% CLX, as the lower concentrations would be clinically irrelevant from a bacteriological point of view. We did, however, expose collagen in our study to 0.5% CLX and found no effect on the collagen. The 2% solution was found to be cytotoxic to the fibroblasts, but given the lack of clinical relevance to any concentration below 2%, we found it unnecessary to continue to test the lower concentration solutions. Therefore, our study did not attempt to define the lowest CLX concentration at which cell viability can be maintained.</p>
<p>While most previous reports of toxicity and complications involved direct lavage with CLX,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512443808">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512443808">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546512443808">38</xref></sup> implantation of a CLX-treated tendon graft during ACL reconstruction may potentially have a deleterious side effect when it comes in direct contact with bone cells on the ACL bony tunnels or chondrocytes of the intra-articular cartilage. Despite the lack of supporting evidence, we think that grafts that undergo CLX disinfection may be better if carefully rinsed with a copious amount of normal saline for a sufficient time before implantation into a joint. A continuous, arthroscopic, normal saline irrigation after graft implementation may be considered a good way to achieve this rinsing.</p>
<p>In conclusion, using 4% CLX can result in marked fibril dissolution and decreased cell viability and metabolic activity and, therefore, definitively should be avoided for use as a disinfectant. Two-percent CLX disinfection of tendon grafts, however, is an effective way to sterilize contaminated grafts while preserving collagen fibril integrity and biomechanical properties. It does, however, render the autograft to acellular tissue through its effect on fibroblast viability. Future studies will involve determining the effects of CLX on autograft incorporation and evaluating the toxicity effects of CLX on bone and cartilage.</p>
