<abstract>
<p>Late-life depression is prevalent in home care. This pilot study, part of a statewide initiative to enhance depression care, evaluated the influence of a 2-hour depression screening and intervention workshop on home care professionals’ knowledge, self-efficacy, and attitudes related to depression in older home care patients. A pretest, posttest design was used to evaluate the effects of the workshop with 280 home care professionals from 7 home care agencies. Following the depression workshop, participants’ knowledge levels in evidence-based screening and care for depressed older adults was significantly increased, <italic>t</italic>(280) = 16.49, p&lt;.001. A significant increase in confidence and attitude ratings were found (p&lt;.001). Findings from this pilot study support broader dissemination throughout Connecticut home care agencies.</p>

<p>Depression among older adults is associated with reduced quality of life, increased health care costs, greater functional impairment, and increased risk of suicide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084822312465747">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312465747"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822312465747">3</xref></sup> Compared with younger adults with depression, older adults are more likely to have longer and more frequent episodes of depression as well as more medical comorbidities that may influence the course and outcomes of care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1084822312465747">4</xref></sup> National data indicate that although depression is widespread in late life, it is often underrecognized and undertreated. According to the National Institutes of Mental Health, there are currently, about 6 million Americans 65 and older dealing with depression, but only 10% are being treated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312465747">5</xref></sup> The purpose of this study was to pilot test a statewide initiative to enhance depression management in home health care.</p>
<p>With depression rates at almost 15% among older home care patients, home care, along with nursing homes, has among the highest rates of any health care setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084822312465747">6</xref></sup> Consequently, effective evidence-based assessment and care of depressed older adults is an important priority for home care agencies.</p>
<p>In response to the magnitude of depression and its impact on poor health-related outcomes in older home care patients, the Connecticut Association of Home Care and Hospice (CAHCH) launched a 3-phase initiative to enhance depression care among older adults. Phase 1 of the initiative, beginning in October 2009 through June 2010, focused on developing a train the trainer model as a strategy to centrally train 25 home care professionals representing 14 home care agencies in the state in preparation for larger dissemination. Several evaluation measures, including an appraisal of the self-reported attitudes and self-efficacy of home care professionals toward depressed older adults, a pre/posttest to assess the trainers’ knowledge, and willingness of trainers to implement the education program at their agencies were used to assess program outcomes. Participants’ self-efficacy levels in screening and caring for depressed older adults was significantly increased following the education program compared to immediately before the education program, <italic>t</italic>(24) = −4.204; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). A description of Phase 1 program design and training outcomes that supported progression to Phase 2 has been previously published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312465747">7</xref></sup> This article reports on Phase 2 of the initiative involving pilot testing of the depression workshop with 280 home care professionals from seven home care agencies in Connecticut, with trainers from Phase I leading the depression workshop within their agencies.</p>
<sec id="section1-1084822312465747">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Given the growing body of evidence linking depression to other clinical and adverse outcomes, geriatric depression has gained increased attention in home care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822312465747">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1084822312465747">9</xref></sup> To encourage home care agencies to screen for depression and implement interventions when detected, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) now requires that home care agencies document depression screening on item M 1730 on the OASIS-C at start of care and recertification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822312465747">10</xref></sup> Data item M1730 asks whether the home care patient has been screened for depression using a standardized screening tool and allows the clinician to respond in one of the following four ways: (0) No screening was conducted. (1) Yes, the PHQ-2 Pfizer scale was used, (2) Yes, another standardized assessment was used, and there is need for further evaluation., or (3) Yes, another standardized tool was used, and there is no need for further evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1084822312465747">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Though CMS has not mandated that any particular tool be used, and home health agencies can decide which tool they prefer; Pfizer’s PHQ-2 scale is suggested and is included on OASIS-C. The PHQ-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1084822312465747">12</xref></sup> depression screening consists of 2 questions, which ask “Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems: (1) Little interest or pleasure in doing things; (2) Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.” If the patient scores ≥3 on the PHQ-2, it is recommended by CMS 10 and current research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1084822312465747">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1084822312465747">14</xref></sup> that the home health care professional then continue with the PHQ-9 and ask the full 9 depression screening questions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1084822312465747">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Depression is a major risk factor for hospitalization for home health care patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1084822312465747">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1084822312465747">17</xref></sup> An analysis of 374,123 Medicare beneficiaries receiving home care services revealed that the presence of depressive symptoms upon admission to home care was associated with a 20% increase in hospitalization, independent of other factors such as diagnosis and functional ability. The authors suggest that efforts by home health care service providers to reduce hospitalizations of Medicare patients might benefit from having greater access to well-trained clinical specialists such as advanced practice nurses and consultant physicians in geriatric mental health/geropsychiatry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1084822312465747">16</xref></sup> These findings underscore the need for evidence-based education regarding depression screening and interventions for home care professionals.</p>
<p>Though depression is recognized as a key assessment area, few statewide initiatives within or outside of home care have been undertaken to disseminate education regarding best practices in depression screening and interventions. However, a few researchers have developed depression protocols for widespread dissemination and conducted multisite studies.</p>
<p>In New York State, Bruce et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1084822312465747">17</xref></sup> developed the TRIAD (Training in the Assessment of Depression) program which was tested at three home health care agencies in Westchester County New York. The intervention was conducted with 17 home care nurses randomly assigned as TRIAD participants. The TRIAD program was developed to improve nurses’ use of the OASIS-B depression item M0590 and M0600s, giving them a list of questions that nurses can ask to determine whether patients had clinically significant depressive symptoms along with action plans for those patients that require further depression intervention. The nurse training intervention consists of 2 sessions equaling about 4.5 hours of one-on-one training with a trainer. The training consists of observation of a trainer interviewing a patient asking questions about depression symptoms and then the nurse is given an opportunity to practice interviewing patients with observation by the trainer. In addition, training included viewing the TRIAD video vignettes along with a Powerpoint and other hands on material. Evaluation was done at baseline, and at 1 year posttraining. The results of 1 year after the training resulted in <italic>n</italic> = 15 responses, with a significant increase in confidence posttraining (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The randomized trial documented that patients with clinically significant depressive symptoms were more likely to be identified and referred for further evaluation under the care of intervention versus control nurses. Since this trial of TRIAD, the program has been distributed to 17 home care agencies in 9 states. The TRIAD video was used as a part of our depression workshop.</p>
<p>Also in New York, Bruce et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1084822312465747">18</xref></sup> developed a protocol for home care professionals to manage depression in their patients. This protocol is called Depression Care for Patients at Home (Depression CAREPATH). The CAREPATH interventions were developed specifically for nurses, speech pathologists, occupational and physical therapists to deliver to their home health care patients. The Depression CAREPATH includes two clinical protocols that home health professionals establish as part of their routine care of the home health care patient. Protocol 1 comprises a Depression Screening Protocol where the professional using the PHQ-2conducts an assessment of the two questions/cardinal symptoms of depression (depressed mood and anhedonia). If the patient scores 0 to 2 on the PHQ-2 questions, the professional is to repeat the assessment in two weeks’ time. If the score to the PHQ-2 questions is ≥3, the professional conducts the full PHQ-9 questionnaire. This leads to the second protocol of the Depression CAREPATH, The Home Care Depression Care Management (DCM) Protocol. The DCM is managed by the home care professional who is giving care at the patient’s home. After depressive symptoms are identified, the professional administers the PHQ-9 on a weekly basis to track depressive symptomology over time and to apprise the Attending Physician /APRN for any change in the plan of care for the home health care patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1084822312465747">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bruce and colleagues are completing a multisite randomized trial of the Depression CAREPATH, conducted with seven agencies located in different regions of the country. The trial determines whether with the Depression CAREPATH results in patients being more likely to receive changes in depression treatment consistent clinical guidelines and to experience a reduction in depressive symptoms based on clinical research assessments of patient over time. Based on evidence of effectiveness, the group has developed long-distance strategies to support agencies in their implementation of the Depression CAREPATH. They are testing the impact of the implementation strategy in a randomized trial of 120 home care agencies examining patient care and clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>One statewide initiative to enhance depression care was conducted in Iowa. The program, entitled <italic>Depression Training to Promote Nurses as Advocates for Older Adults</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1084822312465747">4</xref></sup> is a CD-based educational product that incorporated the collaborative care principles of the Improving Mood—Providing Access to Collaborative Treatment (IMPACT) model of care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1084822312465747">20</xref></sup> The four-part training program consisted of (1) understanding depression in late life, (2) assessing depression, (3) depression care for older adults, and (4) collaborating to promote positive outcomes.</p>
<p>The training materials were mailed to 513 health care providers in Iowa. The researchers allowed a 3-month period for completion of the program, and mailing back of the paper and pencil questionnaire. Within the 3-month period, 250 questionnaires were returned, equaling a 49% response. Of the 250 respondents, 235 self-reported that they were nurses (RN-ADN, LPN, BSN, and Diploma). The respondents worked in a variety of health care settings including hospitals, community and home health care, nursing homes, assisted living, and area agencies on aging. The open-ended question asking how participants’ nursing care changed after the training included encouraging/offering more pleasant activities; listening more closely to patients when they express sadness/concern; use of the PHQ-9, with proper documentation and notification of the MD; more easily open up discussion about depression with patients; making referrals for evaluation and treatment; and more comfortable/knowledgeable about antidepressive medications/treatments.</p>
<p>In summary, statewide efforts to improve depression screening and care are lacking in the literature. Our study attempts to help fill this gap in the literature by piloting a depression screening and intervention workshop in seven home care agencies in Connecticut who are part of 66 member agencies in the CAHCH. A secondary objective is to use the findings from this study in preparation for widespread dissemination throughout CAHCH member agencies.</p>

<title>Conceptual Model</title>
<p>Train-the-trainer models have been used successfully in providing education to health care providers on a variety of clinical topics including mental health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1084822312465747">21</xref></sup> A train-the-trainer model was considered to be a strong option for providing depression education in the current project to reach a large number of home care professionals throughout the state. We used a 7-step train the trainer model to guide the study. Steps 1 to 3: (1) formation of a CACH depression subcommittee to address geriatric depression in home care, (2) develop and implement a depression screening and intervention workshop for trainers, and (3) develop local expertise in evidence-based depression care were completed in Phase 1.</p>
<p>Phase 2 of the study focused on the following final 4 steps:</p>
<sec id="section3-1084822312465747">
<title>Provide Training Package and Standard Curriculum for Trainers</title>
<p>A training package was prepared for each trainer to facilitate their education program within their agencies and provide a standardized curriculum. The package included background information, PowerPoint, link to web-based training video, list of pleasant events adapted for home care by the CAHCH depression committee,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1084822312465747">22</xref></sup> and additional materials for trainers to use in conducting educational programs. In addition, fidelity forms were given to each trainer for completion following the training to assess whether the workshop was delivered as intended and was consistently implemented across agencies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1084822312465747">
<title>Trainers Conduct Training Program at Their Home Care Agencies</title>
<p>Ongoing support was provided by the CAHCH depression committee throughout the training sessions at the individual home care agencies. Prior to conducting the training, trainers were contacted by one of the members of the CAHCH depression committee to review materials and answer any questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1084822312465747">
<title>Increase Knowledge of Evidence-Based Depression Management of Older Adults, Increase Confidence</title>
<p>The project’s purpose was to offer training that would increase knowledge and confidence and change attitudes related to caring for older adults with depression. Pre- and postworkshop surveys were used to evaluate the influence of the workshop. A member of the CAHCH depression committee was present at each workshop to collect pre- and postworkshop data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1084822312465747">
<title>Improve Care of Home Care Patients With Depression</title>
<p>The ultimate goal of the workshop was to improve health-related outcomes among older adults by increasing depression screening and facilitating evidence-based care by home care professionals. As a first step in evaluating the impact of the workshop on clinical practice, we conducted follow-up interviews with home care agencies 12 months following the workshop.</p>

<title>Depression Screening and Intervention Workshop</title>
<p>A training packet on late-life depression screening and interventions was developed specifically for this study by the CAHCH depression committee based on national nursing practice guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1084822312465747">23</xref></sup> and evidence-based assessment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1084822312465747">17</xref></sup> nonpharmacological<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1084822312465747">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1084822312465747"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1084822312465747"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1084822312465747">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1084822312465747">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1084822312465747">25</xref></sup> and pharmacological<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1084822312465747">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1084822312465747">26</xref></sup> protocols used effectively in other studies. The standardized curriculum was similar to the Phase 1 curriculum developed for trainers. The workshop content has been described in detail in a previous issue of <italic>Home Health Care Management and Practice</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312465747">7</xref></sup> The Phase 1 curriculum designed for the faculty trainers was 4 hours and included more in-depth content about depression to facilitate expertise, while the Phase 2 curriculum for home care professionals to be trained by faculty trainers focused on the needs of practicing clinicians and adapted to meet the time constraints within the home care agencies</p>
<p>The 2-hour workshop content was organized under five main sections:</p>
<list id="list1-1084822312465747" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Background and depression statistics and outcomes;</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Pharmacological management;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interactive case studies.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Each section followed a similar format consisting of a didactic component, video clips and time for question and answers. Workshops also included interactive discussion of case studies with practice sessions to provide participants an opportunity to play the role of both clinician and patient in depression screening. Trainers were encouraged to use at least one or two case studies for discussion when they presented the curriculum.</p>

<sec id="section9-1084822312465747">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>A pretest, posttest design was used to evaluate the effects of the depression screening and intervention workshop. This study examined the following research questions:</p>
<list id="list2-1084822312465747" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: What is the influence of the depression training workshop on home care professionals’ knowledge, self-efficacy, and attitudes related to depression screening and interventions for older adults?</p></list-item>

</sec>
<sec id="section10-1084822312465747">
<title>Sample and Setting</title>
<p>Eligibility criteria for this study were (1) home care professionals currently employed at the participating home care agencies, (2) agency trainer willing to conduct the workshop, and (3) willingness of home care professionals to participate. A total of 280 home care professionals from seven Medicare-certified home care agencies in Connecticut participated in the study. Of the 12 eligible home care agencies who participated in Phase I, 10 agencies agreed to continue into Phase 2. However, during the 8-month implementation period, three of the agencies that had initially agreed to participate withdrew due to insufficient resources, lack of time, and change in employment of their agency trainer. All participating agencies had previously sent a representative to the train-the-trainer program in Phase 1 of the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1084822312465747">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>A 28-item survey instrument was developed by the CAHCH older adult depression subcommittee team. Domains in this instrument consisted of knowledge about evidence-based depression management; self-perceived attitudes about and confidence in treating depressed older adults; and demographic characteristics. Items on the survey were a combination of questions used in previous studies with demonstrated reliability and validity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1084822312465747">27</xref></sup> practice questions from the training video used in the study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1084822312465747">28</xref></sup> and questions developed by the subcommittee. Face and content validity of the adapted survey was established by consensus of the depression subcommittee and study consultant, Dr. Bruce, all of whom have expertise in geriatric mental health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1084822312465747">
<title>Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>Approval to conduct this study was granted from the University of Connecticut IRB. Written permission letters were obtained from the directors of the home care agencies to collect data from home care professionals employed in these settings. The survey instrument was accompanied by an information sheet, which explained that the survey was anonymous and participation was voluntary. Consent of the home care professionals was assumed by the return of a completed survey instrument.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1084822312465747">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>Data collection occurred over an 8-month period, from September 2010 to May 2011. Data were entered and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 18 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL). For Research Question 1, paired sample <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted with each of the dependant variables before and after the intervention to assess for treatment effects. <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant. For Research Question 2, data from the open-ended question were analyzed using the method of content analysis by Krippendorff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1084822312465747">29</xref></sup> Comments were coded into mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories. Categories with similar content were clustered to allow for the identification of central themes and the frequency of their occurrence. A graduate student and one of the report authors (CD) independently coded half of the 280 home care professionals’ survey comments. A sample of 50 surveys was then selected at random to be coded by both researchers, with an interrater agreement of 92%. For Research Question 3, data from the follow-up interview with home care administrators from the seven home care agencies were also analyzed using Kripendorff’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1084822312465747">29</xref></sup> method. Data were collected and initially analyzed and coded by two members of the research team and later coded by a third member with an interrater agreement of 100%. Fidelity was also evaluated to assess the feasibility of the intervention and consistency of delivery across intervention sites.</p>

<title>Clinical Impact Within Home Care Agencies</title>
<p>Research Question 3 examined the influence of the depression workshop on clinical practice. A 12-month follow-up interview was used to evaluate the long-term impact of the workshop with the trainers who presented the workshop. The single, open-ended question, “Has the training had an impact on practice within your agency?” was asked of all study trainers. Subsequent discussion was particular to the agency being interviewed and was reported, with common themes noted in the interviews. All agencies polled responded that staff implemented training within their agency.</p>
<p>All interviewees stated that the training on the staff had an impact. While no specific patient outcome data were reported, the majority of respondents indicated that compliance with accurate completion of Oasis C question M1730, “Has the patient been screened for depression using a standardized depression screening tool?” had improved. Additionally, it was noted that there had been an increase in overall ICD-9 coding of depression as well as an increase in the frequency of identification of a diagnosis for depression when antidepressant medications were prescribed.</p>
<p>All interviewees also indicated there had been a noticeable increase in the number and frequency of referral by nursing and rehabilitation therapy staff to the agency’s social workers or behavioral health staff for further depression screening. One agency representative shared that the agency had implemented the use of the 2-hour training for depression screening and intervention into the clinical orientation for newly hired staff (nursing, PT,s and social work).</p>
<p>All interviewees further indicated that training in the standardized use of the PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 tools led to increased awareness, screening, and detection of depression among the elderly population served by the respective agency. A notable increase in the reporting of depression through ICD-9 diagnosis code sets was reported in the interviews, which may present an opportunity for future research. A consistent response on interview was that therapy staff were now screening for depression when prior to training they were not.</p>
<p>One respondent indicated that prior to the training the perception had existed in their agency that depression occurred more frequently in the younger population, hence the suicide risk was perceived as higher among the younger population. Following the training, there was an awareness of the greater suicide risk among the elderly.</p>

<title>Fidelity</title>
<p>To assess whether the workshop was presented as outlined by the CAHCH training package across the seven home care agencies participating in the study and evaluate the feasibility of implementing the workshop throughout the state, fidelity was examined. The workshop implementation and feasibility were evaluated following a framework developed by the Treatment Fidelity Workgroup of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Behavioral Change Consortium to enhance reliability and validity of behavioral interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1084822312465747">30</xref></sup> According to this model, fidelity can be evaluated by delivery, receipt, and enactment of the intervention. Delivery refers to the treatment or intervention that was presented and requires a comparison of the actual versus intended treatment, including any alterations. Receipt refers to the accuracy of the participant’s perception of the intervention, or the degree to which the treatment was received. Enactment refers to the extent to which the participant uses the skills and knowledge conveyed in the intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1084822312465747">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Each trainer completed a fidelity form following their workshop. Overall, the workshop was presented as intended. Trainers used a written intervention manual with standardized guidelines as well as all materials necessary to conduct their workshop. All trainers presented the didactic portion of the standard curriculum as written and the video clips as scheduled. The interactive case study component of the training varied across agencies. Four of the seven trainers did not include the interactive case studies in the workshops due to time constraints.</p>
<p>In this study, receipt was examined by assessing home care professionals knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy following the workshop. Enactment was assessed at two time points: first, immediately following the workshop with an open-ended question on the survey regarding what was the most important thing learned from the training; and, second, several months later with a follow-up interview with trainers to evaluate the long-term influence of the training.</p>

<sec id="section20-1084822312465747" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Pilot testing of the depression screening and intervention workshop, using a Train-the-Trainer model, was an important foundational step in preparing for statewide dissemination of the training throughout CAHCH member home care agencies. Findings from our pilot study provide initial evidence of the effectiveness and feasibility of the workshop. The evaluation data indicate that the majority of home care professionals experienced positive outcomes associated with participation in the depression screening and interventions for older adults workshop. Knowledge and self-efficacy of participants were significantly improved following the training workshop and overall attitudes were more positive. Comments on the posttraining survey reflected home care professionals’ sense of empowerment related to recognizing depression in older home care patients, providing evidence-based interventions and procedures for referral to positively influence patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Feedback on the long-term influence of the workshop within participant agencies revealed that the depression workshop had an important influence on home care professionals in relation to depression screening and interventions. As a result of the training, home care professionals demonstrated a higher compliance with coding depression, described a higher awareness of depression in the elderly, and made more referrals.</p>
<p>Results from this pilot study provide evidence that a depression screening and intervention workshop implemented by trainers home care intervention is highly feasible. Trainers were able to effectively present the training within the everyday working conditions of their agencies. One recommendation for Phase 3 of the training is to extend the workshop for an additional 20 minutes to ensure there is adequate time for home care professionals to apply their new knowledge in the interactive case studies.</p>
<p>The findings of this study support progression to Phase 3. Phase 3 will involve implementing further train-the-trainer sessions in an effort to reach as many of the 59 remaining CAHCH agencies as possible. Our goal is to have at least 50% of CAHCH member agencies participate in the training.</p>
<p>Depression continues to be an important issue among Connecticut home care agencies. A 2012 needs assessment of CAHCH member agencies revealed that programs on depression were ranked among the top five requested programs and 79% of respondents’ selected depression for future education focus. As one original participant in the initial Train the Trainer program stated, “having increased awareness we’re now ready to dig deeper and fine tune our practice” Findings from this needs assessment provide further support for the need for evidence-based depression training for home care professionals.</p>
<p>In summary, a 2-hour depression training workshop to enhance depression care in older home care patients was effective in improving home care nurses’, social workers’, and therapy staff’s knowledge, self-efficacy, and attitudes related to late-life depression. Further research is needed to examine if this education program improves quality of care and outcomes for older home care patients with depression.</p>
