<abstract>
<p>Critics have characterized academic research as being of little practical or commercial value. Such criticism of scholarly research, as opposed to applied research, resonates with detractors who do not appreciate the evolving role of business schools in providing foundational research. The authors contend that scholarly research helps develop knowledge in fields such as strategic management, enhances the value of later applied research, and provides content for courses. Not all research is of high quality, however, so the evaluation of research is critical. The authors examine several considerations for evaluation, such as journal rankings, interdisciplinary evaluation, and breadth of approach.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>More than 50 years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1056492611428721">Gordon and Howell (1959)</xref> issued a scathing analysis of business schools, suggesting that business schools provided largely vocational education with little foundation in research. Since that time, business schools have invested significant efforts to improve the amount and quality of the research performed by their faculty. A recent report issued by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) on the impact of research in business schools suggests that considerable progress has been made, but research in universities has nonetheless come under attack in recent years. The primary target of the attacks is the cost of higher education, exemplified by the often significant increases in tuition and fees paid by the students. In particular, the criticisms propose that the increasing cost of higher education is because professors do not teach enough classes/students. These critiques suggest that faculty members are given reduced teaching loads to do research, much of which in their view has little value. In fact, they argue that a good amount of the research is published in obscure journals on topics of trivial value or the research is esoteric and only a small number of people have any interest in it (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056492611428721">Trowbridge, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056492611428721">Vedder, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056492611428721">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>External public policy groups such as the Texas Public Policy Foundation have focused part of their efforts on higher education costs, with particular emphasis on the research and teaching missions of the university. In fact, this group has analyzed the faculty based on the number of students taught, their salaries, teaching dollars for each student provided by the state, and the amount of external research dollars obtained by individual faculty members. They then issued reports declaring that many professors created deficits for the university because they do not teach enough students. As many faculty in business schools and liberal arts have few opportunities to obtain external funding for their research, these faculty received the most criticism. In addition to concerns about cost, such external parties criticize the value of most of the research performed by faculty on the grounds that it has little or no commercial value or value of any kind in their view. They also criticize PhD programs because, as they see it, such programs are designed mainly to facilitate research and require far too many resources.</p>
<p>Since we entered the profession in the mid 1970s, our deans have always encouraged, rewarded, and required us to do research as part of the expectations of our faculty appointments. Furthermore, the emphasis has always been on doing “quality” research (rather loosely defined). So, because our careers—as with many of our colleagues—have been focused on making valuable contributions in research, teaching, and service, these external criticisms have profound meaning to us. They may also have a significant influence on the shape of higher education in the future.</p>
<p>Does the research we have done and are currently doing have little value? Should we only be doing research that can receive external funding or that has commercial value? Should we eliminate PhD programs and focus our teaching efforts, with much higher teaching loads, on undergraduate programs and “lucrative” master’s programs? Answers to these questions are rooted in assessment of the value of the research that has been performed.</p>
<p>Let us consider some of the “best” research from disciplines that often receive little external funding, as judged by others in the form of Nobel prizes. Ronald Coase received a Nobel prize for his early work introducing transaction cost theory. Daniel Kahneman received a Nobel prize for his work with Amos Tversky on prospect theory. Oliver Williamson received a Nobel prize for his work on economic governance, but his ideas about transaction cost economics brought that theory to the forefront in understanding how establishments can organize to promote efficient transactions. Williamson shared the 2009 Nobel prize with Elinor Ostrom, a political scientist. She also received the prize for her contributions to our understanding of economic governance, but her emphasis was on the critical influences of institutional polycentricity (e.g., national, state, and local institutions). We suspect that many ordinary citizens have never heard of these theories, much less understand them. Is the notion of institutional polycentricity esoteric? Perhaps even a few business executives and politicians might think so. So, should this research not have been conducted? Instead, should these scholars have spent much more of their time in the classroom instead of developing these ideas? We think not. In the social sciences, this work represents basic research on which other and even applied research can be and is based.</p>
<p>The highly cited work of Jay Barney explaining the resource-based view of the firm (RBV) in ways that made it clear and usable to many scholars in the field of management was not published in the very top scholarly journals in the field. In fact, his original article was rejected by the “elite” journals and was eventually published in the respected <italic>Journal of Management</italic>. Since this article was published in 1991, it has been cited thousands of times by people in management and adjacent social science fields. In addition, it serves as primary content for textbooks, applied research and publications, and in the development and delivery of management development programs. What would have the trade-offs been if Barney had to teach many more courses/classes/students and was thus unable to complete and publish this “game-changing” research?</p>
<p>Is research that has no direct commercial value and no external funding of little value, then? How much of the social scientists’ frame-breaking research, for which they received the Nobel prize many years later, had external funding for the development of the original ideas?</p>
<p>We know that basic science knowledge is needed to do applied technology research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056492611428721">Makri, Hitt, &amp; Lane, 2010</xref>). Basic research is also needed in the social sciences as well. One might refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056492611428721">Barney’s (1991)</xref> article and the work preceding it by Birger Wernerfelt and, especially, Edith Penrose (the initiator of the RBV) as basic research. Research, such as that on the RBV and extensions of it, is important because it forms the content for what is taught to students in the classroom and is especially important for the content of textbooks. If we compare textbooks in the area of strategy in the 1970s and today, we would find substantial differences. In the 1970s, such courses were commonly titled “Business Policy”; today, they are usually referred to as “Strategic Management.” Research in the field published in many scholarly journals such as the <italic>Strategic Management Journal</italic> and <italic>Academy of Management Journal</italic> indeed forms the base for much of the material presented in textbooks (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056492611428721">Hitt, Ireland, &amp; Hoskisson, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Of course, research must be evaluated to assess its value (good or bad). Assessing the value of research, particularly early work on a concept (e.g., the RBV), can be challenging. Certainly, the systems used in universities to evaluate research are critically important, especially if we are to support the best work and discourage work with little potential value. Such evaluation systems are also very important if we are to explain and justify the value of research to external stakeholders and especially critics. Thus, we turn next to the evaluation of research productivity.</p>

<sec id="section2-1056492611428721">
<title>Need for Improvement in the Evaluation of Research.</title>
<p>For many reasons (in addition to budgetary and political pressures), there has been increasing emphasis on the evaluation of research in business schools, with much attention focused on journal quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492611428721">Adler &amp; Harzing, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056492611428721">Barnabé, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056492611428721">Cook, Raviv, &amp; Richardson, 2010</xref>). Indeed, the strengths and weaknesses of journal rankings have been discussed at length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492611428721">Adler &amp; Harzing, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056492611428721">Cook et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492611428721">Van Fleet, McWilliams, &amp; Siegel, 2000</xref>). Researchers have identified the benefits, such as for individual career development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492611428721">Van Fleet et al., 2000</xref>), as well as the consequences of placing too much emphasis on journal-quality rankings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492611428721">Adler &amp; Harzing, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056492611428721">Giacalone, 2009</xref>). Although there has been an increasing amount of work devoted to the evaluation of research, we suggest four areas that need further attention: the treatment of emerging areas of research, interdisciplinary evaluation, administrative use of journal lists, and development of broader approaches for evaluating journals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1056492611428721">
<title>Evaluation of Research in Emerging Areas</title>
<p>Current approaches for the evaluation of research provide serious challenges for scholars working in emerging areas of business scholarship. Although research methods typically lag those of more established areas—and there are often justifiable concerns about quality in emerging fields—research in these areas faces unique challenges. The evolution of research in strategic management over the past 30 years provides a parallel example, and the establishment of the <italic>Strategic Management Journal</italic> in 1980 provided a specialized forum for the work of strategy scholars. There was justifiable criticism of early methodologies used in strategic management research, and there was also a need to build a stronger theoretical base. For these reasons, strategic management scholars experienced difficulties publishing their work in the top scholarly journals at the time.</p>
<p>A similar pattern is evident in the emergence of academic research in entrepreneurship in which data availability is an ongoing problem. Scholars making the choice to conduct research in entrepreneurship experience risks of not being able to publish it (e.g., dismissed because of assumed poor quality) in premier journals. These issues are currently the subject of ongoing debate in management departments and business schools. In some departments, the debate has been avoided by having entrepreneurship courses, for which there is substantial student demand, taught by clinical or adjunct faculty for whom there are no research expectations. But in so doing, we risk not developing emerging areas and thus losing opportunities. Researchers have also called attention to the potential for irrelevance that may result from an extreme focus on a small set of premier journals, from which journals focused on emerging areas are typically excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492611428721">Adler &amp; Harzing, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492611428721">Jain &amp; Golosinski, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1056492611428721">
<title>Difficulties of Interdisciplinary Evaluation and Comparison</title>
<p>It is not uncommon for faculty in one business discipline to perceive that publishing in another discipline is noticeably easier or that there are quality control issues in some disciplines. Nonetheless, most research on evaluation to this point has been focused within individual business disciplines rather than across disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056492611428721">Swanson, Wolfe, &amp; Zardkoohi, 2007</xref>). However, there have been a few studies of interdisciplinary differences in the evaluation of research that attempt to provide evidence about the validity of such perceptions. For example, one of a few inquiries into interdisciplinary differences in publication concluded the following: “The model predicts that interdisciplinary differences exist in quality norms, which could result in disparity among business disciplines in the number of top-tier articles published” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056492611428721">Swanson, 2004</xref>, p. 223).</p>
<p>Indeed, there are important differences in research and publication practices across business disciplines of which evaluators of research should be aware. Manuscript flows to the top journals also provide an example of such differences. In 2010, the five accounting journals on the <italic>Financial Times</italic> list of top business journals, the <italic>Accounting Review; Journal of Accounting and Economics; Accounting, Organizations, and Society; Journal of Accounting Research;</italic> and <italic>Contemporary Accounting Research</italic>, received an average of 330 new manuscripts. In contrast, although the <italic>Financial Times</italic> includes several management journals, there are five on which there is often consensus agreement as to premier status: <italic>Academy of Management Journal, Academy of Management Review, Administrative Science Quarterly, Journal of Applied Psy-chology</italic>, and <italic>Strategic Management Journal</italic>. These five journals received an average of 806 new manuscripts in 2010. In addition, there are differences in the level of international competition for journal space. For example, in 2010, 18.6% of the authors who published in the <italic>Journal of Accounting Research</italic> were from outside the United States, whereas in the <italic>Academy of Management Journal</italic>, 31.9% were from outside the United States. This difference is also consistent with an analysis of the composition of editorial boards, with the boards of the <italic>Financial Times</italic>’ top accounting journals more heavily dominated by scholars from the United States than the boards of the other <italic>Financial Times</italic> journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056492611428721">Burgess &amp; Shaw, 2010</xref>)</p>
<p>Moreover, there are substantial differences in the size of some disciplines, which can understate the level of competition for the larger disciplines when faculty members are evaluated on a uniform number of journals across disciplines. For example, survey data from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056492611428721">AACSB (2011)</xref> indicated that there are about 30% fewer marketing faculty than management faculty. Moreover, there are different levels of competition for journal space from outside the business disciplines, which may not be considered in interdisciplinary evaluations of research. For example, researchers from psychology departments often publish in management journals while economists and engineers often publish in operations management and management science journals. Moreover, there are significant differences in the levels of publication and citations across disciplines, with marketing and finance having the highest proportion of faculty publishing in top journals and accounting the lowest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056492611428721">Swanson et al., 2007</xref>). As an example of differences in citations, accounting articles generate far fewer citations relative to those in management. In the <italic>ISI Web of Knowledge</italic> 2010 data, the <italic>Financial Times</italic> top five accounting journals had a total of 13,984 citations whereas the five premier management journals had a total of 60,184. Failures to recognize the legitimacy of such differences may account for invalid attributions such as the following: “Management Professor X’s research must be of low quality because she has twice as many articles as Accounting Professor Y.” or “Accounting Professor Y’s record is undistinguished because he has 50% fewer citations than Finance Professor Z.” Evaluations of research must take such disciplinary differences into considerations to meet basic standards of fairness across the business disciplines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1056492611428721">
<title>Journal Lists and Categories</title>
<p>Journal lists have been the subject of a substantial amount of criticism as well. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492611428721">Adler and Harzing (2009)</xref> concluded that journal ranking systems “are dysfunctional and potentially cause more harm than good” (p. 72). However, there may be need for journal lists to communicate to faculty the quality of journals desired for rewards in their schools. Within disciplines, some faculty may not have a current understanding of the quality of journals beyond the top five (or fewer). More severe limitations exist at the interdisciplinary level, where it has been reported that scholars know only “the top two or three journals in other fields” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056492611428721">Henderson, Ganesh, &amp; Chandy, 1990</xref>, p. 325). Despite the criticisms, journal lists have become more widespread since the years when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492611428721">Van Fleet et al. (2000)</xref> reported that a surprisingly small proportion of schools had such lists (14%). Indeed, lists have been adopted by national associations of business schools, such as the Association of Business Schools in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056492611428721">Harvey, Morris, &amp; Rowlinson, 2010</xref>), and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056492611428721">Australian Business Deans’ Council (2010)</xref>. Thus, journal lists have become a more common attribute of the research landscape and “like them or not, academic ranking systems are a reality, and they are not very likely to go away anytime soon” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056492611428721">Worrell, 2009</xref>, p. 129).</p>
<p>One of the more disconcerting aspects of the use of journal lists deserves further discussion. When departments (or larger entities) adopt journal lists, the journals are usually divided into categories based on various indicators of quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492611428721">Van Fleet et al., 2000</xref>). Some schools use these journal categories as threshold requirements for promotion and tenure, requiring a fixed number of articles in “A” journals. Such distinctions between “A” and “B” journals suggest that journal quality is a discrete rather than a continuous variable and, in some cases, may be based on small differences in indicators of journal quality. When indicators of journal quality, such as impact factors, acceptance rates, and submission flows, of lower ranked journals closely approximate those of the “A” or premier journals, the “A” journal threshold standard appears to be more arbitrary. Moreover, the breadth of the area of demarcation, in terms of impact scores, acceptance rates, or other indicators of quality, between ostensible “A” and “B” journals may not be uniform across disciplines. We question the wisdom of creating discrete categories of journal quality while ignoring some of the information available from indicators of quality, such as impact factors and acceptance rates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1056492611428721">
<title>More Comprehensive Evaluation Approaches</title>
<p>Several researchers have advocated more comprehensive evaluation systems that aggregate existing ratings and evaluate a larger set of journals. As they point out, such systems have the advantage of ensuring that niche or specialist journals are compared with both the general journals and other niche or specialist journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056492611428721">Cook et al., 2010</xref>). Comprehensive evaluation systems are needed as questions about the value that should be assigned to specialized journals often provide some of the most contentious debates within departments and schools of business. The branch-and-cut algorithm of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056492611428721">Cook et al. (2010)</xref>, which incorporates pairwise comparisons, draws on the results of several different rankings of accounting journals. These rankings are based on reputation (peer ratings), use (both citations and downloads), and cost/benefit or the willingness of readers to pay for the journal, which favors practitioner journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056492611428721">Cook et al., 2010</xref>). The Cook et al. approach may have greater validity and reliability than other approaches, but more study is needed. Broader approaches could also incorporate other indicators of journal quality, such as acceptance rates and library holdings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056492611428721">Barnabé, 2011</xref>). In addition, broader approaches to the evaluation of the research of individuals have also been recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492611428721">Adler &amp; Harzing, 2009</xref>). Evaluations of citations and downloads provide more direct measures than journal rankings that are largely based on citations. Although all these approaches have limitations, we recommend greater breadth as the best means of improving the evaluation of research. Broader approaches are more likely to demonstrate value to the multiple external stakeholders concerned about university research and especially those interested in faculty productivity.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We acknowledge the obvious, that not all the research we do is important. Yet, there can be little question of the overall value of conducting academic research, even if it sometimes does not generate immediately obvious practical applications or commercial value. Our discussion above suggests that effective research evaluation systems have never been more important to the continuation and legitimacy of our research activities. Business schools need to carefully and thoroughly assess the quality and impact of research conducted by their faculties. Such evaluations strongly influence the quality of the research done and the reputation of the school as well. Yet, the pressures on universities and business schools for faculty to teach more classes and more students and to only do research that has clear, immediate, and discernible value heighten the importance of the means by which we evaluate and reward research. We should ensure that the increased sophistication of our research is matched by similar sophistication in our methods of evaluation. We must develop and use systems that are reliable and valid and justifiable to all our major stakeholders, internal and external. The very survival of business schools as we know them in universities may be at stake.</p>
