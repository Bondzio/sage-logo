<abstract>
<p>This article considers two types of internationalization process among British docks and seafaring unions, distinguishing between ‘mobilizing’ and ‘managerial’ internationalism with reference to two case studies. The article argues that an internationalism which seeks to mobilize membership in an oppositional way is dependent on the framing, by union leadership, of particular material grievances as necessitating an international, rather than national, response. Managerial internationalism, by contrast, sees a more classically bureaucratic division of labour, in which officials administer more general political and regulatory priorities that are derived from membership concerns. The underlying material determinant of these types is argued to be the degree of labour market security possessed by unions involved. Where workers experience a strong challenge to their employment through international labour competition a mobilizing internationalism is more likely to emerge. But these material conditions also engender spatial and temporal limits within which mobilizing internationalism is constrained.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The maritime sector has been particularly affected by weak regulation in global markets; consequently it has relatively well-developed international trade union institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959680111430658">Koch-Baumgarten, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959680111430658">Lillie, 2004</xref>). This article compares two processes by which British unions have pursued their own forms of internationalization, demonstrating how tensions in domestic unionism shape the expectations and strategies applied internationally. First, I examine Nautilus International, whose approach has been strongly partnership-oriented. Then I consider the involvement of British unions in the ‘Fair and Safe Ferries for All’ (FASFA) campaign, launched by the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) to strengthen solidarity between North European trade unionists in response to ‘social dumping’ of low-wage workers.</p>
<p>I focus particularly on the role of officials and leadership, distinguishing between ‘managerial’ and ‘mobilizing’ internationalisms. Where international labour market competition is intense, as in the FASFA case, conflicts are likely between localized and globalized ways of interpreting interests, and officials can seek to mobilize by propagating international frames. Where competition is relatively mild, as with Nautilus, such conflicts are less pronounced, affording greater space in which a different kind of internationalism can flourish. The latter type entails a bureaucratic division of labour, as general concerns filter upwards from members to be addressed by technical specialists and experienced international officials. In the former case, however, officials often seek to propagate international conceptions of interest which are intended to devolve the locus of international activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0959680111430658">
<title>The material and political conditions of internationalism</title>
<p>Recent scholarship on British trade union revitalization has generally distinguished between the models of organizing (recruitment and collective mobilization) and partnership with employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959680111430658">Heery, 2002</xref>); though <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959680111430658">Martínez Lucio and Stuart (2009)</xref> suggest that the models could be combined, since partnership could be a lever for recruitment. Others identify a ‘top-down’ organizing model involving recruitment and servicing with little input from membership or grassroots self-representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959680111430658">Darlington, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959680111430658">Heery and Kelly, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>An alternative conception of ‘organizing’ involves a focus on member-led trade unionism with the normative objective of increased grassroots activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959680111430658">Martínez Lucio and Stuart, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959680111430658">Simms and Holgate, 2010</xref>). An example is the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union in Britain, which under left-wing leadership has pursued a militant strategy towards railway management, stimulating ‘devolved activist engagement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959680111430658">Darlington, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959680111430658">Kelly (1998)</xref> uses mobilization theory to analyse the cognitive process by which such oppositional activity is generated; he highlights the importance of leadership and framing processes in establishing particular constituencies of collective interest. I follow Kelly in examining the role of framing in shaping internationalism, and also consider the material conditions which shape the space in which framing agency operates.</p>
<p>Tensions between partnership, organizing and mobilization also have implications on an international scale. Partnership at company level realigns the nexus of conflict from intra-firm employer–employee opposition towards inter-firm competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959680111430658">Martínez Lucio and Weston, 1992</xref>); at national level it gives priority to national competitiveness and thereby reinforces ‘regime competition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959680111430658">Streeck, 1998</xref>), disrupting international cooperation between unions – as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959680111430658">Hancké (2000)</xref> has shown in the case of European Works Councils (EWCs).</p>
<p>International maritime trade unionism illustrates on a broader scale the extent to which international solidarity has been undermined by national (or regional) competitive interests. The ITF Flags of Convenience (FOC) campaign, which seeks to impose internationally established minimum standards on ships flagged to deregulated registries, has been repeatedly beset by tensions between labour- and capital-supply countries. The latter, including the more advanced European economies, may demand higher international standards, whilst the former may seek lower standards to retain their competitive advantage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959680111430658">Harvey (2006)</xref> suggests that capital’s expanding reach often creates the material basis, not for international solidarity, but national or regional antagonism; despite its achievements the FOC campaign illustrates this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959680111430658">Koch-Baumgarten, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959680111430658">Lillie, 2004</xref>). Economic internationalization alone does not generate solidarity; trade unions must also construct a ‘<italic>political</italic> argument’ which builds a normative sense of common interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959680111430658">Croucher and Cotton, 2009</xref>: 116). This political argument is often disrupted rather than aided by material factors.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, a literature on ‘new labour internationalism’ has invoked a political vision of labour’s role in an authentically globalized ‘clash between the free market and society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959680111430658">Munck, 2007</xref>: ix; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959680111430658">Waterman and Wills, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959680111430658">Johns (1998)</xref> distinguishes between ‘accommodationist solidarity’ which seeks to protect local conditions against external threats, and ‘transformatory solidarity’ which seeks through active union cooperation to counter the geographical inequalities upon which capitalism thrives. Again, the latter depends on a political consciousness which defines international solidarity as mutually beneficial and normatively desirable. Implicit in this is the notion of ‘bottom-up’ rather than bureaucratic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959680111430658">Ashwin, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959680111430658">Moody (1997)</xref>, for example, presents an extreme formulation of the link between official-led partnership and parochialism, arguing that it is only through the militant <italic>mobilization</italic> of transnational grassroots networks that true global solidarity can emerge.</p>
<p>Hence, can Kelly’s discussion of mobilization apply internationally? Under what conditions is a ‘mobilizing internationalism’ possible, and what is the role of leadership framing agency within it? When applying a mobilizing model on an international scale, certain problems emerge. Marxist writers have persuasively suggested that union bureaucracy is pressured to assume more conservative orientations by its functional interaction with capitalist society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959680111430658">Allen, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959680111430658">Hyman, 1979</xref>). However, there are strong countervailing tendencies, either rooted in leaders’ relative freedom from the need to preserve local workplace prerogatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959680111430658">Croucher and Cotton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959680111430658">Zeitlin, 1989</xref>), or in left-wing ideological commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959680111430658">Kelly and Heery, 1994</xref>). In the USA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959680111430658">Nissen (2002)</xref> shows how a concerted effort to stimulate attitudinal change (featuring a professional labour educator drawn from outside the union) was a critical component in reorienting towards a more ‘immigrant friendly’ model. Hence <italic>contra</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959680111430658">Moody (1997)</xref>, official trade unionism structures may generate the political components of <italic>international</italic> solidarity. Internationalist agency can therefore help frame particular disputes as international rather than national questions.</p>
<p>I consider the constraints under which officials are able to exercise such agency. I argue that the material conditions which enable internationalist frames to gain traction simultaneously limit their progression into a ‘transformatory solidarity’ as defined by Johns. The precondition for the expansion of solidarity between British and other European dockers and seafarers, discussed below, was the need to protect conditions within the regionalized European ‘social infrastructure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959680111430658">Harvey, 2006</xref>: 398) from being undermined by non-EU workers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959680111430658">Fetzer (2008)</xref> also illustrates how international economic integration can prove a basis for international solidarity, within critical limits. Where companies ‘share the pain’ of restructuring or cost-cutting across Europe, they create the basis for ‘risk communities’ in which genuine cooperative relationships can emerge. But these communities also require an <italic>external</italic> driver, in the form of a ‘shared European vulnerability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959680111430658">Fetzer, 2008</xref>: 295; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959680111430658">Ghigliani, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Critical geography writers suggest that such communities, which simultaneously generate and segregate solidarities, are a consequence of the spatial flexibility of capital. Its search for more profitable configurations causes place-specific devaluations which engender national or regional conflict between groups of workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959680111430658">Harvey, 2006</xref>). Within this literature, therefore, there have emerged particularly pessimistic, even dismissive, assessments of the notion of a mobilizing internationalist agency. In tracing the development of the international car industry, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959680111430658">Silver (2003</xref>: 13) draws on the distinction between ‘associational power . . . the various forms of power that result from the formation of collective organization of workers’, and ‘structural power’ accumulated by workers ‘simply from their location . . . in the economic system’. The latter can be further divided into marketplace bargaining power, derived from tight labour markets, and workplace bargaining power, derived from ‘the strategic location of a particular group of workers within a key industrial sector’.</p>
<p>The political argument for international solidarity implies the construction of <italic>associational</italic> power on a much broader spatial scale. Conversely, Silver emphasizes the importance of structural power in generating labour movements, particularly as global capital expands its spatial scope by pursuing ‘spatial fixes’ through the relocation of production. Silver argues, for example, that pre-war American unions in the car industry fared much better than European counterparts despite the latter’s stronger organizing traditions, because of their position at the centre of the industry. Thus Silver’s narrative traces a series of spatially delineated movements, as production moves from one country to another, with any notion of internationalized associational power, or subjective internationalist agency, largely irrelevant. Not only does this suggest autonomous national movements made-or-broken on the location of production with no role for international solidarity, but it also implies that apparent instances of ‘new labour internationalism’ such as the ‘Battle of Seattle’ are in fact instances of hypocritical protectionism in which the victims of relocations work against their beneficiaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959680111430658">Silver, 2003</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>In this article I seek a middle ground, locating the space in which internationalist agency can be located within a context of spatial integration and international unevenness in labour markets. I argue that the material determinant of types of internationalization is the relative flexibility of international labour markets: in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959680111430658">Silver’s (2003)</xref> terms, the marketplace power accrued by unions in the sector. A mobilizing internationalism is more likely to emerge where international integration is high and therefore where marketplace power is weak. In such cases, officials can generate internationalist agency by framing conflicts in internationalist terms. But these conditions also define the spatial limits to internationalism, as solidarity typically aims to exclude those undermining existing marketplace power, and it is much more difficult for internationalist agency to transcend these limits. Moreover, there may also be temporal limits to international mobilization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959680111430658">Hyman (2005)</xref>, identifying of an ‘agitator’ tradition within international trade unionism, suggests that mobilization tends to be reactive, responding to specific grievances against employers, rather than proactive. To consider these limits further, I use my empirical findings to elaborate a more detailed picture of the ‘managerial internationalism’ that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959680111430658">Martínez Lucio (2010)</xref> indicates, as a contrasting model which can aid our understanding of the interaction between material conditions, political frames, and leadership role. As shown below, this type of internationalism emerges where marketplace power is relatively strong.</p>
<p>I present qualitative findings from two case studies. Both are based primarily on semi-structured interviews with approximately 30 leading officials, conducted between September 2009 and March 2011 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959680111430658">Table 1</xref>). The first also draws on interviews with lay representatives and observation at an annual training course for senior lay officers. The second study encompasses non-participant observation at the launch of FASFA in September 2010. In the second study, there are two limitations to the empirical data gathered. First, aside from observation at the campaign launch, there are no data from rank-and-file workers in RMT and Unite (the main dockers’ union). Second, at the time of writing, the campaign had only been in progress for a few months, and it is therefore impossible to assess its practical impact in the long term. Whilst acknowledging these limitations, I also argue that the insights gained into the reasons underlying these strategies, as well as a more detailed study of the role of officials in shaping this process, represents an important and instructive counterpoint to the internationalization process undertaken by Nautilus. In this sense the fact that the campaign is studied only in its earliest stages enables a closer focus on the motivations and framing devices used by international mobilizers in trying to engineer a transition in union orientation.</p>

<title>Nautilus International</title>
<p>Nautilus International is a specialist maritime union with about 24,000 members, generally from higher skill brackets, such as captains, officers and trainee officers, as well as professionals within the shipping industry such as inland navigation workers. As implied by its name, Nautilus has a distinctively international structure, giving priority to international affiliations to the extent that in 2009 it joined Dutch counterparts in a transnational merger. This reflects the unique employment conditions of its membership, which is spread globally across ships in small groups amongst increasingly multinational workforces. In a recent membership survey, the number of respondents on single-nationality ships had declined from 24 percent in 2001 to 13 percent, while the proportion of ships with six or more nationalities had increased from 13 to 30 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959680111430658">Nautilus International, 2010</xref>). In consequence, Nautilus does not have a typical branch and steward structure, instead having only British and Dutch ‘branches’. It is in a relatively strong labour market position compared to other seafaring unions: there is a global shortage of seafaring officers, and there is also prestige associated with British officers which is partly historical and partly related to the levels of training and support available. A far greater challenge to the union’s membership base has been demographic attrition. Reduced training commitments, as well as the declining attractiveness of the seafaring profession because of ‘criminalization’ (as ship-owners seek to transfer legal responsibility for on-board incidents to senior staff) and reduced shore leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959680111430658">Nautilus International, 2010</xref>) has meant that the ageing membership is not being replaced by new cadets at a sufficient rate. Gradually diminishing resources, combined with the challenges a dispersed membership presents to the union’s traditional servicing role, are outcomes of globalization (interview notes).</p>
<p>Increased individual service provision in recent years is in part attributable to a more general ‘decollectivization’ of industrial relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959680111430658">Howell, 2005</xref>: 131). Education for Nautilus representatives, for example, focuses on the increasingly individualized ‘locus of conflict’ at work and the practicalities of representation at employment tribunals. But this is exacerbated by the increasing dispersal of Nautilus membership, and its growing heterogeneity. The Nautilus newspaper, the <italic>Telegraph</italic>, is read all over the world and contains a membership application form. Seafarers of other nationalities often join in this manner, and there are very few restrictions. Given these increasingly diverse constituencies, Nautilus may in future consider variable membership packages, with some receiving only services such as the <italic>Telegraph</italic> and legal support as opposed to collective bargaining coverage (which is logistically impossible on some ships) (interview notes).</p>
<p>Nautilus sees itself as an all-round organization for seafarers rather than just a means of workplace bargaining, and it thrives on the close sense of community that such specialist work entails (interview notes). Therefore dispersal and multinationalization present particular problems. Aside from the safety issues caused by language differences, Nautilus research suggests that multinationalization has led to on-board isolation and cultural segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959680111430658">Nautilus International, 2010</xref>). Whilst its members have been relatively sheltered from the international integration of labour markets, the internationalization of lower-status seafarers has diminished workplace collectivism. Thus internationalization has induced Nautilus to enhance its flexibility as a servicing union, and the increasing need for resources to do so has necessitated expanding its membership base (interview notes). If there is a tension, however, between Nautilus’s membership community and this expansion, it seems to have been negotiated relatively smoothly. Nautilus has expanded strategically, avoiding being reduced to a ‘catch-all’ union. Most notable was the merger with the Dutch <italic>Federatie van Werknemers in de Zeevaart</italic> (FWZ) in 2009 to form Nautilus International.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0959680111430658">
<title>The Nautilus International merger</title>
<p>The merger furthers the two objectives of expanding the member base and projecting a stronger political voice within a globalized regulatory framework. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959680111430658">Gekara (2010)</xref> shows, the merger was initially treated with scepticism, as members feared losing support for local priorities and cooperating with potential competitors for jobs. Constitutionally, it would have been possible to conclude the merger without a ballot of membership, but Nautilus worked hard to give the process democratic legitimacy. Meetings were organized to explain the reasoning, presenting the alternatives as either a cut in services or a rise in contributions. FWZ faced a near-identical set of demographic problems, suggesting a ‘risk community’ primarily rooted not in labour market flexibility but in generalized weakening government commitments to training provision. Moreover, the merger also depended on close pre-existing personal contacts between the organizations, both at workplace level (there are several companies in which British and Dutch seafarers staff the same ships) and among senior officials through cooperation within the ITF (interview notes).</p>
<p>These factors apparently proved persuasive, because the ballot in 2008 saw an 80 percent yes vote on a turnout of 28 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959680111430658">Gekara, 2010</xref>). Senior lay representatives seem to accept the merger’s logic and expect officials to work to deepen administrative integration between branches. It could be argued that the merger delays rather than solves the attrition process, but as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959680111430658">Gekara (2010)</xref> notes, Nautilus believes the heightened political weight of the new organization can ensure increased training and recruitment commitments from state and industry, reversing decline more durably. In this sense, a further reason for the merger is as a strategy to engage with these international political concerns directly, rather than relying on a secretariat such as the ITF (interview notes).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0959680111430658">
<title>Nautilus and managerial internationalism</title>
<p>Nautilus has the ability to ‘punch above its weight’ in the technocratic environment of international bargaining and regulation. Many official positions require technical knowledge more than the general negotiating skills prized in other seafaring unions such as RMT (interview notes). For example, the Nautilus <italic>Telegraph</italic> is widely respected not just by members but also by management as a source of industry news, and officials are often approached for technical advice by employers. The current general secretary, Mark Dickinson, was previously assistant general secretary at the ITF; he sits on the Fair Practices Committee, a key ITF body which coordinates the FOC campaign, sets minimum international standards and tries to find common ground between unions from capital-supply and labour-supply countries. The role of official personnel is therefore an important consideration in understanding Nautilus’s internationalization. If the merger is its most obvious aspect, it is the culmination of a process which has deeper roots. A key factor was the confluence of people in Nautilus during the late 1990s with extensive international links and experience within the ITF (interview notes). The introduction in 2000 of the tonnage tax, designed to attract more companies to UK registration, led Nautilus to look outwards, seeking supranational opportunities to influence crewing provisions in anticipation of growth in the UK fleet (interview notes).</p>
<p>International membership expansion reflects a renewed emphasis on recruitment, which applies to domestic workers in other sectors as well as international workers. One senior lay representative had retained his membership when moving into vessel traffic services, owing largely to the organizational culture of Nautilus, rather than joining the union which organizes the majority of dock workers (interview notes). This is representative of one section of people Nautilus can hope to recruit in future. But the expansion process is most sensitive when it comes to recruiting workers from lower-wage countries. Nautilus officials refer to the union’s ‘core’ membership, indicating professional British officers; but this core does not have a specific definition or confer specific advantages, and it may be that its normative importance will be eroded in the future.</p>
<p>Where Nautilus negotiates agreements covering international workers, progress has to be synchronized with the ITF. It risks becoming uncompetitive if it signs agreements on higher conditions than international minima, so it seeks to raise the wages of non-EU seafarers multilaterally rather than unilaterally (interview notes). However, the union also signs agreements with UK or Isle of Man ship-owners who are not covered by ITF agreements, at levels equal to or above ITF minima. In such cases, Nautilus acts as an agent giving the ship cover against ITF scrutiny as well as technical advice. Nautilus thus draws seafarers of multiple nationalities under its jurisdiction. This is analogous to the strategy of the Japanese Seaman’s Union’s (JSU). This union has claimed to have 60,000 members, which would make it by far the largest specialist seafaring union in the world; but well over half of these are seafarers from countries such as Korea, the Philippines and Indonesia, who are only peripherally considered as members, having been covered by agreements signed with ship-owners rather than joining directly. The internationalization of Nautilus outstrips the JSU in that it is tentatively considering making these seafarers full members (interview notes).</p>
<p>The general secretary attributes the relative lack of contention over expansion to the nationality-transcending community spirit of the shipping profession (interview notes). However, this process also has legitimacy because the challenges Nautilus faces are better suited to international regulation and broadening of its member base, rather than the collective defence of workplaces against low-wage competition. Consequently, the expansion-oriented judgments of a bureaucratic leadership are often seen as legitimate, and recruitment as a necessary means of securing resources. Whilst globalization has transformed its recruitment, conditions of work and the demographics of co-workers, international labour market integration has <italic>not</italic> presented a comprehensive challenge to the employment of core Nautilus members. The union has received resources from the government’s Union Modernization Fund to support liaison officer education, which in 2009 focused on globalization and the importance of partnership as a response. The relative marketplace power possessed by its core membership means that Nautilus can seek to adapt to a transformed global economy, rather than being forced to <italic>confront</italic> globalization head-on.</p>

<title>RMT, ITF and the Athens Policy</title>
<p>The FASFA campaign is an attempt to implement the Athens Policy, a principle adopted by the ITF in the 1990s stating that conditions of remuneration for all workers on passenger ferries must equal the minimum terms within at least one of the countries between which the vessel sails. The campaign coordinator is seconded to the ITF from RMT, and FASFA is more appropriate to the aims of a general transport union organizing ratings and dockers rather than an officers’ union such as Nautilus. This is not to say that the latter will not be involved, but Nautilus will not prioritize such campaigns because its members have not been hit as hard by low-wage labour competition (interview notes).</p>
<sec id="section7-0959680111430658">
<title>RMT</title>
<p>RMT is a general transport union representing approximately 80,000 members in rail and road transport, as well as seafaring ratings, who typically fall into a lower skills bracket than Nautilus members. Overall, its membership is growing, perhaps because of its reputation for militancy; but in seafaring it has suffered dramatically from the restructuring of the maritime labour market, with numbers of British ratings falling from over 30,000 in 1980 to less than 9000 today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959680111430658">RMT, 2010</xref>). Companies have looked to consolidate a small core of British officers whilst drawing on a globalized labour market for other positions (interview notes).</p>
<p>This places limits on what RMT can achieve through the ITF, which has to balance conflicting interests between labour- and capital-supply countries. Like Nautilus, RMT has therefore looked to form alternative alliances with unions with more closely aligned interests; but the union is committed to campaigning primarily at national level for better regulation on the UK flag, focusing on eliminating pay differentials as a means of preventing the undercutting of British seafarers. The 1976 Race Relations Act – ‘the ship owners’ finest asset’ (email correspondence, RMT branch secretary) – contained a loophole whereby pay discrimination on grounds of nationality was allowed to continue. RMT has attacked this loophole more aggressively than Nautilus, who have suggested a compromise whereby the wages of non-EU seafarers follow internationally determined minimum standards. There are material causes for this greater radicalism: the damage they have suffered in the last thirty years has ‘liberated’ RMT, to a degree, to call companies’ bluff on flagging out. Those threatening to do so may have only raised the British flag with the advent of the tonnage tax anyway, and so may employ few British ratings (interview notes).</p>
<p>National campaigning over wages represents a critical means of getting to grips with an internationalized workforce, and therefore an acceptance of the need to campaign on something which has previously been ‘too painful’ to acknowledge fully (interview notes). But this acceptance has been accompanied by a developing conviction that political action is ‘nebulous’ without industrial backing (interview notes). As such, RMT has tried to cultivate links with organizations that may be able to support campaigns against specific companies, and it also has tried to contribute to transnational mobilizing campaigns against offending companies or liberalizing legislation. In this way the ITF may still prove an important resource for RMT, as a means of coordinating protest campaigns among ‘risk communities’, which are defined by shared concerns about social dumping. The FASFA campaign illustrates this process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0959680111430658">
<title>The FASFA campaign</title>
<p>The FASFA campaign was launched in Hull on 15 September 2010, at an event attended by delegates from seafarers’ and dockers’ unions from Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and France. British delegates were from RMT and also Unite, which represents British dockers: a conglomerate formed in 2007 by a merger between the Transport and General Workers’ Union and Amicus. The campaign aimed to develop a political and industrial campaign in order to expose cases of social dumping and enforce the Athens Policy (including clauses demarcating the work of dockers and seafarers), and to build solidarity between the unions involved. It involved a Week of Action, meetings on board ships and in docks, and publicity in the conventional and social media.</p>
<p>To counteract unions’ weak marketplace power, the Athens policy seeks to mobilize an alternative form of structural power: workplace leverage. If dockers refuse to unload ships belonging to offending companies, this effectively paralyses them. This use of structural power fits closely with the more aggressive tone of the campaign, which represents an increasingly oppositional turn from ‘failed’ social dialogue – termed ‘twenty years of collaboration’ by an ITF speaker at the launch. The speaker attributed this failure to the absence of sustained industrial campaigning in support of union positions. The strategy also reflects a renewed emphasis on ‘unconventional’ (member-led) mobilization over specific issues, such as the successful ITF campaign in 2003 against the European Commission Directive on Market Access to Port Services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959680111430658">Turnbull, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>FASFA is also informed by the Irish Ferries dispute in 2005–2006, when more than 500 Irish seafarers lost jobs to be replaced by low-wage Eastern European workers. The event catalysed the ITF regional coordinator’s role into a means for building links between Irish, British and French workers. Within a week of the dispute commencing, one such meeting led to a blockade of the company, as well as large demonstrations in the three countries (interview notes). RMT, for example, sent out communications to all branches, and organized minibuses in an effort to get people on the streets in support. In 2007 these links were brought forward again through an international Week of Action in the Dover Straits against Norfolkline, who had repeatedly refused to recognize RMT. As a result of such campaigns, an ITF official argues that companies are becoming increasingly aware of a floor in conditions on ferry routes, enforceable through international solidarity (interview notes).</p>
<p>Delegates at the campaign launch generally affirmed a strong commitment to the Athens Policy. A representative from RMT reported that in one company, management had simply refused to recognize the Athens Policy, arguing that the very idea was illegitimate because it already had agreements with Filipino unions covering the Filipino sailors on board. The company had tried to settle with the British union members separately, suggesting a ‘total crew cost’ agreement in which pay differentials would be formalized. RMT rejected this, believing that differentials themselves had to be eliminated as an absolute priority if progress was to be made in the long term. The official even suggested that his members might be willing to accept a lower commitment on British jobs in exchange for eliminating wage gaps.</p>
<p>At this early stage it is difficult to determine whether such pronouncements reflect a durable commitment to pay equalization at the expense of national protectionism. Follow-up interviews illustrate some of the problems with this process, as well as its potential successes. The main practical action of the campaign has been the week of action in September 2010, consisting of public rallies and delegations to shipping companies in the UK, Ireland, Belgium, France and the Netherlands. Because the campaign is directed at specific companies that infringe the Athens Policy, it has no definite end point (and no one consistent driver). The campaign coordinator argues that the credibility of the threat posed by the expanded spatial scale of action has forced companies to back down, at least temporarily, on threats to dockers’ work (see below). He also states that several companies have now negotiated with FASFA unions for agreements covering non-domicile seafarers (interview notes).</p>
<p>British unions have taken no specific action on raising the wages of non-EU seafarers, however. One result of the campaign has been to establish company agreements stipulating that when redundancies are made on British ships, non-domicile seafarers will be the first to leave (previously, the reverse was true). Seafaring unions have begun to sign bilateral agreements in which companies allow non-domicile seafarers to join ITF affiliates in their country of origin, with oversight from a British union. This has formed a basis for collaboration with Portuguese unions, whose members have been awarded representation through these measures, but there is little sign so far of such agreements emerging with Filipino unions.</p>
<p>Organizers have tried to publicize the campaign primarily through electronic media. The ‘Dockers and Seafarers’ Facebook page now approaches 2000 members, and is used to spread updates on the campaign. As awareness of the Athens Policy develops, the ITF hopes that union-to-union links can grow, reducing the need for an overarching coordinator’s role (interview notes). One early, and as yet rare, example of such a process is the Humber combine, a stewards’ group set up by Unite dockers in Hull, which has cultivated close relationships with Dutch dockers in Rotterdam.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0959680111430658">
<title>The Humber combine</title>
<p>The use by ferry companies of migrant labour to undertake lashing and unlashing of cargo on board ships presents a twofold problem for port unions. It infringes on work typically undertaken by dockers, and exploits low-paid seafaring labour in the process. This issue is a critical element in the FASFA campaign, constituting a means of galvanizing support from dockers’ unions. The Humber port stewards’ combine stems from one such dispute in 2009, when the union discovered that P&amp;O Ferries intended to employ Filipino seafarers to lash and unlash ships. The turning point in the subsequent campaign was the chance encounter between senior Humber stewards and the ITF regional coordinator, who was speaking at a nearby event. The latter had emphasized his organization’s desire to support domestic disputes more closely, and the stewards approached him with their concerns about P&amp;O. The coordinator suggested an international articulation of pressure involving Rotterdam dockers, who are members of the <italic>Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging</italic> (FNV), at the other end of the P&amp;O ferry route. The result was increased pressure on the company, which backed down without any industrial action being necessary.</p>
<p>This episode has had several after-effects which illustrate the continuing objectives of FASFA in action. The key result has been the development of cooperative links between British and Dutch dockers’ unions. FNV activists have told organizers in Hull that they are prepared to take action in Rotterdam if British dockers are unhappy during contract negotiations, and have also made it clear that they expect such commitments to be reciprocated. One potential stumbling block for collaboration is however the tight legal restraint on secondary action in Britain (interview notes). Despite these concerns, cooperation progressed through a British–Dutch port union conference in Rotterdam in December 2010. The conference sought to map companies using the Hull–Rotterdam route, and identified the ferry company DFDS as a target for future campaigning. Unions also agreed to undertake member education. This culminated in a leaflet for British dockers explaining the threats to their work from migrant seafarers undertaking lashing, highlighting the same problems in Rotterdam, and emphasising common cause between British and Dutch trade unionists. Moreover, the conference also sought collaboration on more general long-term issues, particularly training and accreditation, with a focus on mutual sharing of experience rather than specific actions. Thus there is the potential to convert relatively isolated campaigns against companies into longer term campaigns against the deskilling of dockers’ work and the maintenance of training provision (interview notes). Theoretically this could challenge the temporal limitations implied in a mobilizing approach, depending on the ability of agitators to use local disputes to reinforce the value of ongoing collaboration on broader regulatory issues. The spatial limits, however, remain intractable: it is the shared vulnerability to low-wage migrant competition that forms the platform for British–Dutch cooperation.</p>
<p>There are thus the beginnings of an autonomous transnational network between British and Dutch workers on the Hull–Rotterdam ferry route which, whilst catalysed by the ITF, can act independently in future. It remains in its formative stages, though one regional organizer refers to a ‘buzz . . . [that] the reps are starting to get educated, starting to understand what international solidarity is about’ following trips to Rotterdam and visits from FNV. But the case must also be understood in the broader context of the rebuilding of domestic dockers’ organization: the leaflet campaign, for example, emphasized the need for solidarity between agency, in-house and subcontracted dockers in the Humber itself. Whilst those involved in events such as the Rotterdam conference, including Humber combine stewards, are developing relationships with Dutch counterparts, there remains little interest in the international angle from rank-and-file dockers. When the ITF coordinator addressed Hull dockers in the 2009 P&amp;O case, he was warned by regional officials to avoid mentioning international solidarity as a potential solution until local organizers had firmly established the problems and their implications locally (interview notes).</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The questions raised in the introductory discussion asked how (or indeed, whether) officials seek to mobilize trade unionism on an international scale, and the material conditions under which this happens. I argued that the critical variable in explaining different types of internationalism is the degree of international flexibility possessed by capital in commanding labour inputs. In the case of Nautilus, companies and workers are dispersed all around the world, but tight labour markets and the extra-economic benefits of hiring British and Dutch crew members mean that capital cannot easily outsource jobs currently done by many Nautilus members. In the case of the FASFA unions, the physical space in which the work is done is highly immobile, meaning that the unions involved in the campaign have considerable practical leverage against ship<italic>-</italic>owners, but deregulation within the sector means firms are able to source labour from all over the world. These different degrees of marketplace power have produced radically different internationalizations.</p>
<sec id="section11-0959680111430658">
<title>Mobilizing internationalism</title>
<p>The FASFA case illustrates that conditions of high labour market mobility create the possibility for particular moments of tension and reorientation. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959680111430658">Hancké (2000)</xref> shows, where employers seek to play off nationalities against each other to push through work restructuring, there is an incompatibility between emphasizing business-friendly competitive reforms in local workplaces, and the broader logic of international cooperation. This gap presents a space in which the framing agency of leadership can function. The FASFA campaign is a concerted attempt by union organizers to establish international frames which emphasize the potential benefits of international solidarity and, most importantly, the shared nature of threats. Moreover, the fact that this effort has been accompanied by strong attacks on ‘social dialogue’ and an embrace of a more militant strategy corroborates the suggestion of a synergy between mobilization and the extension of inter-union cooperation onto an international scale.</p>
<p>Such an internationalism is, however, confronted with both spatial and temporal limits. As noted above, instances of ‘agitator’-led internationalism may generally assume a reactive form. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959680111430658">Hyman (2005</xref>: 144) writes of mobilizing ‘agitation’: ‘implicit in this model was often a short-term perspective, since mobilization was only as enduring as the current mobilizing struggle’. Whilst the FASFA campaign is currently set to continue indefinitely, it depends on reacting to companies’ infringements of Athens Policy demands. It is in specific response to such infringements, rather than on a proactive and consistent basis, that transnational engagements have occurred, though attempts by official organizers to upgrade cooperation to the ‘long term’ issues of training and accreditation may counter this. The spatial limitations are more fundamental and illustrate a lesson drawn from the analysis of European ‘risk communities’ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959680111430658">Fetzer (2008)</xref>: the motivating force for collaboration between British and Dutch dockers was undoubtedly their ‘shared vulnerability’ to lower-cost Filipino labour. It is difficult to see how the solidaristic work which has united them could also fully encompass Filipino workers, because the latter are part of the outside world against which European workers seek to defend their conditions. Thus, the preconditions for a mobilizing internationalism are the same that prevent what might be termed ‘transformatory solidarity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959680111430658">Johns, 1998</xref>) from emerging.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0959680111430658">
<title>Managerial internationalism</title>
<p>In the Nautilus case, the relatively benign conditions of international labour markets have determined a very different internationalization process. Because there is less challenge to Nautilus members from other sources of labour, the points of tension which produce international mobilization are less pronounced. This relative absence of tension between local and global frames enables space for a broader internationalism to emerge which is based on regulatory and political concerns rather than specific grievances over threats to employment derived from the international reach of employers. Thus, Nautilus undertakes extensive international activity, but it remains confined to an elite level of technical negotiation over issues such as criminalization, training commitments and piracy. Whilst Nautilus members are frequently ‘internationalized’ in their attitudes, this takes the form of a normative sense of community with foreign seafarers rather than an expression of a mobilizing transnational solidarity (interview notes). When I asked Nautilus lay activists what they considered the purpose of the ITF, they generally replied that it has an important responsibility to the world’s most vulnerable seafarers and as such should be supported, rather than seeing it as a coordinating mechanism for mobilization.</p>
<p>In consequence, Nautilus retains a more traditionally bureaucratic division of labour. Concerns are derived from membership through research and consultation, to be administered by a specialist layer in a manner very close to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959680111430658">Heery and Kelly (1994)</xref> term ‘managerial unionism’. Rather than moving towards a mobilizing approach, Nautilus remains committed to social dialogue mechanisms. Its position on UK equality legislation for example, noted above, reflects not simply a predilection for compromise but also a commitment to the international bargaining processes by which minimum standards are established (interview notes).</p>
<p>This ‘managerial internationalism’ is therefore less confined by temporal and spatial limitations than is the ‘mobilizing internationalism’ of the FASFA campaign. Internationalism is not generated through specific incidents of employer intransigence, but through a more sustained sense of ongoing political partnership, given its most obvious expression in the merger to form Nautilus International. Moreover, it is evident that Nautilus has been more proactive in recruiting and representing seafarers from lower-wage countries both through the usual application process and by direct agreements with ship-owners. Such recruitment has been facilitated by its status as a technical specialist, non-militant union, but to a degree it also reflects the normative components which officers in this more managerial environment are able to bring to their work (interview notes). This partnership and servicing orientation of its internationalism has enabled it to recruit internationally without embracing the mobilizing norms associated with an organizing approach.</p>

<title>Conclusions and implications</title>
<p>The argument presented above is limited by the scope of the data gathered. A full understanding, particularly of mobilizing internationalism, would require more extensive information from rank-and-file sources, potentially extending to quantitative survey data as a means of gauging the extent to which ‘internationalist’ ideas can permeate throughout a union. This study therefore lacks some important elements, particularly in terms of measuring the extent of FASFA unions’ successes in cementing international cooperation as an accepted norm amongst their members. However, the material presented, by focusing intensively on official actions in the early stages of key campaigns, does provide useful insights into the forms that internationalization can take.</p>
<p>One conclusion to be drawn is the difficulty in creating a trade unionism which both mobilizes member-led internationalism and displays a ‘transformatory’ solidarity as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959680111430658">Johns (1998)</xref>. Indeed, I have argued that the material conditions which facilitate a mobilizing internationalism may simultaneously limit its expression to specific grievances and specific spaces. In this sense, my argument presents a more pessimistic view than many writers on new labour internationalism of the prospects for an ‘international social movement unionism’ which is both mobilizing and transformatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959680111430658">Moody, 1997</xref>). I have followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959680111430658">Fetzer (2008)</xref> in trying to locate spaces in which internationalism can emerge according to the ‘risk communities’ which develop as a result of the actions of employers. Where I have tried to develop these ideas further is in showing how this process shapes the organizational forms of internationalization, and the way in which this influences officials’ usage of international frames.</p>
<p>This argument can also be used to reformulate Silver’s analysis of ‘structural’ and ‘associational’ power in a manner which leaves more room for discussion of international solidarity. I have identified cases where trade unionists have differing degrees of ‘marketplace’ structural power, but unlike Silver I have not used this as a means of diminishing the importance of some form of internationalized associational power. Instead, I distinguish different <italic>types</italic> of associational power – in one case through heightened political weight and in another through enhanced ability to mobilize. Indeed, the particular form of workplace power that accrues to trade unionists on ferry routes (the ability to halt a company’s ships) can be multiplied in potency by enhanced cross-border collaboration. The sceptical assessment of internationalism made by Silver is however more clearly borne out when the role of migrant labour is considered. The need for trade unionists to defend marketplace power inevitably defines particular constituencies which must be protected against those outside them, and this holds greater resonance with the notion of divisions between excluded periphery and protectionist core that preoccupies world systems theory.</p>
<p>The most obvious question that arises is whether the two types of internationalization are incompatible. In principle, there is no reason to assume that a union could not pursue mobilization and partnership simultaneously. But the material challenges facing each union studied here has diminished the utility of one pathway and heightened the utility of the other. Nautilus will not prioritize mobilization because the challenges its membership faces demand other strategies (which could be jeopardized by militancy), and the FASFA unions have turned to mobilization specifically as a response to the failures of social dialogue. The attempts to broaden the issues for inter-union collaboration in the Humber combine represent a potential example of a mobilizing framework engaging with the broader issues associated with ‘managerial’ internationalism. In doing so, I noted that this may challenge some of the temporal limitations of mobilizing internationalism, but it is unlikely to break the spatial constraints.</p>
<p>‘Managerial internationalism’ is likely to become increasingly prevalent as unions respond to globalization through supranational institutional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959680111430658">Martínez Lucio, 2010</xref>). In this article I have tried to give a more detailed characterization of what this may look like, and what it may mean for our understanding of trade union internationalism generally. Whilst it may be antithetical to a mobilizing internationalism, Nautilus’s internationalization has been less closely defined within spatial and temporal limits. This suggests that the more pejorative portrayals of trade union officialdom which have emerged, particularly within the Marxist tradition, may need re-evaluation when our analysis extends to the question of international activity. It also raises the problem of whether internationalism can overcome these limitations whilst retaining an orientation towards mobilizing membership activism. If this is to be accomplished, it will depend on the ability and inclination of the networks which emerge through the process of mobilizing internationalism, such as the British–Dutch relationships stemming from the Humber combine, to prioritize the issue of pay for non-EU seafarers over a defence of EU–national employment itself. While employers continue to use low-wage labour as a lever against dockers’ and seafarers’ conditions, any attempts to frame these issues in a global, rather than European, form will struggle against the grain.</p>
