<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article highlights key findings of doctoral research undertaken in three non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in São Paulo, Brazil. The research set out to explore the practice of developing and implementing children and young people’s participation in community-based NGOs in order to understand the complexities of what can often be portrayed as a straightforward process. The article focuses on the concepts of participation and protagonism, exploring how research participants’ understandings of these terms can be used to push forward current debates within Northern literature. I begin by tracing the emergence of protagonism within Brazilian social policy, providing an overview of how the concept evolved and a brief overview of more recent critiques. I then move on to explore research participants’ views utilizing these reflections to facilitate a critical analysis of recent thinking within Northern literature.</p>

<title>Participation debates: The development of youth protagonism in Brazil</title>
<p>In the UK children and young people’s participation is in a conceptual muddle. Widely used yet ill-defined, particularly within the English-speaking world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872812437223">Lansdown, 2010</xref>), participation can refer to anything from a physical presence in a specific space to autonomous decision-making. Although there have been numerous attempts at definition (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872812437223">Fajerman and Treseder, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812437223">Hart, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020872812437223">Shier, 2001</xref>) these have had little impact on language and the word ‘participation’ continues to be widely used to refer to distinctly different situations. While participation is argued to be embedded within the Convention of the Rights of the Child (CRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020872812437223">Skelton, 2007</xref>) and the influence of the CRC on the surge in interest in children and young people’s participation has been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872812437223">Lansdown, 2010</xref>), a ‘credible and coherent body of theory to inform this practice’ is still lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872812437223">Thomas and Percy-Smith, 2010</xref>: 3). In Brazil however there has been a deeper and arguably more effective debate on the meaning of participation. Within the field of social work the historical development of the legal frameworks in Brazil indicates a deepening awareness of the complexity of participatory practice. The <italic>Lei Orgânica de Assistência Social</italic> (Organic Law of Social Work) introduced in 1993 marked a move away from the <italic>‘assistencialismo’</italic> (‘assistentialism’) of previous decades. The idea that the role of the social worker is to provide for the dependent, invariably poor, population shifted towards a more politicized position. Rather than as a form of help or favour, social work began to be linked to citizenship. Within this framework the role of the social worker was to work with individuals, groups and communities to claim and defend the right to citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020872812437223">Paz, 2009</xref>). The explicit linking of rights to citizenship appears to be a key differentiating factor when taken alongside Northern debates. As eloquently noted by Rizzini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020872812437223">2011</xref>: 70), ‘Brazil is a country where many adults throughout history did not feel they were respected as citizens. This feeling is still quite present in contemporary society. In consequence, the notion of citizenship is a potent rallying cry for the less powerful.’ Citizenship continues to be a focus of NGOs and civil society groups in Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872812437223">Cornwall et al., 2008</xref>) and due to the emphasis on ‘citizen participation’ within both the <italic>Estatuto da Criança e do Adolescente (ECA)</italic> (Statute of the Child and Adolescent) and the Organic Law of Social Work, the concepts of citizenship and participation remain heavily intertwined within Brazilian debates.</p>
<p>Integral to the legislative changes were the wider changes that were occurring within Brazil during this time. Brazil had been under a military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985 and experiences during the struggle for democracy are argued to have ‘shaped the experiments that took place over the following years to create institutions that could ensure the accountability and responsiveness of the new democratic state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872812437223">Cornwall et al., 2008</xref>: 3). The 1988 Brazilian Constitution not only established the formal transition to democracy but also sanctioned the decentralization of policy-making and established mechanisms for citizens to participate in the formulation, management and monitoring of social policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872812437223">Coelho, 2007</xref>). This led to Brazil being regarded as ‘one of the world’s most important laboratories of democratic innovation’ (Gaventa, 2004, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872812437223">Coelho, 2007</xref>: 35). A useful example of the commitment to citizen participation is highlighted by the reversal of the term <italic>‘controle social’</italic> (‘social control’) during the process of democratization. Rather than the traditional understanding of social control, when it signifies the control exercised by the state over its citizens, the term was reversed to signify the control exercised by civil society over the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020872812437223">Paz, 2009</xref>). It was during this period of debate and change that a new term emerged: protagonism. Participation as a concept was viewed as insufficient to incorporate the right to citizenship as it failed to move away from the assistentialist perception of ‘giving’ voice. Instead, the concept of protagonism was advocated as incorporating the individual as a protagonist or an active agent within her or his own life and community. Crucially, protagonism brought the two elements of participation and citizenship together.</p>
<p>This contrasts significantly with Northern debates. As highlighted by Beresford and Croft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872812437223">2001</xref>: 296) in their analysis of participation within social work and social care in the UK, ‘Arrangements for participation in social work and social care have predominantly been based on a consumerist agenda’ and while participation has become a prominent concept within practice, its relationship with citizenship remains somewhat unclear. As the recent special issue of the <italic>Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science</italic> illustrates, citizenship remains a debated and elusive concept within Northern literature. Furthermore, when taken alongside the principles of participation as laid out in the CRC, the notion of citizenship becomes even more blurred due to the current focus on political citizenship and the resulting focus on competency as a measure of ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020872812437223">Van Bueren, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In Brazil, another significant legislative change to occur during this time was the introduction of Statute of the Child and Adolescent (ECA) in 1990. Advocated as one of the most advanced pieces of legislation for children’s rights in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872812437223">Da Costa, 2008</xref>), the ECA conceptualized children and young people as subjects rather than objects of human rights. As stated in Article 15:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>The child and the adolescent have the right to liberty, in respect of dignity as human beings in the process of development and as subjects of civil, human and social rights guaranteed in the Constitution and by law. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872812437223">Governo do Brasil, 1990</xref> [my translation])</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In a recent review of children’s citizenship in Brazil, Rizzini eloquently highlights how the legislative changes impacted upon societal attitudes. Summarizing the powerful shift in language away from use of the term ‘<italic>menor</italic>’, Rizzini states:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>One consequence of the new legal language and rhetoric was that the distinction between children and menores became unacceptable in a short period, at least in public discourse. Indeed, the word menores and the phrase minor in irregular situations became politically incorrect. The discourse of protecting abandoned and delinquent children that predominated in nineteenth and twentieth centuries, up to the 1980s, shifted to a discourse of guaranteeing and protecting children’s rights, with an understanding that these rights are comprehensive and cover all aspects of a child’s life. (2011: 69)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As a consequence of both the shift in focus towards the guaranteeing of rights and the increasing recognition of individual agency, there also began to be a debate about children and young people’s own role within the guaranteeing of rights. The term <italic>‘protagonismo juvenil’</italic> (‘youth protagonism’) evolved during this time in an attempt to incorporate both the guaranteeing of rights and the idea of each individual’s own active agency within the wider community. Da Costa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872812437223">1997</xref>: 65) was a key figure in this debate and he developed the following definition of youth protagonism:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Youth protagonism is based upon the presumption that what adolescents think, say and do can transcend the limits of their personal and family surroundings and influence the course of events in community and wider social life. In other words, youth protagonism is a form of recognising that the participation of adolescents can generate decisive changes in the social, environmental, cultural and political reality where they are inserted. In this interpretation, to participate for an adolescent is to involve themselves in processes of discussion, decision, design and execution of actions, aiming, through their involvement in the solution of real problems, to develop their creative potential and their transformative force. Like this, youth protagonism, is just as much a right as a responsibility for adolescents. (my translation)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For Costa, youth protagonism is the active participation of young people in ‘real problems’. The conceptualization of youth protagonism as active participation in decision-making has also been elaborated by Barrientos and Lascano (2000, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020872812437223">Stamato, 2008</xref>), from Peru and Argentina respectively. They propose an integral programme of capacity development for young people at four interactive levels:</p>
<list id="list1-0020872812437223" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Basic capacities</italic>: self-esteem, identity, humour, optimism, hope and creativity;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Participation</italic>: related to confidence, autonomy, socialization and reciprocity, capacity to interact with your surroundings;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Protagonism</italic>: capacity to actively participate in the elaboration and implementation of initiatives that can transform adversities and involve capacities of vision (strategic thinking), proposition, negotiation and management/implementation;</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><italic>Social action for development and citizenship</italic>: capacity for active participation in the planning and construction of your own future, of your family and your community, fulfilling your family, social, economic and political roles. (Barrientos and Lascano, 2000, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020872812437223">Stamato, 2008</xref> [my translation])</p>
<p>In contrast to global Northern literature on children and young people’s participation (see for example the review of models of children’s participation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872812437223">Malone and Hartung, 2010</xref>), Barrientos and Lascano stress that these four levels of youth development are <italic>interdependent</italic>. This is significant as it challenges the more static sequential and hierarchical theoretical models that have come to dominate Northern discourse.</p>
<p>Yet interestingly, despite the more advanced discourses of youth participation and protagonism within Brazilian literature, the widespread adoption of the ‘protagonism’ as a term has created a new wave of critical analysis arguing that the term remains ‘imprecise and multifaceted, anchored in different theories, methodologies and ideologies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020872812437223">Stamato, 2008</xref>: 56 [my translation]). Although founded on the notion of youth empowerment, youth protagonism is now coming under scrutiny for being a basis for sometimes contradictory theoretical and methodological conceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020872812437223">Stamato, 2008</xref>). In a recent comprehensive critique of the concept, Magalhães de Souza argues that despite the legal basis in ECA, within governmental and non-governmental organizations young people continue to be viewed as objects rather than subjects of interventions:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Youth protagonism . . . is a discourse of adults, produced and shared by international organizations, government departments, NGOs, businessmen and women and educators, in other words, by adults that dedicate themselves to the integration of young people, who are considered the object of the intervention. The youth protagonist is the object and not the subject of government and non-government policies and measures. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872812437223">Magalhães de Souza, 2007</xref>: 10 [my translation])</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This highlights how, despite the comprehensive debates within Brazil regarding the role of children and young people in society, the perception of children and young people as objects of protection rather than subjects of rights even within these more advanced debates has yet to be fully overcome.</p>
<p>I argue, however, that despite more recent criticism, protagonism can still significantly add to current Northern discourses of children and young people’s participation. Participation has become increasingly mainstreamed within UK social work since the 1990s however despite ‘user involvement’ becoming a key requirement within service delivery the effectiveness of much user involvement is still ‘open to question’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812437223">Beresford and Croft, 2004</xref>: 61). Children and young people’s participation has the extra complication resulting from the ‘conceptual shift’ that took place within the social studies of children and childhood since the 1990s. Despite the recognition of how ontological questions on what constitutes ‘childhood’ influenced the development of the CRC and resulting discourse and practice, there remains a ‘pervasive perspective of children as ‘‘adults in waiting’’’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020872812437223">Skelton, 2007</xref>: 177). When analysing Northern literature it becomes clear that while there have been a number of attempts to differentiate between the numerous forms of participation, classifications still tend to rely on the differentiating between types of participatory intervention rather than adopting differentiating language. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872812437223">Lansdown (2010)</xref> argues that children’s participation can be broadly classified at three levels – consultative participation, collaborative participation and child-led participation. While valuable, the focus of the classificatory approach to definition remains on differentiating between different forms of participation rather than casting the net more widely to question whether indeed the term itself contributes to rather than diminishes confusion.</p>

<title>Learning lessons from Latin America: The study</title>
<p>I worked with staff members of three NGOs in São Paulo to plan, implement and reflect upon a range of participatory methods with children and young people attending project activities in order to unravel some of the complexities of participatory practice. All three NGOs were relatively small in terms of staff numbers, ranging from a staff team of seven through to a team of 23. Two of the NGOs were based in central São Paulo and worked in neighbourhoods characterized by a predominance of commercial outlets and collective accommodation known as ‘<italic>cortiços</italic>’ where various families divide the same physical space with little privacy and poor living conditions. Within these geographical areas there are also a large number of people living on the street, including children, young people, adults and families. The third NGO was located in a municipality on the periphery of São Paulo city with the highest population density in the state of São Paulo. The area is characterized by precarious housing conditions, higher levels of violence than found in other municipalities and low income levels. The multidisciplinary team aims to minimize factors leading to social exclusion through group and individual support to young people and their families alongside providing educational and recreational workshops and community services. One element of the research process with all three NGOs were individual introductory and exit interviews with staff members and it is this element of the study that provides the empirical data for this article. The semi-structured interviews were conducted in Portuguese with all staff members (independent of role) and lasted for between 20 minutes and two hours. All the interviews were then transcribed, analysed and coded in Portuguese using qualitative data analysis software. A modified version of grounded theory was used for data analysis throughout the fieldwork through the use of reflections and memos, and these were used to form coding categories on which to base data analysis. In total, 40 staff members across the three NGOs were interviewed. During interviews staff members discussed and reflected on their understandings of participation and protagonism (for full discussion of methodology, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872812437223">Jupp Kina, 2010</xref>). Through a detailed analysis of participants’ reflections I was able to build a picture of current understandings of these concepts amongst the participants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020872812437223">1</xref></sup> It is this aspect that I argue can add significantly to current Northern debates.</p>

<title>Differentiating between participation and protagonism: Moving beyond political participation</title>
<p><disp-quote><p>Participation is really broad, isn’t it. Participation in what? Youth protagonism [hesitates], with protagonism they are participating effectively in something. (Jorge, NGO staff member)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As Jorge highlights, a key difference between protagonism and participation is that protagonism is more defined. It is when someone participates effectively in something. However, this raised the question of what constitutes ‘effective’ participation? At the most basic level, the majority of responses from staff members indicated an understanding of effective participation being young people doing things for themselves without the interference of adults. But we are still left with the question: what does this mean in practice? What is the process that permits young people to work free from adult interference?</p>
<p>The idea of control and autonomy emerged as central differentiating factors between participation and protagonism. When asked to define the difference between participation and protagonism in her introductory interview, Tânia, an NGO coordinator, replied:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Tânia:</speaker>
<p>I’m not exactly the expert on this, I don’t have much understanding about this, but [hesitates] I think basically protagonism is closely linked to the search to guarantee rights, to involve the young person in this search, it has everything to do with the autonomy of this young person. How to define participation? [hesitates] It’s to be able to give ideas, to debate ideas in order to make a decision, it’s more or less that.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Victoria:</speaker>
<p>What is the purpose of participation and youth protagonism in your opinion?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Tânia:</speaker>
<p>The purpose of youth protagonism is to stimulate the young person towards this autonomy, to this search. Participation is to be able to really hear what the child has to say, what the family has [to say], it’s not just listening for the sake of listening, it’s to really listen and to give importance that what each person brings is really rich. How you listen and what you do with the information.</p>
</speech>
<p>Tânia clearly differentiates between participation as a process in which the child or young person plays only a partially active role, with the adult assuming the responsibility for hearing what the child or young person has to say and acting upon the information, and protagonism as a process whereby the young person is actively involved in the claiming of their rights. This was further elaborated by João, another coordinator at the same NGO:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>But if within participation you opened up for them to be inside, here with protagonism they are inside and act on [what happens]. So it’s sovereign. Your role is much more to provide incentive or as a mediator, something like that. But they are different objectives, maybe participation as the start of a protagonism.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Both Tânia and João view participation as being when the role of the adult remains central – ‘you open for them to be inside’ – whereas with protagonism the objective is for the young person to have autonomy. As a consequence, the responsibility of the ‘adult’ moves from hearing the child and acting upon what they say to one of mediator or the provider of incentives. So in response to our question of what is the process that permits a child or young person to work free from the interference of adults, Tânia and João indicate that central to this is recognizing the role of the adult: from ensuring that a child or young person is listened to and towards the facilitation of autonomy. In other words, they indicate that protagonism is reliant upon those who are <italic>facilitating</italic> the process of recognizing their own role and required skills.</p>
<p>Yet Tânia’s definition of participation and protagonism also takes this one stage further. She integrates the role of the young person with the overall aim of the process. For example, while the aim of participation is limited to involvement in a specific process, such as taking a specific decision, she views protagonism as broader and connected to the claiming of rights. For Tânia, protagonism has a wider and more politicized aim which goes beyond involvement in specific decisions or discussions. If we briefly return to Northern literature, the distinction between active and passive participation is a key aspect of the various definitions of participation. For example, passive consultation is seen as the most basic level of participation and child-led participation as the highest (although not necessarily the ‘best’). However, the wider and more politicized aim implied within Tânia’s definition of protagonism is missing from the Northern definitions of participation. Children and young people may be participating, but the question of why still remains broadly unanswered. Although there is often mention of advocacy or awareness, raising the explicit reference to children and young people being actively involved in the search for the claiming of human rights is often lacking within theoretical debates (see for example, Francis and Lorenzo, 2002, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872812437223">Malone and Hartung, 2010</xref>). Indeed, the focus on participation within existing social and political structures, such as voting in elections, rather than the broader conceptualizations of participation in everyday activities through the ‘geographies of micro-politics’ (Weller, 2007, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872812437223">Torney-Purta and Amadeo, 2011</xref>) has led to criticism. As Percy-Smith highlights:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>I argue that this preoccupation with political, rather than other forms of participation, is one of the dilemmas with current theories and practices which seek to articulate young people as active citizens . . . One could argue that a radical shift towards widening opportunities for democratic participation should challenge the ethos of dependency and control of state institutions and structures and instead celebrate emerging countercultural orientations in citizen participation, wherein the agenda and form of participation is driven by citizens themselves rather than solely in relation to the state. (2010: 108–109)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A key conceptual difference, therefore, between participation and protagonism is that protagonism goes beyond the notion of participation in pre-existing social and political structures and links to wider issues of citizenship. It is one potential mechanism for challenging the currently rather limited conceptualization of participation as participation in pre-defined ways and shifting towards the recognition of participation as mechanism for collaborative decision-making and action.</p>
<p>Further elaborating on this, Eduardo, another coordinator at the same NGO, clearly differentiated between the active participation of someone in a decision-making process and the internal learning and personal development of the individual. In discussing his views on public participation, Eduardo uses the example of participatory budgeting to highlight how participation should be evaluated in terms of developing critical thinking rather than physical presence or inclusion. Participatory budgeting was introduced in Brazil within the 1988 Brazilian Constitution as a means of decentralization and public accountability through creating deliberative spaces and mechanisms for allocating municipal budget resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872812437223">Avritzer, 2002</xref>). However, as Eduardo articulates, there is a need to look beyond group processes to analyse the internal development of those involved:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Eduardo:</speaker>
<p>I see something more internal than communitarian, it’s a liberal ethic, of the individual. I think it’s more important to make a process completely within the person than mobilizing the whole neighbourhood to vote in participatory budgeting. I think I see it being more relevant that the young person does all the critical thinking within themselves than a physical mobilization of people.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Victoria:</speaker>
<p>So it’s more about the process than the result?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Eduardo:</speaker>
<p>Yes, it’s more about the process than the result. It’s an internal process, people tend to evaluate participatory budgeting by the amount of people who voted, which is good, of course, but if the young person has a critical spirit, even if they didn’t vote I think this is more important. Of course, voting is the final objective but I see a lack of critical spirit. I am uncomfortable if there is a participatory budget process where two or three say what the masses have to vote for. I think this is just as undemocratic as if there was no participatory budget. I think it’s more important to arouse a critical spirit, the capacity to think about the process itself than the final result, it’s more important the process of each young person.</p>
</speech>
<p>Eduardo’s view is that a focus on internal learning and the development of a ‘critical spirit’ means that a decision <italic>not to participate</italic> can be essentially more participatory than ‘active’ participation such as voting on a particular issue. What is important is the way in which this decision is made. The final action, or non-action, may be more visible but more important are the internal processes of learning upon which the final action is based.</p>
<p>The lack of attention paid to non-participation is another area that has been identified as lacking within Northern literature. As Cornwall highlighted in her extensive review of participation, ‘participatory initiatives tend to be premised on the idea that everyone would want to participate if only they could. The active choice <italic>not</italic> to participate is barely recognised’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872812437223">2002</xref>: 56 [emphasis in original]). This is an example of the focus within existing theoretical frameworks on action rather than process. Assumptions about participation being morally right and positive for all (if only society would allow it) have resulted in a failure to include individual processes and individual benefits, as these have been drowned out by hailing participation as the holy grail for a better society (see for example the discussions in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872812437223">Cooke and Kothari, 2001</xref>). The lack of an agreed definition and the tendency to focus on the overall goal, to ‘get them participating’, has left the processes by which this goal is achieved on the sidelines. Indeed, the confusion between purpose and process within participation has already been identified within social work practice in the UK. As noted by Braye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872812437223">2000</xref>: 9), ‘participation is presented both as a means to an end and as an end in itself, and at times the purpose and the process appear indivisible’. This creates a central problem, as the lack of clarity means that the internal learning and development of each person involved in a participatory process becomes immersed in the same confusion. Yet it is only by addressing the internal learning and development of each individual that participation can ensure itself against becoming an oppressive as opposed to empowering force. Using the ideas of Paulo Freire, the Brazilian educational pedagogue, freedom can only come about through the recognition of oppression by the oppressed and anything else amounts to a ‘false generosity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872812437223">1996 [1970]</xref>: 26). Therefore a further conceptual difference between participation and protagonism is the internal processes of learning and development that produce the ‘critical spirit’. This takes the recognition of needing to move away from the focus on participation in pre-defined ways and towards participation in everyday community settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020872812437223">Percy-Smith, 2010</xref>) one stage further, and highlights how the lack of attention to individual internal learning within current participatory processes creates a danger of participation amounting to little more than a ‘false generosity’ that does little to challenge the status quo.</p>

<title>Participation <italic>then</italic> protagonism: Recognizing participation as a process of learning</title>
<p>While broadly reflecting more recent thinking within Northern literature that participation is a process that involves learning as well as the idea of making a difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872812437223">Percy-Smith and Thomas, 2010</xref>), the majority of participants also identified that while participation and protagonism relate to different actions they are not independent of one another. The consistent view was that of a process; that participation leads to protagonism. Research participants consistently stated that participation is a fundamental element in developing youth protagonism. In the words of Carla, an NGO staff member: ‘. . . they go together. They are different words, but the actions are [hesitates] there’s no way for a young person to be a protagonist if they don’t participate’. In other words, to be a ‘protagonist’ you need to have experienced participation. The idea of participation being the first stage of youth protagonism was further elaborated by Beatriz, an NGO staff member who worked in a child protection team:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Beatriz:</speaker>
<p>Participation is the idea of developing the young person, to bring out their desire, to help with this [process] in some way, depending on what is proposed. But to wake up the young person’s desire. Youth protagonism would be planning, to help direct the young person so they can plan both small things within the group and manage to express their thinking about their own life.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Victoria:</speaker>
<p>Do you think that they are two different things or are they linked?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Beatriz:</speaker>
<p>They’re completely connected because by waking up the young person’s desire, you wake up the desire to participate, so [the young person] is able to plan, to organize their ideas.</p>
</speech>
<p>For Beatriz, participation is waking the desire in the young person and it is this that becomes the foundation on which to develop youth protagonism. Yet while this highlights the interconnected nature of participation and protagonism, it also raises the question of how a young person moves from knowing what he or she wants and actually achieving that end. What are the elements that move someone from participation to protagonism?</p>
<p>One fundamental aspect raised by Paulo, a director of one of the participating NGOs, was confidence. This particular NGO has an ‘open-door’ policy whereby children, young people and community members are free to enter all areas and offices within the building. Essentially, this NGO had opened up the physical ‘space’ for children and young people through the institutional decision to invite them ‘in’. Throughout the fieldwork I noticed the impact that this appeared to have on the sense of ownership and confidence of many of the children and young people who spend time ‘hanging out’ at the NGO. Crucially, it appeared that the children and young people gained skills and experiences through their engagement with this ‘space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872812437223">Cornwall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872812437223">Gaventa, 2006</xref>). Paulo felt that the ‘open-door’ policy had had an impact on both participation and protagonism through developing self-confidence:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Paulo:</speaker>
<p>I wouldn’t say they’re the same thing, but having children and young people participate, as participators or whatever is a fertile field to have ‘protagonismo juvenil’ – really strong actions – people are ready for it, basically.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Victoria:</speaker>
<p>So when you say fertile field you mean it’s growing . . .?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Paulo:</speaker>
<p>Being confident. Yeah, it’s things, people are confident, they build up confidence because they’re allowed to. It’s a little difficult to explain, like these children who come in here, just the fact that they can come in and talk builds confidence and then they can say I want to do this, I want to do that, all the rest of it. What I think is that it’s rather organic . . .</p>
</speech>
<p>Fabio, an NGO coordinator, also spoke about the connection between confidence and the process of developing protagonism. Fabio viewed protagonism in the same way as Tânia, believing that protagonism is achieved through autonomy. However, he highlighted the process that needs to be undertaken in order to achieve this:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>From the point of view of developing autonomy I think that it’s this, the child identifying first what he or she doesn’t like or and what he or she does like, and thinking what he or she can do to change this, what are the alternatives. Very often it’s what he or she needs before being able to see the alternatives, it’s developing self-esteem, self-awareness.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For Fabio it is through the experience of participation, through building the self-esteem and self-awareness necessary to be able to ‘see the alternatives’ that facilitates protagonist action. Crucially, this indicates that it is the experience of learning and personal development that comes through participation that facilitates the development of autonomy, and it is through the development of autonomy that moves an individual from being a participant to being a protagonist. In other words, it is precisely through the experience of participating that facilitates a young person moving from identifying what they want and actually achieving that end. In short, participation <italic>facilitates</italic> protagonism.</p>
<p>Theoretical frameworks of participation in Northern literature are curiously silent on the processual nature of the participatory relationship and how the experience of participation facilitates the learning and development that moves an individual towards protagonism. For example, Hart’s ‘ladder of children’s participation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812437223">1992</xref>), which remains the most influential model within the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872812437223">Malone and Hartung, 2010</xref>), utilizes a categorization approach to distinguish between possible types of adult–child interaction. This approach, while useful in the analysis of past actions, fails to incorporate the processual nature of participatory practice. It focuses on <italic>what</italic> is done rather than <italic>how</italic> it is done. The static nature of the categorization approach implies that the adult needs to decide the level of participation that they would like to aim for, which then sets out the amount of ‘space’ the adult will need to provide. The ‘adult’ remains in control of the process. For a framework of participatory practice to be truly representative of reality it must, at the very minimum, represent the processual nature of participation. Instead of focusing on the categorization of participatory practice, the reflections of the participants in this research indicate that a more effective approach to conceptualizing participation would be to represent the experience of participation; to focus on what each individual (adult or child, facilitator or participant) within a participatory process needs to understand and experience in order to <italic>develop</italic> participation. As Paulo articulated so clearly, participation is an organic process, it is not just ‘done’ but is developed over time and it is through focusing on how this process is developed that will provide a more effective and representative framework for participatory practice.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Learning lessons, extending debates</title>
<p>Within this article I have utilized the experiences of practitioners to try to suggest one possible mechanism for bringing some clarity to the conceptual muddle that participation finds itself in within Northern discourse. Through providing an analysis of the terms ‘participation’ and ‘protagonism’ as used within Brazilian discourse and practice, the aim of this article has been to widen debates and question whether the continued use of the term ‘participation’, despite the recognition of the widely different situations to which it can refer, actually contributes to confusion. While a number of critiques of both participation in general and children and young people’s participation in particular have emerged over recent years (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872812437223">Beresford and Croft, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812437223">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872812437223">Cooke and Kothari, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872812437223">Malone and Hartung, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020872812437223">Percy-Smith, 2010</xref>), no other term has yet to be proposed that embraces the conceptual differences between different forms of participation that have been identified. Through providing an analysis of protagonism, this article has identified key conceptual differences between participation and protagonism. First, protagonism connects participation and citizenship, facilitating a shift away from the current focus on political participation and participation in pre-defined ways, towards the recognition of participation as a mechanism for collaborative decision-making and action. Second, protagonism embraces the idea of non-participation through focusing on the internal processes of learning and development. This helps to ensure against the danger of participation becoming a mechanism for reinforcing rather than challenging the status quo. Finally, the article has highlighted the interconnectedness of the two concepts and argued for a move away from the categorical approach within theoretical frameworks. After all, if participation is a fluid process of internal learning, then a theoretical framework must, at the very minimum, attempt to represent this fluidity.</p>
