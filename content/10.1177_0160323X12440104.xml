<p>Building on discussions from a 2008 symposium on accountability sponsored by the Kettering Foundation, the authors in this collection examine accountability through a variety of theoretical lenses. Namely, they look at implementation challenges, the meaning of accountability, the role of different organizational actors in regard to accountability, and the issue of multiple accountabilities in an organization. The cases explored and theoretical implications discussed in this collection are both rich in meaning and diverse in setting.</p>
<p>However, the editors did not require that symposium contributors focus on a specific accountability theme or issue. Instead, they allowed each contributor to analyze accountability in their own way under the assumption that important themes and theoretical frameworks would emerge <italic>ex post facto</italic> from the interaction of participants (Dubnick and Frederickson 2011, 302). This makes reviewing the collection for specific accountability themes quite difficult. However, the editors of the collection identify three accountability themes that run through all of the chapters: the problematic meaning of accountability, the existence of multiple accountabilities, and the emphasis on accountability mechanisms rather than on accountability itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X12440104">Dubnick and Frederickson 2011</xref>, xv). To these themes, I would add another one that almost all of the chapters directly or indirectly address: the notion of accountability as a complex system influenced by different sets of actors in often unimaginable ways. Together these four themes help identify the promise and peril of accountability in modern organizations.</p>
<sec id="section1-0160323X12440104">
<title>The Meaning of Accountability</title>
<p>Accountability and its various meanings and applications come down to choice. Sometimes that choice can be mandated by culture and tradition. Sometimes it is mediated by political and organizational necessity. But however accountability is defined or implemented, it has to correlate with organizational, political, and even cultural pressures in order to have value. Unfortunately, most organizations are under multiple, diverse accountability pressures. Consequently, most organizations find themselves under multiple types of accountabilities. Authors in this collection help delineate the boundaries of the meaning of accountability by noting the influences on it and the context in which accountability resides.</p>
<p>Chapters written by Jonathan Koppell, Thomas Schillemans and Mark Bovens, and Sara Jordan all help explain that the meaning of accountability depends on context. Put simply, different types of organizations have different accountability pressures. For example, while Thomas Schillemans and Mark Bovens spend more time examining the impact of multiple accountabilities on Dutch agencies, their chapter shows how the meaning of accountability in Europe is often injected with distinct deliberative mechanisms in the information, debating, and consequences phases of accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X12440104">Schillemans and Bovens 2011</xref>, 10). In the information phase, public managers give an account of their activities and behaviors in standard, official meetings with high-level principals. Then in the debating phase, the principals and the public managers deliberate on the information before them. And finally in the consequences phase, the principal can sanction or reward the public manager for their activities and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X12440104">Schillemans and Bovens 2011</xref>, 11–15). Schillemans and Bovens show that accountability is more public, more routinized, more deliberative, and perhaps more effective as a tool for effective governance in countries with this more deliberative style.</p>
<p>Meanings of accountability are also inherently linked to our basic philosophies and traditions as identified by Sara Jordan in her chapter on the meaning of accountability in non-Western cultures. In Western cultures, accountability assumes the mantle of the individual operating in an adversarial environment, trying to account for actions to another individual or group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X12440104">Jordan 2011</xref>, 241–42). The agent has to “answer” to the principal to ensure accountability. Or the policy maker has to “answer” to the media to help ensure accountability on some issue. The downside of this Westernized approach to accountability is that it probably translates into a focus on procedural accountability where the fear of sanctions or punishment meted out on the individual becomes the primary accountability incentive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X12440104">Jordan 2011</xref>, 244, 246). In contrast, non-Western cultures emphasize accountability through the lens of the community and its values. If the leader (i.e., the principal) makes a bad decision, sanctions or punishment are dispensed with a focus on the entire community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X12440104">Jordan 2011</xref>, 247). The entire community might suffer from a bad decision, so the community might remove or excommunicate the leader from the community. In this way, an artificial barrier between the leader and the community disappears. Rituals help remind the leader (and the community) of this fact and thus serve as a type of accountability mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X12440104">Jordan 2011</xref>, 246).</p>
<p>Jonathan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160323X12440104">Koppell (2011</xref>, 57) also helps delineate meanings of accountability by arguing for a multidimensional view of accountability that includes liability, transparency, controllability, responsibility, and responsiveness. Organizations, such as the global governance organizations he analyzes, often find themselves in tension with at least some of those accountability dimensions. In particular, global governance organizations often have to choose whether to focus on responsiveness or responsibility as emphasizing one immediately diminishes the scope of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160323X12440104">Koppell 2011</xref>, 74).</p>

<title>Multiple Accountabilities: Problem or Opportunity?</title>
<p>Accountability, then, is shaped by a context of multiple pressures. With each pressure, a different meaning of accountability could emerge and lead to an accountability system with multiple accountabilities. Multiple accountabilities were originally discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160323X12440104">Romzek and Dubnick (1987</xref>) in their prescient article on accountability during the Challenger disaster where they found that public organizations like National Aeronautics and Space Administration were often under concurrent legal, political, bureaucratic, and professional accountability pressures. This resulted in the <italic>accountability dilemma</italic> where the organization was under multiple and often contradictory accountability mandates.</p>
<p>Depending on your point of view, multiple accountabilities either present a massive problem for the organization or a fortunate opportunity. On the problematic side, multiple accountabilities could result in the organization unable to satisfy all of the accountability demands placed upon it. At the very least, these could promote tension, confusion, and dysfunction in the organization. This type of problem commonly emerges in today’s network-driven, contracted-out public sector.</p>
<p>For example, Barbara Romzek’s chapter on welfare reform reveals how the issue of multiple accountabilities can create problems in an organization. In welfare reform, the multiple accountability problem emerges from the diverse set of intersectoral and intergovernmental actors that implement welfare services. The federal government establishes guidelines and offers some level of funding, the states are then allowed to petition the federal government for waivers to the guidelines so that they can “innovate” policy solutions. The services are then implemented by intersectoral contractors for the state. The resulting network has multiple accountabilities. The professional accountability of staff that ensures the proper delivery of services, the political accountability of governments to deliver a service to citizens that actually works, and the hierarchical accountability of contractors to provide services in agreed upon terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160323X12440104">Romzek 2011</xref>, 29). Many times these multiple accountabilities can be in opposition to one another, creating a complex multiple accountability system that only adds to the challenge of modern governance.</p>
<p>However, multiple accountabilities may also present opportunities for better governance. In the previously mentioned chapter by Schillemans and Bovens, the authors analyze multiple accountability systems in Dutch agencies. Those agencies have two-tiered accountability; from ministerial policy makers and from a board of commissioners appointed by policy makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X12440104">Schillemans and Bovens 2011</xref>, 9). The value of this type of multiple accountability system is that the board functions more as a cooperative entity rather than as accountability inquisitors. They try to help the agency achieve plans that the agency already developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X12440104">Schillemans and Bovens 2011</xref>, 13). In many ways, the board seems to serve the agency rather than simply reporting on accountability to higher-level ministerial policy makers. Through forums and even informal discussions, the board helps make accountability redundant. In essence, the board seems to help the agency navigate the sometime dangerous political waters of accountability. They help the agency match information to expected values and help communicate to the agency the different dimensions of accountability expected by principals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X12440104">Schillemans and Bovens 2011</xref>, 18, 19). Ultimately this makes accountability more likely to be beneficial to both the agent and the principal.</p>
<p>Such redundancy could have been used in the United States Coast Guard’s Deeepwater procurement process. As detailed by Trevor Brown, Matthew Potoski, and David Van Slyke, the Deepwater procurement process was beset with problems. The project was probably too big and too complex (it was an integrated strategy to replace all of the Coast Guard’s major assets such as ships, planes, and helicopters; cost $500 million annually; and theoretically could last for twenty-five years; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160323X12440104">Brown, Potoski, and Van Slyke 2011</xref>, 47, 53). The Coast Guard did not have the contract management capacity for such a complex project, so they outsourced contract management to a consortium with ties to the same contractors that would later build the assets needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160323X12440104">Brown, Potoski, and Van Slyke 2011</xref>, 46–47). This fact, along with the complexity of the contract, eroded free-market accountability mechanisms typically observed in successful contracting.</p>
<p>Through the theoretical lens of game theory, the authors find that both contractor and contractee exhibited bad behavior (i.e., defection in the traditional prisoner’s dilemma sense). The authors describe this bad behavior as the perfunctory approach to accountability. That is, doing the bare minimum required by the contract and nothing more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160323X12440104">Brown, Potoski, and Van Slyke 2011</xref>, 43). The problem of perfunctory accountability tends to expand in complex contracting situations where information is uncertain and asset specificity is so high that the final product’s market appropriateness is nonexistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160323X12440104">Brown, Potoski, and Van Slyke 2011</xref>, 47). That is, the contractor knows that their final product, or the technology developed for the product, will not be useful to anyone else. Consequently, they have a tendency to shirk or do the bare minimum required.</p>
<p>To help avert such eventualities, the authors suggest bilateral and vertical accountability mechanisms that would promote consummate behavior, or the tendency of the contractor (and contractee) to engage in true partnership behavior that goes beyond the bare minimum required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160323X12440104">Brown, Potoski, and Van Slyke 2011</xref>, 43, 46). To help promote consummate behavior, the authors suggest a bilateral accountability mechanism of third parties that could informally monitor the parties to make sure that consummate behavior occurred. Such an approach would complement vertical accountability mechanisms already in place. For example, in the Deepwater case the Coast Guard had vertical accountability being measured by the Coast Guard’s home department (the Department of Homeland Security), the General Accountability Office, the Office of Management and Budget, and the various legislative committees and subcommittees. The authors’ idea seems to be that multiple accountabilities can help create redundant accountability system in complex contracts. Such redundancy can help correct for certain market inefficiencies that are commonly seen in today’s world of governance (e.g., not enough contractors, uncertain costs, the problem of high asset specificity, etc.).</p>
<p>However, these redundancy accountability systems have to be achieved informally. When accountability becomes too formalized, often through what Brown, Potoski, and Van Slyke would term vertical accountability relationships, organizational problems with accountability are more likely to occur. Perhaps, this is because formal accountability mechanisms often require a standard type of performance information that often has only minimal usefulness in terms of actual accountability. This leads to the third theme of accountability addressed by this collection: how can the multiple dimensional topic of accountability be measured effectively? Contributions to this collection indicate that performance measurement systems often fail to measure accountability in any meaningful way. At best they focus on bureaucratic accountability, might be of use in the policy process, but often neglect any consideration of political, professional, or legal accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160323X12440104">Pollitt 2011</xref>, 93; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X12440104">Posner and Schwartz 2011</xref>, 140–42; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160323X12440104">Radin 2011</xref>, 106–8).</p>
<p>Beryl Radin has been at the forefront of this debate for over two decades. Her chapter examines the Government Performance and Results Act and the Program Assessment Rating Tool to examine if notions of performance measurement in the United States federal government improve accountability. As readers of her work will know, these two performance programs have numerous problems. They are simplistic and do not consider the multiple pressures and indeed multiple accountabilities that present themselves in federal programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160323X12440104">Radin 2011</xref>, 109). Their conceptualization of accountability seems to only focus on bureaucratic accountability, or making sure that the unelected agent follows the mandates of the elected principal at the expense of other notions of accountability, namely political and professional accountability. This results in an accountability system that ultimately focuses on procedural accountability (or as Brown, Potoski, and Van Slyke would term it, perfunctory accountability) where public managers focus on compliance rather than on substantive issues of accountability.</p>
<p>The link between performance measurement and accountability is also strained in the United Kingdom and in the World Bank. Christopher Pollitt’s chapter examines the United Kingdom’s National Health Service and their use and publication of performance measurements, and the World Bank’s use and publication of world governance indicators. Both sets of indicators were developed and publicized to promote more public and political accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160323X12440104">Pollitt 2011</xref>, 85, 88, 89). Yet, the measures are little used or even noticed by citizens and elected policy makers (i.e., the principals; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160323X12440104">Pollitt 2011</xref>, 88, 90). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160323X12440104">Pollitt (2011</xref>) effectively makes the case that as these performance measures are designed and refined, the public is not consulted and essentially excluded from the accountability process (p. 89). In this way, both public and political accountability are lost. And once again, just as in Beryl Radin’s analysis, the best that can be said about the performance measures is that they can provide some type of limited, internal bureaucratic accountability. Or as succulently said by Christopher Pollitt “tension exists between accountability and performance improvement through measurement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160323X12440104">Pollitt 2011</xref>, 83).</p>

<sec id="section3-0160323X12440104">
<title>The Accountability System</title>
<p>What emerges from this collection is the idea that cultural, social, political, and institutional forces influence accountability and how it is measured in every organization. These forces shape and define accountability within organizations and how it is measured in organizations. In essence, every organization has a complex accountability system shaped by these forces.</p>
<p>The idea of an accountability system is specifically explored by Kaifeng Yang’s chapter on “Emergent Accountability and Structuration Theory.” Arguably, the most innovative chapter in this impressive collection, Yang’s chapter can be looked at as a call to move the study of accountability forward so that accountability systems within organizations are recognized as complex systems on par with physical, biological, or sociological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160323X12440104">Yang 2011</xref>, 275, 277). Such a call recognizes that accountability systems are dependent on complex social interactions between complex decision makers in complex organizational and cultural environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160323X12440104">Yang 2011</xref>, 271–73). This idea moves the study of accountability forward in a systematic, investigative way in that it recognizes that a system of accountability exists in all organizations.</p>
<p>Accountability systems are the future of all organizations since many citizens are now worried about the increasing power of public and private organizations and how that power can be utilized to influence their lives. As a result, in order for organizations to be a success well into the twenty-first century, their accountability systems have to be improved and the concept of accountability has to evolve. On a positive note, this is already occurring in many organizations. Many private organizations now promote other types of accountability, as explained by Matthew Potoski and Aseem Prakash in their chapter on voluntary programs. Instead of just looking at profit, some organizations also consider corporate social responsibility as a type of accountability to be valued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160323X12440104">Potoski and Prakash 2011</xref>, 225).</p>
<p>But on a negative note, the study and practice of accountability are still in their infancy. This collection makes clear that accountability and accountability systems are complex entities; perhaps, even more complex than traditional public administration topics like budgeting, personnel, and acquisition systems [in particular, look at the chapters in this collection by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160323X12440104">Ghere (2011</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160323X12440104">Hood (2011</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160323X12440104">Johnson, Pierce, and Lovrich (2011</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12440104">Karns, Shaffer, and Ghere (2011</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160323X12440104">Kearns (2011</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X12440104">O'Kelly (2011</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160323X12440104">Wheeler (2011</xref>) for thorough explorations on the complexities of modern accountability systems]. Consequently, it will take time for both academics and practitioners to realize the true scope and intricacy of accountability in the public sector.</p>
<p>Above all else, Dubnick and Frederickson’s <italic>Accountable Governance: Problems and Promises </italic>begins the process of moving the study of accountability from infancy to maturation as a valid subfield of public administration. It helps both academics and practitioners question the meaning, purpose, and value of accountability in the public sector. Such questions are desperately needed in today’s public administration where accountability is often emphasized but rarely understood. If accountability is to be a force for better governance, then we have to understand the forces that influence accountability and the complexity of implementing accountability in organizations. With this collection, we can begin that process of learning.</p>
