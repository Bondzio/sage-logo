<title>Objective:</title>
<p>Changing trends in multiple sclerosis (MS) epidemiology may first be apparent in the childhood population affected with first onset acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADSs). We aimed to determine the incidence, clinical, investigative and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of childhood central nervous system ADSs in the British Isles for the first time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1352458512445944">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>We conducted a population active surveillance study. All paediatricians, and ophthalmologists (<italic>n</italic> = 4095) were sent monthly reporting cards (September 2009–September 2010). International Paediatric MS Study Group 2007 definitions and McDonald 2010 MS imaging criteria were used for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Clinicians completed a standard questionnaire and provided an MRI copy for review.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1352458512445944">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Card return rates were 90%, with information available for 200/222 positive notifications (90%). After exclusion of cases, 125 remained (age range 1.3–15.9), with CIS in 66.4%, ADEM in 32.0% and NMO in 1.6%. The female-to-male ratio in children older than 10 years (<italic>n</italic> = 63) was 1.52:1 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.045). The incidence of first onset ADS in children aged 1–15 years old was 9.83 per million children per year (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.18–11.71). A trend towards higher incidence rates of ADS in children of South Asian and Black ethnicity was observed compared with White children. Importantly, a number of MRI characteristics distinguished ADEM from CIS cases. Of CIS cases with contrast imaging, 26% fulfilled McDonald 2010 MS diagnostic criteria.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1352458512445944">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>We report the highest surveillance incidence rates of childhood ADS. Paediatric MS diagnosis at first ADS presentation has implications for clinical practice and clinical trial design.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disabling and costly neurodegenerative disorder. Incidence of MS appears to be increasing worldwide with a rising female-to-male sex ratio,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512445944">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512445944">2</xref></sup> and with approximately 5% of adults who develop MS having first symptoms in childhood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512445944">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512445944">4</xref></sup> Some epidemiological evidence suggests early environmental exposures may influence MS risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512445944">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512445944">6</xref></sup> Hence, any epidemiological change in MS may be evident first in a paediatric population.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of MS in children, as in adults, is first heralded by onset of a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), or more rarely acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Children diagnosed with relapsing–remitting MS present with one of the central nervous system (CNS) acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS) followed by a second event usually within 2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512445944">7</xref></sup> Childhood CIS presentations with an abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (i.e. more than one high T2 signal) compared with ADEM are more likely to have relapsing disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512445944">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512445944">12</xref></sup> Recently, the new MRI McDonald 2010 MS criteria have been recommended for use in children presenting with a CIS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512445944">13</xref></sup> potentially allowing for MS diagnosis at first presentation of a CIS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512445944">14</xref></sup> There is no biomarker that differentiates between monophasic ADEM, monophasic CIS, or MS, hence a combination of clinical, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) positive oligoclonal bands and MRI features is suggested.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512445944">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512445944">15</xref></sup> MRI differences, in particular between ADEM and polyfocal CIS, are also not well recognized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512445944">16</xref></sup> The differential diagnosis of ADS is complex and wide, especially so in childhood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512445944">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The International Paediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group (IPMSSG) have published consensus definitions (2007) of paediatric CNS ADS and MS to facilitate uniformity in clinical practice and future epidemiological research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512445944">4</xref></sup> Two previous surveillance studies in Canada (2004–2007) and Germany (1997–1999) revealed an incidence ranging from 3.7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512445944">18</xref></sup> to 9.0 per million children per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512445944">19</xref></sup> The incidence of childhood ADS remains largely unknown worldwide, and as the incidence of these disorders based on the epidemiology of MS in adults is likely to differ geographically, estimates are needed from multiple geographical regions.</p>
<p>We report a multinational multisource<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458512445944">20</xref></sup> prospective active surveillance study in the British Isles (latitudes 50–59°N) to ascertain incidence, clinical, investigative and MRI features of childhood (age &lt;16 years) ADS using panel review to apply IPMSSG consensus definitions (including the incorporated McDonald MRI 2001 and Barkhof space diagnostic criteria).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512445944">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458512445944">21</xref></sup> We also apply the newly revised 2010 McDonald space and time diagnostic criteria at first ADS presentation;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512445944">13</xref></sup> and the recent Verhey MRI prognostic MS criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458512445944">22</xref></sup></p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-1352458512445944">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>We carried out a prospective active surveillance study of first episode ADS in children aged between 1 and 15 years 11 months of age, in the British Isles. We used multisource ascertainment via two well-established surveillance units in order to establish incidence of new cases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1352458512445944">
<title>The British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU), the primary source of data</title>
<p>The British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU) facilitates epidemiological surveillance of childhood diseases of public health importance in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The BPSU, launched in 1986, has helped initiate over 80 studies with a card return rate consistently higher than 93%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1352458512445944">
<title>The British Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit (BOSU), the alternative source of data for optic neuritis cases</title>
<p>The British Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit (BOSU) enables ophthalmologists to participate in the nationwide surveillance of uncommon ophthalmological conditions. The BOSU card return rate is consistently higher than 75%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1352458512445944">
<title>Case ascertainment via active surveillance</title>
<p>One month before commencing the study, a protocol card and letter was sent to all clinicians informing them of the study. Monthly notification cards (mean 4095/month) were sent by the BPSU (mean 2945/month) to all registered certified consultant paediatricians and paediatric neurologists and BOSU (mean 1150/month) to all registered ophthalmologists (between September 2009 and September 2010). In the British Isles, these clinicians are likely to see all cases of childhood ADS. Clinicians returned the card to the surveillance units notifying any cases or confirming ‘nothing to report’. Upon receipt of a positive notification the surveillance units provided the investigating team with a BPSU/BOSU case number and clinician contact details. The study team contacted the clinician directly, sending a detailed data collection form and a blank CD for an anonymized MRI. As more than one clinician might notify the same patient seen in different settings, minimal identifiers (National Health Service [NHS] number, district postcode, sex and date of birth) were used for record linkage and to exclude duplicates with a high level of certainty (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcpch.ac.uk/bpsu">http://www.rcpch.ac.uk/bpsu</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Initial surveillance reports</title>
<p>Using the IPMSSG consensus definitions for classification of paediatric ADS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512445944">4</xref></sup> we asked clinicians to report children experiencing clinical neurological events consistent with a first episode ADS and confirmed with white matter changes (except in optic neuritis) on MRI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458512445944">Table 1</xref>).</p>

Although a single MRI protocol was not feasible as this was a national population based study collecting data from established clinical practice from all centres, all MRI brain scans were performed on 1.5 T scanners and had a minimum of a T1-weighted and a T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence in two different planes. Additional sequences included gadolinium-enhanced T1, diffusion weighted and spine images. MRI slice thickness varied from 3–5 mm.</p>

<title>Panel classification and agreement for inclusion</title>
<p>The co-investigators met quarterly as a panel to review reported cases (at least four members present at each meeting). The panel consisted of paediatric neurologists (<italic>n</italic> = 8; CDG, CH, EW, MJL, MP, PJ, RK, WPW) with expertise in ADS, and final classification as per IPMSSG clinical criteria was arrived at by consensus. MRI images (with neuroradiologist scoring) were used to confirm the presence of lesions consistent with inflammatory demyelination, to aid in the exclusion of cases and to sub-classify CIS cases with asymptomatic MRI lesions (supplementary material appendix 1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512445944">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the key components of the dataset.

A sensitivity analysis was conducted on a worst-case scenario that all reported cases with missing clinical histories were actually cases of ADS to assess the potential impact on estimated incidence of ADS. We used a two source case capture–recapture analysis to estimate missed cases of optic neuritis on the assumption of independence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458512445944">27</xref></sup> but did not carry out capture–recapture analysis for other ADS, as referral networks mean that the assumption of independence was violated. The England 2010 index of multiple deprivation was used to derive the percentage of cases in England living in the 20% most deprived districts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458512445944">28</xref></sup> Parametric or non-parametric statistical tests (Kruskal–Wallis tests) were used for continuous distributions as appropriate given normality and χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher’s exact tests for nominal data. Agreement between reporters and the panel was measured using the Kappa statistic.

<title>Incidence of childhood CNS inflammatory demyelination in the British Isles</title>
<p>The minimum incidence of first onset ADS in children aged 1–15 years old in the British Isles is 9.83 per million children per year (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.18–11.71). Incidence was highest in England and Wales (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458512445944">Table 2</xref>).

<title>Demographic characteristics</title>
<p>Median age was 10.0 years (range 1.3–15.9; mean 9.74 years, SD 4.34) and 51.2% (<italic>n</italic> = 64) of cases were female (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1352458512445944">Table 3</xref>).

The female-to-male ratio in children younger than 10 years (<italic>n</italic> = 62) was 0.72:1 and in older than 10 years (<italic>n</italic> = 63) was 1.52:1.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The minimum incidence of first onset childhood ADS in the British Isles is 9.83 per million (95% CI 8.18–11.71) children per year aged 1–15 years. This is the highest reported incidence of childhood ADS from a prospective childhood surveillance study. To date, there have been two surveillance studies studying ADS. A Canadian surveillance study (2004–2007) estimated the incidence of childhood ADS to be 9.0 per million people aged less than 18 years old,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512445944">19</xref></sup> with 22% classified as ADEM and 78% as CIS. Although this study did not have MRI review and was conducted prior to the IPMSSG consensus definitions, it is unlikely that these factors would have had a major influence on classification. An earlier surveillance study from Germany (1997–1999) estimated the incidence of MS in children &lt;16 years as 3.0 per million children, and that of ADEM as only 0.7 per year per million children aged less than 16 years old.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512445944">18</xref></sup> This study asked clinicians to report new cases of definite or suspected MS or ADEM cases, and did not include other ADS. Diagnosis of MS and ADS depends on clinical definitions and MRI criteria used, and hence it may be that these ascertainment estimates would change with current definitions and criteria (supplementary material appendix 3).</p>
<p>The mean age of onset (9.7 years) was similar to the Canadian incidence study (mean 10.5 years) and a French<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512445944">9</xref></sup> (children &lt;16 years, 1985-2001) first episode ADS retrospective cohort study (mean 9.9 years), but older than a Dutch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512445944">10</xref></sup> (children &lt;16 years, 1990–2010) retrospective cohort study (8.5 years). A recent retrospective study from the USA (<italic>n</italic> = 85) showed the incidence of childhood ADS and MS to be higher in Black children compared with White and Hispanic children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458512445944">31</xref></sup> While non-White ethnic groups were over-represented in our study (<italic>n</italic> = 125), this did not reach statistical significance. Although there is limited power to compare subgroups in the study, this still contrasts with the adult MS population where white ethnic groups are over-represented. Adult and paediatric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512445944">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512445944">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458512445944">32</xref></sup> MS studies have shown that adolescent females are over-represented compared with males with ratios of up to 3:1. An adult CIS study has also shown a higher risk ratio of females developing CIS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458512445944">33</xref></sup> the first presentation of MS. Our study shows that in childhood first onset ADS, sex ratios also varied with age, with more females in the older age groups (F:M ratio of 1.52:1 in children over 10 years). Children older than 10 years more often had CIS compared with those less than 10 years of age who presented more often with ADEM. A Japanese retrospective multicenter study showed the male-to-female ratio of ADEM to be 2.3:1, and that ADEM was three times more common than MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1352458512445944">34</xref></sup> In addition previous UK epidemiological adult studies have shown that MS hospital admissions, incidence and prevalence were higher in those living in least deprived areas. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1352458512445944">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1352458512445944">36</xref></sup> Our study showed that children with ADS living in the most 20% deprived areas (in England) were more likely to be males and of non-White ethnicity. These observations regarding the geographical deprivation indices and demographics of childhood ADS (over-representation of older females with CIS, and children with Black and South Asian ethnicity) add further support to the hypothesis that environmental influences may indeed be acting as early as in childhood.</p>
<p>This study is not without limitations. As with other epidemiological studies, some cases may not have been reported or have had sub-clinical presentations, and it is plausible that children in our study who met McDonald 2010 criteria for MS at first clinical presentation may have had previous symptoms not identified as ADS. This was addressed as far as was possible by using clear consensus case definitions and multiple sources of case ascertainment. A capture–recapture analysis estimated that a possible 16 ON cases were missed out of a potential 47, although this relies on assumptions of complete independence that may not hold in practice.</p>
<p>Our study shows that childhood CIS occurs more often than ADEM (ratio 2.1:1) and also confirms a previous report that ADEM can be a severe disease with one death and one in five requiring intensive care admission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1352458512445944">37</xref></sup> The proportion of children with ADEM in our cohort (32%) was slightly higher than French<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512445944">9</xref></sup> (29%), Canadian (22%), and Dutch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512445944">10</xref></sup> cohorts (termed polyfocal ADS with encephalopathy, not ADEM).</p>
<p>We found that 43% of CIS patients had one or more asymptomatic brain lesion. Previous studies have shown that children with CIS with abnormal brain scans are at a higher risk of relapse than those without asymptomatic brain lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512445944">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512445944">12</xref></sup> Also it is of interest that a number of MRI measures significantly helped differentiate ADEM from CIS cases. For example, ADEM cases compared with CIS had more deep grey nuclei and cortical grey matter high T2 signal lesions. CIS cases had more periventricular, deep white matter, corpus callosum high T2 signal lesions and black holes.</p>
<p>CSF lymphocytosis and negative oligoclonal bands were associated with an ADEM diagnosis, in contrast to a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512445944">16</xref></sup> It is of interest that one case was reported as positive for the common mutation in the RANBP2 gene, which has been recently described in familial or recurrent acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458512445944">30</xref></sup> With the increasing recognition of the overlap between the MRI and clinical features of ADEM and ANE, and further reports of other genetically predetermined encephalopathies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458512445944">38</xref></sup> this potential novel group of genetic determinant(s) of encephalopathy in demyelination requires exploration.</p>
<p>A total of 26% of CIS cases who had gadolinium given scans (<italic>n</italic> = 38) fulfilled McDonald 2010 MRI criteria for MS at onset (space and time), hence a minimum 12% of CIS patients met McDonald 2010 MS diagnostic criteria at diagnosis. In addition 24% of CIS cases fulfilled either McDonald 2010 or Verhey criteria which are thought to indicate higher risk of MS, although both the McDonald criteria and the Verhey model require further validation in prospective multinational cohorts. This is particularly the case as in this study 8/10 of cases fulfilling McDonald 2010 MS criteria did not meet the criteria from Verhey’s predictive model. We have previously shown that 61% of children eventually diagnosed with MS and who had contrast-enhanced scans at ADS onset fulfilled McDonald 2010 MS criteria at first scan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512445944">14</xref></sup> Not all children in this study had spinal imaging and contrast administered, and MRI sequence variation could have affected the sensitivity of MRI.</p>
<p>The potential to diagnose MS at disease onset has implications for MRI protocols for children with suspected ADS, and individual patient treatment decisions. This may be particularly important as new MS drugs are emerging with reported better efficacy in adults than current injectables, and the simultaneous requirement for new drugs to undergo testing in children with the aim of ensuring robust evidence to support authorization by regulatory agencies. To date, eight new MS drugs have been recommended for a Paediatric Investigation Plan,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1352458512445944">39</xref></sup> hence earlier diagnosis may increase the eligible clinical trial population. Prognostic and outcome data are needed to inform these decisions. A prospective 2-year follow up of this patient cohort is under way and a further multicentre cohort study with detailed outcome measurements and a biobank have been established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1352458512445944">40</xref></sup> These should yield prognostic information and aid validation of consensus definitions, and the clinical utility of the new McDonald and Verhey proposed MRI criteria for early diagnosis of MS in children.</p>
