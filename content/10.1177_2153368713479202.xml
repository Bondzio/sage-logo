<p>In <italic>The Wrong Complexion for Protection: How the Government Response to Disaster Endangers African American Communities</italic>, Robert D. Bullard and Beverly Wright provide an intersectional examination for understanding and addressing environmental disasters by interconnecting race, class, and place. This book raises the debate of a government’s responsibility to its citizens in the time of need. To what extent do we expect the local, state, and federal governments to assist U.S. citizens in the aftermath of a disaster? Debates ensue between the Left and the Right, the liberals and the conservatives about the role of government. The United States was in the midst of this debate—and at high levels of exchange—when Hurricane/Superstorm Sandy struck the eastern seaboard of the country a week before the 2012 presidential election. Liberals and Democrats believed they won the debate for governmental oversight when Sandy’s appearance provided a real example of the need for <italic>federal</italic> government, in particular, to be responsible for the overarching response to natural and human-caused hazards or disasters. At least 111 lives were lost in the United States and 67 in the Caribbean. More than 8 million people are reported to have lost electric power to their homes and businesses. Political oversight, in general, was the major issue raised in the wake of Sandy, and race (and racism) was not as salient a factor as was the case with Hurricane Katrina. However, <italic>The Wrong Complexion for Protection</italic> makes a compelling case regarding the need for government oversight <italic>and</italic> more effective and equal policies that would provide equal protection regardless of race and place. Bullard and Wright’s proclamation that “[r]ace maps closely with geographic vulnerability” (p. 72) becomes quite evident in their accounting of a variety of devastating cases that demonstrate the environmental injustice experienced by African Americans.</p>
<p>Typifying “[w]ho we are is what we do” (p. 9), in the first two chapters, Bullard and Wright situate their professional work in their personal experiences with growing up in neglected southern African American communities disproportionately affected in adverse ways by human-made environmental hazards and natural disasters. Bullard convincingly details how Jim Crow “separate but equal” laws relegated Black neighborhoods in his town of Elba, Alabama, to areas that were repeatedly flooded, while White neighborhoods located in high-lying areas of the town were not affected. Wright offers a personal view into how Hurricane Katrina washed away everything in her home. Having been born and raised in New Orleans and later resettling there after completing her graduate studies, Wright has a great affinity for her hometown and echoes the voices of many affected by and witnessing the experiences of New Orleanians and others in the wake of Hurricane Katrina: “I was heartbroken and angry. It was as if I were watching some cataclysmic event in a Third World country, far, far away. This couldn’t possibly be happening in the United States! Who would have ever believed that this country would respond to the suffering of its people in such a callous and indifferent manner?” (p. 30). As scholars who have spent decades studying environmental racism and as activists for environmental justice, Bullard and Wright enlighten the reader to the calamitous effects of hurricanes and other disasters and hazards, such as toxic contamination, industrial accidents, and human experiments. They intricately weave the way in which race, class, and place, and government actions (or inactions) have situated lower income African Americans (and other people of color) in vulnerable settings in the United States.</p>
<p>In highlighting Hurricane Katrina, Bullard and Wright reframe and reiterate the thinking around the effects of the disaster by underscoring it as “unnatural and caused by humans” (p. 73). In Chapter 3, the authors provide a backdrop of African American mistrust in governmental response to disasters by the time Katrina hit land. They detail a select number of disasters that demonstrate the history of the local, state, and federal government response to individuals and communities affected by tropical storms, hurricanes, and floods; particularly drawing attention to how African Americans were not equally protected. Bullard and Wright emphasize that in the wake of a natural (or unnatural) disaster, African Americans, effectively, suffer from the “second disaster” of discriminatory practices and responses by government policy and officials.</p>
<p>In their ongoing examination of the racialized outcomes of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans in the years since the storm, in Chapter 4 Bullard and Wright recount that approximately 80% of the New Orleans homes that were destroyed were occupied by Blacks, and “Whites were far more likely to make it back to New Orleans than blacks. The percentage of the population that was black fell to 60.2 percent from 67.3 percent” (p. 76). In what they title the “twenty-point plan to destroy Black New Orleans,” the authors offer a compelling and rousing critique. The plan strategically draws attention to the sociological and racial implications of Hurricane Katrina by outlining how practices before and after the storm discriminatorily affected African Americans and the poor. This plan included the selective distribution of Federal Emergency Management Agency grants, the rendering of relatively insufficient insurance settlements to Black policyholders, and the absence of a commitment to rebuild and reestablish government housing for low-income evacuees. Bullard and Wright are impenitent in their offering of these activities that disparagingly impacted people of color and low-income individuals. Indeed, some readers may liken this list to a “conspiracy theory”; however, Bullard and Wright judiciously provide a comprehensive assessment to substantiate a concerted effort to displace individuals who have been relegated to the lower end of racial and socioeconomical hierarchies. Their critical attention to the racialized aftermath of the storm enables Bullard and Wright to recommend feasible initiatives to prevent a similar response to future natural disasters. These include implementing standards that allow for equal protection, equal funding, and cleanup standards in low-income and African American (and other people of color) communities.</p>
<p>In the remaining substantive chapters of the book, Bullard and Wright shift to <italic>human</italic>-caused environmental hazards. In Chapter 5, they provide scrupulous and enlightening instances of how African Americans have been disadvantaged with regard to exposure to environmental contaminants in their neighborhoods. The authors indicate that some of the best environmental laws are those established in the United States; however, these laws are not enforced equally across communities. In addition to the need for wrongs against the individuals disparately affected by environmental toxins to be <italic>civilly</italic> righted, Bullard and Wright call for <italic>criminal</italic> justice: “Allowing polluters and violators of clean-water laws to escape punishment and to endanger the public should be a crime. The nation’s clean-water laws should be enforced equally across the board—not selectively enforced on the basis of residents’ income or a community’s capacity to hire lawyers, experts, and scientists” (p. 104).</p>
<p>In Chapter 6, “Nightmare on Eno Road: Poisoned Water and Toxic Racism in Dixon, Tennessee,” Bullard and Wright provide an in-depth narrative of an alarming case that epitomizes environmental racism. The chapter focuses on an African American family, the Holts, who spent many years battling the city, county, and state in which their farm was located. The Holts’s property is a mere 54 ft from a landfill that has been found to have contaminated the water wells used by the family. Although government tests verified that the wells had been contaminated by a volatile organic chemical (trichloroethylene) that has been linked to an increased risk in contracting cancer, the Holts have faced significant challenges in having their complaints of contamination from the landfill being addressed. Bullard and Wright establish, however, that testing, monitoring, and solutions were provided for White families whose springs and wells were affected. Bullard and Wright’s use of case study puts a face on those affected by differential and deferential treatment in governmental response to African Americans affected by environmentally unsound surroundings and conditions.</p>
<p>Bullard and Wright next move to offer detail on several instances of “industrial accidents” in Chapter 7. They convincingly provide details of disparate effects on African Americans from irresponsible and disregarding acts of industrial companies since the 1930s. These accidents disproportionately affected African Americans because of the location of where the incidents occurred or where resulting debris were dumped. One of these incidents was the explosion of the British Petroleum (BP) oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, which caused the death of 11 workers on the rig and resulted in the largest oil spill in the United States. Although not widely reported by news media, Bullard and Wright report that about 42% of the BP waste went to landfills in communities where people of color comprised the majority of residents.</p>
<p>The final substantive area of environmental racism examined in the book focuses on the authors “link[ing] racism to ill health and health disparities” (p. 206). Bullard and Wright include a discussion on the impact that biomedical research has had on African Americans’ trust in this research and in the health care system. They remind the reader of the well-known, federally funded, 40-year (1932–1972) Tuskegee syphilis experiment in which 400 Black men were not informed by medical professionals that they had been infected with syphilis and were then not provided medical treatment in order for the researchers to trace the natural evolution of the disease. But the authors go beyond this horrific travesty of scientific exploration to detail more recent examples of “abuses masked as research” (p. 207), such as the Baltimore, Maryland lead paint experiment conducted from 1993 to 1995 that involved the intentional exposure of lead paint in homes occupied by mostly Black and poor children. The chapter concludes with the authors questioning if future actions by the federal government will involve equal protection from biomedical experiments and bioterrorism. Although not as rich with examples as compared with the preceding topics in the book, the chapter further substantiates the existence of environmental racism in the United States.</p>
<p>Bullard and Wright are careful to not only highlight the social and structural climate that places African Americans at further disadvantage when a disaster strikes, they also provide recommendations that would prevent delays for assistance and prevent unfairness in providing that assistance. The policy recommendations include the implementation of environmental justice by guaranteeing equal access to funding, health risk assessments, cleanup, public health protections and medical treatment, and environmentally sound rebuilding practices. These recommendations not only assure unbiased services to African Americans, they make certain that all individuals and communities are cared for before, during, and after an environmental disaster.</p>
<p>A limitation of this book is in its structural presentation. Copyediting would have been especially useful to catch grammatical errors and the considerable number of redundant passages that interfere with the flow of one’s reading of the important content imparted in this book. Further, a beneficial inclusion would have been an elucidation of differing responses by and to African Americans based on gender. Nevertheless, this book should be required reading for anyone concerned about social justice for African Americans. The issues imparted by Bullard and Wright demonstrate how natural and unnatural hazards have unfairly impacted African Americans and will continue to do so if public officials fail to deem the practices that place African Americans in harm’s way as violations of the civil rights that we demand and have come to expect in the United States.</p>
