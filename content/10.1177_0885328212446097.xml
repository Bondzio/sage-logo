<p>The corium is decreased to about half of its thickness in skin defects and wrinkles due to gravity and environment. In this study, dexamethasone/poly(<sc>d,l</sc>-lactic acid) (<italic>Mn</italic> = 160,000) microspheres were incorporated into poly(ethylene glycol)–poly(ɛ-caprolactone)–poly(ethylene glycol) (<italic>Mn</italic> = 3300) hydrogel to prepare an injectable hydrogel composite. The composite was designed to increase the thickness of the corium. Dexamethasone/poly(<sc>d,l</sc>-lactic acid) microspheres were prepared by oil-in-water emulsion/solvent evaporation technique. The properties of microspheres were investigated by size distribution measurement, scanning electron microscope and x-ray diffraction. Drug loading, encapsulation efficiency, and drug delivery behavior of microspheres were also studied in detail. Cell adhesion of microspheres was investigated by NIH3T3 cell in vitro. The properties of hydrogel composite were investigated by scanning electron microscope, rheological measurements and methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. Drug release from composite was determined by HPLC-UV analysis. These results suggested that poly(<sc>d,l</sc>-lactic acid) microspheres encapsulating dexamethasone embedded in poly(ethylene glycol)–poly(ɛ-caprolactone)–poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel might have prospective application in orthopedic tissue engineering field.</p>

<p>Gravity which changes in facial physiology (bone resorption, atrophy of facial muscles, and fat) and environment (solar, tobacco, and nutritional) insidiously deteriorates the full-contoured, soft-textured face which are characteristic of youth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328212446097">1</xref></sup> More types of treatment are available for facial wrinkles than for any other physiological aging process. Small wrinkles such as crow’s feet, perioral lines, and wrinkled cheeks can be effectively cured with dermabrasion, chemical peel, or CO<sub>2</sub>-laser resurfacing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328212446097">2</xref></sup> Striking folds like glabellar frowns, nasolabial folds, or depressed corners of the mouth have to be surgically stretched or filled the gap within the dermis with biological or artificial implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328212446097">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Injectable skin fillers attract increasing attention because it can be realized easily. The currently available injectable skin fillers can be divided into three categories: those that function to replace tissue lost by aging process; those that stimulate endogenous connective tissue growth; and permanent fillers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328212446097">4</xref></sup> The use of replacement fillers (collagen, hyaluronic acid, and biologic fillers) is hampered because of their relatively brief duration of effect. Permanent fillers (polymethylmethacrylate, silicone, and hydroxyethylmethacrylate) are appealing to some patients. However, when treatment imperfections do occur, remedies can be problematic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328212446097">5</xref></sup> With careful assessment, stimulatory fillers (poly(<sc>d,l</sc>-lactic acid) (PLA) and calcium hydroxylapatite) are the most ideal ones. They are capable of recontouring and lifting the face to restore youthful arcs and convexities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328212446097">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>PLA which belongs to the alpha-hydroxy acid family is an immunologically inert, synthetic, biocompatible, biodegradable, and absorbable polymer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328212446097">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328212446097"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328212446097"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328212446097">10</xref></sup> It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for restoration and/or correction of the signs of facial fat loss in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328212446097">5</xref></sup> This indication, combined with a European experience that indicates a clinical benefit persisting for up to 2 years, has made PLA a popular injectable soft-tissue filler in healthy patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328212446097">1</xref></sup> The commercially available preparation for facial volumetric correction consists of microparticles (40–63 µm) suspended in sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and mannitol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328212446097">11</xref></sup> There are three differences between soft tissue filler we prepared and the commercial product. First, the particle size is 91.93 ± 1.31 µm, larger than that of commercial products. The same as commercial products, microspheres (91.93 ± 1.31 µm) we prepared are too larger for phagocytosis and may become porous during enzymatic degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328212446097">12</xref></sup> The rate of polymer degradation decreases with the increase of the microsphere size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328212446097">13</xref></sup> Therefore, the microspheres we prepared may have longer efficacy than the commercial products in stimulating endogenous connective tissue growth. Furthermore, microspheres we prepared has a more uniform particle size. Second, dexamethasone was encapsulated into PLA microsphere. Some researchers indicate that injected PLA stimulates a foreign body reaction, locally leading to collagen production, dermal fibrosis, and facial augmentation. However, Amard ultrasonically measured a mean increase in dermal thickness of 151% at 12 weeks, 196% at 24 weeks, and 131% at 54 weeks in 33 HIV patients who used PLA in 2000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328212446097">14</xref></sup> Those HIV patients had no immune system. Therefore, foreign body reaction is not the reason that dermal thickness is increased. Specific properties of the commercial products cause it to be particularly prone to granuloma formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328212446097">12</xref></sup> There is two-phase inflammatory reaction: an initial, moderate inflammatory response and a later, more severe inflammatory phase involving numerous foreign body giant cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328212446097">15</xref></sup> The rate of nodule or papule formation has been reported to range from less than 1% to as high as 10%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328212446097">16</xref></sup> Those hardened granulomas have been seen to appear up to 12 months following injection and may require surgical excision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328212446097">6</xref></sup> Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid is known to have a wide variety of biological effects, especially in modulation and suppression of immune function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328212446097">17</xref></sup> With its high potency and effectiveness on multiple organ systems, we choose it for this research. Its serious systemic side effects can be avoided via microsphere system. Dexamethasone could suppress the initial inflammatory response through burst-release and the later inflammatory response through sustained-release. No granulomas would appear. Finally, poly(ethylene glycol)–poly(ɛ-caprolactone)–poly(ethylene glycol) (PECE) solution serves as a vehicle for subdermal implantation instead of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and mannitol. In previous works of our group,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328212446097">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328212446097">19</xref></sup> PECE triblock copolymer has been prepared successfully. PECE solution undergoes sol–gel–sol transition, which is free flowing sol at room temperature and becomes a non-flowing gel at body temperature. There will be 2 weeks for the biodegradation of PECE in vivo. The great thermosensitivity of PECE solution contributes to the injection of loaded microspheres and can prevent loaded microspheres migrating into the place where it is not needed to be filled.</p>

<p>The triblock PECE copolymer used in this study was synthesized according to the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328212446097">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328212446097">19</xref></sup> The molecular weight (<italic>Mn</italic>) of PECE copolymer was 3.3 × 10<sup>3</sup> which was determined by gel permeation chromatography test. PLA was obtained from NatureWorks (USA, 4032D, <italic>Mn</italic> = 160,000). Dexamethasone (C<sub>22</sub>H<sub>29</sub>FO<sub>5</sub>; FW = 392.5) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were provided by Sigma. Tween 80, sodium azide, phosphate buffer saline, and dichloromethane were gained from Kelong Chemicals, Chengdu, China. Acetonitrile high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade was purchased from EM Science, Merck KGaA (Germany). Ultrafiltrated water was obtained from Milli Q plus, Millipore (USA). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Sigma, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was used without any treatment.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0885328212446097"><title>Microsphere formulation</title>
<p>Loaded microspheres or blank PLA microspheres were prepared by oil-in-water emulsion/solvent evaporation technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328212446097">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328212446097"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328212446097">22</xref></sup> Briefly, 2 g PLA was dissolved in 20 mL methylene chloride, for dexamethasone loaded microspheres, different amounts of dexamethasone to make the microspheres containing dexamethasone of 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% wt, respectively, was dispersed in this solution using a homogenizer at 10,000 r/min for 5 min. This organic phase was added into 100 mL of a 2% (w/v) aqueous PVA (Av, <italic>Mn</italic> = 30,000–70,000) solution and stirred at 900 r/min for 3 min. The emulsion was poured into 300 mL of 0.1% (w/v) aqueous PVA solution and agitated at 250 r/min for 6 h. The resultant microspheres were washed three times with double distilled deionized sterile water and dried under a vacuum for 24 h.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0885328212446097"><title>Surface morphology</title>
<p>The surface morphologies of loaded microspheres (wt = 10%) and loaded microspheres (wt = 10%)/PECE hydrogel composite were observed on a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEM-100CX, Japan). Moreover, the cross-sectional morphologies of loaded microspheres (wt = 10%)/PECE hydrogel composite were detected under SEM else.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0885328212446097"><title>Determination of microsphere diameters and diameter distribution</title>
<p>Loaded microspheres or blank PLA microspheres were first dispersed in distilled water uniformly, and then microsphere diameters and diameter distributions (Spans) were determined using Malvern Mastersizer (Malvern 2000, Malvern Instruments, UK). The microsphere diameters quoted are obtained from at least 20 repeat runs. The size span is a measure of the particle size distribution and is expressed as (D(0.9)–D(0.1))/D(0.5), where D(0.9) is the diameter under which 90% of the particles fall, D(0.5) the diameter under which 50% of the particles fall, and D(0.1) the diameter under which 10% of the particles fall.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0885328212446097"><title>Microsphere encapsulation analysis</title>
<p>Total drug content of loaded microspheres was determined by dissolving microspheres in methylene chloride/methanol (v/v = 5:3) and using UV spectrophotometry (Cecil 9000, Cecil Instruments Ltd, Cambridge, UK) at 240 nm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328212446097">23</xref></sup> Drug loading efficiency was calculated as the actual drug loading divided by theoretical drug content multiplied by 100.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0885328212446097"><title>X-ray diffraction</title>
<p>The samples for x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were blank microsphere, loaded microsphere (wt = 10%), and dexamethasone. XRD was performed on an X’Pert Pro MPD DY1291 (PHILIPS, the Netherlands) diffractometer using graphite monochromatized Cu-K radiation (<italic>λ</italic> = 0.1542 nm; 40 kV; 40 mA). The samples were measured in the 2<italic>θ</italic> range from 10° to 60° at a scanning rate of 4°min<sup>−1</sup>.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0885328212446097"><title>NIH3T3 cell culture and attachment</title>
<p>The immortalized NIH3T3 cell (obtained from ATCC, USA) was chosen to evaluate the ability of the loaded microspheres to support cell adhesion. NIH3T3 cell was cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS.</p>
<p>Ten milligrams of loaded microspheres (wt = 10%) sterilized by Cobalt-60 irradiation were put into a well of 24-well plate. 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded into the well, after 4 h cultivation, we removed the medium from the well and washed microspheres three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Subsequently, microspheres were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 24 h at 4℃, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol/water solution, dried, and sputter-coated with gold–palladium (AuPd), finally we observed them on a SEM (JEM-100CX) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0885328212446097"><title>Rheological study of loaded microspheres (wt = 10%)/PECE hydrogel composites</title>
<p>Rheological measurements of the aqueous PECE copolymer solution and loaded miscrospheres (wt = 10%)/PECE composites solution were performed using an AR2000ex rheometer (TA Instruments, USA). The samples were put between parallel plates of 40 mm diameter and with a gap of 1 mm. The heating rate was 2℃/min in the range 10–60℃. The storage modulus (G′), loss modulus (G′′), and complex viscosity (n*) were measured as functions of temperature. A frequency of 1 Hz and a strain of 1% were used in order to maintain a linear viscoelastic region.</p>

Therefore, raising drug loading did not significantly affect drug loading efficiency. It may due to the same viscosity in a droplet of the internal phase during the preparation of samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328212446097">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328212446097">26</xref></sup> It can be seen that the average size of samples was 86.14–91.93 µm which was regarded within the same particle size range considering their SDs. The size span of S-1, S-2, and S-3 was 0.62 ± 0.06, 0.66 ± 0.01, and 0.58 ± 0.05, small size span of them demonstrated those microspheres were uniform, the size span of S-4 and S-5 was 1.02 ± 0.40 and 1.27 ± 0.51 which showed those microspheres were not uniform. Due to the crystallization of dexamethasone, with the increase of drug loading, its molecules prefer to assemble with other molecules instead of being dispersed within the PLA microsphere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328212446097">27</xref></sup> As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328212446097">Figure 1</xref> showed, microspheres of S-1, S-2, and S-3 were regular, S-4 and S-5 were very inregular, it was the same as size span of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328212446097">Table 1</xref> presented.

<p>The mechanical properties of the PECE copolymer solution and aqueous loaded microspheres (wt = 10%)/PECE composite solution were detected by oscillatory rheological tests as a function of temperature.

When the temperature was below 32℃, the values of G′ and G′′ were about 1 Pa for all samples, which indicated that the samples all remained in the liquid state and could ﬂow freely. When the temperature increased above 32℃, the G′, G′′, and complex viscosity values increased rapidly. The change of aqueous samples from a liquid-like to an elastic gel-like state occurred at the crossover point of G′ and G′′ which was detected at about 37℃. When the temperature increased above 43℃ the G′, G′′, and complex viscosity decreased quickly, revealing that the samples changed from gel state to sol state.

However, the absorbance did not show statistical difference from the values obtained from the negative control.

<p>In this study, dexamethasone-loaded PLA microspheres/PECE hydrogel composite was designed for orthopedic tissue engineering. Loaded microspheres (wt = 10%) with great homogeneity were about 90 µm in diameter. The drug loading and drug efficiency was 6.34 ± 0.36% and 63.38 ± 3.64%, respectively. The surface of microspheres was uneven because of the large diameter of microspheres. NIH3T3 cells could adhere on the surface of microspheres in vitro<italic>.</italic> The capability of cell adhesion could insure that microspheres would be encapsulated with collagen fibers secreted by the body’s own fibroblasts with the time of PECE’s degradation. Adding loaded microspheres into PECE solution did not change PECE solution’s thermosensitivity. Loaded microspheres (wt = 10%)/PECE hydrogel composite had great 3D structure and showed mild cytotoxicity to NIH3T3 cells in vitro by MTT assay. Cumulative release of dexamethasone from loaded microspheres (wt = 10%)/PECE composite and loaded microspheres (wt = 10%) was not different and exhibited a biphasic pattern. Owing to these results, the dexamethasone-loaded PLA microspheres/PECE hydrogel composite is a prospective candidate as an injectable biomaterial for orthopedic tissue engineering.</p>
