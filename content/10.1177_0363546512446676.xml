<sec id="section1-0363546512446676">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Shortcuts for throwing 3 alternating reversed half-hitches on alternating posts (RHAPs), in which the post is switched by alternating strand tension to “flip” the knot, have been advocated but never validated in a biomechanical study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512446676">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>Shortcut tying techniques will affect knot security or loop security.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512446676">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Controlled laboratory study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512446676">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A single surgeon tied 90 knots using No. 2 FiberWire through an arthroscopic cannula. Half had a static “surgeon’s base,” and half had a Tennessee slider base. Three techniques were used to create 3 RHAPs: (1) rethreading, (2) knot “flipping” where half-hitches were tensioned by past-pointing, and (3) knot “flipping” where half-hitches were tensioned by alternating past-pointing and over-pointing. Each knot was subjected to a preload of 5 N, followed by 1000 cycles of 5 N to 45 N at 1 Hz, and a single load to failure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512446676">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>When compared with Tennessee knots, surgeon’s knots had a lower incidence of knot slippage and catastrophic failure as well as higher loads to clinical and ultimate failure. Shortcut techniques did not affect the properties of surgeon’s knots. However, when used to secure Tennessee knots, past-pointing decreased load to clinical failure and ultimate load to failure. Over-pointing increased the incidence of knot slippage and catastrophic failure and decreased load to clinical failure and ultimate load to failure. Loop security was marginally increased by both past-pointing and over-pointing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512446676">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>When all tying techniques are considered, surgeon’s knots outperform Tennessee sliding knots. Shortcut techniques do not alter the properties of surgeon’s knots. However, when used to secure Tennessee sliding knots, shortcuts lead to unacceptably high rates of knot slippage and catastrophic failure as well as decreased knot security.</p>

<p>Arthroscopic reconstructive procedures of the shoulder are gaining in popularity, and as a result, secure and efficient arthroscopic knot tying has become a subject of great interest. The mechanical properties of arthroscopic knots are an important factor affecting the integrity of rotator cuff and labral repairs, and they are defined by the knot’s ability to maintain a tight suture loop as it is tied (loop security<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512446676">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512446676">6</xref></sup>) and by its ability to resist slippage and breakage as load is applied (knot security<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512446676">5</xref></sup>). Knot security depends on friction, internal interference, and slack between throws.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512446676">5</xref></sup> In the search for the optimal arthroscopic knot, a number of biomechanical studies have evaluated different knot configurations and suture materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512446676">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512446676">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512446676">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512446676"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512446676">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512446676">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although there is no consensus regarding the ideal knot configuration or suture material, basic knot-tying principles have been identified that improve knot and loop security. Reversing the direction of half-hitches and switching the post limb between throws each increase knot security by increasing friction and internal interference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512446676">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512446676">14</xref></sup> Thus, a series of reversed half-hitches on alternating posts (RHAPs) is the most secure configuration for static knots consisting of stacked half-hitches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512446676">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, the addition of at least 3 RHAPs has been shown to maximize the knot security of most complex sliding knots.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512446676">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512446676">14</xref></sup> Past-pointing is a technique in which the knot pusher is advanced beyond the knot stack while the surgeon maintains tension on the post limb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512446676">Figure 1A</xref>). This is thought to improve knot security by reducing slack between throws.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512446676">8</xref></sup></p>

<p>Techniques for locking half-hitches. (A) Past-pointing. Tension is kept on the post limb, while the wrapping limb is advanced past the knot with the pusher. (B) Over-pointing. Tension is kept on the post limb, and the knot is pushed down the post with the pusher while pulling the slack out of the wrapping limb. The pusher is advanced directly over the knot stack.</p>

</fig>
<p>Conventional post switching involves rethreading the knot pusher to the other suture limb, which increases the time required to tie the knot. To increase knot-tying efficiency, Chan and Burkhart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512446676">8</xref></sup> described a technique for switching posts simply by alternating tension on the suture limbs. This “flips” the knot, and the wrapping limb effectively becomes the post.</p>
<p>Meier and Meier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512446676">16</xref></sup> noted a potential flaw of leaving the knot pusher on the same suture limb while tying RHAPs. When a “flipped” knot is tensioned, past-pointing may inadvertently revert the knot to its original configuration. This converts a series of RHAPs into a series of identical half-hitches on the same post, a configuration that has inferior knot security. To avoid this problem, they suggested over-pointing, rather than past-pointing, when the knot pusher is on the post limb. To over-point, the knot pusher is advanced directly over the knot stack while maintaining tension on the post strand and pulling slack from the loop strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512446676">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite this recent attention given to new shortcuts in arthroscopic tying, objective, quantitative evaluation of these methods is lacking. We hypothesized that tying RHAPs without rethreading the knot pusher would negatively affect knot and loop security.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>A priori power analysis was used to determine the required sample size. We set the probability of a type I error (α) at .05, the probability of a type II error (β) at .8, and the effect size at .6. The recommended total sample size was 90, for an actual power of 80%. All knots were tied by a single fellowship-trained surgeon (D.S.H.) wearing sterile gloves and using a single high-strength No. 2 suture consisting of braided polyester with a polyethylene core (FiberWire, Arthrex, Naples, Florida). The suture was soaked in 0.9% NaCl solution for a minimum of 5 minutes before tying. Knots were tied through an arthroscopic cannula with an 8-mm inner diameter (Arthrex) using a single-lumen knot pusher (model AR-1305, Arthrex) and secured around a 30-mm-circumference smooth stainless steel dowel submerged in 0.9% NaCl solution. All knots were initiated with an underhand throw. Fifteen knots were tied for each combination of knot configuration and post switching method, for a total of 90 knots. Surgeon’s knots and Tennessee slider knots were all created arthroscopically as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512446676">7</xref></sup> The surgeon’s knot consists of 3 identical half-hitches tied on the same post secured by 3 RHAPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512446676">7</xref></sup> The order in which knots were tied was randomized to minimize the effects of surgeon technical improvement over time, surgeon fatigue, or both.</p>
<p>All knots were tested within 7 days of being tied. In the interim, they were stored in 0.9% NaCl at 37°C. Each individual knot was tested using a servohydraulic materials testing system (MTS, Instron model 1321, Instron Corp, Norwood, Massachusetts) fitted with a 500-N load cell (model 41, Honeywell International Inc, Morristown, New Jersey). Each suture loop was removed from the 30-mm dowel and placed over 2 parallel rods with the knot positioned midway between the rods. The upper rod was mounted to the MTS actuator, and the lower rod was mounted to the MTS base plate within a custom fixture that contained a 0.9% NaCl solution bath kept at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512446676">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Direct measurement of loop security is challenging. The most commonly accepted surrogate measurement in the literature is a change in loop circumference after applying a load of 5 N.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512446676">14</xref></sup> All knots were removed from the dowel and placed on the MTS crossheads. The crosshead displacement was measured and used to calculate the loop circumference as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512446676">14</xref></sup>: loop circumference = (2 × crosshead displacement) + (4 × rod radius) + rod circumference. Loop security was calculated as the difference between the loop circumference at 5 N and the circumference of the knot-tying dowel (30 mm).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512446676">14</xref></sup> All of the knots in this study contracted when moving from the dowel to the crossheads. By convention, loop security was reported as the amount of contraction in millimeters, with more contraction representing a more secure loop.</p>
<p>The knots were then loaded with a sinusoidal waveform from 5 N to 45 N at 1 Hz for 1000 cycles. These cyclic loading parameters have been used previously for arthroscopic knot testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512446676">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512446676">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512446676">17</xref></sup> and are based on the estimate of 1000 to 2000 repetitive loads during the first 6 weeks of rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512446676">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>After cyclic testing, the knots were held at 5 N for 10 seconds and then loaded to complete failure at a rate of 1 mm/s. Data were collected with a sampling rate of 100 Hz. We defined <italic>clinical failure</italic> as crosshead displacement of 3 mm based on consensus in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512446676">5</xref></sup> and <italic>ultimate failure</italic> was recorded as the peak of the force versus time curve. The maximum force was recorded at 3 mm of displacement (clinical failure) and at the peak of the force versus time curve (ultimate failure). The mode of failure was determined by visual observation. Two modes of failure were reported: suture breakage and knot slippage. Catastrophic failure was defined as gross slippage of the knot with failure to survive a single cycle of 5 N to 45 N.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis of continuous outcome variables was performed using 2-tailed <italic>t</italic> tests. Categorical outcomes were analyzed using between-group contingency tables and the χ<sup>2</sup> statistic. If a knot failed on the first cycle of loading, its load to clinical failure and ultimate load to failure were defined as 0 N. Significance was defined as <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Arthroscopic knot tying has become an essential skill for the practicing orthopaedic surgeon. The integrity of rotator cuff and labral repairs depends on an informed choice of suture and knot type as well as meticulous technique. In this study, we set out to determine whether shortcuts, in which traditional suture rethreading is not performed, affect knot characteristics and whether these effects are influenced by the use of a static surgeon’s knot or a sliding Tennessee knot.</p>
<p>We first determined the mode of failure of the various knot configurations. Briefly, failure can be divided into suture rupture or knot slippage. With modern, high-strength materials like FiberWire (Arthrex), MaxBraid (Biomet, Warsaw, Indiana), or ForceFiber (Tornier, Edina, Minnesota), suture rupture is not thought to be a clinically relevant mode of failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512446676">17</xref></sup> Indeed, suture pullout from the tendon is expected to occur before a load sufficient to rupture the suture is reached, as confirmed in a study of failure mechanisms in revision rotator cuff repairs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512446676">10</xref></sup> Knot slippage, on the other hand, occurs at lower loads and is thought to be involved in the failure of repairs from a single forceful muscle contraction or a fall.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512446676">5</xref></sup> Therefore, in biomechanical testing, one would prefer a knot with a lower incidence of failure by slippage. Our results show that overall, surgeon’s knots are less likely to fail by slippage than Tennessee knots. This effect can largely be attributed to the fact that all Tennessee knots secured using the over-pointing technique failed by slippage.</p>
<p>An unexpected and concerning finding was the high incidence of catastrophic suture failure (gross slippage) on the first cycle of cyclic loading in the Tennessee group. The rate of catastrophic failure was 27% for Tennessee knots secured with past-pointing and 60% for Tennessee knots secured using the over-pointing technique. This phenomenon is clearly technique dependent because none of the Tennessee knots secured with rethreading showed catastrophic failure. On the basis of this finding alone, we recommend strongly against the use of shortcut techniques when securing a sliding Tennessee knot. In contrast, the mean displacement with cyclic loading was not significantly different between groups. Without the prior data on catastrophic failure with cyclic loading, this result could be misleading. The reader should not conclude that all knots were equivalent under cyclic loading.</p>
<p>Analysis of the ultimate load to failure of our knots confirmed the inferiority of shortcut methods when securing a Tennessee knot. Clinically, ultimate load to failure testing is most akin to a fall or a single forceful contraction of the rotator cuff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512446676">5</xref></sup> Past-pointing resulted in a 45% lower ultimate load to failure as compared with rethreading, and that number increased to 80% with over-pointing. We envision 2 possible causes for this finding. First, the over-pointing mechanism may simply be ineffective at reducing slack between throws. Another possibility is that the friction caused by forcing the pusher over the knot repeatedly might alter the mechanical properties of the suture. These issues matter less with a static knot that has enough internal friction to withstand load without being backed up with 3 RHAPs. Sliding knots, like the Tennessee, depend more on the 3 RHAPs for security.</p>
<p>The obvious question is how much strength is enough? The maximal contraction force of the rotator cuff has been estimated at 340 N.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512446676">5</xref></sup> Based on the average number of sutures in a cuff repair, each knot should therefore be able to withstand at least 60 N, assuming that the load is distributed evenly between knots. In our study, all surgeon’s knots had mean loads to failure between 220 N and 260 N. Similarly, Tennessee knots secured by rethreading or past-pointing had mean loads to failure between 145 N and 260 N. The concern is with the group of Tennessee knots secured by over-pointing, in which the mean load to failure was just 51 N.</p>
<p>However, we know from clinical practice that the majority of rotator cuff repair failures occur without trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512446676">10</xref></sup> Rather, subfailure loading over time leads to widening of the tendon-bone gap. Eventually, the gap is large enough that healing cannot occur, a concept coined as <italic>clinical failure</italic>. Debate exists in the literature about how to define clinical failure. The most widely accepted definition is a 3-mm gap between the tendon and the bony footprint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512446676">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512446676">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512446676">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512446676">17</xref></sup> While we assume that less gap is better, we chose to use the 3-mm cutoff for consistency with previous studies. Tennessee knots secured with past-pointing and over-pointing had mean loads to clinical failure of 58 N and 27 N, respectively. These fall well within the physiological load expected during rotator cuff rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512446676">18</xref></sup> Our data suggest that using either of these knot configurations is ill advised, particularly if one is considering a rehabilitation protocol with early passive motion.</p>
<p>The final marker of knot quality used in this study was loop security. The strict definition of loop security is the ability of the suture loop to stay tight as the knot is being tied. Direct measurement of loop security is impractical in the laboratory. Lo and Burkhart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512446676">14</xref></sup> suggested an indirect measure of loop security: the change in loop circumference after it is transferred to a materials testing system and tensioned to 5 N. For Tennessee sliders, switching posts without rethreading resulted in improved loop security when compared with rethreading. This could be because of reduced jostling of the knot by keeping the pusher on the same strand. The differences in loop security between groups were on the order of 0.1 to 0.3 mm and are unlikely to be clinically relevant.</p>
<p>When taken as a whole, our results suggest that static surgeon’s knots outperform sliding Tennessee knots. This is consistent with prior biomechanical studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512446676">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512446676">14</xref></sup> The surgeon’s knot can be easily performed through an arthroscopic cannula, and we recommend it for securing rotator cuff or labral repairs. Our study did not show any significant differences between surgeon’s knots tied with rethreading or either of the shortcut techniques. However, there were trends toward worse knot and loop security with the shortcut methods that our study was not powered to confirm. It is clear, however, that if the surgeon chooses a Tennessee sliding base, traditional rethreading must be used to obtain adequate knot and loop security.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to our study. First and foremost, it is an in vitro biomechanical study. Our knots were tied through an arthroscopic cannula, with a standard pusher, and they were bathed in saline at body temperature. Nonetheless, this cannot account for the variability seen in clinical practice. In addition, because of laboratory constraints, we tied all of our knots on one day, and they were tested as a batch, as opposed to immediately after being tied. This short period of storage could have altered the properties of the knots. Also, we used a single-level cyclic load as opposed to incremental loading. Finally, we used a single suture type and only 2 different knot configurations. These results cannot be generalized to other suture types and other sliding knot configurations. We chose the surgeon’s knot because it is considered the gold-standard arthroscopic knot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512446676">14</xref></sup> We chose the Tennessee slider because it falls in the midrange of mechanical properties of sliding knots.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512446676">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512446676">12</xref></sup> Our goal was to assess new post switching techniques in select knots used in our practice, as opposed to adding to the already vast literature comparing all possible knot and suture types.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that static surgeon’s knots outperform Tennessee sliding knots when all tying techniques are considered. We cannot recommend for or against the use of shortcuts when securing a surgeon’s knot. However, when securing a Tennessee slider knot, we recommend strongly against the use of shortcuts in which the post is not rethreaded because of unacceptably high rates of knot slippage and catastrophic failure as well as decreased knot security.</p>
