<p>This article examines whether human capital, particularly prior business ownership experience, is associated with the opportunity exploitation outcome relating to the intensity of exporting. A distinction is made between entrepreneurs who acquire their business ownership experience sequentially (that is, serial entrepreneurs) or concurrently (that is, portfolio entrepreneurs). Using survey data from 432 entrepreneurs in Ghana, this study explores whether human capital theory relating to prior business ownership experience is associated with superior exporting intensity. Notably, portfolio entrepreneurs reported higher exporting intensities than other entrepreneurs. The case for customized assistance to each type of entrepreneur with regard to prior business ownership experience is made.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The inability of traditional internationalization theories to explain why some private small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) internationalize from the outset has been highlighted in the emerging international entrepreneurship theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266242610364426">Oviatt and McDougall, 2005</xref>). International entrepreneurship (IE) has been defined as the process of creatively discovering and exploiting opportunities that lie outside a firm’s domestic market in the pursuit of competitive advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242610364426">Zahra and George, 2002</xref>). Unwittingly, international new venture (INV) (or born global) theorists have encouraged a growing policy belief that more new private firms should internationalize from the outset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242610364426">EIM, 2005</xref>). Practitioners need to recognize that some firms have a competitive advantage in domestic markets alone. If practitioners only contextualize support toward knowledge and technology-based firms, this support may not be appropriate for the vast majority of firms that do not offer products and/or services that involve substantial value added based on a breakthrough in process or technology. Insights from other perspectives need to be considered by practitioners seeking to encourage firms engaged in a broad array of industrial activities to internationalize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242610364426">Keupp and Gassmann, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242610364426">McDougall and Oviatt (2000)</xref> encourage researchers to explore IE beyond the INV phenomenon, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242610364426">Jones and Coviello (2005)</xref> also call for studies to consider alternative, or multiple theories, beyond traditional internationalization theory.</p>
<p>Internationalization studies recognize the importance of internal factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242610364426">Pla-Barber and Alegre, 2007</xref>). There is a considerable pool of knowledge relating to the internationalization of large and multi-plant companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242610364426">Roper and Love, 2002</xref>), and there is an emerging literature relating to the private firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242610364426">Julien et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242610364426">Coviello and McAuley, 1999</xref>). Until recently, relatively few studies have focused on the entrepreneur rather than solely the firm as the unit of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242610364426">Westhead et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0266242610364426">Wright et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast to studies of MNEs, IE studies focus on a different array of questions and relationships relating to private firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266242610364426">Gamboa and Brouthers, 2008</xref>). IE theorists appreciate that the human capital of lead entrepreneurs can shape the exporting process, particularly specific-human capital relating to innovation. Despite research progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242610364426">Ruzzier et al., 2007</xref>), gaps in the knowledge base exist relating to the resource and knowledge profiles of lead entrepreneurs that exploit opportunities in foreign markets through exporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0266242610364426">Wright et al., 2007</xref>). The importance of a lead entrepreneur’s specific human capital, particularly prior business ownership experience, in relation to other entrepreneur, firm and domestic external environmental factors is generally ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242610364426">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>). Studies have highlighted that some entrepreneurs have careers in entrepreneurship, and habitual entrepreneurs (that is, entrepreneurs with multiple business ownership experience, also known as repeat entrepreneurs) exploit more than one business opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242610364426">Ucbasaran et al., 2008</xref>). Entrepreneurs who acquire their business ownership experience sequentially (that is, serial or sequential entrepreneurs) may have different skills and knowledge to leverage than those that acquire experience concurrently (that is, portfolio entrepreneurs). We explore this research gap by providing fresh evidence relating to the contributions made by habitual entrepreneurs who can leverage prior business ownership experience relative to novice entrepreneurs. The following research question is explored: Does an entrepreneur’s human capital, particularly prior business ownership experience, increase the intensity of exporting? We consider both the <italic>extent</italic> and <italic>nature</italic> of entrepreneurs’ prior business ownership experience with regard to three dimensions: years of business ownership experience; habitual entrepreneurs compared with novice entrepreneurs; and portfolio entrepreneurs compared with serial entrepreneurs (with novice entrepreneurs as the reference category).</p>
<p>This study keys into several emerging debates and we seek to make several conceptual and empirical contributions. We both replicate and extend previous research by focusing upon the human capital profiles of entrepreneurs who exploit international opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242610364426">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>). The lead entrepreneur who shapes resource allocation and strategy in smaller private firms is the unit of analysis. First, with respect to replication, we explore whether an entrepreneur’s ability to assemble and leverage human capital is associated with the widely explored intensity of exporting measure (that is, sales revenue generated by exports as a proportion of total sales revenue). Export intensity as a measure of internationalization performance has attracted some criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242610364426">Katsikeas et al., 2000</xref>), but it is widely used and it allows comparison with the existing body of knowledge. The decision to export is a strategic choice influenced by a firm’s resources. The intensity of export activity is a strategic outcome. Export intensity can be contingent on management’s strategic decisions, and influenced by the resources available to the firm such as the entrepreneur’s human capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242610364426">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>). Second, with respect to extending previous work, we explore whether the extent and nature of an entrepreneur’s prior business ownership experience (that is, specific human capital) shapes exporting intensity. Third, we also extend understanding by examining the relationship between prior business ownership experience and exporting outside North America and Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0266242610364426">1</xref></sup> These continents have provided the contexts within which to ground the theoretical foundations of IE studies, but ‘researchers should not assume that findings in a developed economy will be equally applicable in an emerging economy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242610364426">Bruton et al., 2008</xref>: 2). A country’s culture and institutional context can shape people’s attitudes, access to resources and behaviour with regard to opportunity exploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266242610364426">Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2003</xref>). A replication and extension of previous studies in a different geographic and cultural context is needed to confirm robust relationships between human capital and international opportunity exploitation success. Calls to explore links between local resource endowments and the exploitation of opportunities within the under-researched African context have been made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242610364426">Yang et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Ghana is a particularly important context within which to explore our research question for the following reasons: recent economic transformation policies have enabled Ghana to be recognized as one of only seven emerging economies in sub-Saharan Africa; and the inadequate market support institutions and weak enforcement capacity of regulatory and legal institutions create business uncertainty which can be potentially reduced by entrepreneurs that can leverage their prior business ownership experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242610364426">Buame, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242610364426">Acquaah, 2007</xref>: 1236–1238).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0266242610364426">2</xref></sup> Practitioners in Ghana are promoting enterprise to generate wealth creation, job generation and competitiveness. Entrepreneurs in Ghana face barriers to business development, which are widely reported by entrepreneurs in developed countries, particularly those dealing with economic downturns, such as high interest rates, high inflation, currency depreciation as well as high utility charges, high transport costs, the high cost of replacing old equipment, and high cost of local materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266242610364426">Robson and Obeng, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We use data from 432 entrepreneurs who own private independent firms based in Ghana that are engaged in a broad spectrum of industrial activities that employed between 5 and 50 employees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0266242610364426">3</xref></sup> To promote local economic development, the government is supporting firms with existing resources to enter foreign markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266242610364426">Lages and Montgomery, 2004</xref>). Factors associated with the intensity of exporting are explored within a Heckman two-stage procedure. This technique enables exploration of the potential issue of selection bias relating to the profile of exporters relative to non-exporters.</p>
<p>The article is structured as follows. In the next section, insights from human capital theory are used to suggest links between entrepreneur experience and actions. Hypotheses are then derived. This is followed by a discussion of the research method and the data collected. Results from the multivariate regression analyses are then reported. In the following section, key findings are discussed. Finally, conclusions are presented.</p>

<title>Context</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242610364426">Reuber and Fischer (1999)</xref> suggest that the behaviour of entrepreneurs is, in part, shaped by their human capital profiles. A broad view of human capital appreciates that an entrepreneur’s demographic characteristics and accumulated work experience impact on productivity. It is assumed that individuals with broader pools of human capital resources will report superior levels of productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242610364426">Becker, 1975</xref>). Studies have detected that an entrepreneur’s general and specific human capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266242610364426">Hsu, 2007</xref>) profile can shape opportunity exploitation, and superior firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242610364426">Ucbasaran et al., 2008</xref>). We thus distinguish between demographic characteristics, and general and specific human capital in the development of our hypotheses relating to exporting behaviour.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0266242610364426">
<title>Demographic characteristics and general human capital</title>
<p>A distinction has been made between general and specific human capital. General human capital has traditionally been measured in terms of an individual’s gender, age, parental background and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242610364426">Becker, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266242610364426">Cooper et al., 1994</xref>). The first three of these relate to demographic characteristics given by birth, which cannot be changed, invested in or improved upon. Further, they reflect non-intellectual elements of human capital. They can be regarded as <italic>entrepreneur demographic characteristics</italic>.</p>
<p>Traditionally women have been associated with lower levels of human capital with regard to education and training indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242610364426">Becker, 1993</xref>). Female entrepreneurs generally have fewer opportunities to develop relevant experience, have fewer contacts and have greater difficulty in assembling resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266242610364426">Cooper et al., 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242610364426">Saffu and Manu (2004)</xref> detected that female-owned firms in Ghana were more likely to encounter financial constraints. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242610364426">Mead and Liedholm (1998)</xref> found in East Africa that female entrepreneurs reported higher rates of business closure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242610364426">Brush (1992)</xref> suggests that female owners are less likely than male owners to solely pursue economic goals. Due to the disadvantages they face, as well as the industrial sectors they select, some female entrepreneurs are unable to capitalize on identified foreign market opportunities.</p>
<p>Middle-aged entrepreneurs are more likely to have financial security, particularly in terms of owning their own homes. They generally have wider social and business contacts, as well as considerable experience to enable their businesses to survive. This experience can enable more mature individuals to accumulate skills required for superior firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266242610364426">Cooper et al., 1994</xref>). Entrepreneurs drawn from backgrounds in which their parents had owned a business and acted as role models can accumulate management know-how, and may be better prepared to face market opportunities in domestic and international markets.</p>
<p>Among more direct and intellectual measures of general human capital, education is one of the most frequently examined. Education can be an important source of knowledge, skills, problem-solving ability, discipline, motivation and self-confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266242610364426">Cooper et al., 1994</xref>). Entrepreneurs who have been awarded a university degree have generally had their expectations and information processing and problem-solving skills raised. Owing to wider social and business networks they are more aware of opportunities in foreign markets.</p>
<p>This discussion suggests the following hypotheses:
<disp-quote>
<p>H1a: Male entrepreneurs are more likely to report higher exporting intensities.</p>
<p>H1b: Middle-aged entrepreneurs are more likely to report higher exporting intensities.</p>
<p>H1c: Entrepreneurs that have role models among their relatives are more likely to report higher exporting intensities.</p>
<p>H1d: Entrepreneurs with a university degree are more likely to report higher exporting intensities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0266242610364426">
<title>Specific human capital</title>
<p>Specific human capital has a more limited scope of applicability. Innovation is of central importance in entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242610364426">Marvel and Lumpkin, 2007</xref>). Entrepreneurs that invest in creativity and innovation can develop their specific human capital in a way to exploit more successfully opportunities beyond the domestic market alone. Ventures with specific competitive advantages linked to their technological level may be alert to opportunities in international markets from the outset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242610364426">Oviatt and McDougall, 1994</xref>). Entrepreneurs and firms honing production innovation capabilities may be better placed to increase their exporting intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242610364426">Nassimbeni, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242610364426">Pla-Barber and Alegre, 2007</xref>). Hence:
<disp-quote>
<p>H2a: Entrepreneurs who have not tried to introduce an innovation are likely to report lower exporting intensities.</p>
<p>H2b: Entrepreneurs who introduced an innovation are more likely to report higher exporting intensities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An entrepreneur can compensate for his/her personal human capital deficiencies by attracting people with more diverse human capital to join the ownership team (that is, co-investors). Attracting additional equity partners into the entrepreneurial team can enable a solo entrepreneur to accumulate a broader pool of specific human capital to ensure firm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242610364426">Ucbasaran et al., 2003</xref>). Given that exporting requires the acquisition of new skills, increasing team size provides the possibility to obtain those skills. Hence:
<disp-quote>
<p>H2c: Entrepreneurs with partners are more likely to report higher exporting intensities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Experiential knowledge can shape opportunity exploitation. Entrepreneurial experience can add to human capital through enhanced reputation and better understanding of the requirements of financial institutions. Human capital from entrepreneurial experience may be interrelated with greater social capital associated with diverse networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242610364426">Davidsson and Honig, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266242610364426">Shane and Khurana, 2003</xref>). While debate surrounds the social capital concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266242610364426">Cope et al. 2007</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266242610364426">Kim and Aldrich (2005)</xref> argue that the majority of individuals are embedded in social situations, and through ties with external actors they can leverage social relations to accumulate and leverage additional resources for firm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242610364426">Ozgen and Baron, 2007</xref>). Experienced entrepreneurs can leverage their human capital and broader social capital developed through prior business ownership exposure to access resources that are critical for exporting. Entrepreneurs reporting long durations of business ownership experience may have had more opportunities to accumulate and leverage their specific human capital. Further, experienced entrepreneurs associated with legitimacy, financial resources, production, and/or marketing and distribution skills accumulated due to prior and current business ownership experience may have exporting opportunities presented to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242610364426">Ucbasaran et al., 2008</xref>). Hence:
<disp-quote>
<p>H2d: Entrepreneurs with longer durations of prior business ownership experience are more likely to report higher exporting intensities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The extent and nature of prior business ownership experience can shape opportunity identification and exploitation behaviour. Habitual entrepreneurs may have learnt from their previous business ownership successes and mistakes compared to novice entrepreneurs with no prior experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242610364426">Ucbasaran et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, habitual entrepreneurs can learn from the feedback from that experience to enhance their exporting activity compared to novice entrepreneurs. Thus:
<disp-quote>
<p>H2e: Habitual entrepreneurs are more likely than novice entrepreneurs to report higher exporting intensities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The goals, resources, and assets and liabilities reported by portfolio entrepreneurs can differ from those cited by serial entrepreneurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242610364426">Ucbasaran et al., 2008</xref>). Portfolio entrepreneurs with a broader resource pool (that is, ownership of two or more ventures concurrently) may find it easier to circumvent barriers to exporting. Portfolio entrepreneurs, on average, may be more entrepreneurial than novice entrepreneurs. They are more likely to start firms because they want to be challenged by the opportunities and problems involved; more likely to enjoy just thinking about and looking for new business opportunities; to have a special alertness towards spotting opportunities; to be more likely to find new markets; and to consider that identifying good opportunities usually requires immersion in a particular market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242610364426">Westhead et al., 2005</xref>). Portfolio entrepreneurs may, therefore, be more likely to engage in exporting activity than novice entrepreneurs. Serial entrepreneurs, who have owned more than one business sequentially, appear more likely than novice entrepreneurs to have gained experience in a variety of settings; to strive to form alliances with other businesses; to have introduced a new product or service; and/or to have developed a new distribution approach; to make more use of information from customers and suppliers; to seek to grow their business; and to perceive unmet needs of customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242610364426">Westhead et al., 2005</xref>). Serial entrepreneurs may be more likely than novice entrepreneurs to engage in exporting activity, though they may approach it in a less opportunistic entrepreneurial manner than portfolio entrepreneurs. Hence:
<disp-quote>
<p>H2f: Portfolio entrepreneurs are more likely than novice entrepreneurs to report higher exporting intensities.</p>
<p>H2g: Serial entrepreneurs are more likely than novice entrepreneurs to report higher exporting intensities.</p>

<title>Sample, data collection and respondents</title>
<p>No list of exporters and novice, serial and portfolio entrepreneurs is published in Ghana. Primary information had to be collected in order to identify the human capital profiles of exporters and non-exporters. Information was gathered from a survey of firms to identify whether the key decision maker in each firm was a novice, serial or portfolio entrepreneur. The Ghanaian government seeks to promote the development of firms that employ between 4 and 50 employees. This study provides an evidence base relating to private firms in this employment size band, which is the focus of policy debate. This study focuses on independent firms in this employment band for policy support. In developing the sample frame of independent firms for the survey the following organizations provided data: the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI), the <bold>Federation of Associations of Ghanaian Exporters (</bold>FAGE), the Ghana National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GNCCI), the Ghana Export Promotion Council (GEPC), the Ghana Association of Consultants (GAC), and the Ghana Association of Women Entrepreneurs (GAWE). Participants were selected based on the following criteria:</p>
<list id="list1-0266242610364426" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>the business must have at least four employees and at most 50 employees;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the business must be in operation for at least one year;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the respondent must be the owner/founder or major partner in the case of a co-investment;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the business must be independently or privately owned;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the business must be engaged in activities within the agricultural, manufacturing and servicing sectors;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the business must be located within the six districts of the Greater Accra Region.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Non-independent businesses were removed from this list. Industry and standard region sampling proportions were identified for a stratified random sample of independent private firms. A stratified random sampling frame of 1200 independent firms was drawn. After the potential respondents were cleaned, this resulted in a list of 750 business names. Respondents were entrepreneurs rather than a narrower sub-group of owner-managers.</p>
<p>The structured questionnaire was administered between January and May 2007 by one of the authors and three researchers from Accra University who were each trained to administer the questionnaire. To reduce response bias and measurement error, face-to-face interviews were conducted with key informants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242610364426">Kumar et al., 1993</xref>) in independent firms who had sufficient knowledge and an adequate level of involvement with regard to the issues under investigation. The key respondent was a founder/principal owner and a key decision maker in the business. Face-to-face interviews minimized the incidence of the questionnaire being completed by inappropriate people. Only six respondents were identified as not being a founder or principal owner of the business, and they were regarded as non-respondents.</p>
<p>In total, 522 questionnaires were completed. Over the five-month data collection period, nine responses were eliminated because the businesses had been acquired, and they were no longer independent trading entities. A further 13 responses were eliminated because nearly all of the response questions were left blank. In total, 500 valid questionnaire returns were obtained. Respondents who reported that they had only inherited an established business, and those that filed missing information returns to any of the selected dependent, independent or control variables were excluded from any further analysis. Relative to most international business studies a large sample was gathered. In total, 432 respondents provided complete data for the selected variables explored, yielding a response rate of 59 per cent. This rate is considerably higher than similar entrepreneur, SME and international business studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242610364426">Yang et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In total, 95 respondents (22 per cent) suggested their firms were exporters and 337 firms (78 per cent) were non-exporters. The average export intensity was 9.5 per cent (when excluding non-exporters the average level was 43 per cent). Furthermore, 60 firms (14 per cent of all firms) reported international sales of 25 per cent or more. In total, 46 per cent of respondents (249) were aged between 18 and 45 years of age and 76 per cent (328) of respondents were male. The average age of the surveyed businesses was 13.0 years old (standard deviation of 7.9). Firms, on average, employed 19 employees (standard deviation of 14). Thirty-six per cent of respondents had started or purchased the surveyed business with others. In total, 177 respondents were habitual entrepreneurs (41 per cent), among whom 56 (13 per cent) were serial entrepreneurs and a further 121 respondents (28 per cent) were portfolio entrepreneurs. These proportions are comparable to those reported in developed country studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242610364426">Ucbasaran et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Sample representation</title>
<p>Parametric (Bonferroni test) and non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney and Chi-square tests) confirmed that there was no statistically significant response bias between the respondents and non-respondents with regard to industry, government official region, legal form, age of the business and employment size at the 0.05 level. On these criteria, we have no cause to suspect the sample is not representative of the population of private firms.</p>

<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>Entrepreneur demographic characteristics: Female entrepreneurs were allocated a value of ‘0’, while male entrepreneurs were allocated a value of ‘1’ (Gender). Entrepreneurs not reporting an age between 31 and 45 years were allocated a value of ‘0’, while entrepreneurs aged between 31 and 45 years were allocated a value of ‘1’ (Age 31–45). Individuals who reported that their parents and/or relatives had no business ownership experience were allocated a value of ‘0’, while those that reported their parents and/or relatives had business ownership experience were allocated a value of ‘1’ (Relative).</p>
<p>General human capital: entrepreneurs that did not have a university degree were allocated a value of ‘0’, while those having a degree were allocated a value of ‘1’ (Degree).</p>
<p>Specific human capital: there is no universally utilized indicator of innovation and it is typically viewed as a broad construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242610364426">Becheikh et al., 2006</xref>). Respondents were asked, ‘In the last 3 years, has your firm undertaken any form of innovation as regard to seven statements relating to the following’ – product or services, production processes (including storage), work practices or workforce organization, supply and supplier relations, markets and marketing, administration and office systems, and products or services distribution were presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242610364426">Cosh and Hughes, 1998</xref>). With reference to each statement, respondents had to select one of the four following responses: innovation not tried (scored 1); innovation tried and failed (scored 2); innovation new to firm but not new to the industry (scored 3); and innovation new to industry (scored 4). Seven innovation variables were computed. First, respondents who reported options 1 or 2 with regard to the statement relating to product or services were allocated a value of ‘0’, while those reporting options 3 or 4 were allocated a value of ‘1’ (ProductI). This methodological approach was applied to the other six types of innovation: production processes (including storage) (ProductionI), work practices or workforce organization (WorkI), supply and supplier relations (SupplyI), markets and marketing (MarketsI), administration and office systems (AdministrationI), and products or services distribution (DistributionI). The reference category was ProductionI. A composite innovation process variable was also ascertained. Respondents that reported option 1 with regard to each of the seven specified innovation process outcomes were labelled <italic>‘</italic>Innovation not tried’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0266242610364426">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Principal owners who had not attracted co-investors when the firm started were allocated a value of ‘0’, while those that attracted co-investors were allocated a value of ‘1’ (Partners).</p>
<p>Respondents were asked to report the number of years they had owned and run a business (Experience). Further, respondents were asked to indicate the total number of businesses they had established, or purchased into, in which they had minority or majority ownership stakes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0266242610364426">5</xref></sup> A distinction was made between habitual (serial and portfolio – that is, individuals who at the time of the survey had prior minority or majority ownership experience in two or more prior independent businesses) and novice entrepreneurs (that is, individuals who at the time of the survey had a minority or majority ownership stake in a single business that was new or purchased). Moreover, a distinction was made between serial (individuals who had sold/closed a business which they had a minority or majority ownership stake in, and who at the time of the survey had a minority or majority ownership stake in a single independent business that was new or purchased) and portfolio entrepreneurs (individuals who at the time of the survey had minority or majority ownership stakes in two or more independent businesses that were new and/or purchased). Habitual entrepreneurs were allocated a value of ‘1’, while novice entrepreneurs were allocated a value of ‘0’ (Habitual). A further three prior business ownership variables were computed. Serial entrepreneurs were allocated a value of ‘1’, while other (novice and portfolio) entrepreneurs were allocated a value of ‘0’ (Serial). Portfolio entrepreneurs were allocated a value of ‘1’, while other (novice and serial) entrepreneurs were allocated a value of ‘0’ (Portfolio). Novice entrepreneurs were allocated a value of ‘1’, while other (serial and portfolio) entrepreneurs were allocated a value of ‘0’ (Novice). The serial and portfolio variables were included in the regression models and the reference category was Novice entrepreneurs.</p>

<title>Control variables</title>
<p>A firm’s positioning with regard to industrial activity in the home country can shape access to and competition for resources. Services firms are less likely than manufacturing firms to be exporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242610364426">Miesenböck, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0266242610364426">Westhead, 1995</xref>). The main industrial activity of each firm was ascertained. Four industry dummy variables were considered as control variables (Agriculture [no = 0, yes = 1], Manufacturing [no = 0, yes = 1], Production services [no = 0, yes = 1] and Consumer services [no = 0, yes = 1]). The reference category was Production services.</p>
<p>Productivity was captured using sales revenue per employee, and is a selection variable for the Heckman analysis. Firm size is considered to be an indicator of a firm’s organizational resource base and specifically managerial and financial resources available. Larger firms in terms of employment size (a useful surrogate measure of a firm’s resources) are generally more likely to export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0266242610364426">Westhead, 1995</xref>; for a dissenting view see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242610364426">Pla-Barber and Alegre, 2007</xref>). The total employment size of firms in 2007 was ascertained (Size). A U-shaped relationship between size and exporting has been detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242610364426">Nassimbeni, 2001</xref>). We considered the square of each firms total employment size in 2007 (Size<sup>2</sup>). The relationship between firm age and exporting firms is mixed. Older firms are more likely to be exporters in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0266242610364426">Westhead, 1995</xref>), while in others no linkage with business age has been detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242610364426">Nassimbeni, 2001</xref>). The age of the business (years) was collected (Age).</p>

<title>Validity</title>
<p>Content validity was considered and the structured questionnaire was tested during a pilot survey. An early version was revised in line with comments and feedback from financiers and academics in Ghana. To source potential problems and address the problem of face validity, eight entrepreneurs were contacted to pilot test the revised questionnaire. Comments were incorporated within a revised structured questionnaire.</p>

<title>Common method bias</title>
<p>The following steps were taken to ensure that common method bias was minimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242610364426">Krishnan et al., 2006</xref>): protection of respondent anonymity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242610364426">Podsakoff et al., 2003</xref>); reducing statement ambiguity by pre-testing the survey on entrepreneurs; and ensuring the statements relating to the dependent variable were not located close to the independent variables on the questionnaire. All variables were included in a principal components analysis. Nine components with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 were identified, and they accounted for 71 per cent of the variance. The largest component accounted for only 11 per cent of the variance. The Harman one-factor test suggests no evidence of common method bias.</p>

<p>A Heckman two-stage test was conducted to explore for potential sample selection bias between exporters and non-exporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266242610364426">Greene, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242610364426">Lockett et al., 2008</xref>). This technique ascertains whether the sub-sample of exporting firms are not random (that is, the unobservable variables associated with the propensity to export are associated with the unobservable variables associated with export intensity).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The first step of the Heckman test explores the issue of respondent selection bias relating to the profiles of exporters. With regard to the total sample of exporting and non-exporting respondents, a probit regression analysis was estimated relating to the propensity to export or not. Variables (observables) included in step 1 need to be different from those included in step 2. At least one independent variable has to be included in step 1 but not step 2, which is theoretically associated with export propensity but not export intensity. Some studies use a measure of productivity such as output per employee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242610364426">Wagner, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266242610364426">2001</xref>). In line with previous studies, we used total sales revenue divided by the number of employees, and this measure was included in step 1 but not step 2. Independent variables were considered within step 1 (Models 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266242610364426">Table 2</xref> and Model 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242610364426">Table 3</xref>). A generalized residual variable, which is a function of the correlation between the disturbances of the probit model, was considered during step 2, which relates to an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis focusing upon export intensity. If the generalized residual coefficient is significant within the OLS model it suggests that the OLS model is distorted by bias. However, if the generalized residual variable is not statistically significant the OLS model relates to a random sample of exporters. Model 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266242610364426">Table 2</xref> has a Wald chi-square statistic of 121.33 and is significant at the 0.01 level. The Inverse Mills ratio in Model 1 is not statistically significant at the 0.10 level, which suggests that the errors in the two stages of the equation are not correlated. Consequently, there is no omitted variable bias when the two equations have been estimated separately. Further, in Model 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266242610364426">Table 2</xref> and Model 3 in Table 4 the Wald chi-square statistics are 121.33 and 121.38, respectively. Both values are significant at the 0.01 level. The Inverse Mills ratios for both models, however, were not significant at the 0.10 level or lower. This confirms the absence of selection bias with regard to models focusing upon exporting propensity and intensity.</p>

<p>Gender of the entrepreneurs (Gender), and whether the entrepreneurs are middle-aged (Age 31–45), have relative role models (Relative), or possess a university degree (Degree) are included in Models 1, 2 and 3. In none of the models with regard to export propensity or export intensity are the aforementioned variables statistically significant at the 0.10 level or lower. Thus, there is no evidence to support hypotheses H1a, H1b, H1c or H1d. This evidence suggests that entrepreneur demographic and general human capital were not drivers of exporting intensity.</p>
<p>The length of experience variable (Experience) was included in Model 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266242610364426">Table 2</xref>. Entrepreneurs with longer durations of business ownership experience were more likely to export, and to report higher exporting intensities. However, the relationships were not statistically significant at the 0.10 level or lower. Hypothesis H2d is, therefore, not supported. In Model 2, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266242610364426">Table 2</xref>, the Experience variable was replaced with the Habitual variable. Habitual entrepreneurs were significantly more likely to be exporters, and to report higher exporting intensities. Hypothesis H2e is supported.</p>
<p>Model 3 (step 2) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242610364426">Table 3</xref> relates to exporting intensity and in this model the Habitual variable was replaced with the Serial and Portfolio variables. Five independent variables are significant at the 0.05 level. Portfolio entrepreneurs reported significantly higher exporting intensities. Entrepreneurs reporting product or services (ProductI), work (WorkI) and distribution (DistributionI) innovations reported higher exporting intensities. ‘Innovation not tried’ respondents reported higher exporting intensities. Four control variables were significantly associated with exporting intensity. Manufacturing firms and larger employment sized firms (Size and Size<sup>2</sup>) reported higher exporting intensities, while Consumer services firms reported lower exporting intensities.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section18-0266242610364426">
<title>Key findings and implications</title>
<p>Despite a growing body of studies focusing upon the exporting process, the profiles of entrepreneurs that report higher exporting intensities are poorly understood. This study has explored the external validity of theoretical perspectives generated in North American and European contexts with reference to actual entrepreneur behaviour in the developing economy context of Ghana. Notably, this study has focused on the specific human capital resources associated with entrepreneurs that report higher exporting intensities. With reference to the private SME context, a novel contribution of this study is the exploration of the relative importance of prior business ownership experience vis-a-vis other firm, entrepreneur and domestic environmental resources that may shape variations in a widely respected exporting performance outcome. The human capital profiles of entrepreneurs were significantly linked to exporting intensity. Entrepreneur specific-human capital relating to prior business ownership experience and technical capabilities are key drivers of superior exporting performance.</p>
<p>Themes overwhelmingly discussed in developed economy contexts are applicable to the developing country context of Ghana. This study used a Heckman two-stage test to explore presented hypotheses. This technique detected no significant evidence of selection bias with regard to the profiles of exporters relative to non-exporters. Three hypotheses were supported. Respondents reporting ‘innovation not tried’ were less likely to export but the ‘innovation not tried’ respondents reported higher exporting intensities. This latter result was counter to our expectations in hypothesis H2a. The results raise an interesting dilemma for practitioners. Respondents reporting ‘innovation not tried’ were less likely to export, but once they had circumvented the hurdles associated with exporting, and actually started to export, their situations changed. Notably, ‘innovation not tried’ respondents achieved higher exporting intensities. Additional research is warranted to explore whether entrepreneurs in the latter firms actually make the strategic decision to invest in removing barriers to exporting rather than removing barriers to innovation. Respondents that had made investments in product and services innovation and process innovation (that is, distribution and work practices) reported higher exporting intensities (Model 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242610364426">Table 3</xref>). Longitudinal studies would also provide information relating to the lead times between investments in innovation (and types of innovation) and assumed subsequently superior exporting intensities.</p>
<p>The nature rather than the extent of prior business ownership experience was linked to higher exporting intensities. Habitual entrepreneurs reported higher exporting intensities (Model 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242610364426">Table 3</xref>). Further, Model 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242610364426">Table 3</xref> shows that portfolio, rather than serial entrepreneurs, reported higher exporting intensities. This evidence supports hypotheses H2b, H2e, and H2f.</p>
<p>The general human capital relating to university degree was not statistically associated with either the propensity to export or export intensity. A policy of increasing the number of Ghanians going to university may, therefore, not have a short-term direct impact on the exporting potential of the country. We acknowledge that finer level analysis relating to types of university courses followed may warrant additional attention in future studies. Female entrepreneurs are assumed to face specific barriers to business development which warrant targeted assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242610364426">DTI, 2004</xref>). Models 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266242610364426">Table 2</xref> and Model 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242610364426">Table 3</xref> did not provide statistically significant evidence to suggest that female entrepreneurs were less likely to export, and they reported lower exporting intensities. In this context, therefore, the case for exporting programmes targeted to female entrepreneurs appears to warrant additional research attention.</p>
<p>Four control variables were significant across all presented models. Selection of external environmental in terms of industry was linked to exporting intensity. Manufacturing rather than consumer services firms reported superior exporting intensities. Further, firms that had assembled resources (and increased their legitimacy) as reflected in larger employment size appear to have circumvented barriers to superior exporting performance.</p>
<p>Smaller private firms’ exporting activity can make an important contribution to the national economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242610364426">Philip, 1998</xref>). Policy towards SME exporting has several strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0266242610364426">Wright et al., 2007</xref>). One strand is to encourage new SMEs to trade internationally from the outset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242610364426">EIM, 2005</xref>). A second strand is to encourage ‘export capable’ and ‘inexperienced exporter’ firms to sell their goods and services outside the domestic market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242610364426">Julien et al., 1997</xref>). Rather than solely focusing on the ‘quantity’ of exporters, practitioners need to consider measures to improve the ‘quality’ of exporters. Our results provide guidance to practitioners who may be able to tailor support to the needs of each type of entrepreneur. If the goal of policy is to increase the ‘quality’ of new business start-ups (that is, firms with enhanced rapid business development potential) and to maximize investment returns, practitioners should consider picking winners with regard to the profiles of entrepreneurs citing significantly higher exporting intensities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266242610364426">Table 3</xref>). There is a case to target assistance to habitual entrepreneurs, particularly portfolio entrepreneurs. More customized assistance to each type of entrepreneur may be required to improve the ‘quality’ of the entrepreneurial pool. Initiatives that hone opportunity identification skills as well as market and technological knowledge skills may enable innovative and non-innovative products and/or services to be exported.</p>

<title>Limitations and future research</title>
<p>Inevitably this study is associated with several limitations, which provide future research opportunities. As widely used elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242610364426">Nassimbeni, 2001</xref>), this study explored self-report statements relating to selected dependent and independent variables. Doubt may be cast on the wider validity of the operationalized variables. Nevertheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242610364426">Ozgen and Baron (2007)</xref> have shown that key informant entrepreneurs can provide reliable information about the organizational characteristics of their firms. As earlier intimated, the selected objective exporting intensity dependent variable is widely explored in previous studies.</p>
<p>Several business ownership experience dimensions were considered but additional dimensions should be considered in future studies. This study has illustrated that a sizeable proportion of entrepreneurs concurrently own more than one business. On the downside, this study explored the exporting performance of single firms owned by a portfolio entrepreneur. Future studies should gather information relating to the exporting performance of all firms owned by portfolio entrepreneurs, some of which may be interlinked, to ensure one or more of the ventures are able to export. Experienced and inexperienced entrepreneurs may circumvent barriers to exporting propensity and superior exporting intensity by using bridging social capital provided by private and /or private sector organizations. Some inexperienced novice entrepreneurs may compensate for a lack of prior business ownership experience by accumulating and leveraging social capital. Moreover, some habitual entrepreneurs, particularly serial entrepreneurs, may seek to reduce the liabilities potentially accumulated with prior business ownership ‘failure’ by investing in social capital. Further evidence relating to valid and reliable social capital constructs is required to inform this potentially important practitioner tool to address barriers to superior exporting performance.</p>
<p>This study was conducted in an under-explored developing country context. Although this study used survey evidence from a single sub-Saharan country, it can be asserted that findings from Ghana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242610364426">Acquaah, 2007</xref>) are generalizable to other sub-Saharan African countries with strong collectivist cultures and economic development policies promoting competition, liberalization, privatization and indigenous entrepreneurship. Future studies that explore links between exporting performance and other dimensions of business performance are warranted to ascertain whether exporting firms accrue societal benefits in their domestic markets, thus justifying an interventionist stance to increase the ‘quantity’ and/or ‘quality’ of exporting entrepreneurs.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have presented new insights into the under-researched area of the links between prior business ownership experience and exporting intensity. Using a unique dataset of 432 entrepreneurs in the Ghanaian context, one of the most striking findings was that habitual, particularly portfolio, entrepreneurs were more likely than novice entrepreneurs to report higher exporting intensities. Habitual entrepreneurs are not a homogenous entity. Serial entrepreneurs need to further accumulate additional specific-human capital and social capital to fully engage in the exporting process. Entrepreneurs that honed their technological human-specific capital were able to innovate and to introduce process and product and services innovations, which increase their ability to report higher exporting intensities. Novice and serial entrepreneurs may compensate for their human capital deficiencies by investing in social capital, particularly links with private sector organizations with increased legitimacy and broader technical and financial resources. Our findings suggest that prior business ownership experience is a key resource linked to superior exporting performance.</p>

<p>Since independence in 1957, governments have sought to foster the economic benefits associated with attracting foreign direct investment (that is, wealth creation, job generation, the introduction of new ideas and technological capabilities, and so on) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0266242610364426">Wignaraja, 2002</xref>). The 1983 Structural Adjustment Programme introduced opened the economy to market forces, and unprofitable state-owned enterprises have been privatized. The 1992 constitution has fostered political stability. Since the mid-1990s, the government has promoted indigenous enterprise development. Despite recent economic growth, Ghana is still a poor country, and is over-reliant on agriculture (mainly cocoa production) and the growing tourism industry.</p>

<p>In total, 23 per cent (112) of the firms had ‘always not tried’ to innovate (Innovation not tried), 7 per cent (36) of the firms ‘tried and always failed’ in all innovation activity, 53 per cent (265) of the firms cited a <italic>‘</italic>mixture of failed and introduced’, and 17 per cent (83) of the firms reported they ‘always introduced’ each of the seven innovations.</p>
