<abstract>
<p>In India 553 million persons are estimated to live in areas endemic for LF; approximately 21 million have symptomatic filariasis. Of the approximately 16.02 million cases of lymphedema caused by LF globally, 7.44 million (46.4%) are in India. India had seen diethyl carbamizine, and/or albendazole, delivered to whole populations, beginning the project to eliminate the disease. But new populations have developed the infection. In 2003 the need in resource-poor countries for morbidity control of lymphatic filariasis (LF) became clear, prompting the study by the Institute of Applied Dermatology in Kerala, India. Under this study,self help and family members assisted in home-based care, combining compression bandaging, yoga exercises, heat therapy using steaming, and skin care according to Ayurvedic medicine. Lymphedema presents with different patterns in the skin with gross changes in the epidermis, dermis, or subcutaneous tissue. Skilled and time-consuming counselling is important to give patients support. An almost immediate reduction in inflammatory episodes from 80.4% to 8.6% shows up within 2 or 3 weeks, and therefore, intake of antibiotics can be stopped. The second major response is reduction in the size of the limb. Volume reduction for large-sized limbs at 3 months is 39%, with a confidence interval of 4.9 to 5.9 L.</p>

<body>
<p>Having studied the lymphatic system since the 1970s,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612438548">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612438548">2</xref></sup> it was during the late 1990s when Ryan became aware of the urgent need in resource-poor countries for morbidity control of lymphatic filariasis (LF). In 2003, he prompted the Institute of Applied Dermatology (IAD) in Kerala, India, headed by the Indian dermatologist, S. R. Narahari, to develop an integrative treatment protocol for lower-limb lymphedema. This protocol involves low-cost, family-member-assisted, home-based care: a combination of compression bandaging; herbal-based skin care procedures of Ayurveda, an Indian traditional medicine; and yoga exercises.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612438548">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Having played a part in setting up a Regional Dermatology Training Centre in Tanzania where filariasis on the east coast of Africa was common and having seen the effect of filariasis in India, Ryan felt that, clearly, the experience of managing lymphedema in Europe should not be the sole basis of management of lymphedema by the Global Alliance for The Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (to which Ryan had become an advisor on morbidity control). Filariasis was being managed by a program of the delivery of drugs to whole populations to break transmission from mosquitoes, with less emphasis on morbidity control of very disabled persons who suffered from significant swelling of limbs.</p>
<p>With the help of a literature search by Babar Vaqas and from the experience of Terence Ryan, they prepared their advice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612438548">4</xref></sup> They chose to explain how procedures such as washing and use of emollients as well as body movements synchronized with breathing were self-help maneuvers likely to reduce lymphedema.</p>
<p>The suggested regimen appealed to S. R. Narahari, Director of the IAD in Kasaragod, North Kerala. A team qualified to provide the needed therapy was quickly set up, and visits from Terence Ryan, Christine Moffat, Peter Mortimer, and practitioners from the Foldi Clinic, Germany, and from the Netherlands have over the years provided advice to refine management not only in Kerala but in 2 outreach clinics. Key objectives have been locally available, sustainable, low cost, and mostly self help.</p>
<p>The problem to be solved was immense, not only in population terms but because of the great size of some affected limbs around the globe. In India alone, 553 million people are estimated to live in areas endemic for LF. Progressive lymphedema (from the early reversible stages to irreversible and complicated stages), which is associated with an increase in episodic attacks of acute adenolymphangitis is the most important cause of physical suffering, permanent disability, and economic loss. It has been estimated that there are some 16.02 million cases of lymphedema caused by LF globally, and of these, 7.44 million (46.4%) live in India.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612438548">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Over the years, India had seen diethyl carbamizine, plus or minus albendazole, delivered to whole populations, beginning the project to eliminate the disease. But new populations have developed the infection. Surgeons, especially those based in South East India have debulked very large limbs and introduced refined lymphatic anastomotic techniques to restore lymphatic function. Hospital beds are filled for prolonged periods, and only a small fraction of the affected population is likely to be managed in this way.</p>
<p>Ryan and Narahari believed that the need was to make available self-help therapy in rural villages, and they set up a research program to study management using Indian systems of medicine, such as herbal medicine and yoga. Heat therapy using steaming was also offered by India’s Ayurvedic system of medicine. It was important to add an explanation of how these might be of benefit, using knowledge to be found in biomedicine’s textbooks of physiology. Bandaging and hosiery, so important to practice in Europe, the Americas, and Australia, had to be adapted to India, where the best is unaffordable. The following is a description of what has been offered in a research program to more than 1000 sufferers of lymphedema of the legs.</p>
<sec id="section1-1534734612438548">
<title>Counselling</title>
<p>Patient concordance with a complex and demanding self-help regimen that is a burden to the individual and the many who participate in giving their support depends on skilled and time-consuming counselling. Every detail of the proposed therapy is discussed, and an understanding of lymphedema and its management is tested. Close family members also attend the sessions. That therapy will be lifelong is emphasized, and the opportunity is given to opt out.</p>
<p>The fact that there is a success story to be written about has to be credited to the dedication of the councilors and the support of the families and communities at the patient’s home—something that India with its extended families provides probably better than anywhere else. The regimen requires 2 weeks of residence and then follow-up at 1½ months and 3 months, so there are long periods during which the experts are not in attendance. The first 9 days are supervised, and during the last 5 days in the day care center, the family is taught to support the patient. The cost ranges from US$333 to US$555, which is borne by middle-class patients for whom this is affordable. Those who cannot afford it do not pay. In August 2010, the IAD received a grant of 20 million Indian rupees from the Government of India to provide free treatment in each of 2 endemic areas of South India. Telemedicine links have proved to be of value.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1534734612438548">
<title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>The team has biomedically trained members working very closely with Ayurvedic and yoga practitioners, both prominent in India. It was decided to record in detail—by means of written patient notes and photographically—all that should be known in providing gold standard care. Each patient has a 40-page case sheet.</p>
<p>The choice of homeopathy for history taking is based not only on the fact that India is rich in practitioners of homeopathy but also the fact that it is a system that asks questions about all aspects of a patient’s life. Other systems believe that a careful history is important but rarely do they give the time necessary, which is about 1 hour. Homeopathy has its critics but cannot be faulted for the time made available to the patient. At the IAD, this system is now mostly used for vitiligo, because we focused on quality of life in the case sheet, in which most of the history taking is structured and a detailed history is taken of drugs ingested for filariasis or of antibiotics for inflammatory episodes.</p>
<p>Of course, in biomedicine, we expect to examine the general state of a patient’s heath in a functional enquiry, but in Ayurveda, the status of health in constitutional terms is examined. According to the information provided, different mixes of herbals are prescribed.</p>
<p>It may be difficult for the biomedical practitioner to understand the relevance of some of the questions, but recently, different constitutions as recognized by Ayurveda have been found to be genetically determined. Lymphedema presents with different patterns in the skin, with gross changes in the epidermis, dermis, or subcutaneous tissue. These at present are recorded without histology but with special attention to bacterial entry points. The main record is of limb size, using what is specifically defined in biomedicine, such as the tape measure or water displacement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438548">6</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section3-1534734612438548">
<title>Treatment With Herbals</title>
<p>Washing was shown by Shenoy et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612438548">7</xref></sup> to be an effective way of reducing entry points for bacteria. The IAD adds Ayurvedic herbal mixtures to the wash, and this is followed by drying with a cotton towel.</p>
<p>The swollen limb is soaked in a herbal mixture (“phanta” solution) for 20 minutes, partly based on the diagnosis of the constitution. The several herbals prescribed may have antiseptic or anti-inflammatory effects, but at present, they are prescribed according to the Ayurvedic system of diagnosis. Later, we hope to investigate more thoroughly the possible mechanisms underlying their intervention. The patient also receives such medicaments by mouth, and a diet of healthy food is also advised.</p>

<sec id="section4-1534734612438548">
<title>Indian Manual Lymphatic Drainage (IMLD)</title>
<p>Part 1 of MLD (<italic>unmardhana</italic>) is a type of nonoil massage that requires the masseur to apply a squeezing pressure using both palms and fingers and moving from the tip of the toes to the upper edge of the lymphedema. This is performed for 10 minutes with the patient in a supine position. It is a maneuver that initiates a shift of lymph to and from the initial lymphatics in the upper dermis. Part 2 of MLD (<italic>udwarthana</italic>) is a massage using oil. In this procedure, oil is applied to the skin, and the limb is massaged in the opposite direction to hair growth. The oil is selected according to a local skin pathology table, which in 85.5% of patients was a combination of clinical presentations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1534734612438548">
<title>Yoga</title>
<p>There are several types of yoga. At the IAD, it is movement of the tissues synchronized with breathing that is taught. It replaces MLD and relies on self-help. This kind of yoga places the body in obviously advantageous seated or lying positions that enable reduced venous load and improved lymph flow: a straight back and a nontilted pelvis for example. Movements include whole body stretching, antigravity positioning, and ankle movements obviously ideal for reducing venous overload.</p>
<p>When for instance the legs are raised well above the head, one notes that this must be good for both venous and lymphatic drainage, and this is more likely in India than elsewhere to be second nature and culturally acceptable.</p>
<p>Breathing is coordinated. Breathing coordination with movement is probably ideal for emptying the large veins of the upper chest into which the thoracic duct’s lymph has to empty. To leave the large veins well filled and the dilated collecting lymphatics of the trunk equally overfilled when trying to enforce emptying of peripheral lymphatics is obviously without benefit. It is expiratory breathing that is emphasized, synchronized with body movements that shift the lymph. This is what the Chinese call <italic>dragon breathing</italic>, and a hissing sound accompanying it is encouraged. Chanting has the same effect.</p>
<p>Bernardi’s internal medicine group in Pavia emphasizes (Spicuzza et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612438548">8</xref></sup>) the role of slow breathing frequency and a chronic adaptation of pulmonary stretch receptors and attenuation of vagal afferent discharge to the bulbopontine centers. Such synchronized breathing is believed to empty core lymphatic trunks facilitating emptying of the peripheral impeded and overfilled lymphatics. Thus, during the distal to proximal movement in IMLD parts 1 and 2, the patient breathes out slowly or holds the breath after exhalation. The patient takes a sudden and deep inhalation during the pause between the end and beginning of IMLD strokes. IMLD is administered by a masseur who subsequently coaches the patient’s home caregiver in the technique.</p>
<p>This yoga is done twice each session. The first time, it is done without bandaging, and then later, the movements within support bandaging encourages muscle contraction to work against some resistance when contracting and squeezing the tissues, so that lymph exits.</p>
<p>In lymphedema, especially from filariasis, the long-collecting ducts are grossly dilated and overfilled, and they have lost their contractility. The contractility of the vessels is influenced by the autonomic nervous system, also influenced by yoga. Another feature of lymphedema is the poor health of the adipose tissue, which is often hypoxic and inflamed. Such loss of lymphatic function and unhealthy adipose tissue responds to expiratory breathing by vasoconstriction (whereas healthy adipose tissue responds by both vasodilation and vasoconstriction).</p>
<p>The patients in Kerala are taught to breathe through one side of the nose only. With the vagus on the left of the chest, a parasympathetic response to changing intrathoracic pressure, when breathing through the left side of the nose, may be distinguished from right sided sympathetic responses when breathing through the right side of the nose.</p>
<p>The IAD intends to do more studies of these responses, but it is of note that in China expensive electronic equipment to raise intrathoracic pressure to control lymphedema has recently been introduced. It has always been our aim not to use expensive equipment but to focus on entrainment that is entirely of a self-help kind.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1534734612438548">
<title>Heating</title>
<p>Heating is a well-established treatment in Asia. It has both mechanical and biochemical effects. The melting point of fat and the effectiveness of lipases require that fat is not solidified. Enzymes such as collagenase have an optimal temperature of 37°C rarely reached in the lymphedematous periphery. The emptying of fluid from the tissues into the lymphatic system is not so rapidly increased by any other intervention. IAD adopted the Ayurvedic therapy called S<italic>wedana</italic> (inducing sweat over the affected limb). Patients with hardened limbs showing nonpitting edema (“organized/tight limbs”) were given Ayurvedic heat treatment over the affected limb under medical supervision for the first 14 days. Herbalized steam made with the roots of 10 herbs is passed through a pipe and sprayed directly over the affected area. An additional layer of oil used for massage in IMLD 2 is applied over the area before steaming. The steam is sprayed until the treated limb shows uniform beads of moisture. The process is continued until the patient cannot tolerate the heat any longer. This takes an average of 15 to 20minutes. Pain and temperature sensations were tested before administering this treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612438548">5</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1534734612438548">
<title>Bandages and Hosiery</title>
<p>At the end of 6 months, estimates of cost found that compression bandaging, of all procedures, is the most expensive accounting for around 42.6% of the cost for 14 days of treatment and around 60% of the cost after 6 months of treatment. Biomedicine has a large range of bandages and hosiery, some of which is donated to the IAD. However, short-stretch bandages and well-fitted hosiery are too expensive for the resource-poor village patient unless donated. Short-stretch bandages are not available routinely in the Indian market. Some patients may need at least 20 bandages per week and ample foam rubber materials that help reshape the limb. The life of a bandage is short after it has experienced the heat of the tropics and washing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1534734612438548">
<title>Skin Camps</title>
<p>Many dermatologists in India organize skin camps in schools or religious houses, and the IAD is no exception. Advertising in advance that therapy will be available free for a particular disease will result in many hundreds of affected patients turning up. The IAD gives training in washing and reducing bacterial entry points and teaches yoga in such camps.</p>
<p>In addition, a community model using village health workers and selected patients that have learned the system is proving to be of value to enlarge the teaching workforce.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1534734612438548">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 1315 limbs in 964 patients were treated using integrated medicine during October 2004 to November 2011. Entry points were present in 86.4% limbs at baseline and in 71.6% of limbs at the end of 3 months. Most of these entry points are a result of the persistence of intertrigo and maceration in the fourth toe web space. Recently, the topical cream of amorolfine hydrochloride was introduced to the Indian market. There is better response to this drug, and the prevalence of entry points in recently treated patients is less than previously recorded. The simplest and single most impressive results have been an almost immediate reduction in inflammatory episodes from 80.4% to 8.6%.within 2 or 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734612438548">Figure 1</xref>), and therefore cessation of intake of antibiotics. The second is reduction in the size of the limb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734612438548">Figure 2</xref>). It is useful to record the results in the very large limbs seen frequently in India separately from the more frequent smaller degree of swelling that is seen in patients in the West. Volume reduction for large-sized limbs at 3 months following treatment is 39%, with a confidence interval of 4.9 to 5.9 L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534734612438548">Figure 3</xref>). It is 24.2% for small limbs, with a CI of 1.3 to 1.6 L. Using McNemar’s test, a significant change from 25.5% to 7.5% in skin fold thickness with a <italic>P</italic> value of zero is observed after 3 months of treatment.</p>

<p>Although an almost normal limb is desirable, patients who have not left their bed for many months at presentation are satisfied if they resume their normal occupation. The quality of life measurement and participation data are often the most convincing that the IAD is making a huge contribution to morbidity control. The results have impressed many international experts. The results on these &gt;1300 limbs are currently undergoing audit. The IAD has experience in conducting Ayurvedic systematic reviews and using evidence-based medicine. IAD is a recognized leader in both, and it is helping its doctors conduct the patient audit scientifically.</p>
<p>The fact that a large new building has been opened in December 2011 and that outreach programs have been started up are all an indication of progress. The teledermatology link has proved to be useful. Dedicated teams have been trained for the outreach centers in Chertala in Kerala and Gulbarga in Karnataka. However, this is not an indication of adequate resources; much is being borrowed.</p>
<p>Audit rather than research into mechanisms is under way. The reversal of the gross hypertrophy of some very large limbs urgently needs explanation. The pathology seen in the epidermis, the gross fibrosis, and the excessive adipose tissue deserves much more study. Funding would greatly help these causes. More knowledge about such a low-cost self-help maneuver, as is represented by yoga, is also highly desirable.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of an able team with international advisers, India has an enterprise likely to benefit millions who suffer from lymphedema not only caused by filariasis but also other, as yet poorly estimated, causes of lymphedema such as malignancy, other infections, and immobility.</p>
<p>Understanding lymphedema will also lead to better self-help, at low cost, for chronic wound healing. As indicated, there are many other problems of pathogenesis in the epidermis, dermis, and adipose tissue that have yet to be explained, including elephantiasis and its reversal. All this depends on adequate finance.</p>
