<abstract>
<p>This paper is a response to Bandura’s 2012 Guest Editorial, which defends the functional properties of self-efficacy by criticizing published studies that have demonstrated a negative relationship between self-efficacy and performance at the within-person level of analysis. We focus on the theoretical and methodological criticisms that Bandura has made in relation to our (Yeo &amp; Neal) 2006 piece that examined the dynamic relationship between self-efficacy and performance across levels of analysis and specificity. In doing so, we explain the importance of designing and analyzing studies involving self-efficacy at the within-person level of analysis. We then demonstrate how the concept of resource allocation can explain the co-existence of positive and negative dynamic self-efficacy effects across the between- and within-person levels of analysis. We acknowledge the great strides that researchers have made in understanding the complex and dynamic processes involving self-efficacy and encourage researchers to continue this collective effort.</p>

<p>This paper is a response to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206313490027">Bandura’s (2012)</xref> Guest Editorial, which defends the functional properties of self-efficacy by criticizing published studies that have demonstrated a negative relationship between self-efficacy and performance at the within-person level of analysis.

<title>Social Cognitive Theory and Levels of Analysis</title>
<p>Social cognitive theory has been, and will continue to be, influential in the field of management and related disciplines. It is widely accepted that self-efficacy plays a critical role in self-regulation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206313490027">Schmidt, Beck, &amp; Gillespie, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206313490027">Sitzmann &amp; Ely, 2011</xref>). There is overwhelming evidence, from both correlational and experimental studies, showing that highly efficacious individuals tend to set more challenging goals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206313490027">Robbins, Lauver, Lee, Davis, Langley, &amp; Carlstrom, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206313490027">Sitzmann &amp; Ely, 2011</xref>), strive harder (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206313490027">Colquitt, LePine, &amp; Noe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206313490027">Sitzmann &amp; Ely, 2011</xref>), persist for longer (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206313490027">Multon, Brown, &amp; Lent, 1991</xref>), feel better (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206313490027">Judge &amp; Bono, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206313490027">Sitzmann &amp; Ely, 2011</xref>), and achieve better results than their counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206313490027">Moritz, Fleltz, Fahrbach, &amp; Mack, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206313490027">Multon et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206313490027">Sadri &amp; Robertson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206313490027">Stajkovic &amp; Luthans, 1998</xref>). However, these meta-analyses, as well as the majority of primary studies included in them, were conducted at the between-person level of analysis, which does not provide a complete picture of self-efficacy’s role in self-regulation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206313490027">Lord, Diefendorff, Schmidt, and Hall (2010)</xref>, for example, observe that although “between-person research consistently shows positive associations between self-efficacy and performance . . . within-person research finds self-efficacy can be negatively associated with subsequent performance” (pp. 544-545) and argue that between-person research “may do little to inform our understanding of within-person self-regulatory processes” (p. 545).</p>
<p>The problem that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206313490027">Lord et al. (2010)</xref> referred to is known as the “ecological fallacy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206313490027">Chen, Bliese, &amp; Mathieu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206313490027">Cooper &amp; Patall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206313490027">Robinson, 1950</xref>)—it involves equating findings that are based on aggregated data to findings based on disaggregated data that ignore group membership. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206313490027">Robinson’s (1950)</xref> seminal work demonstrated that literacy rates were higher in U.S. states with a greater percentage of foreign-born individuals (<italic>r</italic> = .62) but that literacy was negatively correlated with foreign birth when the data were examined at the individual level (<italic>r</italic> = –.12). This example of the ecological fallacy involves individuals nested within groups; however, the ecological fallacy also applies to situations in which repeated measurements are nested within individuals (i.e., the individual is the “group”). For example, individuals who exercise frequently tend to have lower blood pressure than those who exercise less frequently; yet for any given individual, an increase in exercise can increase blood pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0149206313490027">1</xref></sup> As these examples show, it is essential to design and analyze effects at the level at which they are expected to operate.</p>
<p>Social cognitive theory describes a set of processes that operate at the within-person level of analysis. Self-efficacy is defined as an individual’s belief regarding his or her capability to succeed and attain a given level of performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206313490027">Bandura, 1977</xref>). Social cognitive theory identifies two mechanisms by which this belief influences motivation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206313490027">Bandura (1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206313490027">1997</xref>) terms these mechanisms “discrepancy production” and “discrepancy reduction.” The argument is that high self-efficacy causes people to set more challenging goals, thereby creating a discrepancy between the current and desired state. The person then acts to reduce this discrepancy by applying more effort and using more effective strategies. These are dynamic processes that unfold within individuals, over time, and should thus be observed and analyzed at the within-person level.</p>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206313490027">Bandura (2012)</xref> identified a number of requirements for the test of social cognitive theory, he omitted one important condition, namely, that any empirical test of a theory must be conducted at the appropriate level of analysis. A problem with empirical tests of social cognitive theory is that, until recently (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206313490027">Vancouver, Thompson, &amp; Williams, 2001</xref>), most studies analyzed effects at the between-person level rather than the within-person level. The issue of levels of analysis is central to the debate over the functional properties of self-efficacy, because mis-specification of levels may produce spurious results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206313490027">Sitzmann &amp; Yeo, in press</xref>). Aggregating within-person variance to the between-person level can mask the true direction and/or magnitude of effects at the within-person level. Aggregation is particularly problematic for situations in which a given construct (such as self-efficacy) could have opposing effects across levels of analysis. Analyses conducted at the between-person level are useful for addressing research questions that relate to static differences between individuals. For example, such analyses were appropriate for Bandura’s early work that examined whether individuals with higher self-efficacy were more likely to overcome phobias than those with lower self-efficacy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206313490027">Bandura &amp; Adams, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206313490027">Bandura, Reese, &amp; Adams, 1982</xref>). However, between-person analyses in isolation cannot assess how changes in self-efficacy within an individual relate to subsequent changes in performance. In the next section, we demonstrate how the concept of resource allocation can explain the co-existence of positive and negative dynamic self-efficacy effects across the between- and within-person levels of analysis.</p>

<title>Resource Allocation Theory and the Direction of Dynamic Self-Efficacy Effects</title>
<p>Bandura accused us of piecemeal theorizing. Needless to say, we disagree. We used a single mechanism—cognitive resources—to generate predictions regarding the way in which the relationships among self-efficacy (both general and task specific) and performance may change throughout skill acquisition. There is a long history in psychology of using the hypothetical concept of cognitive resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206313490027">Humphreys &amp; Revelle, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206313490027">Kahneman, 1973</xref>) as an explanatory mechanism. The concept of cognitive resources is useful, because it provides a means of explaining complex phenomena that would otherwise be difficult to account for. Examples include the effects of dual-task interference, arousal, fatigue, ability, and motivation on performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206313490027">Hockey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206313490027">Humphreys &amp; Revelle, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206313490027">Kanfer &amp; Ackerman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206313490027">Navon &amp; Gopher, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206313490027">Yeo &amp; Neal, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In the current context, the concept of cognitive resources provides a means of understanding the effects of self-efficacy on performance in a dynamic context—that is, in which both constructs change over time and thus vary within, as well as between, individuals. Changes in resource demands over time can be used to explain how the effects of self-efficacy at different levels of analysis may change throughout skill acquisition. Previous results regarding the relationship between self-efficacy and performance over time have been mixed—the relationship strengthened in some studies yet weakened or remained stable in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206313490027">Lee &amp; Klein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206313490027">Mitchell, Hopper, Daniels, George-Falvy, &amp; James, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206313490027">Vancouver et al., 2001</xref>). Resource allocation theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206313490027">Kahneman, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206313490027">Kanfer &amp; Ackerman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206313490027">Yeo &amp; Neal, 2004</xref>) provides a principled basis for reasoning about these effects. The core elements of this approach are explained below.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206313490027">Kanfer and Ackerman (1989)</xref>, we assume that individuals have a limited pool (or availability) of cognitive resources, which can be allocated to on-task, off-task, and self-regulatory activities. Resource availability is expected to differ across individuals, primarily as a function of cognitive ability. The greater the pool of cognitive resources, the more capacity an individual has for setting higher goals, persisting for longer, and using more effective strategies than his or her counterparts. Resource allocation is expected to vary over time, due to dynamic contextual factors, such as task demands and task engagement. The allocation of these limited resources is governed by a compensatory mechanism such that resources are allocated according to need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206313490027">Hockey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206313490027">Vancouver, 2005</xref>). For example, when task demands are low, an individual will devote relatively few resources to the task. As task demands increase, the individual will increase his or her allocation of resources to the task, until he or she reaches the point of maximum motivational potential, which is the maximum amount of effort that the individual is prepared to allocate to the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206313490027">Brehm &amp; Self, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206313490027">Hockey, 1997</xref>). At this point, the person may change his or her strategy, lower his or her goal, or withdraw from the task.</p>
<p>Turning to the effects of self-efficacy, prior research suggests that people who are highly efficacious tend to have higher ability, use more effective strategies, set more difficult goals, and persist for longer than people who are not efficacious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206313490027">Chen, Gully, &amp; Eden, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206313490027">Kanfer &amp; Heggestad, 1997</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0149206313490027">2</xref></sup> If so, then people with high self-efficacy should, on average, allocate more resources to the focal task, and use those resources more effectively, than people with low self-efficacy. As a result, people with high self-efficacy should learn faster, and reach their performance asymptote earlier, than people with low self-efficacy. These processes should produce a positive main effect of self-efficacy on performance at the between-person level that initially strengthens over time as the performance trajectories diverge and then weakens as the performance trajectories converge (after individuals with high self-efficacy reach their asymptote).</p>
<p>At the within-person level, this account suggests that fluctuations in self-efficacy during a performance episode should be negatively associated with the dynamic allocation of resources. Efficacy judgments are a source of information indicating what proportion of resources are needed to meet task requirements—a decrease in self-efficacy signals the need for more resources to compensate for higher task demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206313490027">Vancouver, Weinhardt, &amp; Schmidt, 2010</xref>). Consequently, self-efficacy should be negatively associated with performance at the within-person level. Note that although self-efficacy and performance trajectories are expected to be positive overall (as described above), dynamic contextual factors (e.g., task demands, task engagement) should produce within-person deviations around these trajectories (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206313490027">Sitzmann &amp; Yeo, in press</xref>, for a description of this phenomenon). For example, when task demands reduce from one trial to the next, an individual’s self-efficacy should increase. This change in self-efficacy should prompt a reduced allocation of cognitive resources and subsequent decrease in performance. When task demands increase from one trial to the next, an individual’s self-efficacy should decrease. This change in self-efficacy should prompt an increased allocation of cognitive resources and subsequent improvement in performance.</p>
<p>Our results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206313490027">Yeo &amp; Neal, 2006</xref>) are consistent with this theoretical account. Task-specific self-efficacy was negatively related to performance at the within-person level, whereas general self-efficacy and average task-specific self-efficacy were positively related to performance at the between-person level. Furthermore, the average level of task-specific self-efficacy reported by participants during the experiment predicted the shape of the performance trajectory. This interaction is particularly noteworthy—as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206313490027">Figure 1</xref>, the performance trajectories of individuals with high self-efficacy diverged from those with low self-efficacy early in practice but then converged again toward the end as individuals with high self-efficacy reached their performance asymptote. This finding is consistent with our theoretical framework and shows why it is important to consider the dynamics of the underlying process when reasoning about the effects of self-efficacy.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206313490027">Bandura (2012)</xref> questioned how it is possible for general self-efficacy and task-specific self-efficacy to work in opposing directions. We are puzzled by this reaction because the notion of opposing self-efficacy effects is consistent with social cognitive theory. As explained above, the role of discrepancy production processes in generating positive self-efficacy effects is central to social cognitive theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206313490027">Bandura, 1977</xref>). In parallel, social cognitive theory also recognizes the role of discrepancy reduction processes and acknowledges that self-efficacy effects may be negative when such processes are active (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206313490027">Bandura &amp; Locke, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to note that there are boundary conditions relating to the effects described above. The theoretical explanation that we have presented assumes that people act to conserve resources. This mechanism is important in situations in which people have competing demands and limited resources, but it is not universal. For example, many of the early examinations of self-efficacy used tasks or settings in which people were asked to cope with something aversive (e.g., submersing one’s arm in freezing cold water; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206313490027">Litt, 1988</xref>) or interact with feared stimuli (e.g., snakes for people with a snake phobia; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206313490027">Bandura &amp; Adams, 1977</xref>). These tasks do not require people to make choices regarding the allocation of a limited pool of resources. Thus, an increase in self-efficacy in these tasks is unlikely to signal that the person can reduce the amount of effort that they are applying.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206313490027">Sitzmann and Yeo’s (in press)</xref> within-person meta-analysis highlighted the importance of boundary conditions. Their results showed a null relationship between self-efficacy and performance after controlling for past performance and the linear trend. However, substantial variability was unaccounted for by available moderators, so they urged researchers to continue searching for moderators to understand when the effect may be positive or negative. Vancouver, Schmidt, and their colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206313490027">Beck &amp; Schmidt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206313490027">Schmidt &amp; DeShon, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206313490027">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206313490027">Vancouver, More, &amp; Yoder, 2008</xref>) are leading the field in this regard. To date, the potential moderators assessed in these papers have been treated somewhat independently. However, an implicit theme underlying this work is that a negative self-efficacy effect is expected when an increase in self-efficacy signals that resources are not required for success and can thus be conserved (e.g., for people with high average self-efficacy, in easy tasks, and following prior success or satisfactory goal progress); whereas a positive effect is expected when an increase in self-efficacy signals that resources are likely to improve the chance of success and thus be a worthwhile investment (e.g., for people with low average self-efficacy, in difficult tasks, and following prior failure or unsatisfactory goal progress).</p>
<p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206313490027">Beck and Schmidt (2012)</xref> provided support for their argument that a negative effect exists for people with high average self-efficacy (those whose judgments of self-efficacy fluctuate around the high end of the continuum). The authors argued that these individuals believe that the task can be completed easily, so a momentary increase in self-efficacy for them indicates that resources can be diverted elsewhere. On the other hand, Beck and Schmidt provided support for their argument that a positive effect exists for people with low average self-efficacy. The authors argued that these individuals believe that success is in doubt, such that a momentary increase in self-efficacy for them should indicate that there may be a chance of success if resources are allocated to the task. Interpreting these findings under our framework suggests that both individuals with high and low average self-efficacy act to conserve resources but under different conditions and in different ways. Those with high average self-efficacy act under the premise that resources will not necessarily be required for success, so they will be expended only when required; otherwise they will be conserved for another task. Those with low average self-efficacy act under the premise that resources will be required for success, so they will use them when they are likely to lead to success and otherwise conserve them for another time during engagement of the current task.</p>

<title>Criticisms Related to Analysis</title>
<p>Bandura’s criticism related to selective reporting of results is arguably the most damning. He accused us of misleading readers as to what variables were included in our analyses, claiming that affect was included but not reported. This claim is incorrect. Our analyses were conducted exactly as reported in the paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206313490027">Yeo &amp; Neal, 2006</xref>). Negative affect was measured for another purpose (to examine the relationships among Behavioral Inhibition System, negative affect and performance over time; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206313490027">Koy &amp; Yeo, 2008</xref>) but was not included in the analyses reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206313490027">Yeo and Neal (2006)</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206313490027">Stajkovic and Bandura (2010)</xref> re-analyzed our data, running a series of hierarchical linear models comprising various combinations of predictors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206313490027">Bandura (2012)</xref> reported that in “all of the performance prediction models, . . . self-efficacy was <italic>positively</italic> related to subsequent performance” (pp. 32-33). He then stated that the “miniscule negative self-efficacy effect was obtained by measuring the effect of pretrial self-efficacy on subsequent performance after controlling for future self-efficacies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206313490027">Bandura, 2012</xref>, p. 33). Putting aside the inherent contradiction between these claims (the self-efficacy effect could not have been positive in all models if it was negative in at least one), it appears that the difference between <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206313490027">Stajkovic and Bandura’s (2010)</xref> results and ours is that they did not control for average task-specific self-efficacy (referred to as “future self-efficacies” by Bandura). When interested in the within-person relationship between self-efficacy and performance, it is essential to control for the aggregate at Level 2 if the Level 1 variable is grand-mean centered.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0149206313490027">3</xref></sup> If this control is not included, the estimate of the within-person relationship will be biased because a grand-mean centered Level 1 variable includes both within- and between-person variance. Not surprisingly then, when average task-specific self-efficacy is excluded from the analyses reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206313490027">Yeo and Neal (2006)</xref>, the within-person effect of task-specific self-efficacy switches from negative (significant) to positive (non-significant). The negative effect of task-specific self-efficacy remains significant when group-mean centering is used (with and without controlling for the aggregate at Level 2). Also, the results found for these various combinations of analyses hold when negative affect is included as a control variable.</p>

<title>Criticisms Related to Design</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206313490027">Bandura (2012)</xref> argued that our design was flawed because we confounded “type of self-efficacy (specific or general) with degree of performance aggregation (discrete or lumped together” (p. 32). He challenged the conclusion we drew regarding the positive effect of general self-efficacy versus the negative effect of task-specific self-efficacy because we allegedly examined a different form of performance for each construct. That is, he stated that we tested the effect of general self-efficacy and aggregated task-specific self-efficacy on “aggregated performance” and the effect of task-specific self-efficacy on “discrete performance,” but the conclusion we drew necessitated a comparison between general self-efficacy and “discrete performance” (p. 32). These comments reflect a misunderstanding of multi-level analysis. General self-efficacy varies only between individuals, so it can predict only between-person variance in performance. Multilevel modeling is appropriate because it can examine task-specific self-efficacy as a predictor of within-person variance in performance, while <italic>simultaneously</italic> examining general self-efficacy as a predictor of between-person variance in the performance intercepts (i.e., individuals’ average levels of performance) and slopes (i.e., individuals’ performance trajectories).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206313490027">Bandura (2012)</xref> also criticized the absence of goals in our model. He argued that “one cannot test Perceptual Control Theory without a goal comparator. . . . Without it, there is no discrepancy for self-efficacy to affect, thereby stripping the feedback loop of its essential error correction function” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206313490027">Bandura, 2012</xref>, p. 31). We did not aim to test perceptual control theory but, rather, aimed to examine relationships among self-efficacy and performance across levels of analysis and specificity. The experimental design that we used was appropriate, given the question that we were addressing.</p>

<title>Criticisms Related to Measurement</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206313490027">Bandura (2012)</xref> criticized both of our (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206313490027">Yeo &amp; Neal, 2006</xref>) self-efficacy measures. First, he argued that the general self-efficacy measure should be an aggregate of self-efficacy measurements across different task contexts. There is debate regarding the best way to measure stable individual differences in self-efficacy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206313490027">Jackson et al., 2012</xref>); however, evidence suggests that such differences do exist. Given the demonstrated validity of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206313490027">Chen et al.’s (2004)</xref> General Self-Efficacy (GSE) measure, we believe that it is reasonable to assume that stable differences in self-efficacy will be captured, at least in part, by the GSE measure. It is possible that using Bandura’s approach would have led to stronger GSE effects in our data; however, doing so would not have changed the interpretation of our findings as a whole.</p>
<p>Second, he argued that our task-specific self-efficacy measure did not include enough performance levels (i.e., the number of items that are used to create the composite self-efficacy score) and consequently the relationships involving this measure would be distorted. Prior to each trial, we asked participants to rate their self-efficacy for an easy, moderate, and difficult level of performance and took the average of these ratings as the self-efficacy score for that trial. Strangely, the work that Bandura cited to back up his argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206313490027">Pajares, Hartley, &amp; Valiante, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206313490027">Streiner &amp; Norman, 1989</xref>) related to the number and type of response options rather than the number of items that are used to calculate the composite scale score. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206313490027">Pajares et al. (2001)</xref> concluded that the predictive validity of a 0-to-100 scale is stronger than a 6-point Likert scale. The three items in our self-efficacy scale are each rated on a 0-to-10 scale. Despite this mismatch between argument and evidence, the fact that our measure predicted performance shows that the three items we used were sufficient for predictive validity. It is possible that a measure based on a greater number of items would strengthen our effects. However, this is unlikely given that three items are sufficient to obtain internal consistency and item homogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206313490027">Hinkin, 1998</xref>). More importantly, Bandura’s argument gives us no reason to expect that doing so would produce a change in direction from negative to positive. Further, we are not aware of research that suggests that three items in particular is insufficient for detecting relationships or that four, in comparison, is sufficient (Bandura was positive about <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206313490027">Seo &amp; Ilies’ [2009]</xref> work, and their self-efficacy measure is based on four items).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, we are puzzled by Bandura’s reaction to our results, given that social cognitive theory allows for the possibility of negative effects of self-efficacy at the within-person level. It is hard to escape the conclusion that Bandura is being selective in his critique, seeking to criticize studies that demonstrate a negative within-person self-efficacy effect, without applying the same standards to within-person studies that demonstrate a positive effect of self-efficacy. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206313490027">Bandura (2012)</xref> criticized our 2006 paper yet cited one of our unpublished conference papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206313490027">Neal &amp; Yeo, 2003</xref>) as one of a number of “well-designed studies of the role of self-efficacy in within person change [that] verify its positive function” (p. 18). This paper was cited because it demonstrated that the relationship between self-efficacy and performance became positive when participants were provided with unambiguous feedback. We did attempt to publish this work; however, the paper was rejected for publication because the manipulation of task ambiguity was confounded. It seems ironic that work that has not passed the test of peer review is viewed more favorably than work that has.</p>
<p>It is important to note that we are not claiming that the negative effect of self-efficacy at the within-person level is universal (it is not), and we are not advocating social policies that undermine self-efficacy. Like others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206313490027">Beck &amp; Schmidt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206313490027">Schmidt &amp; DeShon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206313490027">Seo &amp; Ilies, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206313490027">Vancouver &amp; Kendall, 2006</xref>), we are trying to identify boundary conditions that influence the direction and magnitude of self-efficacy effects on motivation and performance and to understand the mechanisms that underlie these dynamic processes. Over the last decade, researchers have made great strides in understanding this complex and dynamic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206313490027">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206313490027">Sitzmann &amp; Yeo, in press</xref>). We have no doubt that our collective understanding of this process will continue to improve over the next decade and beyond, provided we continue to apply the resources that are required to achieve this goal.</p>

<p>This research refers to situations in general, such that those with high ability tend to have higher self-efficacy across contexts than their counterparts, presumably because repeated experiences of success foster the development of self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206313490027">Sitzmann &amp; Yeo, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206313490027">Vancouver, 2005</xref>). Within contexts, however, research suggests that the poorest performers (or the least skilled) overestimate their abilities, whereas the top performers underestimate their abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206313490027">Dunning, Johnson, Ehrlinger, &amp; Kruger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206313490027">Ehrlinger, Johnson, Banner, Dunning, &amp; Kruger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206313490027">Kruger &amp; Dunning, 1999</xref>). If self-estimates of ability are viewed synonymously with efficacy judgments, the positive between-person relationship between self-efficacy and performance may be attenuated in such situations. The relationship is unlikely to switch to negative, because the top performers in these studies still had higher estimates of abilities than the poor performers.</p>

<p>An alternative method for estimating the within-person relationship in an unbiased manner is to use group-mean centering at Level 1 without the aggregate at Level 2 (however, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206313490027">Hofmann &amp; Gavin, 1998</xref>, for additional benefits of controlling for the aggregate). Also note that multilevel-modeling results based on group-versus grand-mean centered Level 1 variables are mathematically equivalent if the aggregate is included as a Level 2 variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206313490027">Hofmann &amp; Gavin, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206313490027">Yeo and Neal (2006)</xref> used grand-mean centering at Level 1 in order to avoid problems estimating effect sizes associated with group-mean centering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206313490027">Snijders &amp; Bosker, 1994</xref>).</p>
