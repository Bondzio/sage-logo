<abstract>
<p>Abuse and neglect are well-established risk correlates of borderline personality disorder (BPD). The goal of this study was to examine whether BPD probands can be differentiated from their sisters with respect to a range of developmental adversity and maltreatment indicators, including retrospective self-reports of past experiences of childhood abuse and neglect, dysfunctional parent–child relationships and peer victimization and dysfunctional peer relationships. A total of 53 patients with BPD were compared to 53 sisters who were currently free of psychopathology on measures assessing childhood adversities. Both probands and sisters reported similar prevalence of intrafamilial abuse, although BPD patients reported more severe physical and emotional abuse. BPD patients reported higher prevalence of physical abuse by peers. These findings generally support the principle of multifinality, in which similar histories of adversities can be associated with a variety of outcomes, ranging from psychopathology to resilience.</p>

<body>
<p>Numerous studies have found that women with borderline personality disorder (BPD) tend to report a highly pathogenic and chaotic family environment (Zanarini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1077559512461173">2000</xref>). Not all patients describe such histories, but childhood abuse and neglect, as well as dysfunctional parental relationships, are clearly risk correlates of BPD, although these experiences are neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of BPD (Paris, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1077559512461173">2008</xref>). Most studies that have reported associations between childhood maltreatment and the development of BPD have drawn conclusions from between-family comparisons of unrelated individuals. No study to date has used a within-family comparison of BPD patients and their siblings, which could address some of the confounds associated with between-family designs (Dick, Johnson, Viken, &amp; Rose, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077559512461173">2000</xref>). Furthermore, most previous studies have focused on assessing the impact of proximal experiences such as child-parent relationships and maltreatment. Less attention has been paid to factors from a broader developmental context, such as peer relationships and peer victimization, which could also be risk correlates of BPD. The present study was designed to address these gaps in the research literature.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077559512461173">
<title>Sibling Design</title>
<p>The use of sibling comparisons in psychiatry is a relatively novel approach that has some advantages and avoids some of the limitations associated with the use of between-family designs (Bifulco, Brown, &amp; Lillie, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077559512461173">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077559512461173">Hines, Kaufman, Kantor, &amp; Holt, 2006</xref>; Johnson, Cohen, Brown, Smailes, &amp; Berstein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077559512461173">1999</xref>; Laporte &amp; Guttman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077559512461173">1998</xref>; Paris, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077559512461173">1997</xref>). Sibling design is one way to reduce some of the background genetic variance and to control for some of the confounding variables common to children raised in the same family (Dick et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077559512461173">2000</xref>). Thus, a sib-pair methodology provides the opportunity to study participants who could have experienced a similar family background and psychosocial environment and, may have experienced comparable adversities such as poverty, caregiver stress, lack of parenting skills, parental spousal abuse, caregiver substance abuse, and mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077559512461173">MacKenzie, Kotch, Lee, Augsberber, &amp; Hutto, 2011</xref>). This design also provides an opportunity to verify whether siblings within a family are subjected to different levels or types of abusive parental behaviors and to examine the association of these adverse experiences with current levels of functioning. Although interviewing siblings about the perception of their developmental history is not a method that permits researchers to validate the veracity of retrospective reports, it does provide information on their potential consistency (Brewin, Andrews, &amp; Gotlib, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077559512461173">1993</xref>; Fergusson, Boden, &amp; Horwood, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077559512461173">2008</xref>), in the absence of prospective and objective measures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1077559512461173">
<title>Abuse, Neglect, and Psychopathology</title>
<p>Both retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated that childhood abuse and neglect constitute risk correlates for the development of psychopathology (Bifulco &amp; Moran, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077559512461173">1998</xref>; Kessler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077559512461173">2010</xref>; Whitmore, Kramer, &amp; Knutson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1077559512461173">1993</xref>), as are dysfunctional families and parental behaviors (O'Connor, Jenkins, Pickering, &amp; Rasbash, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077559512461173">2001</xref>). At the same time, evidence suggests that children vary considerably in their responses to significant adversity, such that not all abused and neglected children will develop mental health symptoms in adulthood. This has been demonstrated in studies which report that between 25% and 33% of severely abused children do not go on to develop psychiatric problems and appear to be relatively unaffected (Collishaw et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077559512461173">2007</xref>; McGloin &amp; Widom, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077559512461173">2001</xref>). Even among children who have experienced multiple childhood adversities, 50% will achieve good developmental outcomes (Bernard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077559512461173">2006</xref>). This is consistent with a relationship between childhood maltreatment and psychopathology that is the product of a complex interplay between cultural, social, familial, and personal factors (Dick et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077559512461173">2000</xref>; Fergusson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077559512461173">2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Childhood Maltreatment and the Development of BPD</title>
<p>A key focus in the literature on BPD and early adversity has been on elevated levels of childhood sexual and physical abuse reported by these patients (Davidson, Devaney, &amp; Spratt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077559512461173">2010</xref>; Widom, Cjaza, &amp; Paris, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1077559512461173">2009</xref>; Zanarini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1077559512461173">2000</xref>) with sexual abuse as one of the strongest antecedents of BPD (Paris, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1077559512461173">2008</xref>). Recently, attention has also been paid to the potential impact of parental emotional abuse on emotional dysregulation (Allen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077559512461173">2008</xref>), which is a key feature of BPD. Researchers in the broader domain of maltreatment (Finkelhor, Turner, Ormrod, &amp; Hamb, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077559512461173">2010</xref>) and in studies of BPD in particular (Paris, Zweig-Frank, &amp; Guzder, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077559512461173">1994</xref>) have also emphasized the importance of documenting a range of parameters (e.g., severity, duration, and frequency) across multiple types of abuse (e.g., sexual, physical, emotional) in the association of childhood adversity with adult outcomes. In the case of BPD, about 25% of patients report having been sexually abused by caretakers (Paris et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077559512461173">1994</xref>; Stone, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1077559512461173">1990</xref>; Zanarini &amp; Frankenburg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1077559512461173">1997</xref>) and some studies have found even higher rates (Laporte &amp; Guttman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077559512461173">1996</xref>). Many patients with BPD also report having been sexually abused by nonfamily members, and multiple experiences of maltreatment can have an additive or synergistic effect (Greenfield &amp; Marks, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077559512461173">2010</xref>; Laporte &amp; Guttman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077559512461173">1996</xref>; Paris, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1077559512461173">2008</xref>). Variations in characteristics of abuse have been associated with variations in risk of adult psychopathology (Collishaw et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077559512461173">2007</xref>), with relationship to the abuser emerging as a particularly important factor (Browne &amp; Finkelhor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077559512461173">1986</xref>). Schilling, Aseltine, and Gore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1077559512461173">2008</xref>) have demonstrated the importance of considering the differential severity of each adversity when constructing a composite score of childhood adversity, which may be a key to the study of maltreatment sequelae in personality disorders (Laporte &amp; Guttman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077559512461173">1996</xref>; Paris, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1077559512461173">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Another type of adversity that patients with BPD may report is peer victimization during childhood or adolescence. A growing body of research shows that abuse perpetrated by peers or dating partners is more prevalent in those who have experienced previous maltreatment and that these adverse events can be associated with long-term detrimental effects (Hawker &amp; Boulton, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077559512461173">2000</xref>; Putnam, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1077559512461173">2010</xref>; Teicher, Samson, Sheu, Polcari, &amp; McGreenery, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1077559512461173">2010</xref>). There are also numerous reports of associations between childhood peer victimization and depression, suicidality, antisocial personality disorder, or psychotic symptoms (Arsenault et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077559512461173">2011</xref>), and these symptoms can persist in adulthood (Brunstein, Sourander, &amp; Gould, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077559512461173">2010</xref>). At present, there are little data concerning the specific role of peer victimization in the development of BPD. The only report comes from an Internet survey of parents of BPD patients (Goodman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077559512461173">2010</xref>), in which a greater percentage of BPD offspring were reported to have been victims of bullying in elementary school and of violence in adolescence, compared with their non-BPD siblings. This combination of abuse from both adults and peers may represent another risk correlate for the development of BPD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077559512461173">
<title>Impaired Relationships in the Development of BPD</title>
<p>There is strong evidence that many patients with BPD have disordered family relationships (Laporte &amp; Guttman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077559512461173">2001</xref>; Zanarini, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1077559512461173">2000</xref>), associated with both a lack of parental care and parental overprotection (Paris et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077559512461173">1994</xref>). High levels of parental care and support are among the strongest correlates of positive outcome in abused and neglected children (Collishaw et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077559512461173">2007</xref>). On the other hand, childhood adversities that are associated with maladaptive family functioning are also associated with a higher risk of developing mental disorders (Kessler et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077559512461173">2010</xref>). However, parent–child relationships can vary within the same family. Parents can have distinct relationships with each of their children, and there is an association between differential parenting and psychological sequelae (Plomin, Manke, &amp; Pike, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077559512461173">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1077559512461173">Rutter, Silberg, O’Connor, &amp; Simonoff, 1999</xref>). Problems in parenting directed specifically at one child are correlated with symptoms in that child and associated with fewer symptoms in siblings (Reiss &amp; Neiderhiser, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1077559512461173">2000</xref>). Other studies have shown that children who report having received higher parental control (Dunn &amp; McGuire, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077559512461173">1992</xref>) and lower maternal affection (Dunn, Stocker, &amp; Plomin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077559512461173">1990</xref>) had poorer outcomes than their siblings.</p>
<p>Another developmental factor that may also affect the risk of BPD derives from peer relationships. Given that adolescence is a salient period for identity development, the quality of peer relationships during this developmental phase can have a significant effect on long-term functioning (Ellis &amp; Wolfe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077559512461173">2009</xref>). Previous studies have found that siblings tend to experience very different peer relationships (Daniels &amp; Plomin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077559512461173">1985</xref>) and that positive relationships with peers can buffer the negative effects of family violence (Ellis &amp; Wolfe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077559512461173">2009</xref>). Collishaw and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077559512461173">2007</xref>) found that the quality of peer relationships was a correlate of outcome in children who have been abused and neglected. Goodman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077559512461173">2010</xref>) reported that 44.4% of BPD patients, compared with 8.1% of their unaffected siblings, had difficulties making friends. Research also suggests a relationship between experiences of abuse and neglect and problematic peer relationships (Bolger &amp; Patterson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077559512461173">2001</xref>; Ellis &amp; Wolfe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077559512461173">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Our hypotheses concern differences between retrospective reports of maltreatment and other past experiences by patients with BPD and their sisters without BPD. First, because childhood abuse and neglect have been linked to the development of BPD, we hypothesized that women who develop BPD would report more overall intrafamilial child abuse than their sisters. Second, as sexual abuse has been repeatedly demonstrated to play a role in the etiology of BPD, and since the severity of childhood abuse has also been considered an important correlate of the development of this disorder, we hypothesized that women who develop BPD would have experienced more sexual abuse and more severe abuse of all types than their sisters. Third, we expected that BPD patients would report more peer victimization than their sisters. Finally, based on what previous literature has shown, we hypothesized that women who develop BPD would have had more problematic parent–child relationships and peer relationships than their sisters.</p>

<sec id="section6-1077559512461173">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The study considers a sample of 56 pairs of sisters, one of which was diagnosed as having BPD. All female patients with BPD were referred from psychiatric clinics across a large urban area. Of the 88 potential sibling pairs, 56 pairs of sisters completed the study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077559512461173">Table 1</xref>). In a previous publication (Laporte, Paris, Russell, &amp; Guttman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077559512461173">2011</xref>), we reported that only 3 pairs of sisters were concordant for BPD, while the remaining 53 sisters had no personality disorders and did not have serious current psychopathology. For the purposes of this report, we restricted our analyses to the 53 discordant pairs, this difference allowing us to examine similarities and differences in risk correlates for the disorder. Forty-one women with BPD had only one sister. When there was more than one sister, the sister closest in age was recruited. All participants were between 18 and 45 years with a mean age difference of 3.17 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.93). The patient was the younger sister in 34 pairs. There were three pairs of dizygotic twins.</p>

<p>Patients and their siblings were included if their age difference was within 7 years of each other and were full siblings who had lived with at least one shared biological parent during the most of their upbringing. In order to receive a diagnosis of BPD, participants were required to meet <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </italic>(4th ed., Text revision; DSM-IV-TR) criteria (American Psychiatric Association, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077559512461173">2000</xref>) and to score 8/10 on the <italic>Diagnostic Interview for Borderline–Revised</italic> (DIB-R; Zanarini, Gunderson, &amp; Frankenburg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1077559512461173">1989</xref>). There were no exclusions as to diagnosis, except for organic brain disorders or mental retardation.</p>

<sec id="section7-1077559512461173">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The purpose of the study was explained to respondents in a telephone interview, during which they were assessed according to study criteria. Participants met members of the research team twice. Signed informed consent was obtained from each participant after the study procedures were fully explained during the first meeting. Subsequently, they participated in a semistructured diagnostic interview in order to assess BPD diagnosis and were carefully evaluated for major psychiatric illness. They also participated in two neuropsychological tests and had blood samples taken; these data will not be reported on here. During the second meeting, participants first answered a series of self-report questionnaires and participated in the childhood abuse interview. Institutional review boards at all hospitals from which patients were recruited, as well as the Research Ethics Board at McGill University, approved the study. Subjects received an honorarium of $50 at the end of each meeting to compensate for their time and travel costs.</p>

An experienced clinician, who was blind to which participant was recruited from BPD clinics, administered these interviews, as well as the Hamilton Depression scale (HAM-D; Hamilton, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077559512461173">1960</xref>), the Hamilton Anxiety scale (HAM-A; Hamilton, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077559512461173">1959</xref>), and the substance abuse section of the Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I, First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &amp; Williams, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077559512461173">2002</xref>). Self-report instruments included the Symptom Checklist-90, revised (SCL-90-R, Derogatis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077559512461173">1975</xref>). Furthermore, an assessment of <italic>Psychosocial Functioning</italic> was completed with an inquiry as to the subjects’ satisfaction in the spheres of work, social life, and personal relationships. Participants answered one question pertaining to satisfaction in each of these aspects on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>Very good</italic>) to 4 (<italic>Very bad</italic>).</p>
<p>Childhood adversities reported by the participants were assessed with the <italic>Childhood Trauma Interview</italic> (CTI; Fink, Bernstein, Handelsman, Foote, &amp; Lovejoy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077559512461173">1995</xref>) and administered by two interviewers, different from the clinician doing the diagnostic interviews and blind to the diagnostic status of the participants. This included interpersonal loss (parental death, separation or divorce, foster care placement), parental maladjustment (mental illness, substance abuse, and violence), parental neglect, and history of abuse by family members and peers. The CTI has been well validated, and previous studies have found good interrater reliability and construct validity (Fink et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077559512461173">1995</xref>). It investigates the frequency, severity, and duration of six<sup> </sup>types of trauma (separation or loss, physical neglect, emotional<sup> </sup>abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and witnessing of violence)<sup> </sup>and also codes the age of the onset of abuse, and the duration, frequency, and severity associated with each incident of abuse by each perpetrator. Duration is scored in years, while severity is scored on a scale of 1–6, with 1 being <italic>the less severe</italic> and 6 the <italic>most severe abuse</italic>, in accordance with a scoring manual that provides detailed examples. Frequency is scored from 1 to 6, with 1 being an <italic>event happening once</italic> and 6 <italic>happening continuously</italic>. A “composite score” is calculated for each type of abuse by summing the product of the severity, frequency, and duration scores across all perpetrators within<sup> </sup>each domain of abuse (Bernstein, Ahluvalia, Pogge, &amp; Handelsman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077559512461173">1997</xref>). The subjective impact of reported abuse was also assessed in order to better understand whether abuse shared by sisters had a differential impact. For each incident of reported abuse, participants scored 1 (<italic>strong life impact</italic>) to 3 (<italic>weak life impact</italic>).</p>
<p>The separation or loss section describes interruptions in early<sup> </sup>attachments, including those caused by parental absence related<sup> </sup>to separation, divorce, death or the absence of the child from the family home through foster placement. Physical neglect inquires about lack of supervision, deprivation of food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and levels of childhood supervision. The emotional abuse section inquires about scolding, screaming, blaming, insulting, threatening, demeaning, and belittling. The physical abuse section asks about experiences<sup> </sup>of being hit, beaten, kicked, burned, suffocated, cut, shot,<sup> </sup>or locked up. For the purpose of this study, we reported on neglect, emotional and physical abuse within the household (intrafamilial); emotional and physical abuse perpetrated by peers or dating partners was coded as peer victimization. The sexual<sup> </sup>abuse section asks about both contact and noncontact childhood sexual experiences, including touching of breasts or genitals, oral sex, and penetration. Consenting experiences with similar-age<sup> </sup>peers were not included. Sexual abuse by a family member was coded as intrafamilial abuse, abuse by peers or dating partners was coded as sexual peer victimization, while sexual abuse by someone outside the nuclear family was coded as other sexual abuse. We reported all events experienced by the participants with the exception of single incidents unless these were high in severity (e.g., a single incident of rape or of being strangled). We wanted to take into account potential gradations in the severity of the abuse reported by patients and by their sisters in order to address whether there was an association with subsequent psychopathology even at lower levels of severity. To estimate the effect of all events, a “global cumulative score” was calculated by adding all single composite scores together.</p>
<p>For this study, two experienced interviewers administered the CTI and interrater reliability was established on 12 subjects on four types of trauma (physical neglect, emotional<sup> </sup>abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse). The κ scores for reliability of rating on the prevalence of physical neglect, emotional<sup> </sup>abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse range from .78 to 1. For each type of abuse, Kendall scores for rating of severity range from .63 to .79, for frequency range from .77 to 1, for duration in categories range from .73 to 1, for age of onset in categories range from .92 to 1, for identification of perpetrator range from .98 to 1, for number of perpetrators range from .68 to 1, and for impact of abuse were 1.</p>
<p>Quality of parental relationships was assessed with the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI; Parker, Tupling, &amp; Brown, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1077559512461173">1979</xref>) and the Sibling Inventory of Differential Experience (SIDE; Daniels &amp; Plomin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077559512461173">1985</xref>). The PBI is a widely used 25-item scale that measures the subject’s perception of the parenting they received on two dimensions: care (empathic responsiveness) and protection (support and tolerance of autonomy). Respondents are asked to score each parent on a 4-point Likert-type scale on the basis of how they remember them in the first 18 years of their lives. This instrument has acceptable test–retest and split-half reliability (Parker et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1077559512461173">1979</xref>). It has been tested for validity in clinical and nonclinical populations and there is good concordance between siblings’ ratings of parental behavior, parental self-ratings, and clinical ratings (Parker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1077559512461173">1983</xref>). In this study, the Cronbach’s α was, respectively, .91 and .92 for maternal and paternal care and .88 and .83 for maternal and paternal control. The SIDE (Daniels &amp; Plomin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077559512461173">1985</xref>) is a self-report questionnaire consisting of 11 scales designed to assess nonshared environmental influences. This study focused on siblings’ perceptions of parental treatment. The 9 items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>My mother was always like that</italic> to 5 = <italic>My mother was never like that</italic>). Finally, peer relationships were assessed with SIDE factors of popularity, delinquency, and college orientations. The 26 items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>My peer group has never been this way</italic> to 5 = <italic>My peer group has been always this way</italic>). This instrument has sound test–retest reliability, ranging from .77 to .93 for a 2-week period (Daniel &amp; Plomin, 1985) and reliability coefficients’ α in the current study ranging from .68 to .90.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were created for all variables using frequency counts, means and standard deviations, or medians and ranges, as appropriate. To investigate the possible effect of experiences of maltreatment on the odds of having a BPD, we used conditional logistic regression (CLR), which is the analysis of choice for retrospective case-control studies (Hosmer &amp; Lemeshow, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077559512461173">2000</xref>). In all CLR analyses performed, the dependent variable was a binary indicator of BPD (case or control). The models were separated by type of exposure variables: intrafamilial abuse, peers and extra familial abuse, PBI-parental bonding, SIDE-parental relationships, and SIDE-peers relationships. In each CLR analysis, the log-likelihood ratio test was used to test the overall significance of the model. The significance of the variables in the model was assessed by the Wald χ<sup>2</sup> test. Results of the CLR models are presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Standard errors were corrected for small sample sizes (Fay &amp; Graubard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077559512461173">2001</xref>).</p>
<p>We also present the characteristics of each type of abuse (age of onset, perpetrators, duration, severity and life impact), as well as their composite score. Because data on these characteristics can only be obtained if participants were abused or neglected, this information is not available for all pairs of sisters. Thus, in many cases, there were too few discordant pairs to apply a CLR analysis, as it does not take into account incomplete pairs where, for example, only one sister reports the abuse. We performed a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test of association separately for all characteristics of each type of abuse, where permitted by the prevalence. Composite scores were analyzed by CLR. The distribution of scores related to current psychopathology in BPD patients and siblings were compared using the Wilcoxon’s signed rank (WSR) test, and the psychosocial functioning variables were analyzed with a CMH test of association. Analyses were done using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). All statistical hypothesis tests were two-sided and performed at the .05 significance level.</p>

<p>Both sisters reported the same experiences of parental separation and divorce (39.6%) or death of one or both parents (5.7%) in their childhood. Nine women with BPD (17.3%) and four sisters (7.7%) reported having lived in foster care for more than 6 months at some point in their youth. In 5 pairs of sisters, only patients with BPD reported living in foster care while in 44 pairs both sisters reported never having lived in foster care and in 4 pairs, both reported having had that experience. Twenty women with BPD (37.7%) and 10 sisters (18.9%) reported having run away from home in their youth. This behavior was discordant in 20 pairs of sisters. In 15 pairs, only the patient with BPD reported this behavior while in 5 pairs, only the sisters reported running away from home. In 28 pairs, both sisters never ran away from home while in 5 pairs, both sisters did. The CLR found that running away from home increased the odds of being in the BPD group (OR 3.0, 95% CI [1.1, 8.3], <italic>p</italic> = .03).</p>

<p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1077559512461173">5</xref> presents the prevalence of intrafamilial abuse, extra-familial sexual abuse as well as peer victimization. This table also describes all characteristics of abuse for those who reported having been abused or neglected. Results of CMH tests showed that for physical abuse and emotional abuse, severity was significantly higher in BPD than in sisters (respectively <inline-formula id="inline-formula5-1077559512461173">

<title>Cumulative experiences of abuse</title>
<p>In total, all 53 women with BPD and 51 sisters (96.2%) reported experiencing intrafamilial childhood abuse or neglect while 35 patients with BPD (66%) and 29 sisters (54.7%) reported peer victimization or sexual abuse by adults outside their family. A CLR for the Global Cumulative score shows a significant effect on the odds of being in the BPD group (OR for any 100-unit change 1.3, 95% CI [1.03, 1.56], <italic>p</italic> = .02).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the relationship between childhood abuse and neglect, family relationships, peer relationships, and BPD, using a sibling design that permits a detailed evaluation of differences between sisters and risk correlates. Contrary to our first hypothesis, the results indicate that pairs of sisters, one with BPD, the other currently free of psychopathology, do report similar prevalence of different types of intrafamilial maltreatment. The low rates of psychopathology in sisters who reported similar experiences of intrafamilial abuse and neglect are consistent with community studies of child abuse and neglect, in which only a minority of those exposed to early adversity develop serious psychopathology as adults (Fergusson &amp; Mullen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077559512461173">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077559512461173">Finkelhor, Ormong, &amp; Turner, 2007</xref>; Rutter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1077559512461173">2007</xref>). Personality traits may also play a role in such resilience, and in a previous publication describing the same population (Laporte et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077559512461173">2011</xref>), we reported that the BPD probands had a markedly different trait profile than their sisters, suggesting a heightened temperamental vulnerability to childhood adversity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077559512461173">Jenkins (2008)</xref> has hypothesized that the unique ways in which children interpret environmental events can moderate the effects of adverse environments and could explain differences between siblings.</p>
<p>Women with BPD and their sisters reported rates of physical neglect and emotional and physical abuse that were almost identical. Since physical neglect usually affects all children in a family (Fergusson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077559512461173">2008</xref>), this similarity is not surprising. However, pairs of sisters also reported similar prevalence of emotional and physical abuse. Some authors have suggested that one child within a family can be the target of harsh and disturbed parental behavior, while the other children are spared (Dunn &amp; Plomin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077559512461173">1991</xref>; Reiss &amp; Neiderhiser, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1077559512461173">2000</xref>). Yet, other studies have not found differences between siblings’ experience of abuse (Bifulco et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077559512461173">1997</xref>; Whitmore et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1077559512461173">1993</xref>). Notably, in about 75% of families in the present study, the concordance of abuse reports was similar, which does not suggest that abuse is necessarily directed specifically at one child. However, the parameters of the maltreatment could help explain the association between abuse and the development of this disorder (Paris et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077559512461173">1994</xref>). Our results showed that severity of the experiences of abuse reported had a significant association with BPD for both physical and emotional abuse. Although both these types of maltreatment have been associated with indices of clinical severity among patients with BPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1077559512461173">Bierer et al., 2003</xref>; Laporte &amp; Guttman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077559512461173">2001</xref>), the link between the severity of these types of abuse and BPD is a new finding. Soloff, Lynch, and Kelly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1077559512461173">2002</xref>) had noted a link between BPD and the severity of sexual abuse, but not physical or emotional abuse.</p>
<p>Contrary to our second hypothesis, sexual abuse perpetrated by nuclear family members was not significant. There were 11 discordant pairs of sisters in which only the patients with BPD reported intrafamilial sexual abuse, and one discordant pair where only the sister reported intrafamilial sexual abuse, so that the odds of an individual developing BPD is over 13 times higher if this person had been sexually abused by a family member than for someone who has not experienced this type of abuse. However, due to the small number of discordant pairs, the effect was not statistically significant. This result is not fully consistent with previous literature showing that intrafamilial sexual abuse is more pathogenic than abuse from nonrelatives or strangers (Fergusson &amp; Mullen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077559512461173">1999</xref>; Fergusson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077559512461173">2008</xref>). Moreover, the reported rate of 24.6% for intrafamilial sexual abuse in BPD was almost identical with the rate of 25% reported by Zanarini and Frankenburg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1077559512461173">1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though we observed more severe maltreatment in this clinical sample than is common in community samples or in other reports from clinical samples (Ogata et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1077559512461173">1990</xref>; Paris et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077559512461173">1994</xref>; Zanarini &amp; Frankenburg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1077559512461173">1997</xref>), the results are not consistent with the generally held assumption that childhood abuse by itself is a major cause of BPD. This difference could be attributable to the fact that the participants in this study were all recruited from specialized personality disorder programs where the level of psychopathology is higher than in general outpatient clinics. While it has been established that there is a correlation between the severity of abuse and the severity of BPD (Soloff et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1077559512461173">2002</xref>), it may also be important to consider the cumulative effects of maltreatment, as reflected in the higher global cumulative score of women with BPD, indicating that these women experienced somewhat more severe adversities.</p>
<p>Contrary to our third hypothesis, probands did not generally experience more dysfunctional relationships with parents. Both sisters reported difficult relationships with parents, as measured by the PBI with women with BPD actually reporting the opposite of what was expected, with scores on maternal care and overprotection lower than those of their sisters, and results of the CLR showed that increased maternal care and lower overprotection had an effect on the odds of BPD. Earlier studies found that women with BPD report worse care and more overprotection compared to women with other psychiatric disorders or to community norms (Laporte &amp; Guttman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077559512461173">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1077559512461173">Torgersen &amp; Alnaes, 1992</xref>; Zweig-Frank &amp; Paris, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1077559512461173">1991</xref>). In this sample, both groups reported lack of care and overprotection by both parents. However, this is the first study to report on differences in pairs of sisters’ relationships with parents. We found similarities in description of their parental relationships on a second instrument (SIDE) assessing parent–child relationships, and the odds of BPD were not affected by these variables. Again, our results did not show that negative relationships with the parents occurred only with one child, but that families as a whole tended to be dysfunctional.</p>
<p>Our fourth hypothesis, that women who develop BPD will have had more problematic peer relationships, was confirmed, showing problems in peer affiliation and in peer victimization. There were significant results pertaining to peer group affiliation during adolescence. Women who reported having more delinquent friends and less popularity among their peers showed a higher odds ratio for having BPD. Furthermore, being physically victimized by their peers increased the odds of being in the BPD group. Goodman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077559512461173">2010</xref>) found that adolescents who develop BPD are more aggressive and impulsive and more likely to have been victims of assault than their unaffected siblings, and a recent study by Wolke, Schreier, Zanarini, and Winsper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1077559512461173">2012</xref>) suggested that being bullied by peers in childhood is a precursor for developing BPD symptoms in childhood. In the present study, women with BPD reported more experiences of physical victimization by peers.</p>
<p>Thus BPD probands seem to have experienced a different adolescence from their sisters in relationships with peers. One needs to examine the social context beyond the boundary of the immediate family, and the effects of additional adversities that could lead to a vicious cycle, in which the basic traits behind BPD, emotional dysregulation and impulsivity (Crowell, Beauchaine, &amp; Linehan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077559512461173">2009</xref>), interact and are then reinforced by life experiences. As these forms of dysregulation become more severe, adolescents at risk could go on to carry out more risk-taking behaviors, which further amplify these dysfunctional traits.</p>
<p>Although the present study did not allow for a test of the validity of retrospective reporting, the relative consistency of reports between sisters on their childhood history was striking. Whereas some authors are cautious about accepting retrospective accounts by individuals with BPD (Gunderson &amp; Links, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077559512461173">2008</xref>), and have expressed concern about bias in the accuracy of recall of childhood trauma (Battle et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077559512461173">2004</xref>), other researchers have been concerned about underreporting (Bifulco et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077559512461173">1997</xref>). Only a few studies have attempted to confirm reports of abuse using other family members (Laporte &amp; Guttman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077559512461173">2001</xref>; Silk, Lee, Hill, &amp; Lohr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1077559512461173">1995</xref>). All these findings invite research comparing retrospective with prospective data.</p>
<sec id="section19-1077559512461173">
<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>The results of the study could have been affected by a sampling bias, in that we only assessed one pair of siblings; variability in the presence of childhood trauma or adaptation could have been present in other siblings, although this problem only affected a few families in our sample. Other limitations include the use of single questions to assess some aspects of psychosocial functioning and the use of a single researcher to conduct diagnostic interviews. It is also possible that sibling pairs characterized by high conflict or sisters suffering from psychopathology may have chosen not to participate in our study. Another limitation of this study could lie in the fact that in comparing women with BPD and their sisters, we did not control for changes over time in family structure, environment, neighborhoods, and schools, and nonshared environmental factors that could also have had an impact. Furthermore, all data on childhood were retrospective, with the limitations inherent to that methodology. The generalizability of the findings reported here is limited by the nature of the sample, as this was a severely ill group of patients with BPD with a more serious prognosis (Soloff et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1077559512461173">2002</xref>). Also, sisters of probands in this study showed extremely high rates of abuse, far above population norms. It is therefore possible that in less severely ill patients from less dysfunctional families, the rate of abuse in sisters could have been lower. Finally, this study needs to be replicated in larger samples where more discordant pairs would permit to apply CLR analyses on characteristics of abuse.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all these limitations, this is the first study of its kind, and provides the first detailed examination of siblings of women with BPD. Other strengths of the study is that the interview was detailed enough to allow for exploratory analysis of the parameters of childhood abuse and neglect and to calculate a cumulative score of childhood maltreatment. It is also the first study to assess other developmental factors that affect the risk of BPD such as peer relationships and peers victimization. By and large, these findings support the principle of multifinality, in which adversities can be associated with a variety of outcomes, ranging from psychopathology to resilience.</p>
<p>This research also has clinical implications. In high-risk families, when one child is identified has having been maltreated, siblings should also be assessed. Also, clinicians need to consider multiple risk factors in the development of BPD, including problematic peer relationships and physical victimization. Finally, clinicians should be aware that maltreatment does not necessarily lead to BPD, as demonstrated by the ubiquity of resilience in first-degree relatives.</p>
