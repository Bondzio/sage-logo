<p>News of the Holy Roman Empire’s demise in 1806 travelled fast enough for Goethe, on the way to Jena, to have heard about it the following morning, but he was more agitated by the ‘quarrel between the servant and the coachman on the coachbox’ (22). Historians long took a similar view of the defunct institution, either paying it scant attention or writing it off as a doomed anachronism. A considerable body of literature has since substantially revised earlier views of the Old Empire’s effectiveness as a legal and peace-keeping order. Nonetheless, suggest the editors of this volume, the relevant literature – like that on the French Empire, which was immediately responsible for its demise – ‘remains dominated by the concerns of two distinct national historiographies’. Hence, a workshop in the bicentenary year of 2006 offered ‘an ideal opportunity for a comparative approach towards the transition to modernity and serves as a snapshot moment in the vacillating balance of power and influence between France and Germany in the construction of Europe’ (1). While ‘modernity’ lacks a clear definition and not all of the contributors engage directly with this theme, Forrest and Wilson have done a good job in putting together a collection which highlights key developments in recent research.</p>
<p>Peter Wilson starts proceedings by looking at the ‘meaning of Empire in Central Europe around 1800’. He describes the functioning of the Holy Roman Empire, and claims by different states and dynasties to imperial status (the Habsburg Monarchy and France) or the lack thereof (Prussia), but without delving more deeply into how the notion of Empire was understood in conceptual terms. Michael Rowe offers a fine discussion of the political culture of the late Holy Roman Empire, paying particular attention to two imperial institutions, the <italic>Reichshofrat</italic> (Imperial Aulic Council) and the <italic>Reichskammergericht</italic> (Imperial Chamber Court). While steering clear of overly positive re-assessments of the Empire <italic>qua</italic> state, Rowe argues for the effectiveness of these institutions in channelling social and political conflicts into judicial processes. These first two essays are complemented by reciprocal pieces on the Napoleonic Empire (Michael Broers) and its political culture (William Doyle). Broers forcefully re-states his argument about the Napoleonic Empire as an exercise in French cultural imperialism, while Doyle’s vignette reminds us of the long-term impact of the changes brought about by Napoleon’s novel creation of France as an Empire.</p>
<p>Subsequent essays become more specific, either offering regional case-studies or examining particular themes. Michael Kaiser discusses Bavaria’s elevation to the status of Kingdom as the realization of a long-held Wittelsbach dream, although this was tempered by the obligation to marry off the King’s daughter, Auguste Amalie, to Napoleon’s step-son, Eugène Beauharnais. In suggesting that King Max Joseph steered Bavaria successfully through dangerous times (106), Kaiser nevertheless downplays the difficulties involved in securing the dynasty’s gains, for he does not discuss the considerable unrest in Franconia or the revolt in Tirol in 1809, which led to the loss of territory after the Peace of Schönbrunn that year. Alan Forrest then looks at Napoleon’s political evolution, suggesting that his early expressions of republicanism were already giving way to a liking for courtly formality in the late 1790s, before developing into the monarchical pomp of the French Empire after 1804. In acknowledging the importance of the abolition of feudalism to the Napoelonic legacy, Rafe Blaufarb stresses that its achievement was not a simple matter, automatically copying the French model, but was subject to much debate and contestation, not to say difficulty in implementation.</p>
<p>Turning to the experience of war around 1806, Claus Telp looks at the Prussian army in the disastrous Jena campaign, rejecting attempts to portray it in a more positive light. He suggests that, while sound, the army was deficient in training and organization; along with individual mistakes and the unfavourable strategic circumstances, this left it no match for a more formidable enemy. Thomas Biskup shows how, after Jena, Napoleon sought to place himself in the ranks of history’s great leaders by visiting the tomb of Frederick the Great and having his sword transferred to Paris, in a symbolic passing of the baton from one soldier of genius to another. Karen Hagemann looks at the desperate Prussian experience of occupation by France after 1806. Though ideas of German nationalism and Prussian patriotism were confined to small sections of the middle class, the memory of the years 1806–08 fed into the anti-French propaganda that helped motivate support for the ‘wars of Liberation’ in 1813. Turning to the other side, David Hopkin’s innovative contribution explores popular legends as a way of understanding the experience of Allied invasions and occupations in Eastern France in the period 1792–1815, while Michael Rapport argues for the centrality of Germans and Germany in the shaping of French identity (as opposed to the more familiar Franco-British rivalry). Finally, the collection is rounded off by one of the best pieces in the volume, in which John Breuilly argues that, where earlier research over-estimated the role of national feeling in the German response to Napoleon, more recent work has ended up marginalizing it among a range of other social, economic, political and religious-cultural factors. Neither of these positions being entirely satisfactory, Breuilly therefore suggests that a more useful approach is to examine ‘which versions of the national idea work with or against the grain of modernisation’ (276).</p>
<p>Some of the articles in this volume have more to offer in the way of original research than others, but the overall standard is consistent and the collection provides a worthwhile overview. Nevertheless, none of the essays engage explicitly in comparative analysis – it is more a case of material on the two Empires being placed side by side. Together with the lack of a concluding essay, this means that the volume’s aim to follow a comparative approach is not pursued as fully as it might have been. Moreover, an evident weakness of this collection is the virtual absence of the dynasty which stood at the apex of the Empire for so long: the Austrian Habsburgs (among whom the Emperor Francis II was nephew to the French Queen, Marie Antoinette, not ‘brother’ (2); nor was Leopold II ‘his elder brother’ (2), but his father). While in part this absence reflects the relative lack of attention to the Habsburg Monarchy in the recent literature on the period 1790–1815, when compared to the historiography on the German states, France, Spain and Italy, more could have been done to rectify this imbalance, including tapping into recent projects on various Habsburg lands. For all the buzz created by the Bee (Napoleonic France), the Eagle (the Empire) does not fully bare its claws here.</p>
