<sec id="section1-0363546513480465">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Although instability of the knee joint is known to modify gait patterns, the amount that patients compensate for joint laxity during active movements remains unknown.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513480465">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>By developing a novel technique to allow the assessment of tibiofemoral kinematics, this study aimed to elucidate the role of passive joint laxity on active tibiofemoral kinematics during walking.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513480465">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Controlled laboratory study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513480465">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Using motion capture, together with combinations of advanced techniques for assessing skeletal kinematics (including the symmetrical axis of rotation approach [SARA], symmetrical center of rotation estimation [SCoRE], and optimal common shape technique [OCST]), a novel noninvasive approach to evaluate dynamic tibiofemoral motion was demonstrated as both reproducible and repeatable. Passive and active anterior-posterior translations of the tibiofemoral joint were then examined in 13 patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures that were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and compared with those in their healthy contralateral limbs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513480465">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Passive tibial anterior translation was significantly greater in the ACL-ruptured knees than in the contralateral healthy controls. However, the femora of the ACL-ruptured knees generally remained more posterior (~3 mm) relative to the tibia within a gait cycle of walking compared with the healthy limbs. Surprisingly, the mean range of tibiofemoral anterior-posterior translation over an entire gait cycle was significantly lower in ACL-ruptured knees than in the healthy joints (<italic>P</italic> = .026). A positive correlation was detected between passive laxity and active joint mobility, but with a consistent reduction in the range of tibiofemoral anterior-posterior translation of approximately 3 mm in the ACL-deficient knees.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513480465">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>It seems that either active stabilization of tibiofemoral kinematics or anterior subluxation of the tibia reduces joint translation in lax knees. This implies that either a muscular overcompensation mechanism or a physical limitation due to secondary passive stabilizers occurs within the joint and thus produces a situation that has a reduced range of active motion compared with knees with physiological stability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0363546513480465">
<title>Clinical Relevance:</title>
<p>The reduced range of active tibiofemoral translation suggests overloading of the passive structures in passively lax knees, either through excessive muscular action or joint subluxation, and could provide a plausible mechanism for explaining posttraumatic degeneration of cartilage in the joint.</p>

<p>Stabilization of the knee joint during dynamic activities is controlled by a combination of passive structures, including ligaments and bone, but also through the activation and coactivation of muscles that cross the joint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513480465">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513480465">20</xref></sup> In particular, the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) plays an important role in the kinematics of the tibiofemoral joint, not only by limiting tibial anterior translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513480465">2</xref></sup> but also by guiding knee axial rotation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513480465">3</xref></sup> especially during activities involving high anterior forces and moments such as stair descending.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513480465">26</xref></sup> Even during routine activities such as walking, anterior-posterior (A-P) translation is important for physiological knee function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480465">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is well known that ruptures of the ACL not only modify movement patterns of the entire lower limb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513480465">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513480465">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513480465">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513480465">22</xref></sup> but also influence muscle activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513480465">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513480465">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546513480465">45</xref></sup> and hence result in a movement strategy that is thought to compensate for pain and joint instability. Here, patients may compensate for passive knee joint laxity by actively contracting and co-contracting local muscles during dynamic activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513480465">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513480465">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513480465">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513480465">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546513480465">40</xref></sup> The amount of additional joint stability provided by muscle activation remains unclear, but the additional muscular forces are thought to raise joint loading in a process that could play a key role in the subsequent clinically observed degenerative changes to the joint, including osteoarthritis (OA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513480465">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513480465">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513480465">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinical assessment of joint stability and laxity after ACL ruptures is generally based on the Lachman test, the anterior drawer sign, and the pivot shift test,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513480465">23</xref></sup> which can be complemented using devices such as the KT-1000/KT-2000 arthrometer (MEDmetric Corp, San Diego, California).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546513480465">43</xref></sup> Although passive measures of knee laxity are useful in assessing the status of the ACL, where high accuracy is achievable in static poses, the clinical assessment of dynamic stability of the knee joint continues to be almost exclusively based on subjective observations. To allow more dynamic assessments, radiological techniques have been implemented in which a range of tibiofemoral A-P translation (range<sub>A-P</sub>) of approximately 14 to 16 mm has been observed in patients with ACL ruptures during lunge movements, for example.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480465">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513480465">12</xref></sup> However, these approaches generally limit patients’ range of motion or are unable to track activities of daily living. While studies using noninvasive motion capture techniques have demonstrated a range<sub>A-P</sub> of approximately 30 mm in healthy individuals, and reduced A-P translation in ACL-deficient patients at specific instances of the gait cycle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513480465">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513480465">17</xref></sup> the relationship between passive and active tibiofemoral joint stability, particularly in patients with knee joint laxity, remains unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513480465">32</xref></sup> Because subtle changes in the kinematics of the joint are known to play a critical role for cartilage overloading and damage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513480465">30</xref></sup> knowledge of changes to joint kinematics with joint instability could help explain the mechanisms for the onset and development of joint OA.</p>
<p>Recently, approaches that minimize the effects of soft tissue artifact,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480465">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513480465">37</xref></sup> as well as functionally identify skeletal joint centers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513480465">14</xref></sup> and axes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513480465">15</xref></sup> have been proposed to assess skeletal kinematics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513480465">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513480465">38</xref></sup> The combination of these approaches is now able to provide the accuracy and sensitivity required to analyze movement patterns in a rapid, robust, and therefore clinically viable manner. So far, it remains unclear to what degree joint stability in healthy knees differs from those in ACL-deficient knees and if joint stability is compensated during active movements. We hypothesized that patients with ACL-ruptured knees would show increased passive joint laxity and that this laxity would be observable during active movements. With the aim of gaining an insight into the mechanisms involved in joint degeneration after ACL ruptures, the goal of this study was to assess the levels to which patients with a rupture of their ACL compensate for passive joint laxity and stabilize the kinematics of the tibiofemoral joint during dynamic movements by comparing the behavior of the ACL-deficient knee with the contralateral uninjured knee.</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>In this study, a novel approach to understanding intersegmental knee joint kinematics during dynamic activities is presented and tested for reliability. Furthermore, in a clinical study that was approved by the local ethics committee in which all patients provided written informed consent before participation, the stability of the knee joint was then compared in healthy and ACL-deficient knees in both static and dynamic scenarios.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546513480465">
<title>Cohorts</title>
<p>To test the intertrial reliability of the approach to determine dynamic tibiofemoral translation (described in the following section), 8 healthy individuals (mean age, 28 ± 5 years; mean body mass index [BMI], 22 ± 2; 4 men and 4 women) with no injuries, previous operations, or self-reported disorders of the knee were included in this study. Interday reliability was tested using the same approach in 3 healthy individuals (mean age, 33 ± 6 years; mean BMI, 23 ± 1; 2 men and 1 woman), tested on 2 separate days. Additionally, 13 patients with unilateral ACL ruptures (mean age, 32 ± 8 years; mean BMI, 25 ± 3; 9 men and 4 women; mean time after injury, 8 ± 12 months) were recruited into the study to investigate the levels of passive and active joint mobility. With the exception of 2 patients, all measurements were performed 1 to 13 days before ACL reconstruction. The 13 contralateral knees of the ACL-deficient population were used as paired controls.</p>

<title>Functional Assessment of Tibiofemoral Translation During Dynamic Activities</title>
<p>The positions of a set of 52 reflective markers attached to each patient’s lower extremities were tracked at 120 Hz using an infrared optical motion capture system (system accuracy, ~0.3-0.5 mm) (10 T20S cameras, Vicon, Oxford, United Kingdom), while the patients performed repetitions of walking. Markers were placed according to an optimized configuration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513480465">38</xref></sup> that included the use of palpation to identify bone landmarks on the pelvis, tibia, and ankle. Here, skin markers were attached onto the right and left anterior and posterior superior iliac spine, the medial and lateral epicondyles of the knee, and the medial and lateral malleoli of the ankle. Additional markers were attached symmetrically to the femur, tibia, and foot segments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0363546513480465">
<title>Quantification of Relative Tibiofemoral Translation</title>
<p>To quantify relative tibiofemoral motion during dynamic activities, a novel approach was developed based on the OSSCA technique (OCST, SARA, and SCoRE combined approach; see below for further expansions) for assessing skeletal kinematics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513480465">38</xref></sup> In the first step, each patient performed functional movements, including a “star-arc” motion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480465">10</xref></sup> in a standing position to allow identification of the hip joint center and flexion-extension movements of the knee to determine the tibiofemoral axes of rotation. Soft tissue artifact was minimized using the optimal common shape technique (OCST),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513480465">37</xref></sup> where an optimum rigid marker configuration for each segment is formed to reduce the effects of skin elasticity. Each OCST segment marker configuration was constructed using data from the calibration movements and then replaced the raw data marker positions throughout the measurements, thereby removing the effect of any stretching of the skin. The hip joint center was then identified from the star-arc movements using the symmetrical center of rotation estimation (SCoRE),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513480465">14</xref></sup> an algorithm to determine the center of rotation of ball and socket joints from segment motion data.</p>
<p>Functional knee axes were identified from the knee flexion-extension movements, using the symmetrical axis of rotation approach (SARA), which computes a representation of the axis of rotation in local segment-based coordinates for each segment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513480465">15</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513480465">Figure 1A</xref>). Here, data were only taken from the flexion-extension activity between 15° and 85° to cover a standard range of motion across all patients, which avoided any bias in the patient-specific movement data used for determining the axes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546513480465">41</xref></sup> Based on the symmetrical properties of the SARA, the positions of 2 local functional axes are reconstructed for each knee (1 for the femur and 1 for the tibia), where the motion of each axis is consistent with the motion of the respective segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513480465">Figure 1</xref>). Here, for normal flexion-extension activities, both these 2 axes lie at locations roughly consistent with the femoral epicondylar axis and for the most part overlay one another. However, secondary movements of the joint including, for example, internal-external rotation or A-P translation would cause a shift in the axes of rotation. Such translations of the axes are now detectable using the approach presented. Furthermore, because an axis possesses no center, each functional axis was complemented using the 3-dimensional (3D) marker data to ensure a robust definition of the position of the knee center. Here, the OCST corrected data of the medial and lateral epicondyle markers were projected onto each functional knee axis, with the knee center then defined as their midpoint. The reference center for each knee was assumed to be the tibial axis midpoint. The ankle center was defined geometrically as the midpoint of the 2 malleoli markers.</p>

<p>(A) Dual tibial and femoral functional knee joint axes were determined using the symmetrical axis of rotation approach (SARA). (B) The functional knee joint axes form the basis for calculating the tibial as well as femoral coordinate systems. Anterior-posterior translation was then determined by assessing the relative motion of the femoral axes of rotation relative to the tibial frame of reference.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0363546513480465-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The femoral coordinate system was located at the femoral axis center, with the first axis of rotation defined by the femoral axis of rotation. The second axis was constructed using the vector from the femoral fixed knee joint center to the hip joint center. Accordingly, the tibial coordinate system was defined at the center of the tibial axis, with its first axis as the axis of tibial rotation. The second component was constructed using the vector from the tibial fixed knee joint center to the ankle center. The third axes for both coordinate systems were then defined by the cross-products of the first 2 basis vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513480465">Figure 1B</xref>). Tibiofemoral translations and rotations were finally quantified using the relative movement of the functionally assessed femoral axis center in the tibial coordinate system. In this manner, tibiofemoral motion is assessed in the tibial fixed coordinate system, with its origin located approximately at the level of the femoral epicondyles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513480465">Figure 1</xref>). This approach therefore avoids any A-P translation error that would be present if computed at the height of the tibial plateau because of flexion-extension rotation of the joint.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0363546513480465">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The 3D tibiofemoral motion data during walking were split into multiple repetitions of individual gait cycles. For each kinematic variable, 101 discrete points according to 0% to 100% (heel strike to heel strike) of the gait cycle were extracted at 1% intervals using interpolation. The range<sub>A-P</sub> during each gait cycle was calculated as the difference between the minimum and maximum A-P movement of the coordinate systems relative to one another. To determine group differences, each of the kinematic curves was averaged across trials for each patient as well as across all patients in each cohort.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0363546513480465">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>To assess the intertrial repeatability of the approach, the coefficient of variation (CV) was determined for all 101 frames and finally averaged over the whole cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513480465">Figure 2</xref>). Here, the standard deviation of all repeated walking trials (3-6 repetitions for each of the 8 bilaterally healthy patients) was calculated and normalized to the absolute range<sub>A-P</sub> and finally averaged over the whole gait cycle. The intraindividual reproducibility to assess A-P translation over the entire gait cycle between repetitions was tested using the intraclass correlation coefficient ICC(3,1). In a similar manner, ICC(1,1) was used to assess the interday repeatability of test data collected on separate days and with a different observer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513480465">Figure 2</xref>). The mean of these ICCs was then taken across patients. In addition, intraclass correlations were calculated for range<sub>A-P</sub> using the ICC(3,1) model. Furthermore, after verification using multifactorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses that ACL deficiency has an effect on A-P translation, a post hoc test was applied to determine the magnitude of the difference in A-P translation between ACL-ruptured and healthy (contralateral) knees. A <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was regarded as statistically significant. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics 18 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Chicago, Illinois) and the Statistics Toolbox from Matlab (The MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts).</p>

<p>The mean CV across all 16 healthy knees was 5.2% ± 1.2%, demonstrating the high reliability of the approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513480465">Figure 2</xref>). Excellent reproducibility was observed for both A-P translation over an entire gait cycle (ICC(3,1) = 0.92) as well as range<sub>A-P</sub> (ICC(3,1) = 0.98) between repetitions in individuals. Furthermore, a high interday repeatability was demonstrated by a mean ICC(1,1) of 0.83 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513480465">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Tibiofemoral Motion in ACL-Ruptured Knee Joints</title>
<p>In general, ACL-deficient knees displayed reduced femoral anterior motion compared with the healthy knees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513480465">Figure 3</xref>). As expected, no differences were observed in the active range<sub>A-P</sub> during cycles of walking between limbs of the healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546513480465">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, the largest differences were found during sections of the gait cycle (at about 70% ± 3%, corresponding to the period shortly after toe-off) between ACL-ruptured knee joints and the healthy limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513480465">Figure 3</xref>). Here, at the 70% instant, a lower mean femoral anterior translation was found in the ACL-ruptured knee joints (4.9 mm) compared with the contralateral limbs (6.9 mm). Moreover, the range<sub>A-P</sub> during a gait cycle of walking was significantly lower in ACL-ruptured knee joints (15.7 mm) than in the contralateral knee joints (18.4 mm) (F = 5.62, <italic>P</italic> = .026) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546513480465">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>Evaluation of the A-P translation during passive measurements revealed an opposite effect. Here, the mean anterior A-P translation in ACL-ruptured knee joints during a 133-N pull force was 8.5 ± 3.9 mm, showing a statistically significant difference from the contralateral side (4.5 ± 2.3 mm).</p>
<p>In addition to the A-P translation, significant differences could also be found in the flexion-extension and abduction-adduction angles during gait between ACL-ruptured and contralateral knee joints. During midstance (30%-50% of gait cycle), a more flexed knee (mean, 12.7° of flexion vs 7.9° of flexion) as well as an increased varus angle (mean, 8.7° vs 6.9°) during the swing phase (66%-73% of gait cycle) was observed in the ACL-ruptured knee joints compared with the healthy knees.</p>
<p>In an investigation into the relationship between active and passive A-P stability of the knee (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546513480465">Figure 5</xref>), a positive correlation was detected for both ACL-ruptured knees (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.47) and for the healthy contralateral knee joints (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.34). Interestingly, it was observed that ACL-ruptured knees had a remarkably similar relationship to their contralateral limbs, but with a consistent reduction of range<sub>A-P</sub> of approximately 3 mm.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>With an estimated incidence of 100,000 tears per year in the United States alone,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513480465">33</xref></sup> ACL rupture is one of the most frequent injuries, often resulting from sporting activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513480465">36</xref></sup> An ACL injury leads to reduced function as well as joint instability and is known to result in OA joint degeneration in 50% to 90% of patients 7 to 20 years after the injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546513480465">44</xref></sup> However, the mechanical mechanisms governing these degenerative processes remain unknown, and particularly the influence and interaction of passive versus active knee joint laxity require elucidation. In this study, we observed that joints with pathological knee laxity displayed reduced tibiofemoral A-P translation during active movements than healthy, passively stable knees. In general, it is well recognized that active contraction of the muscles can help to increase the mechanical stability of the knee and thereby reduce the translation of the femoral condyles relative to the tibial plateau. The results of this study demonstrate that increased joint laxity due to ACL ruptures results in a reduced active range of A-P translation within the joint. It seems plausible that this reduction in A-P motion results from 1 of 2 possible mechanisms: (1) either muscular co-contraction acts to stabilize the joint, probably through pure compression of the joint surfaces or by pushing the tibial plateau anteriorly relative to the femoral condyles until the surrounding passive soft tissues limit the motion, or (2) through anterior tibial subluxation, where forward motion of the tibia is limited by other surrounding passive structures, for example, popliteal fossa of the meniscus or the collateral ligaments. Although it was impossible to unravel the exact mechanism within this study, it seems that passive joint laxity will result in overloading of the surrounding structures and produce a situation that could explain posttraumatic joint degeneration.</p>
<p>The instability caused by ruptures of the ACL became apparent in the increased tibiofemoral A-P translation during passive measurements. During active movements, however, pain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513480465">30</xref></sup> modified gait patterns,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513480465">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513480465">31</xref></sup> or musculoskeletal adaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513480465">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513480465">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546513480465">40</xref></sup> could all play a role in the amount of stability in the joint, but it seems clear that muscular activity is a main actuator in this process. It is well known that modifications to muscle activation patterns influence the resulting kinematics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513480465">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513480465">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513480465">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513480465">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546513480465">40</xref></sup> but the mechanisms, as well as the exact interactions between the passive and active stabilizers of the knee, particularly after ACL ruptures, remain to be elucidated. Although it was not possible to provide evidence of additional muscle forces or joint loading, any additional muscle forces acting to stabilize the joint kinematics are likely to raise joint loading and therefore provide a mechanical process that could play a key role in the subsequent clinically observed degenerative changes in the joint,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513480465">30</xref></sup> including the development of OA. The specific identification of patients who are able to compensate from those that cannot may therefore be possible using such kinematic biomarkers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513480465">32</xref></sup> and this information could provide additional insight for clinical decision making. Although the strategy for reducing tibiofemoral A-P translation could not be elucidated in this study, it seems that any patients using a muscular stabilization strategy could overload their joints and are therefore at most risk of possible early joint degeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513480465">1</xref></sup> Whether and to what degree these mechanisms are indeed active, as well as their interaction with biochemical cascades during joint degeneration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513480465">42</xref></sup> however, remain to be understood and should be investigated in further studies.</p>
<p>One key finding of this study was that a positive relationship between passive laxity and active mobility of the joint exists for both physiologically healthy as well as for unstable knees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546513480465">Figure 5</xref>). Additional stabilization of the joint in lax knees, through muscular co-contraction or tibial subluxation, led to a significant and almost constant 3-mm reduction of posterior motion of the tibia compared to healthy joints during the same activity. An associated observation was that the tibiae of the ACL-ruptured knees were consistently located more anteriorly relative to the femur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513480465">Figure 3</xref>). This phenomenon is unlikely to be an artifact of the assessment approach because the relative tibiofemoral motion was determined in a global manner (the approach imposes no artificial reference or “zero” position on the bones). The observed results are also consistent with previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513480465">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546513480465">45</xref></sup> It therefore seems reasonable that the tibial anterior shift occurred because of ACL deficiency and was limited by the surrounding passive soft tissue structures. The consequence of such altered kinematics would be joint loading in regions that may not be adapted to such loading conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513480465">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513480465">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513480465">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513480465">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients with ACL ruptures also appeared to use an adapted gait strategy that limits knee extension during walking and thereby possibly reduces the need for a functional ACL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513480465">17</xref></sup> In our study, a significantly lower knee extension was observed in the stance phase, at about 40% of the gait cycle. During the swing phase of walking, no differences in the flexion angle were detected between groups. While the study had sufficient statistical power to identify differences in the range of A-P translation within the knee joint, the 13 patients studied here were not sufficient to provide conclusive evidence on differences in, for example, knee flexion angles during swing phase between injured and noninjured limbs. However, reduced posterior translation of the ACL-ruptured tibiae was observed compared with the contralateral sides during the swing phase of the gait cycle, even though the flexion angle did not show any differences at that instance. One possible explanation for this phenomenon was presented by Zhang and coworkers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546513480465">45</xref></sup> suggesting that the posterior force generated by the hamstrings on the tibia might not be sufficient to completely restrain translation of the tibia.</p>
<p>The range<sub>A-P</sub> from full extension to a joint flexion of about 65° has been estimated at approximately 30 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513480465">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513480465">17</xref></sup> using marker-based approaches, while more invasive radiological studies suggest the values are much lower.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480465">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513480465">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513480465">28</xref></sup> These differences might be partially explained by the additional movement attributable to soft tissue artifact. Although the approaches used in this study were based on the optical assessment of markers attached to the patients’ skin, we have demonstrated the reliability of this novel approach for assessing intrajoint kinematics. While the role of BMI remains to be investigated, the effective reduction of soft tissue artifact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513480465">37</xref></sup> and precise approaches for determining joint centers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513480465">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513480465">14</xref></sup> combined with specific characteristics of the SARA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513480465">15</xref></sup> that allow the determination of dual segment–associated axes, have previously been shown to be effective in a combined manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513480465">38</xref></sup> One aspect that remains unclear is the best approach to use and transfer calibration data for the functional identification of joint axes onto the activity kinematic data. In this study, joint axes were taken from a flexion-extension reference movement in a standardized manner, but differences in, for example, loading conditions and flexion angles between the reference movement and the measured activity, in this case walking, could result in inaccuracies or discrepancies in the location of the markers relative to the axes. Here, the dual axis technique was critical for allowing the assessment of femoral segment motion relative to a plane based on the tibial coordinate system. Although this plane does not consider local anatomic features such as the slope of the tibial plateau, it does allow the standardization of movement metrics across patients and has been demonstrated as highly reliable.</p>
<p>The tibiofemoral A-P translation during walking determined in this study was lower than that reported with previous optical approaches and only slightly higher than values suggested by radiological evidence, indicating that the approach is less sensitive to soft tissue effects than previous approaches. High reliability of the study was also supported by a single expert undertaking the measurements and statistical analysis, but this approach limited our ability to perform the study in a fully blinded fashion. It must also be noted that the passive translation assessed using the KT-1000 arthrometer produces a measure of anterior translation relative to a physiological equilibrium position and did not determine the passive posterior motion of the tibia, explaining the lower values in this assessment compared to previous radiological measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480465">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513480465">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513480465">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results of this study indicate that patients with passive knee laxity have a reduced range<sub>A-P</sub> during active movements. While the mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain to be confirmed, the likely overloading of the remaining stabilizing structures provides a possible explanation for posttraumatic cartilage degeneration and early OA development in the knee.</p>
