<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We read with interest the article by Burke et al. in the February 2013 issue of your journal and agree wholeheartedly with many of the observations as to what constitutes a successful psychiatry program as judged by the high rate of recruitment into formal training positions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213496857">1</xref></sup> Many of these observations correlate well with the observations of the Hunter New England Psychiatry Training Program as previously documented by us in your journal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213496857">2</xref></sup> We would particularly agree that a focus on a quality Junior Medical Officer (JMO) experience in psychiatry prior to specialty career choice is important, and good relationships with the hospital JMO Management structure is vital. We would also agree that provision of quality teaching and exam preparation and ensuring reasonable workloads for trainees assist in attracting potential trainees. Utilizing trainees with the skills and inclination for teaching as teachers of the next generation ensures continuity of a positive culture of learning in our experience as well.</p>
<p>We were intrigued by the statement that “it is our impression that more trainees have been recruited into psychiatry training from the JMO ranks of St Vincent’s Hospital than from any other teaching hospital in NSW in recent years” and wonder on what evidentiary basis this has been made?<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213496857">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is worth noting that JMO training in NSW occurs in networks of hospitals rather than individual teaching hospitals. The HNET program records indicate that from the period 2008–2012 22 psychiatry trainees have entered this program from within the Hunter New England JMO Network.</p>
