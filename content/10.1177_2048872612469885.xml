<title>Aims:</title>
<p>To compare the performance of the CRUSADE, ACUITY-HORIZONS, and ACTION risk models in the ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2048872612469885">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>We studied all consecutive patients with STEMI who underwent PPCI at our institution between 2006 and 2010 (<italic>n</italic>=1391). The CRUSADE, ACUITY-HORIZONS, and ACTION risk scores were calculated based on the patients’ clinical characteristics. The occurrence of in-hospital major bleeding (defined as the composite of intracranial or intraocular bleeding, access site haemorrhage requiring intervention, reduction in haemoglobin ≥4 g/dl without or ≥3g/dl with overt bleeding source, reoperation for bleeding, or blood transfusion) reached 9.8%. Calibration and discrimination of the three risk models were evaluated by the Hosmer−Lemeshow test and the C-statistic, respectively. We compared the predictive accuracy of the risk scores by the DeLong non-parametric test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2048872612469885">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Calibration of the three risk scores was adequate, given the non-significant results of Hosmer−Lemeshow test for the three risk models. Discrimination of CRUSADE, ACUITY-HORIZONS, and ACTION models was good (C-statistic 0.77, 0.70, and 0.78, respectively). The CRUSADE and ACTION risk scores had a greater predictive accuracy than the ACUITY-HORIZONS risk model (<italic>z</italic>=3.89, <italic>p</italic>-value=0.0001 and <italic>z</italic>=3.51, <italic>p</italic>-value=0.0004, respectively). There was no significant difference between the CRUSADE and ACTION models (<italic>z</italic>=0.63, <italic>p</italic>=0.531).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2048872612469885">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The CRUSADE, ACUITY-HORIZONS, and ACTION scores are useful tools for the risk stratification of bleeding in STEMI treated by PPCI. Our findings favour the CRUSADE and ACTION risk models over the ACUITY-HORIZONS risk score.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the performance of these three risk models has not been compared to date in the ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Moreover, none of these risk scores has been validated to date in the setting of trans-radial approach for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2048872612469885">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>We sought to evaluate their predictive accuracy in a contemporary cohort of patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI (PPCI), mainly using radial access.</p>

<title>Methods</title>

<title>Study population</title>
<p>All consecutive patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI at our hospital between January 2006 and December 2010 composed our study population. Patients who underwent rescue PCI were excluded from the present analysis.</p>
<p>STEMI was defined as typical chest pain lasting &gt;30 minutes but &lt;12 hours with documented ST-segment elevation ≥1 mm in ≥2 contiguous leads (or reciprocal ST-segment depression ≥1 mm in V1 or V2) or (presumed) new left bundle branch block and elevated markers of myocardial necrosis (CK-MB, troponins).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2048872612469885">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to our treatment protocol, patients received at least 250 mg aspirin at the moment of diagnosis and a loading dose of clopidogrel (300 or 600 mg) before PCI. An intravenous IIb-IIIa glycoprotein inhibitor (abciximab, loading dose 0.25 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 0.15 µg/kg/min for 12 hours) was strongly encouraged. Anticoagulation was accomplished using weight-adjusted intravenous unfractionated heparin as per standard recommendations. After the procedure, a maintenance dose of 75 mg/day of clopidogrel was recommended for at least 1 month if a bare metal stent was implanted or for 12 months if it was a drug-eluting stent. Use of thrombectomy, selection of stent type, and use of predilatation, postdilatation, and/or other technical aspects were left to the operator’s discretion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2048872612469885">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2048872612469885"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2048872612469885">10</xref></sup>. Regarding haemostasis after PCI, in patients undergoing trans-radial PCI the arterial sheath was immediately removed after the procedure and a compression bandage was then applied. Vascular closure devices were the default method of immediate closure of the femoral artery after PCI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2048872612469885">11</xref></sup> The use of these devices was only precluded if the arterial insertion site was not in the common femoral artery, if the common femoral artery was &lt;5 mm in diameter, or if severe angiographic arterial disease was present.</p>
<p>Demographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, medical history, clinical presentation, electrocardiographic findings, drug treatment, and angiographic and procedural data were collected in a prospective fashion by the main operator of the procedure using a computerized database.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-2048872612469885">
<title>Clinical endpoint and variables definitions</title>
<p>An exhaustive review of the patients’ clinical records was performed in a retrospective fashion in order to determine the occurrence of in-hospital major bleeding, as defined as the composite of intracranial or intraocular bleeding, access site haemorrhage that required intervention, reduction in haemoglobin of ≥4 g/dl without or ≥3g/dl with an overt bleeding source, reoperation for bleeding, or blood transfusion, was determined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2048872612469885">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clearance of creatinine was estimated using the Cockcroft−Gault formula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2048872612469885">12</xref></sup> Prior vascular disease was defined as it was done in the CRUSADE registry (prior stroke and/or peripheral artery disease).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2048872612469885">3</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section9-2048872612469885">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Continuous variables are presented either as median (interquartile range). Categorical variables are summarized as absolute and relative frequencies (percentages). Associations between categorical variables were studied by the χ<sup>2</sup> test or the Fisher Exact test, as appropriate. Comparisons between two mean values were performed with the Student t or Mann−Whitney tests as appropriate.</p>
<p>The CRUSADE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2048872612469885">3</xref></sup> ACUITY-HORIZONS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2048872612469885">4</xref></sup> and ACTION,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2048872612469885">5</xref></sup> bleeding risk scores were calculated from patients’ clinical characteristics. The individual rating for each variable established in each score was assigned. The total score of each patient was calculated by summing the individual result for each prognostic variable included in the score.</p>
<p>On the basis of the original publications of the risk scores, patients were classified into risk categories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2048872612469885">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2048872612469885"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2048872612469885">5</xref></sup> The CRUSADE and ACTION models distinguished five risk categories of bleeding (very low, low, moderate, high, and very high risk). In the ACUITY-HORIZONS, patients were stratified in four risk categories for bleeding (low, moderate, high, and very high risk).</p>
<p>Risk model calibration was assessed by the Hosmer−Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, which determines how close the predicted and observed incidence of events are over a range of scores. In this test, a significant result indicates lack of model adjustment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2048872612469885">13</xref></sup> We assessed the discriminatory capacity of the risk models for major bleeding by deriving their C-statistics, using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. In general, a model with a C-statistic above 0.70 has acceptable discriminatory capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2048872612469885">13</xref></sup> The C-statistics for the three risk models were compared to each other using a nonparametric test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2048872612469885">14</xref></sup> Both calibration and discrimination of the model were assessed with respect to the entire patient population. A separate analysis was performed for the patients undergoing PPCI using a trans-radial approach.</p>
<p>SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the statistical analysis, whereas the areas under the ROC curve for clinical event models were compared using MedCalc version 11.6.1 (MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium). A bilateral value of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
<p>This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki. The local ethics committee has approved our research protocol. Informed consent has been obtained from the subjects included in the present analysis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we have evaluated the performance of the CRUSADE, ACUITY-HORIZONS, and ACTION-GWTG risk scores for the prediction of major bleeding in a contemporary cohort of patients with STEMI treated by PPCI. The three risk scores showed good calibration and discrimination in our series, as it was demonstrated by the non-significant results of the Hosmer−Lemeshow test and their C-statistics, respectively. In addition to this, the three risk scores for major bleeding corresponded well with observed bleeding, with increasing rates of bleeding across increasing risk categories.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the CRUSADE and ACTION risk scores had greater predictive value for major bleeding than the ACUITY-HORIZONS risk model in our cohort. This difference in bleeding discrimination might be explained by differences in the variables that comprise each model. The three risk scores include female sex, renal function, and anaemia, variables that are clearly associated with bleeding in ACS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2048872612469885">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2048872612469885">2</xref></sup> The CRUSADE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2048872612469885">3</xref></sup> and ACTION<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2048872612469885">5</xref></sup> models have several variables in common, such as heart rate, systolic blood pressure, heart failure, diabetes, and vascular disease, that are clearly linked to bleeding in ACS.<sup>1,2</sup> The ACUITY-HORIZONS risk model did not include these variables;<sup>4</sup> we think that this has contributed to the superiority of both CRUSADE and ACTION models in comparison to the ACUITY-HORIZONS risk score. Moreover, the performance of the ACUITY-HORIZONS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2048872612469885">4</xref></sup> may have been negatively affected by the fact that none of the patients of this cohort received treatment with bivalirudin.</p>
<p>The three scores may be useful tools to identify those patients with an STEMI undergoing primary PCI at a higher risk for major bleeding and may help physicians to select the most appropriate adjunctive antithrombotic regimen for them. Although none of these scores was developed specifically for the STEMI, they are composed of several clinical variables independently associated with bleeding;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2048872612469885">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2048872612469885">2</xref></sup> this might explain their accuracy for major bleeding prediction in the present cohort of STEMI patients undergoing PPCI.</p>
<p>The relative superiority of CRUSADE and ACTION models seems to favour their use over the ACUITY-HORIZONS score for bleeding prediction in STEMI. In view of our results, it is not possible to choose between these CRUSADE and ACTION models, as there was no significant difference regarding their predictive value. Despite our study is underpowered for finding statistically significant differences in this head-to-head comparison, due to its modest sample size, this lack of difference is not surprising at all, because both scores had only minor differences in their composition. While the CRUSADE score incorporates age, weight, and creatinine as a single variable using creatinine clearance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2048872612469885">3</xref></sup> the ACTION model incorporates the three variables in a independent fashion, so their influence is more directly accounted for. The ACTION score comprises prior warfarin use and ECG changes, variables that are not included in the CRUSADE model. However, none of these differences seems to be relevant for bleeding prediction in our cohort. Despite the concerns regarding the impact of systemic anticoagulation in the management of ACS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2048872612469885">15</xref></sup> prior warfarin use was uncommon in our cohort, having so a low impact in bleeding. Given the fact that all our patients had a STEMI, the inclusion of ECG changes, as defined by the ACTION researchers, did not have a significant influence in bleeding prediction in the present population. Despite it has been stated that the ACTION risk model may have increased generalizability in comparison with the CRUSADE score,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2048872612469885">5</xref></sup> as it was developed in patients with both NSTEMI and STEMI, our findings support the use of the CRUSADE risk model in the STEMI, not only in the NSTEMI, thus questioning this affirmation. On the basis of the present results, we believe that both models may be employed for the analysis of bleeding risk in both NSTEMI and STEMI.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to date validating the usefulness of risk models for bleeding prediction in trans-radial PCI. This becomes even more important given that the 2011 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the care of NSTEMI have questioned the predictive value of the CRUSADE risk score in a radial access setting for PCI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2048872612469885">6</xref></sup> as it was developed from a US cohort where femoral access was predominantly used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2048872612469885">3</xref></sup> Trans-radial approach for PCI, widely employed in Europe, is associated with fewer bleeding complications than femoral access and may allow more aggressive antithrombotic adjunctive treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2048872612469885">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2048872612469885"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2048872612469885">18</xref></sup> The predictive ability of the CRUSADE, ACUITY-HORIZONS, and ACTION risk scores was adequate in the trans-radial PPCI subgroup. In this subgroup of patients, the CRUSADE model yielded a higher C-statistic than the ACUITY-HORIZONS model, but there were no differences in the remaining comparisons between risk scores. It is not easy to explain why the ACTION score had a lower predictive accuracy in the trans-radial PPCI subgroup of patients when compared to the entire cohort, but we think that it might be due to chance.</p>
<p>Our findings are not decisive when choosing one of the three models in particular to be employed in the trans-radial PPCI, given the absolute value of the C-statistics obtained for the three risk models. Instead of making a recommendation on which score should be employed, we would rather underscore the usefulness of the three risk models for bleeding risk stratification in the PPCI performed using the radial approach.</p>
<p>Our study may have several limitations, mainly with regard to its design. This was a nonrandomized cohort observational single-centre registry and may have the inherent bias of this type of studies. The modest simple size of our cohort is another limitation of the present analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2048872612469885">19</xref></sup> As the study population comprised only patients with an STEMI undergoing primary PCI, these results may not be applicable to STEMI patients undergoing PCI after failed thrombolysis (rescue PCI). This study population was treated with clopidogrel and, many of them, abciximab. As none of them received bivalirudin or new antiplatelet agents (prasugrel, ticagrelor), these results need to be replicated in patients undergoing primary PCI with these new antithrombotic therapies.</p>
<p>Several other scoring systems for bleeding risk stratification are available, such as those developed in the STEEPLE (Safety and Efficacy of Enoxaparin in PCI Patients, an International Randomized Evaluation) trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2048872612469885">20</xref></sup> and REPLACE (Randomized Evaluation in Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Linking Angiomax to Reduced Clinical Events) –1 and −2 studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2048872612469885">21</xref></sup> We did not include them in this comparative analysis, as they were developed in stable ischaemic disease. Despite any risk score may discriminate well at the group level, it is now recognized that it may not necessarily perform well at the individual level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2048872612469885">22</xref></sup> None of these risk scores was developed for use with single patients. Although the discriminatory capacity is high, it will never be perfect. The scores can be used in a specific patient only as an approximate guideline, as they may indicate a particular risk but do not unequivocally predict the final clinical outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2048872612469885">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, the CRUSADE, ACUITY-HORIZONS, and ACTION risk scores showed good calibration and discrimination for major bleeding prediction in patients experiencing a STEMI undergoing PPCI. For this reason, these risk scores are useful for the stratification of bleeding risk in these patients. In our study population, the CRUSADE and ACTION risk models had a greater predictive capacity for major bleeding than the ACUITY-HORIZONS risk score. Our study also highlights the usefulness of bleeding risk scores for the trans-radial PPCI, given the adequate calibration and discrimination of the three risk models for bleeding prediction demonstrated in the subgroup of patients with STEMI treated by PPCI using the radial approach.</p>
