<abstract>
<p>This article examines the moderation of the Mexico's National Action Party in the context of democratization. Founded in 1939 as a confessional party, by the 1990s the PAN had moved toward the political center – retaining its Christian-Democratic identity and ideals but also making institutional appeals to the broader voting public in Mexico. This article explains the segmented process through which the PAN moderated in response to inclusionary reforms promulgated by Mexico's authoritarian regime. In some cases, those reforms merely aggravated internal tensions in the party. But other reforms repositioned the PAN vis-à-vis its competitors, Mexican civil society, and the Mexican voting public, and triggered institutional changes that enabled the PAN to build political momentum in advance of the country's 2000 democratic transition. Employing an institutional process-tracing approach, this article examines how shocks in the PAN's competitive environment reverberated inside the organization: how they affected the relative power of factions in the party, how they were mediated by existing party institutions, and how they related to the party's ideological goals. Those crucial intra-party processes, I argue, influenced whether the PAN, as an organization, responded to those exogenous shocks in terms of its competitive behavior, and conditioned how the PAN responded when it did so. The case of the PAN demonstrates that parties may respond to inclusionary reforms or other exogenous shocks in relatively uncoordinated and unsystematic manners.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Inclusion–Moderation thesis suggests that the opportunity for meaningful representation should trigger centrist moves by niche, religious, extreme, radical or otherwise ‘immoderate’ parties. In this article, the experience of Mexico’s Partido Acción Nacional (PAN), a niche, Catholic party under Mexico’s authoritarian regime (1939–2000), both complicates the ideas of inclusion and moderation and adds new explanatory insights to that thesis. I examine moderation as a complex and multidimensional process – more so than typically recognized in the extant literature – that relates to changes in ideas, in interests and in institutions. Consistent with that literature (Thelen 2003; Pierson 2004), I find that moderation is triggered by (sometimes accidental) inclusionary reforms, and then is mediated by intra-party divisions and potentially blocked by veto players in parties. More importantly, though, this analysis demonstrates the potential organizational incoherence that moderation fosters. The case of the PAN shows that moderation, when it does occur, often unfolds unevenly across dimensions of party life and incrementally over time, resulting in inchoate organizations. These incoherencies, I suggest, augur poorly for the ability of ‘moderated’ parties to adequately represent citizen interests and may threaten the long-term viability of such organizations.</p>

<title>An institutional approach to moderation</title>
<sec id="section3-1354068812472571">
<title>Moderation as a concept</title>
<p>The Inclusion–Moderation thesis sustains that efforts to direct political debate and dissent into institutionalized and electoral politics (inclusion) alter the strategic decision-making of niche, radical or extreme leaders, and often results in choices to move ideological and policy positions toward the political centre (moderation). Doing so, after all, offers those leaders and their parties the opportunity to gain significant representation in the legislature or the executive, and thus also political power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354068812472571">Kalyvas, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354068812472571">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354068812472571">Murniati, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068812472571">Schwedler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354068812472571">Wickham, 2004</xref>). While that logic may seem intuitive and clear, understanding what moderation is, or entails, is less so. Most often, as in the case of the articles in this issue, it is applied to religious parties. However, Schwedler’s (2006) initial formulation of the thesis, among the most important recent works, makes no reference to particular types of parties to which her ideas might apply.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1354068812472571">1</xref>
</sup> The theory is perhaps best applied to ‘niche parties,’ those characterized by an issue focus outside the mainstream of party competition and that does not overlap with existing political cleavages, and which limits their issue-based appeals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068812472571">Meguid, 2005</xref>: 347 f.). When such parties moderate, it could be as simple as the choice to participate in electoral politics (a ‘new political practice’ (per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068812472571">Schwedler 2006</xref>: 22); for others moderation might mean deliberate changes in issue positions (a clearer case of Schwedler's ‘ideological moderation’) or a related ‘path out of unsecular politics’ (Kalyvas and Van Kersbergen 2010: 201).</p>
<p>Moderation by niche parties is thus conceptually murky. Schwedler, recognizing this, advanced a two-dimensional conceptualization, wherein moderation is constituted by changes in behaviour and in ideology that combine to create new ‘boundaries of justifiable action’ for immoderate parties or movements. That is, post-moderation, parties are able to advance different, moderated ideals and engage in different, moderated actions. She was right to acknowledge the complexity of her core concept, but even her specification of it may be overly narrow. Niche parties’ moderation may entail expanding those boundaries in even more directions. Specifically, if moderation means the movement of a party from a politically peripheral niche toward a more moderate centre, it also may involve changing those dimensions of party organization through which the party interacts with the voting public. Those include, but are not limited to, its bureaucratic presence in communities where voters live and its openness to their participation in party processes of candidate selection and decision-making (including membership). Moderation thus considered means (in turn) an effort to deepen and broaden bureaucratic presence and the adoption of more participatory internal rules. Examining these institutional dimensions, along with the ideological and behavioural dimensions emphasized in the moderation literature, facilitates a much richer examination of the transformations that niche and radical parties may experience following inclusionary reforms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1354068812472571">
<title>Moderation as an outcome</title>
<p>Moderation, whether examined in the limited case of <italic>ideas </italic>or a more expansive sense that consider <italic>interests </italic>and <italic>institutions</italic>, results from an interaction between environmental forces and partisan ones. The extant literature suggests, as per the theory’s ‘name’, that moderation follows significant inclusionary reforms, like transformations in state structure, electoral systems or the party system in which an organization competes. The logic is that the opportunity for improved political representation or voice unleashes desires for moderation among some party actors. Of course, politics is not mechanical, and that causal relationship comes with a number of caveats and complications. First, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068812472571">Schwedler (2006</xref>: 24) observes, reforms to state structure and the like may well be a response to a challenge to the regime’s <italic>status quo ante</italic> – such that inclusion <italic>per se</italic> is not the first step in the moderation process. In her analysis, those challenges came from excluded radicals in Yemen and Jordan. Second, the relationship between inclusion and moderation is not direct. Rather, those inclusionary reforms unleash debates within organizations about how to respond to those opportunities. The party activists that populate and control national party organizations (<italic>any</italic> party organization) are committed to their ideals and their visions of party structure. If moderation is to occur in any dimension of party life, advocates of moderation must overcome potential internal resistance among leaders, activists and rank and file members of parties. Typically, this is framed in terms of conflicts among ideologues or radicals (‘those who seek revolutionary change, often through the use of violence’) and pragmatists or moderates (who ‘seek gradual reform within the existing system’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068812472571">Schwedler, 2006</xref>: 8). Only when moderating forces prevail in these internal contests should we expect to see changes in ideology or behaviour, or ideas, interests and institutions.</p>
<p>Third, one must recognize that moderation by a niche party does not always signal factional victory by moderate forces or the conversion of radicals into moderates – indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068812472571">Schwedler (2006</xref>: 13) notes, moderation could result from fence-sitters becoming moderates, further moderation by existing moderates, reducing the support of radicals, and several other possibilities. Moderated parties retain immoderate elements. Fourth, and relatedly, parties’ likelihood of remaining moderated must also be considered. In some cases, core supporters of niche parties have punished them for responding to more open structures of political opportunity. The trick is that these parties have typically not been vote-seekers in the political mainstream, but rather occupied marginal niches in their party systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354068812472571">Meguid, 2005</xref>). While they were marginal political forces, their activists and mobilized bases regarded them not as office-seekers, but as message-seekers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354068812472571">Greene, 2007</xref>). For a religious party or an ideologically extreme party, turning away from historical programmatic commitments may upset those message-seekers, producing either schisms within parties or threatening any moderating reforms in the party.</p>
<p>Lastly, given the multidimensional nature of party organization and the complex nature of the concept of moderation, it seems very unlikely that ‘wholesale’ moderation could occur in a niche party. That hypothetical case would involve a removal of party elites, an abandonment of the party’s traditional base and a successful overture to voters in the political centre – and those are merely the conditions for successful programmatic moderation! Understanding moderation by niche and religious parties requires focusing on the smaller, more incremental institutional changes that occur as parties encounter more inclusive political environments, and identifying the cumulative effect of those changes over time (as considered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354068812472571">Mahoney and Thelen (2010</xref>)). Within any single moment, though, parties are likely to exhibit contradictory attributes: stasis in some dimensions, moderation in others, and perhaps even ‘immoderation’ in others. Those contradictory attributes may resolve over time, or may endure. Additionally, moderation may not follow a coherent sequence – while the construction of a niche party may follow a logic that unifies ideas, interests and institutions, its deconstruction is likely less sequenced, ordered and predictable. Understanding moderation thus requires a long-term perspective that is sensitive to short-term, subtle, discrete and uneven events.</p>

<title>The PAN as an ‘immoderate’ party</title>
<p>Most recent scholarship on the PAN has emphasized its contributions to Mexico’s democratization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068812472571">Mizrahi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354068812472571">Shirk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354068812472571">Wuhs, 2008</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1354068812472571">2</xref>
</sup> While by no means suggesting that emphasis is misplaced, this article instead examines the PAN as a religious party, based on the similarities between it and European confessional and Christian-Democratic parties. To consider the PAN as such does not deny its pro-democratic positions, nor does it equate the PAN as a religious party with jihadist or radical religious parties like those considered by Schwedler and those included in this volume. Rather, here I place particular analytical emphasis on the centrality of political Catholicism to the PAN’s foundation and history.</p>
<p>The influence of religion on the PAN is most evident in its doctrine, which is ‘deeply inspired by the Social Doctrine of the Catholic Church’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068812472571">Mizrahi, 2003</xref>: 22), and drawn from the same papal encyclicals as most European Christian-Democratic parties, the Rerum Novarum (1891) and the Quadragesimo Anno (1931). Central among those ideals is the notion of a ‘third way’ alternative to liberalism and communism and an emphasis on the principles of subsidiarity and solidarity (see also Sigmund, 2003). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068812472571">Magaloni and Moreno (2003</xref>: 253) refer to the PAN’s social Christian identity as a ‘commitment toward democracy and private initiative linked with a set of Christian moral values that command a person’s political and social behaviour beyond the private spiritual sphere’. This bears some similarity to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354068812472571">Irving (1979</xref>, as cited in Kalyvas and Van Kersbergen (2010: 187)) notes for Christian Democracy in general: ‘Christian commitments to elementary human rights, liberal democratic values, and class and transnational reconciliation.’</p>
<p>The ideas of liberalism and illiberalism also figure centrally in discussions of political Catholicism and the PAN’s own ideas, as well as the inclusion–moderation logic. In the end, the multiple meanings attached to the word complicate a clear relationship between the PAN’s and other parties’ ideals and the logic of inclusion and moderation. Illiberalism is among the defining characteristics of parties examined through that logic’s lens, usually referring to the position of parties vis-à-vis democratic politics. Moderation by those illiberal parties thus represents greater acceptance of democratic rules of the game. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068812472571">Loaeza (2003</xref>: 205) regarded illiberalism as the core proposition of the staunchly internally and externally democratic PAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354068812472571">Wuhs, 2008</xref>), due to its strident opposition to restrictions placed on the Church. A variant of illiberalism was also evident in the PAN’s early proposal for corporatist representation for parents in Mexico’s Chamber of Deputies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1354068812472571">3</xref>
</sup> Because of the confusion the terms ‘liberalism’ and ‘illiberalism’ introduce (without even acknowledging their economic implications), here I simply emphasize the Catholic character of the PAN’s ideals, leaders and interests.</p>
<p>Despite the centrality of Catholic ideals in the party’s foundation, the party maintained distance from the church and its institutions – characteristic also of European Christian Democracy (Kalyvas and Van Kersbergen, 2010: 185), though in the PAN’s case it was also motivated by legal restrictions against religious political parties at the time of the PAN’s foundation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1354068812472571">4</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354068812472571">Kitschelt et al. (2010</xref>: 250–253) note, by the late 1930s, the church itself had established a ‘friendly’ relationship with the Cárdenas government (1934–1940). Catholic lay organizations, however, had not. Like most Christian-Democratic parties, the PAN’s foundation grew from dissatisfaction on the part of those organizations and their members. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068812472571">Mizrahi (2003</xref>: 22) notes that lay associations, like the Catholic Association of Young Mexicans – ACJM and Mexico Catholic Action – ACM, were the largest groups in the PAN’s founding coalition, and provided important resources for its establishment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1354068812472571">5</xref>
</sup> As in Europe, these movements were autonomous from the church, opting to form a party once they realized that ‘their interests lay in the consolidation and further expansion of parliamentary and electoral democracy’ (Kalyvas and Van Kersbergen, 2010: 185 f.; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354068812472571">Kalyvas 1996</xref>: 245). And, as in the case of many religious parties, those groups were especially politicized by secularizing reforms of an incumbent government. In the case of the PAN, it was the governments of President Plutarco Calles in the late 1920s and particularly that of President Lázaro Cárdenas (1934–1940) that mobilized Catholic lay associations. Both leaders were intent on realizing the anti-Church reforms embedded in Mexico’s post-revolutionary 1917 constitution, which, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068812472571">Camp (2008</xref>) notes, imposed dramatic restrictions on religious political influence, undermined the legitimacy of religious institutions and removed special legal status for religious institutions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1354068812472571">6</xref>
</sup> The lay associations were also especially concerned by the imposition of secular education by Calles and what they perceived as his government’s efforts to restrain freedom of religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068812472571">Magaloni and Moreno, 2003</xref>: 249).</p>
<p>Early scholarship on the PAN portrayed it as a party closely wedded to the political objectives of these organizations and other conservative Catholic groups. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354068812472571">Johnson (1965</xref>) described the PAN as a ‘restorationist’ ally of the National Sinarquist Union–UNS (itself founded in 1937) and the National Parents Union–UNPF (formed 1917), with whom it often shared local-level members. While those alliances experienced their ups and downs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354068812472571">Shirk (2005</xref>: 71) chronicles the growing influence of such organizations in the PAN during the 1950s and 1960s, consistent with several recent works that emphasize the importance of Catholic leaders of the party, in this chapter of the PAN’s history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068812472571">Mizrahi, 2003</xref>: 21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354068812472571">Shirk, 2005</xref>: 60; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068812472571">Loaeza, 2003</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354068812472571">1999</xref> passim).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1354068812472571">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The PAN’s ideals, political base and leadership thus featured very important religious dimensions. Of course, the PAN’s voters were also Catholic. That said, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354068812472571">Camp (1994</xref>: 89) notes, PAN voters are not clearly <italic>more</italic> Catholic or differently Catholic today than are voters for the PRI or the PRD (the Partido Revolucionario Institucional and the Partido de la Revolución Democrática, its main competitors), and it seems unlikely they were distinct in the late 1930s. The PAN’s political Catholicism is an organizational attribute – not one that can be used to distinguish among voters in the electorate. Indeed, as in European confessional parties and later Christian-Democratic ones, the appeals of the PAN drew a heterogenenous coalition of groups because, in contrast to several of the parties examined in this volume, the PAN is not <italic>only </italic>a religious party. It is certainly the case that the politicization of the religious–secular cleavage played an important role in the formation of the PAN in 1939 (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354068812472571">Kitschelt et al., 2010</xref>: 256). However, the Cárdenas government politicized <italic>several</italic> latent social cleavages – including the religious one, the centre-periphery cleavage (per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068812472571">Magaloni and Moreno, 2003</xref>) through its establishment of centralized state authority, and the owner-worker cleavage through the effective incorporation of mass actors into politics, the creation of a powerful centralized labour organization, and the passage of labour rights regimes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354068812472571">Dion, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354068812472571">Middlebrook, 1995</xref>). The PAN, from its foundation, drew its support from the ‘losing’ side of these divisions – political Catholics; resistors to centralized authority, including participants in the Cristero conflict (a rebellion by Christian peasants and farmers in the Bajío against the central state); entrepreneurs concerned about a growing state influence in the economy and workers’ power; and economic and political liberals alienated by the Cardenista reforms.</p>
<p>Therein lies another very important contributing factor to the political immoderation of the PAN. While it emerged from the politicization of existing social cleavages, factors exogenous to the PAN added to the party’s niche status. The PAN was founded as Mexico entered into a lengthy period of control by a dominant party authoritarian regime (DPAR) organized around the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI, a descendant of the PRM). The PRI’s DPAR dramatically amplified the normal benefits of incumbency by increasing the resource advantages offered to the incumbents and by raising the costs for mobilizing in the political opposition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1354068812472571">8</xref>
</sup> The result, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354068812472571">Greene (2007</xref>: 59–62), was that ambitious office-seekers shifted their loyalty to the incumbent, while message-seekers stayed behind to build a niche party. Those circumstances created several problems for the PAN: its appeals moved out of the mainstream, it lacked the resources needed to communicate effectively with voters, and it struggled to recruit office-seeking elites.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1354068812472571">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The PAN was politically immoderate, then, for interrelated ideological and political reasons. Its founders represented ideals and interest groups that were anathema to the consolidating PRI regime, and, as a consequence and because of the incentives of the DPAR, it was unable, for most of its history, to attract ambitious office-seekers to the party given its niche status. That status was clearest in the first 20 years of the party, and especially during what scholars of the PAN refer to as the ‘confessional’ period of the party, when the PAN was metaphorically ‘crossing the desert’. It was a ghettopartei during this period, led not by its more moderate founding leader Manuel Gómez Morin but by Catholic ideologues like Efraín Gonzáles Luna. That is, during this period (which most analysts mark as 1946–1961) PAN leaders from Catholic lay organizations were hegemonic within the party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354068812472571">Shirk, 2005</xref>: 69–71; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068812472571">Mizrahi 2003</xref>, 22). Their dominance marked a time of ‘extreme confessionalization within the party, characterized by the predominance of doctrine’, in which the PAN grew, ‘intransigent and moralistic in its opposition, rejecting negotiation and compromise and maintaining only tenuous relations with other players’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068812472571">Loaeza, 2003</xref>: 212). Despite the hegemony of that ideological current in the party, though, the UNS, UNPF and the lay Catholic associations remained formally autonomous from the PAN.</p>
<p>The programmatic character of the PAN in its early years bred an organization that was ‘niche’ as well. The party leadership consisted of a narrow and loose network of individuals, based in Mexico City but with an important presence in the Bajío region of Mexico (the Cristero states) and spotty presence in Mexico’s north. It was also poor – with no effective resources to bring to campaigns, to the maintenance of party offices, even to staffing the party’s national and state offices, which were administered out of members’ homes and offices. Leaders from that era recall that, ‘there was no money that didn’t come from my or someone else’s pocket. That’s how campaigns were too – with members providing <italic>tortas</italic>, cars, even drivers. …But it was a beautiful time, because the party was living its ideals – we didn’t participate in the interest of public office.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1354068812472571">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The confessional period of the party’s history influenced how it managed its internal life as well. Despite being politically marginal in the Mexican context, PAN leaders and activists placed extraordinary emphasis on the integrity of their internal rules – their democratic character and the way that those procedures demanded devotion to the party. For example, membership in the party during this period was difficult to attain: interested individuals (for the party fiercely banned of corporate membership) needed a sponsor (a current member of the PAN, in good standing) to be considered by the local party committee for recommendation to the national party office. If that individual passed successfully through that filter, they were required to enroll in a course on PAN doctrine as well as compelled to pay their membership dues. (This, compared to membership in the PRI, which Mexican lore says one held until one renounced.) The party had similarly restrictive (or sectarian, in Mizrahi’s (2003) terms) rules for leadership and candidate selection. The process for selecting the party’s presidential candidate was indicative: during the confessional period, the victorious candidate was required to garner 80 percent support of the PAN’s national electoral convention to carry the nomination – thus ensuring that ‘good panistas’ and not mere political entrepreneurs represented the PAN on election day.</p>
<p>Despite the authoritarian character of Mexican politics during the confessional period and through the late 1970s, the PAN regularly competed in municipal, state and federal elections. <italic>In formal terms, it was not excluded as a party</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1354068812472571">11</xref>
</sup> As Figure 1 demonstrates, the party was marginal in its vote and seat-share – but it did regularly compete, and represented Mexico’s only truly regime-autonomous opposition party during most of the authoritarian period.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>That said, there were serious debates within the party about competing in elections that were either rigged or were marked by tremendous resource inequities between the PRI and the PAN. Did doing so contribute to the illusion of democracy the PRI sought to create? Indeed, from the PAN’s establishment in 1939 the primary factions within the party were constructed around precisely the question of whether to engage in the formal political sphere, gain marginal representation, and use it to ‘spread the gospel’ of the PAN (a group led first by founding leader Gómez Morin and later Adolfo Christlieb), or withdraw from the political arena, maintain the moral high ground, and not dignify the regime (a group that first coalesced around Efraín Gonzáles Luna) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354068812472571">Loaeza, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354068812472571">Reveles Vázquez, 1996</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354068812472571">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354068812472571">Wuhs, 2001</xref>). While these strategic differences were significant and contributed to serious division within the party during its confessional years, ultimately the PRI’s hegemony stunted them; even full-scale participation during the 1950s would have yielded only a marginal political voice.<sup>

<title>Inclusionary Moment I: The party deputies reform</title>
<p>Mexico’s first moderating reform followed 1958’s presidential election, for which the PAN named a firebrand entrepreneur from the northern state of Chihuahua (Luis H. Alvarez) as its candidate. He waged a campaign that, by his own telling, was unlike the party’s prior efforts, marked by combative rhetoric and public condemnations of PRI authoritarianism. ‘Our strategy was to attack the <italic>caciques</italic> throughout the country, and it resulted in a very complete penetration of the country. That campaign brought us to the corners of the country, to plant the seed of democracy and the doctrine of the PAN.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1354068812472571">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Though the PAN lost that election (as Figure 1 suggests), the post-electoral protests were more numerous and confrontational than in the past, and the following year’s state and local elections met with the most ‘unrecognized wins’ of the PAN’s history to that point, suggesting PRI concerns about the PAN’s performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068812472571">Lujambio, 2001</xref>: 54).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1354068812472571">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Just a few years later, in 1963, the PRI passed the first of several electoral reforms that restructured the legislature by creating designated seats for opposition parties, a move typically interpreted as an effort to offer the political opposition a carrot to remain engaged in formal, institutional politics rather than street politics. This first reform, termed the party deputies reform, delivered seats to parties that surpassed a modest 2.5 percent threshold, but capped representation per opposition party at 20 seats. That is, PRI hegemony was never in jeopardy. Furthermore, parties that were assigned seats through the party deputies reform were required to accept those seats. If they refused them in protest (say, in a show of resistance to PRI hegemony), those parties lost their federal registries and their ability to compete in future elections.</p>
<p>The promise of reliable political representation (minimal though it was) bolstered the pragmatic faction of the PAN, and triggered an intensification of their internal factional battle with their more doctrinaire rivals. At issue, to be clear, were not promising candidacies and the spoils of government; the PAN still lost the vast majority of the contests in which it competed, and it failed to name candidates for most elections (topping off at less than 15 percent of municipal elections through the mid-1970s; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354068812472571">Lujambio, 2001</xref>: 55). Instead, leaders were debating the very identity and disposition of the party. Should it seek office or should it preserve its integrity?</p>
<p>Despite the inclusionary opening of the party deputies reform, there were no significant external signs of moderation in the PAN. Doctrinaire voices continued to hold sway over the National Council and National Executive Committee of the party, and thus were positioned to block any significant reform, even though the PAN’s 1960s president, Adolfo Christlieb, was quite pragmatic in his own orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354068812472571">Loaeza, 2003</xref>: 218). One significant moderating change did occur in the early 1970s, though, when the goal of winning office first appeared in the PAN’s core documents. Even so, the party’s performance on election day 1970 was weak, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354068812472571">Figure 2</xref> shows.</p>

<title>Inclusionary Moment II: The electoral reform of 1977</title>
<p>Events in 1975 and 1976 precipitated an inclusionary move by the PRI in 1977. In those years, the PAN elected a new party president and also had to select its presidential candidate for the 1976 federal elections. In the former case, as was typical of leadership contests, candidates from the rival factions vied for control of the organization. Despite five rounds of voting, neither the pragmatic nor the doctrinaire candidate was able to muster the supermajority required to win the party presidency – the contest was resolved only when the pragmatic candidate withdrew, leaving the PAN with a weakly legitimate leader. Later, when the PAN sought to name its presidential candidate for the 1976 federal elections, factional strife was such that the PAN actually failed to nominate one. The 80 percent vote-share then required was beyond the reach of any candidate, leaving the PRI candidate to run unopposed.</p>
<p>Those events represented a low point for the PAN, but ironically generated further opportunities for the party. The uncontested nature of 1976’s presidential election exposed the one-party nature of Mexico’s DPAR, and prompted the PRI to react. It capitulated to opposition party pressure for greater legislative representation by adding 100 proportional representation seats to the Chamber of Deputies (which had been composed of only plurality, single-member district seats).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1354068812472571">18</xref>
</sup> As with the party deputies reform before it, this change in Mexico’s electoral law increased the power of the pragmatic faction of the party. In large part, the strengthening of pragmatists in the PAN resulted from later recognition by members of the private sector that the PAN was a viable vehicle through which to challenge the PRI. Following the nationalization of the country’s private banking system in 1982, many entrepreneurs, particularly northern entrepreneurs and members of two industrial associations (Coparmex and CANACO), shifted their allegiances to the PAN (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354068812472571">Mizrahi, 1994</xref>). Following the style of Manuel J. Clouthier, they injected the PAN with a newly confrontational style of politics.</p>
<p>The 1977 reform and the arrival of the <italic>neopanistas </italic>(as the entrepreneurs were called) signalled a substantial shift toward the political mainstream for the PAN. In terms of the interests represented by the party, it did result in an important departure from the party’s confessional identity. And while there was no formal programmatic change in the party following that inclusionary moment, the party did shift which aspects of its programme it emphasized in public campaigns. Neopanista campaigns were not organized around the social Christian values of the party typical of earlier campaigns, but around the party’s credentials as a pro-democratic alternative to the PRI. It represented local democratic governance, which was a possibility, and a desire for alternation in state and federal government, which was not yet possible. Indeed, the mobilization of the PAN around the ideas of democracy embedded in its doctrine contributed to the emergence of a new axis of political competition in the 1980s – the democratic-authoritarian axis – that remained the dominant issue dimension in Mexican politics through the 2000 democratic transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354068812472571">Molinar Horcasitas, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354068812472571">Greene, 2007</xref>: ch. 5–6). However, the PAN’s internal institutions remained stable and relatively uncontested, as the leadership of the party and its activist base was still steeped in its traditional political identity. While the neopanistas were the public faces of the party in the 1980s, they were also effectively excluded from the party’s core leadership (the National Executive Committee) until the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354068812472571">Wuhs, 2001</xref>: 150).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1354068812472571">
<title>Inclusionary Moment III: The prelude and postlude to the 1988 federal elections</title>
<p>Mexico’s crushing debt crisis in the 1980s further undercut the legitimacy the PRI regime derived from its successful management of the economy during the ISI-fuelled Mexican Miracle. The crisis and the government’s inadequate response to a devastating earthquake in 1985 spurred social movement mobilization on the left and further critiques from the pro-business right. As a result, heading into the 1988 federal elections the PRI leadership was in its weakest position since the 1930s. It responded to that weakness by creating a second 100 PR seats in the Chamber of Deputies (as part of a more comprehensive electoral reform) in 1986. The likelihood of even greater formal representation spurred the opposition on, but also contributed to other elements of a bigger inclusionary moment in the late 1980s: a significant schism within the PRI, the formation of a new left party, the Partido de la Revolución Democrática (PRD), the first-ever recognition of an opposition party gubernatorial victory (in Baja California in 1989 for the PAN), and PRI overtures to the PAN for legislative cooperation in tacit exchange for the recognition of future gubernatorial victories.</p>
<p>Those moments add up to a very significant political opening for the PAN between 1986 and 1990. To what extent did they contribute to moderation within the PAN? Programmatically speaking, the PAN through this period continued to emphasize the democratic elements of its doctrine and, by implication, de-emphasize policy-specific issues in its campaigns. It certainly amounted to moderation – but it was moderation by emphasis, not via a formal institutional change. The relatively strongly performance of PAN candidate Clouthier in 1988’s presidential election and the breakthrough in Baja California contributed to the image of the PAN as an electorally viable party – but did not result in <italic>new</italic> interests coming to the party. That said, even though the PRI had by that time shifted its economic programme to the right, the party during the early 1990s grew even more attractive to segments of Mexico’s entrepreneurial community – including, for example, Vicente Fox, the PAN’s 2000 presidential candidate. The PAN’s improved performance is evident in Figure 3.</p>
<p>Despite the increasingly pragmatic and entrepreneurial character of the party’s leadership during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the PAN retained its very restrictive membership rules, its closed candidate selection procedures, and its virulent anti-corporatist politics. This seeming mismatch led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354068812472571">Mizrahi (2003</xref>) to argue that during this period the PAN was an electoralist party with sectarian rules – and as a result could not be an effective electoral party. In fact, only one successful important institutional change that could be considered ‘moderating’ occurred at this time, though it was quite significant in its implications for conservative elements in the party. Since the 1977 electoral reform, franking privileges and other minor subsidies had been available to registered political parties like the PAN. When those benefits were first created, the PAN leadership resoundingly refused their acceptance. Doing otherwise would, in their eyes, have legitimated PRI rule. In 1989, pragmatist party president Luis H. Alvarez (the party’s 1958 presidential candidate) unilaterally accepted those funds. This action alienated many of the most extreme religious elements in the party to such an extent that they formed a visible internal current, the Democratic and Doctrinaire Forum, and when that current failed to garner broad support in the party, most of its leaders left the party (in October 1992).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1354068812472571">
<title>Inclusionary Moment IV: Electoral reform of 1996</title>
<p>The final major exogenous shock to the Mexican system occurred with an electoral reform effective for the 1997 federal mid-term elections. The PAN and PRD by the mid-1990s represented a considerable influence in Congress and a powerful presence at the state level. They jointly used their influence to engineer a radical revision to Mexican electoral law that, rather than just tinkering with the composition of the legislature as in past reforms, sought to level the playing field among parties across-the-board. Three primary mechanisms achieved that goal. The first was the provision of very generous public finance for party basic operations and, in federal election years, for campaigns. While funding levels were proportional to vote-share in prior elections, the regulations served to dramatically increase the coffers of the PAN and the PRD, placed caps on the PRI’s budgets and introduced strict auditing requirements for campaigns and operations expenses. Second, and relatedly, the 1996 electoral reform sought to remedy the heavily biased press that had favoured the PRI during its hegemonic period and throughout the 1980s through related limits and auditing on election-season media coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354068812472571">Eisenstadt, 2003</xref>: 33–35).</p>
<p>The final mechanism for levelling the playing field was the strengthening of the country’s electoral authority (the Federal Electoral Institute), such that it was a truly regime-autonomous actor, endowed with the power to organize and execute federal elections, featuring an electoral tribunal to arbitrate post-electoral disputes, and with the resources necessary to carry out those functions. To the extent that the PRI’s dominance had been manufactured through fraud, it was no longer able to wield that power. Paired with the proportional-representation seats in the Chamber of Deputies, new ‘minority’ senators, and new proportional-representation senators,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1354068812472571">20</xref>
</sup> the opposition parties encountered an institutional environment that facilitated increased representation in the state. In terms of its programmatic position, the late 1990s in the PAN was marked by a strident emphasis on the democratic character of the party’s ideals – a continuation of that emphasis from the early 1980s, but backed up by the PAN’s cumulative experience of governing at the state level following PAN-led localized democratization processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354068812472571">Cornelius et al., 1999</xref>; Rodriguez and Ward, 1995).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1354068812472571">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>An important moderating institutional change occurred during the 1990s – a revision of the membership rules that historically kept the party’s cadres narrow and exclusive. In 1997, under party president Felipe Calderón, a second tier of party membership was added, the party ‘<italic>adherentes</italic>’ to complement the ‘<italic>activos</italic>’ who joined the party under the existing rules. The adherentes layer was designed to capitalize on the bubble of political support the party encountered in the mid-1990s and draw new interests and members into the organization. They were subject to less stringent requirements as they joined the party, but were often allowed to participate in nomination processes and were welcomed into the internal life of the party. The adherent layer of the party accounted for the lion’s share of the party’s growth in the late 1990s, as Figure 4 shows.</p>

<sec id="section10-1354068812472571">
<title>The PAN post-2000: Moderation, immoderation and fragmentation</title>
<p>The PAN ended the PRI’s hegemony in 2000 – removing it from the federal executive and reducing it to a minority party in the Congress. The year’s election, which left the PAN with the presidency and, for a time, a plurality in the Chamber of Deputies, marked a tremendous ‘inclusionary moment’ for the party and solidified the PAN’s status as an electoralist party. The inclusion and moderation in the PAN prior to 2000 entailed, on the programmatic level, no formal change in the ideals or doctrine of the party. It did, however, mean a shift in what the party emphasized at election time. After the doctrinaire faction was side-lined and the neopanistas entered the party, the PAN increasingly identified itself not as a social Christian or conservative agent, but instead as a democratic agent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1354068812472571">23</xref>
</sup> Its actions in that regard also contributed to the emergence of the ‘democracy issue’ as the most salient issue dimension in Mexican politics in the 1990s. But the democratic transition presented a programmatic challenge to the PAN – precisely because the democracy issue was resolved by the events of 2000. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354068812472571">Magaloni and Moreno (2003</xref>), the politics of ‘democracy’ enabled the party to be relatively opaque about its programmatic positions on ‘family values’ issues like sexual freedom and abortion (both of which ideologues in the party opposed), and to a certain extent about the economy. Rather than have a defined set of voters attracted to particular ideals advanced by the party, PAN voters were ‘scattered all over the political spectrum along the economic and moral values dimensions’ (261–265). However, in the post-transition period, as the party has staked out more particular positions on those and other issues, its place as a conservative Catholic party has grown increasingly clear. That clarity has revealed disconnects between the issue positions of PAN leaders and voters. Upper-class PAN voters, for example, oppose the party’s conservative abortion position and restrictions on sexual freedom, while the party’s neoliberal economic position has alienated its lower class, but socially conservative, voters. Thus, the emergence of traditional issue-based competition may have contributed to a public perception of ‘immoderation’ on the part of the party – only because its actual positions became more transparent.</p>
<p>Inclusionary reforms also brought new voices and interests to the political opposition. The organized social base of the party had been primarily Catholic lay associations through the 1960s, but by the mid-1980s they had been joined by significant numbers of entrepreneurs. That said, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068812472571">Camp (2008</xref>) notes that voters active in religious organizations were 22 percent more likely to have supported the PAN candidate in 2006 than to have supported the left alliance. At the elite level, the PAN’s legislative delegation shows a plurality of interests: members of socially conservative organizations like the UNPF are elected members of the national congress, but they are far outnumbered by business association members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354068812472571">Wuhs, 2010</xref>). Still, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354068812472571">Camp (2008</xref>), 51 percent of PAN candidates for the 2006 election were members of religious organizations – more than double the proportion of PRD members.</p>
<p>While the PAN’s internal institutions were slow to respond to inclusionary reforms, by the 1990s and early 2000s significant changes in membership and nomination rules opened the party to new segments of Mexico’s voting public. From the party’s foundation through the early 1990s, there had been no substantial changes in the mechanisms through which legislative and executive candidates were nominated – this despite, especially since the early 1970s, increased factional conflict in the party and, since the early 1980s, the arrival of new cadres to the party. The sectarian rules of the party privileged very closed selection processes wherein the party’s most devout could be nominated to run against the PRI, likely as political martyrs. Of course, from the 1980s on, the PAN accumulated more municipal and state-level victories, suggesting that nomination was decreasingly an act of personal sacrifice. As Figure 5 demonstrates (borrowed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354068812472571">Wuhs (2008</xref>), after the 1997 mid-term elections the PAN opened up the selection processes for executive posts and the Senate to broader popular participation.</p>
<p>Wuhs (2008) measured candidate selection rule openness on a rising eight-point scale. In 1991, all federal candidate selection choices were made at a national electoral convention. Prior to the 2000 election, the PAN moved to a closed primary for the nomination of its presidential candidate. Shortly after the 2000 election, it shifted the nomination of gubernatorial and senate candidates to state-level conventions, and briefly shifted to an open primary for its presidential selection rule (though that reform was quickly overturned). Notably, the change in selection rule was not uniform; especially notable is the marginal closing of the rule for naming SMD deputy candidates (which resulted from the imposition of more stringent delegate selection rules). Overall, though, the PAN’s internal rules demonstrate a desire to open the party to broader segments of the voting population.</p>
<p>Beyond those internal rules, the party also slowly established a stronger organizational foothold across Mexico, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1354068812472571">Figure 6</xref> demonstrates. The party’s bureaucratic coverage was nowhere near universal, and there were quite significant organizational blind spots for the PAN; in the southern Mexican states of Puebla, Chiapas and Oaxaca, all PRI strongholds, the PAN has a very weak presence, which augurs poorly for its potential for attracting voters in those states as well. That said, compared with the confessional period’s voluntarism and mysticism, the PAN by 2004 represented a more modern and institutionalized party organization.<sup>

<sec id="section11-1354068812472571">
<title>The results of moderation</title>
<p>The story of the PAN in Mexico offers several important reflections on the Inclusion–Moderation thesis. First and foremost, it highlights how complicated processes of moderation are. Parties do not (or may not) adapt wholesale to inclusionary moments, but in partial ways that are unpredictable at that moment and even perhaps over time. It is not an integrated process. Parties are complex organizations, and while conservative leaders may be able to block moderating changes in some aspects of party life (where, for example, they retain a true institutional veto), they may be unable to do so elsewhere. The clearest cases of this were the delayed institutional changes in the PAN – which were possible only after the neopanistas had established themselves in the national leadership of the party and following the schism of the Democratic and Doctrinaire Forum. Despite pressures to make the party more open to the Mexican citizenry in the 1980s, it was not until the mid-1990s and even after the transition that any moderating rule changes occurred – long after the ideas emphasized by the party and the interests it included had moved toward the political centre. However, in their individual electoral campaigns (which were often conducted with some autonomy from the national leadership), neopanista candidates could emphasize issues like democratic alternation and effective governance that resonated with voters more than political Catholicism did. In that ambit, the party central office lacked an effective veto.</p>
<p>Second, the experience of the PAN raises the question of what inclusion means. Not all inclusionary moments were equal for the PAN. The limited inclusion of the 1963 party deputies reform, for example, did not result in any significant moderation and indeed exacerbated intra-party tensions that were debilitating through the 1970s. The effects of inclusion were not felt, ultimately, until <italic>both</italic> the existing pragmatic faction of the party was bolstered by the 1977 electoral reform <italic>and</italic> forces outside the party (the entrepreneurs-cum-neopanistas) recognized the PAN as a viable electoral vehicle. Moderation, then, isn’t just the result of institutional drift or decisions to adapt institutions made internal to parties, but the result of interactions between party leaders, activists and institutions, on the one hand, and elements of the political environment, on the other.</p>
<p>Third, moderation is not a unidirectional process. One of the more surprising turns in recent Mexican politics has been the seeming resurgence of the conservative Christian elements of the PAN’s doctrine through the actions of state and local governments (not an ideological change <italic>per se</italic>, but a change in the ideological emphasis of some actors in the party). The loss of the democratic axis of competition has, as noted earlier, revealed other elements of PAN doctrine that are certainly less moderate and for which the population may hold less sympathy. For example, across Mexico PAN-held state governments have enacted increasingly restrictive abortion policies, and even before the transition to democracy the party gained infamy in Jalisco for a municipal-level effort to ban mini-skirts.</p>
<p>Fourth, this analysis of the PAN reveals something important about the causal chain behind moderation. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354068812472571">Schwedler (2006</xref>) notes, inclusionary reforms are often prompted by challenges to the regime. In her case discussion, she privileges deliberate political challenges by radical forces to the regime. At times, as after the 1958 presidential election, the PAN too directly confronted the PRI regime. However, other challenges that led to inclusionary reforms were passive and circumstantial in character. The PAN’s failure to nominate a presidential candidate in 1976 was not a deliberate challenge to PRI rule, nor a plot to reveal the non-democratic character of PRI hegemony. Yet it is one of the key factors behind the landmark 1977 electoral reform that first gave opposition parties a serious foothold in the Chamber of Deputies and triggered moderation within the PAN. Likewise, the economic collapse of the 1980s weakened the legitimacy of the PRI regime, which prompted the subsequent wave of electoral reforms.</p>
<p>Moderation brought electoral success to the party, but as Felipe Calderón (through 2012 the President of Mexico, but then as president of the PAN) once noted, the dilemma for the PAN in the 1990s was how to win power without losing the party. Implied in his comment was a concern that moderation would cause the loss of the PAN’s mysticism, its ideology – the glue or collective incentives that held activists to the party in its early years despite the utter absence of election-day rewards. The trade-off that he posited was unfortunately oversimplified. The PAN retains significant elements that are fierce advocates of the ideals of those lay associations that were so crucial in the PAN’s early years – so the party was not ‘lost’. That said, the party now also includes entrepreneurs, democratic activists, ambitious office-seekers and others holding different ideals. Its voters, as noted earlier, are scattered across the ideological map, and its leaders are distant, ideologically, from its voters. Moderation meant electoral success for the PAN, but it also ushered in serious organizational fragmentation. The PAN was founded out of the confluence of several overlapping politicized social cleavages, but key to its success was the way the DPAR regime of the PRI collapsed those cleavages upon one another. They lent unity to the PAN as a force in the political opposition. Democratization, however, separated those cleavages and has highlighted the different agendas advanced by members of the PAN’s base. In the institutional contexts of federalism and multipartyism, and especially of the politically divisive drug war launched by Calderón shortly after his inauguration, the PAN has not shown a capacity to hold together that coalition. The PRI’s dramatic resurgence in the 2009 federal legislative elections, in which the PRI regained a plurality of seats in the Chamber of Deputies, demonstrated the potential consequences for the PAN, and perhaps Mexican democracy, of the PAN’s fragmentation.</p>
<p>The challenge for the PAN in 2012 was thus daunting: to keep the PRI from regaining the presidency, it needed to reassemble its cleavage-based coalition of the past, or forge a new one based on either a charismatic candidate or a palatable post-transition platform. Paired with the costs of Calderón’s offensive against the country’s drug cartels, neither path was possible. The PAN was resoundingly defeated, losing the presidency to the PRI and relegated to a minority voice in the Chamber of Deputies, and immediately entered crisis mode as competing leaders sought to explain the party’s performance. While those conflicts and debates may exact further costs on the party, the PRI’s return to power may, like 1976, offer the PAN an unanticipated opportunity. If concerns raised during the campaign about corruption and the re-establishment of PRI hegemony hold true, the PAN may be able to reassemble a working coalition, recapture its democratic credentials and mount a campaign based on broad regime critiques rather than social policy positions or a perhaps-unwinnable drug war. That, however, is merely a short-term strategy; to enjoy long-term success the PAN must somehow reconcile the competing internal interests it developed during the moderating years of the transition period.</p>

<p>It may also be important to recognize some party-system relativism here. Niche, religious and other immoderate parties may all be subject to the logic of inclusion and moderation, but that does not mean that religious parties are necessarily radical or extreme. In a highly secularized political system, however, they may, as Mexico’s PAN often did, occupy the ideological corners of the party system.</p>

<p>The non-excluded character of the PAN under PRI hegemony is one important difference between this case and others considered under the Inclusion–Moderation thesis. However, as will become clear later, the PAN did moderate in response to later inclusionary reforms.</p>

<p>Several ‘satellite’ parties that revolved around the PRI held registries throughout this period. They typically endorsed the PRI’s presidential candidate and nominated their own congressional ones. The PRI’s implicit support enabled them to retain their registries and allowed the PRI to maintain the illusion of contestation for power during the 1950s, 1960s and most of the 1970s. Maps about PAN vote-share were generated by me from data presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354068812472571">Díaz Cayeros and Martínez (1999</xref>). </p>

<p>This reform also fixed, for the first time, the number of majority seats in the Chamber of Deputies at 300. Prior to this reform, districts were based on demographics, and as a result the size of the legislature varied. In 1976, just prior to the reform, there were 178 seats in the Chamber.

<p>Thirty-two PR senate seats were also created in the 1996 electoral reform. There is a single national district for this group of seats. It brought the number of Senate seats to 128. By this time, there were also 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, 300 filled through single-member districts and 200 through proportional representation across five electoral districts. ‘Minority senators’ were created through an electoral reform in the early 1990s, which compelled senate candidates to compete on party-based two-person tickets. Both of the members of the top vote-getting ticket gained office, as did the first member of the second-place ticket.</p>

<p>Parties may be able to win elections despite these organizational deficits, of course. In 2010, PAN–PRD coalition candidates won the governorships of Puebla and Oaxaca, for example. However, it remains quite unclear whether either party will be able to hold on to that seat or perform well in these and other states where they have minimal presence.</p>
