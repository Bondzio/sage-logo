<sec id="sec13-0300060513480081"><title>Objective</title>
<p>To investigate the relationship between child and adolescent obesity, and parental weight status.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0300060513480081"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Height and weight were measured in Chinese children and adolescents aged 6–17 years old. Information was collected concerning parental weight and height, and possible covariates, using a questionnaire. The body mass index (BMI) of each study participant and their parents was calculated. On the basis of the BMI, parents were categorized as normal, overweight or obese, and children and adolescents were categorized as normal or obese.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0300060513480081"><title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 5 041 participants included in the study, 6.82% were obese. Child or adolescent obesity was significantly associated with parental obesity. When both parents were obese, there was a 3.62-fold increased risk of obesity compared with those whose parents were of normal weight. Obesity in fathers was associated with a heightened risk of obesity in female children, whereas obesity in mothers was associated with a heightened risk of obesity in male children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0300060513480081"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Parental obesity was a predictor of obesity in children and adolescents. It is therefore of key importance to prevent obesity in children who have one or more obese parents.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0300060513480081" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Obesity among children and adolescents is a major public health problem that is growing in magnitude worldwide and which has reached epidemic proportions in recent years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300060513480081">1</xref></sup> Although health problems associated with obesity are less common in childhood, children who continue to be overweight into adulthood are more likely to develop numerous associated complications, compared with children who continue to be of normal weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300060513480081">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300060513480081">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a key aspect of the family context, parental weight status has been shown to be an important predictor for the development of obesity in children and adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300060513480081">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300060513480081"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300060513480081">6</xref></sup> However, the relative contribution of parental weight status is still controversial.</p>
<p>The present study was a large-scale cross-sectional epidemiological survey to investigate the potential relationship between parental weight status and obesity in children and adolescents (6–17 years old) residing in rural North China. Other potentially interacting or confounding sociological and demographic variables were also investigated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0300060513480081" sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects and methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-0300060513480081"><title>Study population</title>
<p>Chinese children and adolescents (age range, 6–17 years) were recruited from 12 schools in rural areas of Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China, between July 2010 and January 2011.</p>
<p>Written informed consent was obtained from the parents or legal guardians of the participants. The study protocol was approved by the Committee on Human Experimentation of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0300060513480081"><title>Parental weight status</title>
<p>Information on the weight and height of each study participant’s mother and father was provided from a questionnaire completed by the parents. The body mass index (BMI) was calculated and was used to categorize parental weight status as normal (BMI &lt; 24), overweight (24 ≤ BMI &lt; 28) or obese (BMI ≥ 28).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300060513480081">7</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0300060513480081"><title>Child and adolescent weight status</title>
<p>Height and body weight were measured by trained personnel using standard protocols; study participants were barefoot and wore only light underclothes. Height was measured using a portable stadiometer and was rounded to the nearest 0.5 cm. Body weight was measured using a professional scale and was rounded to the nearest 100 g.</p>
<p>Participants were categorized as obese or not obese, on the basis of the recommended cut-off values for the child or adolescent’s age and sex, as reported by Cole et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300060513480081">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0300060513480081"><title>Covariates</title>
<p>Information concerning potentially interacting or confounding covariates was collected in the parental questionnaire, including the age, sex and race of the child or adolescent, the parents’ educational status and the number of people in the house.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300060513480081">9</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0300060513480081"><title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>The χ<sup>2</sup>-test was used to evaluate differences in the percentage of obese children and adolescents according to parental weight status. Logistic regression models, using parental weight status as the independent variable (model 1) and with added covariates of age, sex, parents’ education level, number of people in the house and ethnicity (model 2) were created; odds ratios for obesity in children or adolescents were calculated. In addition, the dependent variable in model 1 was adjusted for the sex of the child or adolescent. A <italic>P</italic>-value of &lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS® software, version 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0300060513480081" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 5 665 Chinese children and adolescents aged 6–17 years old were recruited to the study. The final study population consisted of 5 041 participants (2672 males; 2369 females), giving a response rate of 89%. The mean ± SD age of the male study participants was 10.92 ± 2.67 years and that of the female study participants was 10.88 ± 2.70. Participants with incomplete data were excluded from the study.</p>
<sec id="sec9-0300060513480081"><title>Parental weight status and child and adolescent obesity</title>
<p>A total of 344 children or adolescents were found to be obese, giving an overall prevalence rate of 6.82%. The prevalence of child and adolescent obesity according to paternal and maternal weight status is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0300060513480081">Table 1</xref>. Overweight and obese parental weight statuses were both associated with a significantly higher prevalence of child and adolescent obesity (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). There was also a significant increase in the prevalence of obesity, with an increase in the number of parents affected by obesity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0300060513480081">Table 2</xref>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).

<p>In the present cross-sectional study, the overall child and adolescent obesity rate was high, at 6.82%, and was shown to increase significantly with increased parental weight status. The obesity rate in children and adolescents whose parents were both obese (21.95%) was 3.62 times the rate compared with children and adolescents whose parents were of normal weight (6.07%). Furthermore, the obesity rate of children and adolescents had a significant association with the obesity rate of their parents (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). These results suggest that obesity in parents has an important influence on children’s BMI. Even unilateral obesity in parents was associated with an increase in child and adolescent obesity; however, maternal obesity was shown to be more of a risk factor than paternal obesity.</p>
<p>A number of studies have shown that childhood and adolescent obesity has an obvious familial aggregation, which is a result of the interaction of genetic and environmental factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300060513480081">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300060513480081"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300060513480081">12</xref></sup> Obese parents, either through genes or sharing the same environment with children, can increase the risk of child or adolescent obesity. For young children, daily energy consumption depends to a large extent on their parents. In addition, children imitate others; thus, parental eating habits and lifestyle have a great influence on children’s behaviours. Unhealthy parental eating habits (such as the consumption of sweet, fried and fast foods), or bad lifestyle habits (such as lack of exercise and prolonged television watching) can lead to obesity in both themselves and their children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300060513480081">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300060513480081"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300060513480081">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, maternal weight status had a stronger influence on obesity prevalence in children and adolescents than paternal weight status. This may be due to mothers being more involved with activities such as food choice and preparation. It has been reported that the diet of children is more similar to their mother’s diet than to their father’s diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300060513480081">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300060513480081"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300060513480081">15</xref></sup> In the present study, obesity in male children or adolescents was more strongly correlated with maternal weight status than with paternal weight status. Conversely, obesity in female children or adolescents was more strongly correlated with paternal weight status than with maternal weight status. This suggests that obese fathers had a greater impact on their female children, whereas obese mothers had a greater effect on their male children.</p>
<p>Improvements in social environments, and changes to the type of food available, have been associated with obesity becoming a serious public health problem in many countries. Research shows that, although there are short-term consequences of adolescent obesity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300060513480081">16</xref></sup> the greatest risk is related to the significant association with adult obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300060513480081">17</xref></sup> Obese adolescents have a higher than normal risk of metabolic disorders, diabetes and hypertension, compared with adolescents of normal weight, and this risk increases as they develop into obese adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300060513480081">18</xref></sup> Early intervention and control of adolescent obesity could prevent adult obesity and its associated complications.</p>
<p>The use of BMI to assess parental weight status may be a limitation of the present study, as the BMI does not always reflect a person’s body fat percentage and does not take into account waistline circumference. According to the 2004 guidelines for the prevention and control of overweight and obesity in Chinese adults,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300060513480081">7</xref></sup> a BMI ≥ 24 is designated overweight and a BMI ≥ 28 is designated obese, but in addition a male waist circumference ≥85 cm or a female waist circumference ≥80 cm should be considered obese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300060513480081">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated a significant association between child or adolescent obesity and parental obesity, showing that obesity in parents is an important risk factor for obesity in children or adolescents. The World Health Organization has repeatedly proposed that it is not sufficient to simply intervene in the lives of overweight or obese adolescents in order to reduce the adolescent obesity rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300060513480081">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300060513480081"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0300060513480081">21</xref></sup> The present study results suggest that overweight parents, or obese children or adolescents, should not be seen in isolation as the major target population for preventing obesity. Instead, children and adolescents and their parents should be encouraged to join together, to improve the eating habits and lifestyle of the entire family.</p>
