<p>Editor’s Note:</p>
<p>This piece by Hal Rainey continues our ongoing discussion generated by David Kasdan in our July 2012 issue. Our next issue will include a rejoinder by Dr. Kasdan to the many comments scholars have made over the past several months regarding his provocative update to Frank Sherwood’s survey of the “Great Books” of Public Administration.</p>
<p>David Kasdan invited Waldo Award winners, journal editors, and frequent book reviewers to nominate the most influential book in public administration during 1990 to 2010. Osborne and Gaebler’s <italic>Reinventing Government</italic> (hereafter, O&amp;G) received the most nominations. <italic>Understanding and Managing Public Organizations</italic> (hereafter, UMPO), by the present author, got the second most nominations (or apparently did—read on). This response to an invitation to comment on this nominating process considers some of its implications for scholarship, education, and practice in public administration.</p>
<p>The comments here will not adopt a triumphal tone. While the status of <italic>second-most-nominated</italic> is gratifying, some characteristics of the nominating process have to be considered. In addition, as proud as this author is of this second-ranked book, as discussed below, it has faced challenges that reflect general challenges for the field.</p>
<p>As for the nominating procedure, Kasdan reports that 18 people responded, out of 30 queried. He says that several respondents contended that journal articles play a stronger role than books in influencing the field. Kasdan lists five books that received at least two nominations, and says he broke ties by checking the citation rates for the books. This means that <italic>UMPO</italic> may have ranked second due to receiving three nominations, or it may have received only two and reached the second spot due to having more citations than another book—See the point above about a nontriumphal tone! I decided not to email Kasdan to ask him for the number of nominations each book received. This selection process is in keeping with the title of this section of <italic>Administration &amp; Society</italic>, in that it is infinitely disputable. Pressing for details about the number of nominations for each book appears to be an exercise in misplaced and inappropriate precision.</p>
<p>In responding to Kasdan’s request, I first nominated O&amp;G. So did others, obviously, since it came in first. I must also admit that for my second choice, I nominated my own book <italic>UMPO</italic> for reasons discussed below. Thus, <italic>UMPO</italic> may have ranked second because of only two nominations other than the author’s touting of his own baby magpie. Absent this <italic>author’s</italic> self-aggrandizement, <italic>UMPO</italic> may have fallen back into the pack with only two nominations. (This possibility assumes that other Waldo winners and journal editors did not nominate their own books). As noted above, the author of <italic>UMPO</italic>, in an uncharacteristic lapse into magnanimity, also nominated O&amp;G. Who knows if this acknowledgment of <italic>O&amp;G</italic> knocked <italic>UMPO</italic> out of the top spot, or at least a tie for it, and deprived <italic>UMPO’</italic>s author of the intensely coveted accolade of most influential book writer, 1990 to 2010 division? Whether its author penalized <italic>UMPO</italic> out of the winner’s circle, or selfishly pushed <italic>UMPO</italic> into second place when it deserved lower ranking, will likely not serve as a controversial topic in sports bars and seminar rooms around the nation. Whatever the validity of the win and place status of the two books, however, their ranking invites comparisons of them.</p>
<p>Professor Kasdan offered observations relevant to the comparison. He recounts the panelists’ harsh criticisms of <italic>O&amp;G</italic>, as well as those of published reviews of the book. They condemned it as a popularized, glib, unoriginal, unscholarly description of 10 different examples of how government reformers can reform government. He then turned brief attention to the “next most influential” books on the list, <italic>UMPO</italic> and Richard Stillman’s <italic>Preface to Public Administration.</italic> Kasdan observed that <italic>UMPO</italic> is “geared toward the practical and instructional side of the field” and that Professor Stillman’s book “offers more of a theory perspective for public administration.” Kasdan notes that both these books are authored by academics and hence represent a “tip of the hat to ‘serious’ public administration scholarship.”</p>
<p>Please let me extend those observations and beg to differ on certain points relevant to the field. As did others, I nominated <italic>O&amp;G</italic> because it is clearly the most influential book in public administration in the last 20 years, based on important (and infinitely disputable) criteria. It received more attention from more academics and practitioners than any other book in the field during the period. It influenced reform initiatives at all levels of government, most notably the <italic>National Performance Review</italic> led by Vice President Gore during the Clinton administration. Given the criticisms of the book noted above, however, we might be able to go to Google Scholar and check citation rates, and show how much more influential have been the books which, in horseracing parlance, came in “place” and “show” (i.e., <italic>UMPO</italic> and Stillman’s book). As of October 8, 2012, Google Scholar lists 1,248 citations of <italic>UMPO</italic>—Pretty good? As of that date, Google Scholars lists 8,817 citations for O&amp;G—Ouch! As for the authors of the other books on the list of five, their citation rates suggest that they should stay out of this. It is painful enough for one of us to take a citation drubbing. And if this is not enough of a damper on triumphalism, check the citation rate for the winner of the Sherwood’s previous survey. Herbert Simon’s <italic>Administrative Behavior</italic> has been cited 15,414 times. On the bright side, at current citation rates in a few more years, <italic>UMPO</italic> will be nearly one tenth of the way toward Simon’s rate.</p>
<p>Every scholar knows the limitations of citation rates, especially in cases where someone else’s rates are higher than one’s own (e.g., “a mere textbook!”), so there are other important considerations besides citations. As Kasdan and many others have noted, <italic>O&amp;G</italic> was not a scholarly book, of any particular significance to research and theory development. It described 10 approaches to reinventing government, including market-driven government, results-oriented government, and others. The evidence in support of these prescriptive assertions included examples of situations in which government organizations and people in them were doing these things. Notwithstanding the irony that <italic>O&amp;G</italic> recommended reinventing government by doing more of what people in government were already doing, the book is stimulating, lively, encouraging, optimistic, supportive ultimately of the crucial role of good government, and full of ideas for those who care about good government to put into practice—or try to, that is. As noted above, critics raised plenty of doubt about the value of the advice in <italic>O&amp;G</italic>. In spite of these barbs, this important, constructive book stands clearly as the most influential, in attracting readers, and through the provision of influential ideas for improving government.</p>
<p>But, does <italic>O&amp;G</italic> really provide what practitioners and students need to know? Critics have obviously said no. Countervailing opinions, however, suggest that it does a better job than an alternative approach that <italic>UMPO</italic> represents. To ponder the question, <italic>UMPO’s</italic> author must drag the reader through some of the history of <italic>UMPO</italic>, and its travails and triumphs—Well, okay, maybe not triumphs but some good stuff. As evident by now, <italic>UMPO’s</italic> author attempts to engage in self-deprecating humor. In this self-deprecating mode, the author has sometimes jokingly described <italic>UMPO’s</italic> origins as a schizophrenic undertaking. Jossey-Bass, Publishers, Inc. (now a John Wiley imprint) in the early 1990s emphasized publishing books of value to practitioners in various professional fields, including public administration. Their editors wanted a book about public sector organizations and management that would be practitioner friendly. <italic>UMPO</italic>’S author wanted to write a scholarly book, compiling and integrating research and theory relevant to public organizations and management. We both sought a book that would sell in academic courses, probably at the graduate level in master of public administration (MPA) programs. We thus shared the multiple goals of producing a good book that would serve the academics, the practitioners, the students, and the field in general. Did we? We will return to that question below.</p>
<p>I nominated <italic>UMPO</italic> in part because I was not sure what the process would involve. If there was commentary and then voting, it would be interesting to see what happened. I thought the book deserved at least to be considered, given such indicators as the citation rate and healthy sales for graduate courses. It seemed possible that the book would be bounced out like a bad check in voting about influence on public administration. The book is more about organization theory and organizational behavior than the more general topic of public administration. In fact, each of the other valuable books on Kasdan’s final list focuses more on the topic of public administration than does <italic>UMPO.</italic></p>
<p>A more important reason to nominate <italic>UMPO</italic> was that the book represents the work of many researchers besides the author. The book attempts to integrate many studies about topics in organization theory and management as they apply to public organizations. The book addresses a fundamental question of theoretical and practical significance: Can we identify a category, public organizations, and show that they have distinctive characteristics relevant to their management and operations? An elaborate body of theory and research analyzes organizations and the people in them. Sociologists, psychologists, and business management researchers developed this topic, with contributions by economists and political scientists. Much of this work implies or aggressively asserts that distinctions between public and private organizations or for-profit and nonprofit organizations explain very little. <italic>UMPO</italic> accepts this “generic” assumption for the most part. The book presents a fairly standard coverage of the major topics in organization theory. These include organizational environments, goals and effectiveness, structure and design, motivation and work-related attitudes, leadership, groups and teams, and other topics. The book also presents, however, the theory and concepts that identify a distinctive category of public organizations. Then, does this public status have implications for the topics just listed? What is the evidence for such implications?</p>
<p>To consider the evidence, the book draws on studies by numerous researchers. Many of them represent an elaborate and growing body of research on what many of us now call “public management” as reflected, for example, in the Public Management Research Association and the Public Management Research Conference. These researchers are the ones to whom I refer above when I suggest that this is not just about me.</p>
<p><italic>UMPO</italic> thus takes an approach very different from <italic>O&amp;</italic>G to trying to meet academic, student, and practitioner needs, and raises the question of how well <italic>UMPO</italic> serves these needs. As mentioned above, Professor Kasdan characterized <italic>UMPO</italic> as concerned with the practical and instructional aspects of public administration. Some colleagues have indicated that they do not think it does a good job of meeting practical and instructional needs. Any book is subject to anonymous peer reviews that the publisher engages, book reviews in professional journals, and more informal reviews in the form of comments from colleagues, students, and others. The first edition of the book was the subject of four or five very favorable reviews in journals. At least one of those reviewers mentioned that very few practitioners would value the review of theory and research that the book provided. Some of the anonymous reviewers of the first four editions expressed a similar view. A bit defensively, I wrote in the preface of the third edition that I felt that this view of practitioners’ inclinations underestimated them. Some of the most thoughtful students in our MPA courses are practitioners, and they often show an interest in theory and research. Practitioners spend their workdays on strategy, decision making, organizational change, motivating, leading, and other topics covered in the book. One might think they would appreciate a review of the background theory, research, and thought on such topics. The implication of some of the reviewers’ comments, however, is that practitioners much prefer the <italic>O&amp;G</italic> treatment. This leads to the disputable proposition that many academics in public administration appear to accept: Practitioners prefer very readable, entertaining, aphoristic, prescriptive material over reviews of theory, research, and abstract thought about topics in public administration.</p>
<p>Over the four editions, reactions to <italic>UMPO</italic> as an instructional text raised a similar issue about students, especially MPA students. At professional conferences, colleagues and friends have said that they discontinued the book because some MPA students did not like the reviews of research and theory and did not see the need for all the citations to the literature; they did not find the book enjoyable to read. Anonymous reviewers for a fifth edition now in preparation advanced similar concerns. The apparent consensus is that many MPA students like the book, but many others do not; doctoral students and faculty members appreciate the compilation of literature and theory, and the book is more useful to them than to MPA students.</p>
<p>One interpretation of these developments is that the book needs a more reader-friendly presentation. Even so, one wonders how a law professor teaching a course on torts and contracts, or an accounting professor, or a professor teaching organic chemistry would react to student comments that the reading materials for the course are no fun to read. Should reading materials in MPA courses in our field tend in the <italic>O&amp;G</italic> direction, toward entertaining, highly prescriptive discussions that avoid too much information intensity? How much should we ask our practice-oriented students to familiarize themselves with the theoretical and research background for the topics that will figure importantly in their practice, and with the complexities and limitations of the research and theory as opposed to Zen-like aphorisms and highly prescriptive, even if loosely substantiated, advice?</p>
<p>One expresses appreciation for David Kasdan’s contribution by noting that the matters discussed here only begin to address the many issues and controversies his effort can invoke. Regardless of the rankings of books and other resources, we all benefit from continuing conversation and controversy about how to serve the academics, practitioners, and students.</p>
