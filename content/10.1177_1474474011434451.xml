<p>In <italic>Wired for War</italic>, PW Singer presents a wide-reaching consideration of the past, present, and future of robotics in warfare. With the increasing application of unmanned robotic systems in warfare – such as Predator drone aircraft – geographies of war must now attend to a whole new class of cultural productions: the actions of robots.</p>
<p>By 2008 the US had deployed at least 22 different robotic systems on the ground in Iraq, with individual robots numbering into the tens of thousands. These vary from lawnmower-sized units equipped with high-resolution, multispectrum cameras for reconnaissance to larger and more lethal rovers rigged with M-16 rifles, machine guns, grenades, or antitank rockets. With sea and air-based robotic systems also very much in the mix, Singer offers a strong case that the ongoing shift to robotics is a revolutionary change that will restructure military geographies, transform how we fight wars, and fundamentally blur conceptions of what it means to be a soldier.</p>
<p>Singer initially comes across as a giddy aficionado of military robots, declaring in his opening sentence that, ‘robots are frakin’ cool’. <italic>Wired for War</italic> wobbles at times with a glib tone – presumably to engage a popular audience – yet Singer also grapples in earnest with a set of profoundly important questions: Will robotics make us more likely to go to war or help humanity achieve a lasting peace? Does the use of robotic warriors lend itself to military engagements that are in some ways cleaner, stripped of human vengeance and retributional rampages, or do robots simply lower the threshold for combat and make it easier and more asymmetrically devastating? How will robotics change the fundamental character of warfare and the military, and where wars occur?</p>
<p>The use of Predator drones highlights a number of these questions. Many Predator attacks in Afghanistan and Iraq are ‘piloted’ by office cubicle-bound operators stationed on the outskirts of Las Vegas, Nevada. What Singer casts as a video-game style of warfare challenges existing rules of military engagement and dangerously broadens the geography of war. Operators of joystick-controlled airstrikes can finish their lethal morning shift and head out to coach an afternoon Little League game or catch a Vegas show that evening. But what are we to make of these remote control warriors? Are they legitimate wartime targets, enemy combatants, or just part-time actors in a distant conflict? The rules blur for the unmanned aircraft as well: a fighter pilot can fire in self-defense when targeted by enemy radar, but should these same principles apply to drone aircraft? If so, as the US air force contends, have we granted rights to robotic systems matching those accorded people?</p>
<p>Unmanned and robotic systems may seem to present clear savings of ‘blood and treasure’ to technologically advanced militaries. As Singer writes, ‘They are the ultimate means of avoiding sacrifice’ (p. 312). And yet, the use of such systems may also reveal our own fear, rather than just inspire it in our enemies, thereby spurring ever more determined attacks against human targets where these exist. Singer establishes convincingly that our ability to create and deploy military robotic systems has rapidly outpaced our understanding of this change. The longer we fail to plan for the many ethical, legal, and strategic implications of sending robots to war, the more aggressively we may need to extend cultural geographies to include what has never actually been human.</p>
