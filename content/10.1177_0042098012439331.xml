<p>Scholars and urban planners have long been occupied with the movements of people into, through and out of Africa’s cities. Depending on one’s perspective and theoretical leanings, the permanent settlement of rural Africans in the continent’s urban centres reflects everything from progress and modernisation to tragic social and geographical dislocation at the hand of ascendant capitalists. Conversely, the ‘incomplete’ urbanisation of Africa’s poor—marked by ongoing financial and social connections with ‘home’ and the possibility of regular or permanent return—reflects countries’ (and urban planners’) inability to provide stable jobs, services and housing for their citizens. Faced with these apparent shortcomings, city officials have struggled to come to terms with such ongoing mobility. How can relatively poor local officials plan for a population that will not stay put? And if they do so successfully, will they only further swell the ranks of the urban poor? By levying evidence from decades of work in Zimbabwe and examples from across sub-Saharan Africa, Potts takes these perspectives head on.</p>
<p>By removing the analysis of circular migration from meta narratives about modernisation, class formation, global capitalist exploitation and immediate planning challenges, Potts’ book allows us to see circular migration for what it really is: a central, rational and not particularly threatening adaptation to Africa’s economic realities. In doing so, she highlights the interplay between residents to seek a combination of profit, economic or physical protection and passage as they make their way into southern African cities. If nothing else, we see how difficult these trends are to identify empirically and how they are almost impossible to respond to proactively in practical or policy terms. While domestic migration remains an important factor, international migration—the focus of much of the global literature on migration and development—appears as a relatively minor concern.</p>
<p>When it comes to city planning, it matters less why people are moving than what they are doing while they are in town. Here, we learn that we can not assume that people in African cities are necessarily exclusive urban residents, nor are they merely passing through. This recognition demands a shift in the way we conceptualise cities—or at least how African urban planners conceptualise them. Rather than rural–urban dualism, Potts argues that the two ‘zones’ are closely linked, if not always by geography, then by people who negotiate their ways in multiple spaces. Circular migration in its various manifestations is a central part of how this works. These ongoing connections—financial and social—also blur the analytical boundaries between city and rural, undermining classic modernisation perspectives while demanding that urban analysts pay more attention to events, activities and affiliations beyond the urban edge.</p>
<p>Whereas many feared that rural economic collapse would swell African cities, it appears that the economic insecurity brought about by structural adjustment processes and other forms of economic shock has strengthened a sense of ‘home’ and thus the centrality of circular migration. Against expectations, rather than ringing Malthusian alarms of an influx of rural poor, the book should assuage urban planners’ fears with claims that urbanisation is slowing; what growth is happening is due more to fertility and longer life-spans than new arrivals.</p>
<p>As a careful examination of ties between human mobility and Harare’s post-1980 urban transformation, this book is an undeniable success. Its internal chapters reflect Potts’ deep knowledge of the city (and of Zimbabwe more generally) and present an almost bewildering array of primary and secondary data. As a collection of the author’s cumulative work—often done in collaboration with local partners—and a consolidated account of the city, this book is a reference point for Zimbabweanists for years to come. It should also serve as the empirical basis for further theorisation around the meaning of urban citizenship, the importance of demographic variables in popular protest and democratisation, and Harare’s productive possibilities. Potts hints at these themes, but there is far more that can be done.</p>
<p>When measured against its own ambitions, the book’s success is far less certain. Rather than an account of Harare’s population dynamics, Potts has framed the text as an assault on ‘African internal migration theory’. For many readers—particularly urbanists—the debates she outlines will seem drawn from an intellectual backwater populated largely by demographers. That many of the debates over migration patterns she cites are rooted in 1970s literature prematurely ages what should be an exciting and current text. Indeed, many of her conclusions about broader patterns of migration and urbanisation will come as little surprise to anyone who has thought seriously about African urbanism in the past 20 years.</p>
<p>The book’s inability to fulfil its own ambitions is rooted in the breadth of the claims—about migration in Africa—and the narrowness of the data and analysis. Potts never adequately justifies how a detailed account of Harare helps to make claims about Africa’s changing migration landscape. While Harare’s experience undoubtedly blends elements of the migration and urbanisation stories from elsewhere—failing rural economies; underpaced urban job creation; displacement and persecution—Zimbabwe is nonetheless somewhat exceptional for bringing them all together in such a short space of time and to such extremes. Hence, the text slips somewhat uncomfortably between different levels of generalisation, doing little to highlight what is so unusual (and by that I mean interesting) about Zimbabwe or suggesting that urbanisation elsewhere, in some of the much older and established West African cities, for example, may follow similar or different patterns. Even when narrowing the scope to Zimbabwe, she falters by treating Harare as a metonym for urbanisation writ large. Increasing evidence from across the continent suggests that what happens in primary or capital cities is not the sum total of urbanisation trends: the fastest urban growth rates are no longer in the primary cities, but in peri-urban areas (often outside main city boundaries) or in secondary cities. These kinds of pattern are almost completely absent from Potts’ review or her conclusions.</p>
<p>Beyond its evidence and analysis, the writing itself is somewhat tortured—filled with archaic phrasing and a heavy reliance on the passive tense. The book’s dense and small typeset assaults the eye in ways that will dissuade all but the most dedicated fan from reading further. The graphs and charts—seemingly assembled on a basic word processing programme—add to the book’s uninviting aesthetics.</p>
<p>As it stands, Potts’ book is an uncomfortable blend of the general and the specific. As a text on African migration and, particularly, circular migration, it falters. The points made here would be better suited to a review article or textbook chapter. Unfortunately, in framing the book as one about African migration, Potts distracts us from the more valuable chapters on Harare’s changing population dynamics. These offer important empirical material even if it is underanalysed and undersold. Rather than a book aimed at stale debates about human mobility, a text half as long that was built firmly on the author’s expertise on Zimbabwe’s planning modalities and political perceptions would have made a stronger and more enduring contribution.</p>
