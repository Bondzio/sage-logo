         <abstract>
            <p>The curiosity and the natural tendency to explore the environment put young children at an increased risk of poisoning over older children and adults. Poisonings are a significant area of concern from 1 year of age and progressively contribute more to overall rates of morbidity and mortality until children reach adulthood. Particularly, the abuse of children by poisoning is also highly common with thousands of fatalities. A practical strategy is presented that aims to alert health, forensic, and law enforcement professionals to this problem and to demystify the preconception that it is a rare form of abuse or neglect. Compounds that are foreign to a living organism (xenobiotics) and those present within body (endobiotics), mainly involved in children intoxications and contextual examples related to exposure are also reviewed. Particular concern is given to concepts in the field of children poisoning. The described history and the clinical and toxicological evaluation are discussed, and harmonized protocols regarding correct procedures for sample collection to forensic toxicological analysis are proposed. Since children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of high doses of xenobiotics and endobiotics, special consideration on the preparation of the environment that surrounds children in order minimize all possible risks will be also considered.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Childhood harm is a growing global health problem according to World Health Organization, with hundreds of thousands of children dying every year and millions of others suffer the consequences of nonfatal injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-1524838012470033">Sethi, Towner, Vincenten, Segui-Gomez, &amp; Racioppi, 2008</xref>). The leading unintentional mechanisms of fatal lesions in children are road traffic crashes, drowning, poisoning, thermal injuries, and falls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-1524838012470033">Sethi et al., 2008</xref>). In the European Union of 27 member states (EU27), over 52,000 children less than 20 years old die each year, with poisonings representing the fifth leading cause of unintentional death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1524838012470033">MacKay &amp; Vincenten, 2009</xref>). Inequality is substantial in the EU27 both between countries and within countries. The countries with low- and middle-income countries are at increased risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1524838012470033">MacKay &amp; Vincenten, 2009</xref>). In addition, the home is the most common setting for poisoning where children easily have access to compounds (stored in nonchild-proof containers), which are either foreign to a living organism (xenobiotics [XBs]) or that are normally present within body (endobiotics [EBs]). In the EU27, pesticides, drugs, household products, and plants cause the most cases of fatal poisoning, and acute intoxication with alcohol is a growing concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-1524838012470033">Sethi et al., 2008</xref>). In a recent report from American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524838012470033">Bronstein et al., 2010</xref>), children younger than 3 years old represented 38.9% of XB exposures and children younger than 6 and 19 years old accounted for 51.9% and 65% of all human exposures, respectively. A male predominance was found among cases involving children younger than 13 years old, but this gender distribution was reversed in teenagers and adults, with females comprising the majority of reported exposures. Unintentional and intentional intoxications in children younger than 19 years old were almost 92% and 6% of the reported cases, respectively. In another study, children of 1 year of age had the highest incidence of unintentional poisonings, with medicines being the number one among all age groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-1524838012470033">Vilke et al., 2011</xref>). In 2010, the Portuguese Poison Center (CIAV) described 9,250 (less than 15 years old) and 964 (between 15 and 19 years old) poisonings in children. More than 65% of the cases were children from 1 to 4 years old. On average, CIAV received 77 calls per day related to children poisonings, the majority of them occurring between 6 p.m. and 11 p.m., period that children are normally at home with easy access to all the type of XBs, namely medicines. Children 6- to 12-year-old are less likely to ingest XBs. For children between 13 and 19 years of age, XB exposures are usually intentional, either as recreational abuse or as suicide attempt.</p>
         <p>Though the majority of poisonings in children are unintentional, the significant number of fatalities may represent clear cases of abuse or neglect. Indeed, recent studies show an average of 160 malicious poisonings per year reported to poison control centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-1524838012470033">Yin, 2010</xref>). Historically, awareness of child abuse by poisonings was reported in the landmark article by Kempe, Silverman, Steele, Droegemueller, and Silver in 1962. Authors enumerating the various forms of child abuse observed that “in an occasional case the caregiver also may have assaulted the child by administering an overdose of a drug or by exposing the child to gas or other toxic substance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1524838012470033">Kempe et al., 1962</xref>). Apparently the authors first met a new form of abuse by administering XBs. Since then, sporadic reports have described cases of children who were chemically abused (a designation firstly introduced by Shnaps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-1524838012470033">Shnaps, Frand, Rotem, &amp; Tirosh, 1981</xref>) or neglected, but a review of clinical and forensic aspects has not been discussed in detail yet.</p>
         <p>Nowadays it is known that the exposure of children to XBs/EBs represents a common event with several legal implications. Not only XBs are normally involved, EBs, such as vitamins, salt, water, and so on, should be also considered. Paracelsus when inquiring about “what is there that is not poison?” realize that “all things are poison and nothing [is] without poison. Only the dose determines that a thing is not a poison and the right dose differentiates poison from a remedy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524838012470033">Deichmann, Henschler, Holmsted, &amp; Keil, 1986</xref>). Therefore, EBs can also be the cause of intoxications, particularly in children as will be discussed in the next sections.</p>
         <p>Since, children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of high doses of XBs/EBs, special considerations to safeguard their right to health and to a safe environment are mandatory. The need for integration of health professionals, managers, society, educative, and regulatory actions directed toward protection of the children are particularly relevant. Enhancing poisoning prevention by introducing a national law requiring child-resistant packaging of household cleaners/chemicals would be particularly useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1524838012470033">MacKay &amp; Vincenten, 2009</xref>). The mistreatment of children is one of the most striking dramas that affect the quality of life, with repercussions at several levels, namely in the construction of personality.</p>
         <p>This review/practical strategy aims to alert health, forensic, and law enforcement professionals to this problematic and to demystify the preconception that it is a rare form of abuse or neglect. Different contextual examples surrounding children unintentional or intentional poisonings are highlighted, and XBs and EBs mainly involved in children intoxications are also reviewed. Particular concern is given to the concepts in the field of children poisoning, since these are for several times erroneously used. For instance what is an abusive, neglect, or accidental intoxication in children?</p>

         <title>Method</title>
         <p>To achieve our goals, articles written in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese were searched in the National Library of Medicine’s PubMed MedLine database and the Web of Knowledge for different contextual examples surrounding children’s unintentional or intentional exposure to XBs/EBs. Having defined the most prevalent contexts, we searched for common XBs/EBs usually involved in these contextual examples, and we proposed specific measures to reduced children poisonings.</p>

      <sec id="section3-1524838012470033">
         <title>Types of Intoxications</title>
         <p>Two major types of intoxications can be considered: the intentional and unintentional. In the following topics these possibilities are discussed.</p>
         <sec id="section4-1524838012470033">
            <title>Unintentional or Nonvoluntary Intoxications</title>
            <p>Unintentional intoxication implies that intoxication was not voluntarily caused by caregivers or by the child. Nevertheless, caregivers may be responsible for creating or allowing unsafe conditions and improperly supervise the child playing field. This procedure may represent neglectful unintentional intoxications since it facilitates the child’s access to the XBs/EBs and consequently predispose to a greater risk. Accordingly, considering the variability of events, neglectful or nonneglectful unintentional intoxications could be distinguished.</p>
            <sec id="section5-1524838012470033">
               <title>Nonneglectful or noncriminal intoxications</title>
               <p>Nonneglectful or noncriminal intoxications are also commonly referred to as accidental and occur if there are no signs of neglect. Physicians, particularly pediatricians and specialists in forensic sciences, should be fully aware that even when adequate precautions and reasonable supervision are exercised by caregivers, children can still sometimes access XBs/EBs (“pica syndrome,” children put everything into their mouths) in their environment, and these cases cannot be directly associated with abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524838012470033">Dinis-Oliveira et al., 2006</xref>). In this sense, if a child is the victim of an accident of inevitable occurrence, then real accidents are always very rare, children being considered victims of neglect and not of accidental poisonings. Usually clinicians consider this possibility of “accidental” in a broader scope, limiting neglect to those cases with clear signs of insecurity or when repetitive situations are present. This makes sense, since the border between negligence and the accident is very faint and difficult to establish. On the other hand, some authors believe that all cases of poisoning always involve some degree of neglect and abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1524838012470033">Fischler, 1983</xref>). In Portugal, accordingly to most recent statistics of the Central Poison Center, most of the intoxications occur between 6 and 11 p.m., showing that the house is an unsafe environment. Vilke and coworkers showed that children of age 1 year had the highest incidence of unintentional poisonings, with medicines being the number one cause and also cosmetics and cleaning agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-1524838012470033">Vilke et al., 2011</xref>). Ensuring that the XBs/EBs are kept enclosed, inaccessible, appropriately labeled in their original container, and its opening is “child-proof,” are measures that are to and should be taken. However, it is necessary to consider that these child-proof containers are predesigned for children of a certain age. If supervision is not adequate, a child may (depending on their stage of development, age, etc.) be capable of removing this protection, and neglect in these cases are to and should be taken into consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1524838012470033">Paschall, 2005</xref>). The high incidence of hospitalizations of children 1–3 years old as consequence of intoxications corresponds to their intrinsic ability to explore their environment. Caregivers may underestimate their child’s capabilities and leave XBs within reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-1524838012470033">Vilke et al., 2011</xref>). Another new form of threat is due to the easily accessible alcohol-based hand sanitizers that have wide use in schools, hospitals, and workplaces and by consumers. Because of their wide availability and expectation of frequent use, it seems unlikely that child-resistant closures for this product will be mandated. As an example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1524838012470033">Engel and Spiller (2010</xref>) described a case of a 4-year-old girl brought to the emergency department with altered mental status after a history of ingesting an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Accidental poisoning can also occur when a child visits another house or there are home visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524838012470033">Bonkowsky et al., 2005</xref>) and the XBs/EBs may not be properly secured in child-proof containers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1524838012470033">Kupiec, Goldenring, &amp; Raj, 2004</xref>). The increased risk is the “mimicking” of adult behavior of taking medicines, like grandparents who come home with medications in nonchild-proof containers kept in their purses or luggage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-1524838012470033">Vilke et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="section6-1524838012470033">
               <title>Neglectful intoxications</title>
               <p>Neglectful intoxications occur when caregivers consider that risk practices, including bizarre and erratic behavior, as being normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1524838012470033">Paschall, 2005</xref>). Neglect is defined as the failure to meet child’s needs, in any field such as health, education, requirements for growth and development, shelter, environmental safety, comfort, and so on that under normal circumstances should be provided by caregivers. Acts and is normally punished by neglect the one that does not behave with precaution and that, under given circumstances, is obliged and capable of, and:</p>

                  <list-item>
                     <p>has conscious that a fact represents a crime but acts without complying with this achievement;</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                     <p>does not even get to represent the possibility of holding the event (unconscious).</p>
                  </list-item>
               </list>
               <p>These two brief legal criteria in themselves may not be enough to reach the threshold for a neglectful intoxication exposure to be considered. Indeed, the criterions are highly dependent on laws that often vary across countries and even within countries.</p>
               <p>Examples of neglectful intoxications are highlighted below:</p>
               <list list-type="alpha-lower">
                  <list-item>
                     <p>Typically they occur when children lives in environments with easy access to XBs/EBs, namely caustics, pharmaceuticals, pesticides in containers labeled for milk, juice, or other consumables. An example of the consequence of improperly stored pesticides was recently described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524838012470033">Chen and colleagues (2010</xref>) who documented fatal paraquat intoxication of an 8-year-old boy who ingested this herbicide kept in a soda bottle on a shelf for many years in parents’ garage.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                     <p>Places of production and/or consumption of drugs of abuse where not only the final product is accessible but also other XBs used in the chemical synthesis are also common examples. Indeed, methamphetamine, a synthetic drug of abuse, can be easily obtained, even at home, from licit drugs, namely ephedrine and pseudoephedrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1524838012470033">Farst et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1524838012470033">Kolecki, 1998</xref>). In the process of synthesis, acids and bases are used, and children living in these environments are at risk of poisoning mainly because these products can contaminate every surface, including cloths, skin, and toys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1524838012470033">Farst et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, supervisor’s addicts while under the influence of drugs of abuse (including ethanol) also somewhat exhibit erratic behaviors and are less vigilant thereby endangering the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1524838012470033">Hohman, Oliver, &amp; Wright, 2004</xref>). There is a clear association between physical abuse and neglect when caregivers are under the influence of drugs. XBs that cause drowsiness and impair concentration and attention can reduce levels of parental supervision, and hence putting children at risk of neglect not only of their immediate physical and emotional needs, such as meals and regular bedtime routines, but also for accidents, including unintentional poisoning, because of minimal supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1524838012470033">Palmiere, Staub, La Harpe, &amp; Mangin, 2010</xref>). Reports by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1524838012470033">Palmiere et al. (2010</xref>) illustrate these concerns. In one case, the child was left unattended at home while the mother went out to buy cocaine. The mother was arrested and did not mention the existence of the child, since she feared losing her parental rights. She mentioned that she had thought her boyfriend, a drug user like herself, was taking care of the child. Nobody attended to the child for days and the corpse was found in the apartment several days later. An autopsy was performed and toxicological analysis showed traces of cocaine and benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite) in the bile. High levels of cocaine and traces of 6-monoacetylmorphine were detected in hair, suggesting a repeated exposure to cocaine and to a lesser extent to heroin. In a second case described by the same research group, a child mistakenly received a methadone suppository by her father instead of an antipyretic one. The father, a former heroin addict, used to smoke cannabis daily, bought the methadone from the black market in a suppository form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1524838012470033">Palmiere et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

Although these caregiver’s actions may be well intentioned or “honest” mistakes, whether or not they constitute abuse is determined on a case-by-case basis, but this possibility should at least be considered by medical staff. A report from Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1524838012470033">Martos Sanchez et al., 2000</xref>) documented nonabusive salt ingestion in 2 girls of 7 and 20 months who had seizures and severe hypernatremia and unfortunately both died. The older girl was fed with yogurt on 2 occasions, by inadvertently adding salt instead of sugar.

                     <p>Errors in preparing infant formulas can also lead to nitrate poisoning and consequently to methemoglobinemia. Children younger than 6 months are particularly susceptible to nitrate-induced methemoglobinemia because of higher gastric pH, which allows greater bacterial invasion of the stomach and hence an enhanced conversion of ingested nitrate to nitrite, the relatively easy oxidation of fetal hemoglobin to methemoglobin comparatively to adult hemoglobin and immaturity of the methemoglobin reductase system, the enzyme that converts methemoglobin to hemoglobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1524838012470033">Fewtrell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1524838012470033">Greer &amp; Shannon, 2005</xref>).

                     <p>Other cases that may be classified as neglectful or not occur when the caregiver equivocates and administers medication that would be for another family member or mistakes in medication dose. Adverse effects and toxicity can occur when administering an XB that was prescribed for an adult or the dose was not adjusted taking into account the age, weight, body surface area, metabolic status, etc. Misunderstandings, illiteracy, and language barriers may lead to poisoning by the simple belief that “if a small amount of an XB is useful, larger quantities will be even better.” Poisoning can also result because of the many presentations of medicines, from syrups, drops, suppositories, tablets, granules, powders, and so on (as occurs for paracetamol), which can confuse caregivers simply because they have the same active ingredient in its formulation, although in different doses. An Australian group observed that dosing errors and inappropriate use of medicines lead to a large number of calls to poison centers as well as emergency hospital admissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1524838012470033">Halling, Fridh, &amp; Ovhed, 2006</xref>). Researchers were surprised when they observed that several caregivers thought that medicines must be safe because it is possible to buy them without prescription. Most parents are unaware of the side effects of over-the-counter medicines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524838012470033">Birchley &amp; Conroy, 2002</xref>) and medicines are used for inappropriate indications, including the use of paracetamol to sedate children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524838012470033">Allotey, Reidpath, &amp; Elisha, 2004</xref>). Since doses for children are often small, the risk of getting the measurement errors is greatly increased. Their study found that 15% of participants would give a medicine without taking their child’s temperature, and 55% would give medicine when the temperature was less than 38°C. Using domicile spoons to measure them out could mean a potentially dangerous overdose. Children less than 5 years old have been exposed to a top risk of random overdose.</p>

               <title>Caregiver psychopathology</title>
               <p>Examples include pediatric condition falsification (PCF), Münchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP), and a closely related factitious disorder by proxy (FDBP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1524838012470033">Paschall, 2005</xref>). PCF is a medical diagnosis made by the physician examining the child and focusing on the harm or potential harm to the victim. PCF occurs when the child is doubly abused/harmed by the caregiver and/or as consequence of the adopted medical therapeutics, possibly invasive diagnostic and surgical procedures, based on incorrect, incomplete, or false information provided by the caregiver. PCF occurs when the caregiver, usually the mother, repeatedly or not, produces (fabricate, simulate, invents) intentionally symptoms in their child, alters diagnostic and clinical samples, falsifies the history, denies, omits, or distorts the act of poisoning or actively causing the disease, putting the child at risk of life. Therefore, the child is erroneously considered ill and receives treatment, being also target of abuse by the physician. Facts reported range from “blood” in urine, “fever” (by heating a bulb thermometer) to episodes of “apnea” (by suffocation with a diaper). These simulations ultimately expose the child to physical suffering (e.g., blood sampling for unnecessary tests, forced use of drugs for various therapeutics) and psychological (e.g., numerous inquiries, unnecessary hospitalizations) and may even lead to death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524838012470033">Davis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1524838012470033">Guarnero, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1524838012470033">Meadow, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-1524838012470033">Vennemann et al., 2005</xref>). In classic forms, the attitude of simulating/producing the disease has no logical goal, seeming to be an intrinsic need or compulsion to assume the role of caregiver for a patient (by proxy) in order to satisfy the need to feel useful in health care (assuming the role of hero of the story). If the motif that moves the caregiver is to assume the role of a parent of sick children in order to receive psychological reward, PCF is therefore a component of what is considered to be MSBP. Cases of PCF without MSBP occur when the caregivers are delusional and sincerely believe that the child is suffering from a nonexistent medical condition. In addition, sometimes other motifs may be present such as the mother aims to gain some advantage for her and/or the child (e.g., to get attention of the husband/father; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1524838012470033">Libow &amp; Schreier, 1986</xref>), to receive economic reward by being eligible for financial assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524838012470033">Ayoub et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-1524838012470033">Schreier, 2002</xref>), and to move away from a house troubled by violence. There are also cases without delusion, which caregivers believe that the child is suffering from some disease and is not being treated properly. These parents may have a history in their own family or have knowledge from other sources of a child who suffered an adverse outcome or possible death because of the failure of the doctors to make the correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Sometimes this intent to receive doctor attention is referred in literature as “Doctor Shopping” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1524838012470033">Paschall, 2005</xref>). The excessively vigilant parent who frequents medical facilities for relatively minor concerns and is easily relieved by trusted health care professionals, requesting no or minimal diagnostic and therapeutic actions, does not meet the requisite criteria for FDBP/MSBP. The MSBP was first described in 1977 by Meadow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1524838012470033">Meadow, 1977</xref>).</p>
               <p>Besides the classical form of MSBP, in which one or more diseases are simulated, there is a form of MSBP by poisoning where the child is repeatedly intoxicated with XBs/EBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524838012470033">Aranibar &amp; Cerda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524838012470033">Carter, Izsak, &amp; Marlow, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1524838012470033">Holstege &amp; Dobmeier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-1524838012470033">Tamay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-1524838012470033">Tessa, Mascalchi, Matteucci, Gavazzi, &amp; Domenici, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr157-1524838012470033">Willis, Roper, &amp; Rabb, 2007</xref>), which represents one of the most common cause of factitious illness. The mother reports are largely based on lies and the combination of symptoms and signs are mostly unrelated. The behavior is considered compulsive in the sense that the person is unable to abstain even when knowing or advised of the risks. Although compulsive, acts are voluntary, conscious, deliberate, and premeditated. The disease is considered a serious personality disorder with a difficult treatment and prognosis. Unlike the classic abuse and violence against the children, mothers with MSBP are usually not violent or neglectful with their children. The XBs/EBs usually involved in this form of abuse are mainly the own child prescribed medication or even nonprescribed drugs or drugs intended for other patients. Anxiolytics, sedatives, hypnotics, cathartics, emetics, stimulants, drugs of abuse, drugs used for cardiovascular diseases, alcohol, analgesics, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants represent the most common cases. This form of abuse leads to various symptoms causing difficulty in diagnosis. Generally 18 to 24 months are needed to make a diagnosis, and it is unlikely that the diagnosis arises without a psychiatric evaluation of mother. This psychopathology includes multiple personality disorders including bipolar disorder, psychosis, attention deficits and hyperactivity, and psychological symptoms associated with severe allergies. The doctors should check for child medical records in other health units or evaluate whether entities with jurisdiction over children or organizations for the protection of children have previous reports of abuse by similar facts. MSBP is typically not diagnosed unless there is a high clinical index of suspicion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-1524838012470033">Tamay et al., 2007</xref>). Often, when the case is diagnosed, it is realized that there is a history with several years (with cases occurring mainly in children less than 2.5 years old) and the events, though abnormal, were not considered for possible of child abuse. There are numerous reasons for the delay in the correct diagnosis:</p>
               <p>a) Symptoms are difficult to understand and identify since in most cases symptoms are not notorious internal and external signs of injury, which contrast with the classical forms of physical abuse, where the signs are most often easily observable, facilitating the documentation of findings by narration, photographs, and diagrams. Exceptions to this generalization are cases of forced ingestion of caustic substances. One of the most prevalent “symptoms” is that the child becomes ill in the presence of the mother. This “symptom” is particularly difficult to identify since hospital staff trust the child’s mother, as nobody thinks that a mother would give harm to her child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-1524838012470033">Tamay et al., 2007</xref>). The re-abuse rate by poisoning is particularly high if the child is left unattended with the caregiver in the hospital or sent home in the care of the offending caregiver. It is possible that the same occurs when the victim is hospitalized, if the mother has access to the child. It is not a rare case when the mother takes advantage of an intravascular catheter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524838012470033">Blyth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1524838012470033">Feldman &amp; Hickman, 1998</xref>) or a feeding tube and continues to exploit this pathway to intoxicate the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524838012470033">Christ, 2000</xref>).

Videotape revealed her mother pumping air into the patient’s gastrostomy tube until the patient vomited and the same method was hypothesized to explain the persistent phenobarbital and carbamazepine toxicity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1524838012470033">Herman, Glass, and Howard (1997)</xref> reported a case of a 17-month-old child who had a gastrostomy tube placed for vomiting and failure to thrive. Her mother was caught using the tube to poison her with acetone. Lee, Lin, Lin, Hsia, and Wu (, 2010) described a very interesting clinical case of a healthy 5-year 6-month-old boy with recurrent organophosphate intoxication as a consequence of MSBP. Authors also evidenced the strategy to uncover this syndrome. Urine and blood samples were collected from the victim by physicians at the same time that another urine sample was obtained by the stepmother. Toxicological analyses of samples collected by physicians were positive for chlorpyrifos, while urine sample sent by the stepmother was negative. Therefore, medical staff contacted the public procurator for further investigation. Urine DNA analysis proved that the stepmother sent her own urine for toxicological analysis. She finally admitted to add pesticides to the previous drink and soup fed to the boy and to switching his urine samples for hers. The stepmother was charged by attempted murder under public prosecution, and the boy was taken care of by other family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1524838012470033">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). This unusual case demonstrates the value of perseverance in the clarification of an ill defined clinical problem. As previously mentioned, recovery periods coincide with the mother’s absence. However, these fluctuations in presence/absence of symptoms are rare because the psychopathology associated with the caregiver makes him or her to remain almost always near the child or absent only for brief periods. In the most serious situation, the child dies before FDBP/MSBP is recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-1524838012470033">Tamay et al., 2007</xref>). Usually the caregiver is a well-informed person in medical terms, with a concerned personality, typical of vigilant parents. This mother, at first sight, appears to be an excellent ally of the health professionals and easily gain admiration of the staff. Physicians do intensive workup for rare diseases with genuine desire to help the child, being away from the real diagnosis and facilitate the perpetrator’s manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1524838012470033">Hettler, 2002</xref>). Prolonged and multiple hospitalizations can cause complications such as nosocomial infections that can further confuse the medical staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-1524838012470033">Tamay et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
               <p>MSBP is therefore a form of child abuse that requires immediate investigation and treatment. The evaluation and the signalization of such form of abuse require a thorough understanding of the phenomenon and should be always considered when physicians are searching for a rare disease and whenever they are confronted with unusual and persistent or recurrent signs and symptoms in a child. An important review on this subject was given by several authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1524838012470033">Galvin, Newton, &amp; Vandeven, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-1524838012470033">Tamay et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

               <title>Drugs facilitate sexual abuse or assault</title>
               <p>Offenses are defined when victims are subjected to nonconsensual sexual acts while they are incapacitated or unconscious due to the effects of XBs/EBs and are therefore prevented from resisting or are unable to consent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1524838012470033">Hall &amp; Moore, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1524838012470033">Payne-James &amp; Rogers, 2002</xref>). Intentional poisoning to facilitate sexual abuse or assault differs from other types of intentional abuse because in most cases the abuser is not a relative or other person who has the custody of the victim. Usually this occurs at a family friend’s house, someone who takes care of the child, in a neighbor’s house, by a teacher, or even by a stranger. In the family, the father, the stepfather, brother, or any other male relative are the main parties responsible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1524838012470033">Spiller, Rogers, &amp; Sawyer, 2007</xref>). The most common intoxication is with sedative–hypnotics (benzodiazepines, particularly flunitrazepam; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-1524838012470033">Rickert &amp; Wiemann, 1998</xref>), antihistamines, ethanol, opioids, antidepressants, ketamine, amphetamines and derivatives, cocaine, γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1524838012470033">Li, Stokes, &amp; Woeckener, 1998</xref>), and cannabinoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524838012470033">Crawford, Wright, &amp; Birchmeier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1524838012470033">Elliott, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1524838012470033">Girard &amp; Senn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1524838012470033">Horvath &amp; Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1524838012470033">Hurley, Parker, &amp; Wells, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-1524838012470033">Wedin, Hornfeldt, &amp; Ylitalo, 2006</xref>). Because the majority of central nervous system depressants cause anterograde amnesia and because these XBs have short half-lives, it is clear that suspicions are late and the toxicological analyses are often negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1524838012470033">Hall &amp; Moore, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-1524838012470033">Scott-Ham &amp; Burton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-1524838012470033">Scott-Ham &amp; Burton, 2006</xref>). For instance, GHB acts synergistically with ethanol to produce CNS and respiratory depression. Being tasteless, colorless, and easily dissolved in water and alcohol, GHB can be easily concealed from a potential victim. GHB is rapidly absorbed, with onset of action occurring in 15 to 30 min and reaching peak in 20 to 60 min. The elimination half-life is about 30 min. These central nervous system depressants alter the victim’s capacity to consent or resist sexual abuse. Usually mixtures of XBs can be used, which is an additional problem since synergistic interaction between XBs may ensue largely exacerbating depressant effects and may even lead to death. All children suspected of having been raped or sexually abused should be asked for the possibility of having received ethanol or other beverages before sexual assault. The answer is not always accurate since the victim may have been at a party not authorized by the parents, consumed alcohol or other drugs of abuse, or be involved in behaviors considered inappropriate or immoral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1524838012470033">Paschall, 2005</xref>). Most of these cases are not reported because children are afraid to tell someone what happened to them. Confusion, altered consciousness, and amnesia may be present in a suspected scenario of sexual assault. It is estimated that its peak incidence is mostly present from 8 to 13 years of age. Females are most often the target for abusers, but sometimes the male is also the victim. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1524838012470033">Kintz, Villain, Cheze, and Pepin (2005</xref>) described alprazolam-positive hair samples of a 12-year-old girl. The drug was used repetitively by her father to sedate and therefore to facilitate the assault. In another case, alprazolam was detected in 4 consecutive 1 cm hair segments obtained from a 16-year-old adolescent who was forced to prostitute herself. A 9-year-old girl was assaulted with repetitive diphenhydramine administrations due to its sedative properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1524838012470033">Kintz, Evans, Villain, Salquebre, &amp; Cirimele, 2007</xref>). A single strand of hair from the victim was obtained approximately 7 weeks after the alleged incident and confirmed XB poisoning. Finally, it is important to remember that the intoxication might be involuntary, since adolescents may easily accede to ethanol or other XBs and therefore making them more vulnerable or unable to resist or consent sexual assault. For instance, MDMA generates empathy, and an occasional increase in disinhibition and sexual desire. It also removes the person’s ability to give a reasoned consent, turning the person into “a helpless slave” to their own sexual desires and those of the alleged perpetrator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524838012470033">Capela et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1524838012470033">Jansen &amp; Theron, 2006</xref>). The argument holds that the victim becomes part of the assault because they seem to be cooperating and colluding with activity, which they would not have consented to without taking these XBs.</p>

               <title>Disciplinary</title>
               <p>Usually, forced exposure presents as an impulsive behavior and under stressful conditions. In this type of abuse the adult forces a child to eat, smell, or contact with XBs/EBs as a method to discipline, punish, and educate, similar to a situation when a child does not like vegetables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-1524838012470033">Wardle, Herrera, Cooke, &amp; Gibson, 2003</xref>).

               <p>Usually represents an impulsive act under stress with the aim of using XBs/EBs to modify the behavior of difficult children. Measures include to increase the dose of sedatives prescribed for children and the administration of other drugs, even when they were prescribed to other patients. Satar, Yilmaz, Gokel, and Toprak (, 2001) reported the use of haloperidol by the mother to put his son to sleep since she was annoyed with his difficult behavior. This procedure is also a form of abuse since it may jeopardize the well-being and mental health of children. Inducing sleep with the administration of antihistamines is also relatively frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1524838012470033">Naso, Jenkins, &amp; Younger, 2008</xref>). A study conducted by Marinetti et al. found 10 infant deaths (over an 8-month period) in which intoxications by over-the-counter cold medications were implicated (2005). In this study, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine were detected in 9 out of the 10 infant deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1524838012470033">Marinetti et al., 2005</xref>). In another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524838012470033">Dart et al., 2009</xref>), the caregiver admitted their intent to sedate the child with medicines for which these products were neither labeled nor intended. In other cases, the documentation explicitly stated that the child did not have cold symptoms, indicating a different intent of the caregiver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524838012470033">Dart et al., 2009</xref>). In a more recent work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-1524838012470033">Yin (2010</xref>) performed a retrospective study of all pharmaceutical exposures involving children less than 7 years of age reported to the U.S. National Poison Data System from 2000 to 2008 in which the reason for exposure was coded as “malicious.” Authors reported 18 (1.2%) deaths. Of these, 17 (94%) were exposed to sedating agents, including antihistamines (8 cases) and opioids (8 cases). Therefore, it is reasonable that medicolegal investigators should consider testing for sedating XBs, including antihistamines and other over-the-counter drugs, especially when children less than 2-year-old are present. Although these cases represent voluntary intoxications, there is usually no intent to cause injury. The intoxication serves only the interests of the adult but not the needs of the child. Administration of high doses of multivitamins, iron, or herbal products is also a frequent practice of some caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524838012470033">Black &amp; Zenel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1524838012470033">Hoffer, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-1524838012470033">Wardle et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

         <title>Presented History, Clinical, and Toxicological Evaluation</title>
         <p>The circumstances surrounding the intoxication are extremely important not only for the medical or forensic doctor but also for the toxicologist that will perform toxicological analysis. Indeed an oriented toxicological analysis is more prone to be successful, since in several cases characteristic nonbiological or biological data exist to suggest a particular XB/EB as the cause of intoxication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524838012470033">Dinis-Oliveira et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524838012470033">2012b</xref>). In addition, an oriented toxicological analysis will help the physician to implement the most useful therapeutic, since toxicological results can be more easily and rapidly obtained. Efforts should also be made to find a cup or a bottle left on a poisoning spot. Disposable needles, syringes, metal needles wedged onto droppers, rolled paper, improvised filters (cotton), “cooking” equipment (spoon or bottle cap used to heat the drug to achieve solubility) constitute the “works” or paraphernalia commonly used to inhale or inject drugs should be also searched. A list of all XBs/EBs accessible to children should be obtained. Any evidences available and findings of local reports from relatives and neighbors should be considered.</p>
         <p>Nonabusive intoxications are easily witnessed or perceived by the caregiver. The most common scenario is the presence of open containers, already empty or lacking in content and presence of medication in the mouth, hands, or spilled on children’s clothes. With these observations, when the intoxication resulted from unintentional exposure, usually the caregiver quickly seeks medical help or contact a poison center before arriving to a health unit. Nevertheless, child may also present without a history of intoxication, since the caregiver may not be aware of intoxication or may withhold information if the intoxication resulted as consequence of neglect or illegal activities occurring in the child environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1524838012470033">Farst et al., 2007</xref>). When the container is brought with the child, this can greatly facilitate identification of XBs/EBs, because high concentrations (with higher degrees of purity) of analytes are usually present. An example of this situation was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1524838012470033">Freeman and Wolford (1996</xref>) who described a methemoglobinemia in a 16-month-old male secondary to ingestion of cleaning solution. The mother stated that she had taken the child to the hair salon and that the child may have ingested the industrial cleaning solution used at the salon. According to the mother, the child was found to have some of the solution on his chin and hands and the smell of it on his clothes.</p>
         <p>In a more serious scenario, such as intentional intoxications, no information, although known by the caregiver, is provided. Hence, getting the true history of the pediatric patients requires knowledge, experience, time, and observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-1524838012470033">Satar et al., 2001</xref>). Caregivers should be questioned many times about the incongruences between the clinical diagnosis and the patient’s histories and different questioning techniques should be employed each time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1524838012470033">Paschall, 2005</xref>). In addition, the physician should not forget the possibility of MSBP, since the perpetrator usually denies any knowledge of the true etiology of the child’s illness when presenting the child for medical assessment and care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-1524838012470033">Sheridan, 2003</xref>). The symptoms and signs typically disappear when the child is separated from the perpetrator.

Obtaining a careful medical history may guide the clinician to the diagnosis, and personal and family medical history should be elicited in detail. Questions such as (1) was she or he alone? (2) did she or he visit other friends or relatives? (3) did she or he go to school that day? should be considered always. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524838012470033">Table 1</xref> summarizes the type of intoxication and the history and facts that are usually reported.</p>

         <p>When an intoxication occurs and the victim is sent to an hospital, medical doctors and co-medical staffs should concentrate their efforts on the patient intensive care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-1524838012470033">Suzuki &amp; Watanabe, 2005</xref>), irrespective of any other aspects surrounding the case. Medical doctors and co-medical staffs should communicate with the local poison information center, giving as much information about the patient as possible, namely clinical data (since databases have been developed for estimation of a causative XB according to clinical data) but also results of clinical tests, any previous medical history of poisoning, details of drugs or other XBs to which the patient may have had access and, in cases of accidental poisoning, XBs to which the victim may have been exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1524838012470033">Moffat, Osselton, &amp; Widdop, 2004</xref>). The information exchange should be made between the doctor directly treating the patient and a staff of the local poison information center or any expert toxicologist for the specific XB. Their conversation, aimed to clarify symptoms, often yield clues for the cause of toxicity and for the priority tests to be performed. Close communication must continue if the initial tests prove negative, so that the search has to be widened, or if the clinician requires advice on the interpretation of positive results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1524838012470033">Moffat et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
         <p>Although toxicological analyses are critical in the diagnosis and management of poisoning, the history and physical examination are the factors that usually determine the initial therapy intended to decrease the absorption of XBs or the toxic-related effects or to increase excretion. Despite the undoubted advantages of toxicological analysis, most treatments begin well before the toxicological result is available to the clinician. In this sense, the diagnosis is usually clinical, with the results of toxicological analysis viewed as confirmatory. Routine laboratory testing such as serum glucose, electrolytes, calcium, urea, creatinine, liver enzymes, serum osmolality urine dipstick, urine type II, serum C-peptide, and blood gases might be important to reach a presumptive diagnosis of poisoning and help the clinical with clues to suspect the XBs/EBs involved. These results are usually available well before the report of the toxicological analysis, since some of them can be performed even at the bedside. Collected samples should be saved and stored in appropriate containers in anticipation for later analysis for specific XBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524838012470033">Dinis-Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
         <p>A variety of symptoms may be of value to the clinician in determining the need for emergency care as well as for ordering toxicological analysis. Symptoms commonly found are a consequence of the type of XBs/EBs involved. Particularly common are convulsions, central nervous system depression, altered mental status and hypoglycemia-induced seizures, hemorrhage, hyponatremia, apnea, vomiting, nausea, fever, dysrhythmias, bradycardia, tachypnea, hyperthension, hypothension, miosis, mydriasis, increase or decrease in body temperature, sweating, odor, vomiting, abdominal pain, failure to thrive, icterus, bleeding, diarrhea, stunted growth, and systemic and dermal infections by unusual microorganisms. Physical injuries are mostly nonexistent. Exceptions include injuries caused directly by caustic XBs (namely in the mouth and esophagus) and cases of dermatitis as consequence of laxatives poisonings, which can be confused with burns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524838012470033">Bappal, George, Nair, Khusaiby, &amp; De Silva, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524838012470033">Table 2</xref> lists the most common signs and symptoms and possible implicated XBs/EBs.</p>

         <p>Sulfonylurea ingestion represents a recurrent intoxication in children, which is life threatening in toddlers due to its strong and prolonged hypoglycemic effect. Its administration to children may not be accidental and from the literature, 29% were cases of MSBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1524838012470033">Glatstein, Garcia-Bournissen, Scolnik, Koren, &amp; Finkelstein, 2009b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1524838012470033">Glatstein and colleagues (2009b</xref>) discussed a case of nonaccidental sulfonylurea ingestion by an 18-month-old girl, presented to the emergency department with altered mental status and severe hypoglycemia, which required intravenous hypertonic dextrose solutions to maintain euglycemia. A family history of type 2 diabetes prompted a search for sulfonylureas in the child’s serum, which was positive. Further investigation led to the conclusion that the child’s poisoning was the result of the mother’s MSBP. Glatstein et al. concluded that sulfonylureas intoxication should be considered in previously healthy children presenting with hypoglycemia.</p>
         <p>In body packer syndrome, illicit drugs (namely, heroin, cocaine, amphetamines, MDMA, marijuana, and hashish) are usually packed in condoms, balloons, or plastic film (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1524838012470033">Dinis-Oliveira, Magalhaes, Carvalho, &amp; Santos, 2009</xref>). Children are also implicated in this syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-1524838012470033">Yegane et al., 2009</xref>). The most frequent cause of the death among body packers is acute XB intoxication due to rupture of the package within the body. Suspicious signs such as persons’ behavior, origin and destination of their traveling, doubtful declaration about their journey, sweating without mobility, and the specific smell of their mouth as resulting of the effect of gastric acid on the packets wrapping material, may help physician to uncover “body packing” cases. These patients also usually refuse to eat or drink during the flight. Symptomatic body packers report pain, vomiting, and absence of defecation, indicating gastrointestinal obstruction similar to the occurrence of any foreign body in the intestinal tract, which can progress to perforation and consequent peritonitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1524838012470033">Hergan, Kofler, &amp; Oser, 2004</xref>).</p>
         <p>Accidental paracetamol overdose in children is common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1524838012470033">Rumack, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1524838012470033">Rumack, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-1524838012470033">Rumack, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-1524838012470033">Yarema et al., 2009</xref>) and may be associated with toxic liver damage leading to fulminant liver failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1524838012470033">Mahadevan, McKiernan, Davies, &amp; Kelly, 2006</xref>). The elevation in liver enzymes is a relevant result for clinical diagnosis of paracetamol poisoning. Intoxications are common since this drug is found in many over-the-counter medicines and prescription medications, under different brand names and in combination with other active drugs, to treat symptoms of colds and influenza (flu), allergy, pain, and insomnia. Therefore, the maximum daily dose can be quickly exceeded without the caregiver realizing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-1524838012470033">Stumpf, Skyles, Alaniz, &amp; Erickson, 2007</xref>).</p>
         <p>A patient with methemoglobinemia sufficient to produce cyanosis may have normal oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry with a concomitant low arterial blood oxygen saturation determined in an arterial blood gas analysis. Causes of methemoglobinemia include medicines such sulfonamides, quinones, phenacetin, benzocaine, and environmental substances including naphthalene (mothballs), nitrites/nitrates, and some industrial compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524838012470033">Bong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524838012470033">Bryk et al., 2003</xref>). Naphthalene mothballs are sold in sealed plastic bags and sometimes, they are multicolored and have added fragrance that may be particularly attractive for children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524838012470033">Bates, 2002</xref>). Mothballs usually contain either paradichlorobenzene (also known as p-dichlorobenzene [PDCB] and 1,4-dichlorobenzene), naphthalene, or camphor. Mothballs are used to protect clothing and other fabrics from attack by moths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1524838012470033">Feuillet, Mallet, &amp; Spadari, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1524838012470033">Lim, Poulose, &amp; Tan, 2009</xref>).</p>
         <p>Acute onset of bloody stools and shock in an infant or child followed by persistent metabolic acidosis and elevated liver function tests may be attributable to iron intoxication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524838012470033">Black &amp; Zenel, 2003</xref>).</p>
         <p>Radiological imaging might be an important tool for intoxication diagnosis, since it can detect ferrous sulfate (iron), enteric-coated tablets, esophagical, gastric and hepatic lesions as consequence of corrosive XB ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1524838012470033">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1524838012470033">Ruthmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-1524838012470033">Youn et al., 2010</xref>), or packets related to the body packer syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1524838012470033">Hahn, Hoffman, &amp; Nelson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1524838012470033">Hierholzer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1524838012470033">Kersschot, Beaucourt, Degryse, &amp; De Schepper, 1985</xref>) in the gastrointestinal tract of children. However, negative radiological image alone does not rule out the intoxication or the possibility of a body packer case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1524838012470033">Hahn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1524838012470033">McCarron &amp; Wood, 1983</xref>). Nevertheless, imaging is often helpful, particularly because an accurate history is unusual, and therefore large airports are implementing onsite radiography for the purposes of detaining those individuals confirmed to be “packing.” Radiological imaging has also been useful in documenting lesions within cerebellum of children caused due to the presence of carbon monoxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1524838012470033">Fan, Wang, Lo, Chang, &amp; Chen, 2009</xref>) and methadone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1524838012470033">Mills, MacLennan, Devile, &amp; Saunders, 2008</xref>) and cerebral edema as consequence of sodium valproate fatal intoxication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr151-1524838012470033">Unal, Kaya, &amp; Aydin, 2007</xref>).</p>
         <p>Despite the relevance of symptoms and signs registered, radiological diagnosis and circumstantial evidences, nothing replaces qualitative and quantitative toxicological analysis. Forensic toxicology request forms should be filled in as complete as possible and submitted to the laboratory, together with the samples for analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524838012470033">Dinis-Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>). The requested fields on this form are essential for an adequate analysis and could save time and expense, by assisting the toxicologist to use the most useful methods of analysis and to interpret the results in the context of the case at a later stage. A copy of the postmortem report should be submitted as soon as it is available and a copy of any police sudden death report may also be useful.</p>
         <p>In most hospitals, the automated analytical methodologies using immunoassays allow the screening and semiquantitative analysis for a finite number of XBs/EBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1524838012470033">Gerostamoulos &amp; Beyer, 2010</xref>). The profile of XBs/EBs analyzed is variable depending on the laboratory considered, usually taking into account the most common toxicological requests that differ among geographic regions. The problem arises because new compounds are introduced every day in the market for which antibodies are not available. Moreover immunoassays are influenced by cross-reactivity leading to false positives, due to the simple inability to distinguish XBs/EBs within a group as consequence of the structural similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1524838012470033">Flanagan &amp; Connally, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1524838012470033">Flanagan, Taylor, Watson, &amp; Whelpton, 2007</xref>). Other components in a specimen, for example, bilirubin, hemoglobin, lipid, and endogenous human antibodies in the specimen may interfere with the assay signal and thus produce incorrect assay results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1524838012470033">Flanagan et al., 2007</xref>). In spite of these limitations, immunoassays have clear advantages, such as cost, speed, easy automation, and no need for analysts with high expertise. In addition, preliminary screening tests are important to narrow causative XB candidates before accurate analysis by instruments of high performance. The identification of a causative XB is one of the most important tasks in emergency medicine. Ideally, the XB can be both identified and quantified within this time frame. When this is not possible, a qualitative result still has considerable value if the symptoms are consistent with the identified XB and the result should be provided to the clinician without delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1524838012470033">Moffat et al., 2004</xref>). However, they must be of sufficient quality to allow an appropriate clinical decision to be made. It is important to discuss the scope and limitations of the tests performed with the clinician and to maintain high standards of laboratory practice, especially when performing tests on an emergency basis. It may be better to offer no result rather than misleading data based on unreliable tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1524838012470033">Flanagan et al., 2007</xref>). Though clinicians often treat poisoned patients on the basis of clinical history rather than wait for toxicological results, they may change their approach once they have them. In addition, the analysis should not end after the first positive finding because additional, hitherto unsuspected XBs may be present.</p>
         <p>Subsequently, confirmatory tests may be performed in view of qualitative and quantitative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1524838012470033">Maurer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1524838012470033">Maurer, 2010</xref>). Although elaborated, time-consuming, and expensive confirmatory analyses are rarely necessary for emergency purposes, they are mandatory for legal issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524838012470033">Dinis-Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>). Confirmatory analysis requires higher specificity, precision, and accuracy techniques so that the results can be used later in court proceedings. High-pressure liquid chromatography and gas chromatography, both coupled with mass spectrometry, are the analytical techniques of choice when underlying objective analysis in forensic toxicology. Frequently routine clinical chemical analysis will be performed at one site, while the more complex confirmatory toxicological analysis will be performed by a different department, possibly at a different location. Screening tests could be performed at bedside or in the clinical laboratory, inside the advanced critical care medical center, whereas complex qualitative and quantitative analysis are usually performed at laboratories with more accurate analytical instruments and specialized analysts, such as local academic institutions or institutes of legal medicine. However, the range of analyses that can be offered by specialized laboratories to meet emergency demands usually encompasses only few dozens of XBs/EBs. Even if there is time, laboratories cannot screen for everything and they do their job best if they are given some idea of the type of XBs/EBs to look for. There is often no need for the clinician to be familiar with the technical details of the toxicological analytical methods and therefore the authors do not discuss this issue further. Indeed, what is important to remember is that the clinician should always contact and collaborate with the toxicologist in order to increase the quality of the toxicological analysis, namely by avoiding the possibility of commit “laboratory errors,” such as those related to sample collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524838012470033">Dinis-Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>). The majority of these errors originates from the preanalytic phase and not from problems concerning the analytical process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1524838012470033">Plebani &amp; Carraro, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr158-1524838012470033">Witte, VanNess, Angstadt, &amp; Pennel, 1997</xref>). Therefore, it must be recognized that—even with technological advances—accurate, forensically defensible results are predicated on the quality and type of specimens provided and the documentation of each specimen’s origin and history.</p>

         <p>The scientific literature indicates that by 2012 there were more than 5 hundred references to child abuse by poisoning in Medline. These statistics represent mainly published case reports and reviews and therefore do not reflect the total number of cases including unrecognized intentional poisonings. Statistics on toxic exposures in children less than 19-year-old are available on the website: www.aapcc.org. The data presented are from the Toxic Exposure Surveillance System (TESS) of the AAPCC. AAPCC in the 2009 report presents the top 25 XB/EB categories listed by the frequency of human exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524838012470033">Bronstein et al., 2010</xref>). This ranking provides an indication on where to focus public health resources for prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524838012470033">Bronstein et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1524838012470033">Table 3</xref> lists the most common XBs involved in children intoxications.

         <p>In all cases with suspicion of criminal abuse and neglect by XBs/EBs, collection, transport, and toxicological analysis should take into account the procedures of quality, safety, and integrity in order to respect the chain of custody from point of collection to the forensic toxicology laboratory. An example of a chain of custody report was presented by the authors in a recent discussion on this topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524838012470033">Dinis-Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>). This documentation is central to the demonstration that the evidence has remained intact, and not been adulterated, changed, mishandled, or misplaced in any way that would compromise its integrity. Properly maintained chain of custody documentation rules out any period of time in which a specimen may be left vulnerable to adulteration or tampering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1524838012470033">Karch, 2008</xref>). Evidence ties together people, places, actions, and things that have important impact on circumstances surrounding events in which individuals are held legally accountable. The procedure also raises the issue of confidentiality and ethics where illegal activities may be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr159-1524838012470033">Wolff et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
         <p>To date, a standardized protocol for sampling in suspected poisoning or XB-related intoxications has not yet been established, but there is a broad consensus that collection should be performed as early as possible after intoxication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524838012470033">Dinis-Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>). Sampling procedure, selection of specimens or quantity for toxicological analysis has to be case dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1524838012470033">Plebani &amp; Carraro, 1997</xref>), largely considering the case history, requests, legal aspects, and availability. Any specimen that was in contact with an XB is a potential candidate for toxicological investigations, at least, for qualitative analysis. Although toxicology testing can theoretically be performed on almost any specimen, it is usually limited to those for which there is an appropriate database available to help in the interpretation of the results or for which there is a validated method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1524838012470033">Moffat et al., 2004</xref>). Blood, urine, and gastric content (namely gastric lavage fluid and vomitus) are normally used as specimens for XB analysis in living subjects. In postmortem toxicology investigations, specimens available can be numerous and variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1524838012470033">Skopp, 2004</xref>). They may range from relatively pure solutions of an XB to a putrefying specimen. Proper collection and preservation of postmortem specimens is critical, since there is usually no opportunity to go back for recollection of specimens after cremation. Peripheral and cardiac blood, urine, gastric content, and solid organs, particularly liver and kidney, are useful specimens to address almost all possibilities related to children intoxications. Specimens routinely collected at autopsy include peripheral and cardiac blood, urine, gastric content, and organs, particularly liver and kidney. Other specimens, such as vitreous humor, brain, lung, spleen, and skeletal muscle, should be collected only in specific circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524838012470033">Dinis-Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>). Blood from peripheral sites should be obtained from femoral vein or artery and prior opening in the thorax and abdominal cavities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1524838012470033">Skopp, 2004</xref>). Samples that may also be collected prior to organ dissection are urine, bile, cerebrospinal fluid or fluid from putrefactive blisters, hair, nails, and swabs from the orifices of the body or from the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1524838012470033">Skopp, 2004</xref>). Organs are normally collected after evisceration. They provide one of the best and most useful specimens to assist in the interpretation of blood findings. XB detection in tissue specimens should be considered whenever highly lipophilic or preferably bound to tissue XBs are suspected to be involved in the intoxication. Organs may also be useful in cases with extended postmortem time period, namely in decomposed bodies and whenever body fluids are not available or difficult to obtain. A large amount of data for XB findings in tissue exists, primarily for liver and kidney and, to a lesser degree, brain and lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524838012470033">Baselt, 2011</xref>). Plasma, serum, and blood are the ideal samples if quantitative measurements are needed. Urine is commonly used in qualitative analysis since relatively large volumes are usually available (especially antemortem) the concentrations of many XBs and their metabolites, tend to be higher than that found in blood, thereby facilitating detection. Gastric contents are also considered as useful specimens for the identification of an XB when the time after ingestion is short, since there are higher probabilities to contain large amounts of an unchanged form of an ingested XB. For the other specimens available, qualitative importance should also be considered, instead of quantitative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1524838012470033">Drummer, 2004</xref>). Particularly important in the field of drug facilitated sexual assault is the sample of hair of the victim in order to detect GHB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1524838012470033">Kintz, Cirimele, Jamey, &amp; Ludes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1524838012470033">Kintz, Villain, &amp; Ludes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1524838012470033">Kintz, Villain, Pelissier, Cirimele, &amp; Leonetti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1524838012470033">Kintz, Villain, &amp; Cirimele, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1524838012470033">Negrusz &amp; Gaensslen, 2003</xref>).</p>
         <p>A standard report format is very helpful and results should be reported in appropriate units, preferably written out in full to avoid confusion (e.g., between mU/L and μU/L), indicating the measurement uncertainty if desirable, with appropriate reference data or information to assist the requester in understanding their significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1524838012470033">Jickells &amp; Negrusz, 2008</xref>). An example of a forensic toxicology report was recently presented by authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524838012470033">Dinis-Oliveira et al., 2010</xref>). A negative result is not sufficient to establish that the XB is not implicated in an intoxication case. In addition, a positive qualitative analysis never solely provides conclusions of the involvement an XB in the intoxication but is only one of many pieces of evidence. For example, minute quantities of cyanide, arsenic, lead, and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) are regularly ingested from food sources or inhaled as environmental contaminants and retained by the human body, but in amounts that are insufficient to cause obvious deleterious effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1524838012470033">Klaassen, 2008</xref>). Ethanol represents another typical example since it is produced after death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1524838012470033">Kugelberg &amp; Jones, 2007</xref>). If the toxicological analysis indicates the presence of an illicit XB, then the environment in which the child lives should be supervised by the police.</p>

         <p>Children explore the world around them. “the pica syndrome,” which means taking things to the mouth, is part of their normal behavior and growth process. The caregiver is responsible to secure the environment that surrounds children in order minimize all possible risks. This means, for instance, the need to improve XBs home safety storage and dispensing practices. In the past, not all manufacturers provided measuring devices with their products. Legislation of child-resistant packaging and increasing the level of enforcement reduces the incidence of poisonings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1524838012470033">Franklin &amp; Rodgers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1524838012470033">Rodgers, 1996</xref>). Nevertheless, measuring devices are not standardized across the pharmaceutical industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524838012470033">Dart et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, legislation is most effective when supported by educational activities. To ensure coordinated action, national plans for preventing poisoning need to be developed. Those should include child home visits, education on child poisoning prevention, dispensing medicines in nonlethal quantities, and establishing a national media campaign targeting child poisoning safety. Some important measures to reduce poisoning in children include:</p>

         <p>To make a diagnosis of child abuse or neglect in any of its forms, one must be willing to consider the possibility that children are abused and neglected by those that are responsible for assuring their safety. Child poisoning by XBs/EBs is one of the most covert forms of maltreatment and should be considered to protect children. The work done by the Forensic Sciences and the Central Poisons professionals in recent years has made aware the public and health professionals of this possibility. Indeed, in a comparison between 14 countries that participated in both 2007 and 2009 evaluations, the average safety performance score to avoid intoxications in children increased 14.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1524838012470033">MacKay &amp; Vincenten, 2009</xref>). One study found concomitant child physical abuse in 20% of the children who had been intentionally poisoned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524838012470033">Dine &amp; McGovern, 1982</xref>). Any child suspected of being intentionally or unintentionally poisoned resulting from serious endangerment or supervisory neglect should undergo a physical evaluation appropriate for age and circumstances and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1524838012470033">Marcus, Ammermann, Bahro, &amp; Schmidt, 1995</xref>). It is also clear that many of the familial and social risk factors to exposure children to XBs/EBs are the same as risk factors for physical abuse: abusive disciplinary measures, poverty, caregiver drug abuse, impulsive anger-driven actions, misinformed attempts at behavior modification, unrealistic developmental expectations, and a multiplicity of life, stressors.</p>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1524838012470033">Pitetti, Whitman, and Zaylor (2008</xref>) in a very interesting study showed a substantial number (8.4%) of children presenting to their emergency department with an apparent life-threatening event had a positive toxicology screen result. In particular, 4.7% of the children were found to have been given an over-the-counter cold medicine. The authors recommend that toxicology screens should be included as part of the routine evaluation of children who present with an apparent life-threatening event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1524838012470033">Pitetti et al., 2008</xref>). The use of these medications is not recommended in young children, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dosing guidelines do not exist for children less than 2 years of age. Caregivers possess the mistaken notion that over-the-counter cold medications formulated for children are also safe for use in infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1524838012470033">Marinetti et al., 2005</xref>). In a subsequent comprehensive evaluation of pediatric fatalities associated with nonprescription cough and cold medications, authors observed that deaths in children appear to arise from product misuse rather than adverse effects resulting from recommended doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524838012470033">Dart et al., 2009</xref>). Children less than 2 years of were the most commonly involved. Their small size may facilitate inadvertent administration of an overdose and it is also harder for young children than for older children to communicate emerging adverse effects to their caregiver.</p>
         <p>To reduce the effects of poisonings on children, one prudent intervention could be to standardize investigations of pediatric victims of suspected abuse or neglect and to routinely include XBs/EBs screening, particularly medicines, in these investigations. In addition, a battery of XBs/EBs must be created and designed for that purpose and must be adapted to the reality of each country. The concept of child fatality teams was developed to address the recognized inadequacy of current systems in identifying the cause of unexpected death among children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr155-1524838012470033">Webster, Schnitzer, Jenny, Ewigman, &amp; Alario, 2003</xref>). Children abused or neglected with XBs/EBs likely compose part of the hidden cases of child abuse, since many antemortem and postmortem examinations do not routinely include blood analysis. Providing a standardized evaluation of each pediatric death to the child fatality teams would increase the knowledge to this field and the routine investigation of child deaths would allow more accurate ascertainment of cases and perhaps identify additional risk factors. The cooperation between physicians and law enforcement and the need for law enforcement to be trained to recognize abuse and neglect of children by poisoning is mandatory. It is almost unknown what proportion of poisonings are suspected to be cases of abuse or neglect by hospital providers and/or reported to forensic services, neither the factors that influence the decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr160-1524838012470033">Wood, Pecker, Russo, Henretig, &amp; Christian, 2012</xref>). By reviewing contextual examples, we expect to further help medical doctors and law enforcement professionals to uncover these cases. In most police departments throughout the world, responding officers will be unaware or uneducated regarding the possibilities of abuse and neglect by poisonings. These issues would greatly benefit of medical personnel education to create a social movement that would lead to the recognition of these conditions in law, and the need to train law enforcement personnel to also recognize these risks.</p>
