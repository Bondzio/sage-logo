<abstract>
<p>Humanitarian intervention and the responsibility to protect are two examples often used of the separation between humanitarian action and the political. To say that humanitarianism is separate from the political comes from a very particular theological reading. To understand this reading, the article provides a detailed analysis of the life of Henry Dunant, the founder of the ICRC, to show his religious and historical environment in Calvinist Geneva.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the Old Town of Geneva, Switzerland, near the Cathedral of St. Pierre, stands the house where, in 1863, Henry Dunant, Louis Appia, General Guillaume Henri Dufour, Theodore Maunoir, and Gustave Moynier created the basis of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) from the Public Welfare Society of Geneva. The building is fifty meters from the imposing Cathedral, transformed during the sixteenth century from a Romanesque-Gothic Catholic Church to a somber site for the preaching of John Calvin during Geneva’s Reformation, theocratic<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0304375412469315">5</xref></sup> period. The wooden chair where Calvin delivered over 2,000 sermons during his ministry from 1536 to 1564 sits against the stark walls, a reminder of the scene of Calvin's triumph when St. Pierre became a Protestant church in 1536, with Calvin's followers tearing out the altar, paintings, and statues. Nearby, a 100 meters from the Cathedral, is the apartment in which the first meetings of the ICRC took place in 1864. Across the street from the Cathedral, in the City Hall of Geneva, is the Alabama Room wherein was drafted a convention in 1864 that when ratified and acceded to would bind its adhering governments to give humane treatment to the sick and wounded in time of war in what is referred to as the first Geneva Convention for Victims of War.</p>
<p>What is the relationship between reform Protestantism and the humanitarian foundation of the Red Cross? What is the intellectual distance between St. Pierre and the idea formalized in the institution created in the apartment and crystallized in the City Hall? What is the relationship between evangelic Protestantism as understood in Geneva in the nineteenth century and tensions today between humanitarianism and politics?</p>
<p>This article examines the relationship between Calvinist Geneva and humanitarianism through the separation of the humanitarian from the political from a religious perspective following the early life of Henry Dunant. It focuses on Dunant’s religious beliefs and their relationship to the larger humanitarian concept. Dunant’s youth was caught up in two religious separations: the separation of Catholicism from Protestantism and, most importantly, his activities within the ultrareligious Réveil (Awakening) movement which separated itself from the National Protestant Church. Although the two separations were certainly not similar in magnitude, it is important in terms of current debates about the nature of humanitarianism to understand that not only was Henry Dunant’s early education profoundly religious once he failed the regular school in Geneva but that he was a most active member of a small group of devout young men which later developed into the worldwide Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA).</p>
<p>Humanitarianism has become a rallying cry in the face of increasing threats to civilian populations. Following what has been labeled as humanitarian crises from the scenes of starving children in Biafra in 1968<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0304375412469315">6</xref></sup> to the border camps in eastern Congo, Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, to safe havens in Srebrenica including Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Cambodia, the idea of humanitarianism as protection of innocent civilians in the face of the violence of war has become an accepted term and concept.</p>
<p>However, within the call for humanitarian assistance are numerous pleas for the maintaining of humanitarian space from political encroachment, even in what is being called “new humanitarianism.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0304375412469315">7</xref></sup> Within the call for humanitarian space and civilian protection is the assumption that humanitarianism is distinct from the political. The political/humanitarian divide<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0304375412469315">8</xref></sup> is one of the foundations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) as well as the ICRC. Traditionally, the political/humanitarian divide has been a conceptual cornerstone of the humanitarian activities of the ICRC. Indeed, its former President, Cornelio Sommaruga, stated in an address to the UN General Assembly in 1992 that “humanitarian endeavour and political action must go their separate ways if the neutrality and impartiality of humanitarian work are not to be jeopardized . . . ”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0304375412469315">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>How has the discourse of humanitarian become so strongly separated from the political? How has that dichotomy become part of the general discourse? One difficulty with this divide, as we shall see later on, is that much like the dichotomy between negative and positive rights when applied to civil and political rights versus economic, social, and cultural rights,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0304375412469315">10</xref></sup> active intervention inherently transgresses a radical divide between political and humanitarian spaces. In order to protect civilians in the name of humanitarianism, political/military action must be taken. Humanitarian intervention has an inherent contradiction because it demands a positive action to establish a passive space of nonintervention, a zone outside of conflict, if not political reality. But, a “humanity oasis”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0304375412469315">11</xref></sup> is harder and harder to imagine today as the line between civilians and combatants becomes more and more blurred, and as proactive political/military actions are employed more and more in the name of humanitarianism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0304375412469315">
<title>The Humane Humanitarian in a Fallen World</title>
<p>Humanitarian is a most popular word and concept that is easily misunderstood in spite of its frequent use. Like human rights, it implies helping those in need outside of political considerations based on universal values. For example, the United Nations established the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in 1991 as the system’s focal point in major disasters, both natural and man-made, as distinct from the Department of Political Affairs.</p>
<p>IHL deals with the laws of armed conflict, essentially the laws of war. Without war, in other words, there would be no humanitarian law; without war, there would be no need for a humanitarian space. What then is the relationship between war and humanitarian space? Traditionally, it has been a space separate from the political, as reiterated in the work of the ICRC through its creed of impartiality, neutrality, and independence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0304375412469315">12</xref></sup> The activity of the ICRC takes place within a humanitarian space in the midst of but separate from the political/military. Humanitarian law in its ideal creates order and civility within barbarity and chaos. Norms and rules are designed to apply in situations where norms and rules have broken down. The separation of the humanitarian from the political space is a demarcation, such as the supposed safe haven in Srebrenica during the Balkan Wars. People who are within the safe haven, physical humanitarian space are supposedly protected from violence, and hence the political.</p>
<p>What is this imagined community of humanitarian space and where does it come from? The separation of the humanitarian from the political has a long history in Western political thought from Thucydides to Hobbes, from Machiavelli to Weber, Niebuhr, Morgenthau, and Kissinger.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0304375412469315">13</xref></sup> The basis of this demarcation is the separation of the individual from society, in Niebuhr’s terms, moral man in immoral society, or in Walzer’s terms, the problem of dirty hands when one enters political reality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0304375412469315">14</xref></sup> Politics, according to this tradition, must be dirty. Or, as Mark Cutts writes, “There is a tendency to view humanitarianism as principled and politics as unprincipled. Humanitarianism is seen as resulting from pity and compassion, while politics is seen as an activity involving less noble sentiments.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0304375412469315">15</xref></sup> Any political action in this world, according to this reading by the Realists, must be tainted since the very space in which the action is taking place is fallen. Humanitarianism as well as humanitarian space is not quite divine—although it would be interesting to poll how many people working in humanitarianism have theological backgrounds—but is radically separated from politics, just as borders between insiders and outsiders mark territories and citizens. Humanitarianism, while not sacred, is markedly different from activities in the fallen world such as politics or war.</p>
<p>In her description of humanitarian values, and specifically their relation to Henry Dunant, Eva Wortel observes, “Inspired by his understanding of Christianity . . . Dunant has a moral sense of the importance of human life . . . In <italic>A Memory of Solférino</italic>, humanity appears to be a key ideal and value, and also a theological code of conduct . . . his actions seem to derive from a sincere concern for the lives of those people. This concern is so strong that he even overcomes his own prejudices; he assists the ‘barbarians’ as well.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0304375412469315">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Humanitarian space, in other words, is a distinctive arena from the political, which is by its very notion corrupt. Concerns for human lives, for humanity, take place in this world, but are separate from it. The problem, therefore, is the relationship between the idealism of the humanitarian and humanitarian space and the political necessity of creating that space in this world if one is to reject entirely the Transcendentalist move of back to nature such as Henry David Thoreau to Walden Pond.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0304375412469315">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Part of the answer lies in the political move from the primacy of state sovereignty to human security. As Adam Roberts has noted, “The increase in humanitarian efforts in the 1990s contained many elements of idealism, not least a hope that it was part of a larger process whereby the sovereignty of states would take second place to human rights of citizens.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0304375412469315">18</xref></sup> With the movement from the primacy of state sovereignty to concern for individuals, the image of humanitarianism being separated from politics gains importance. For example, as Larry Minear and Thomas Weiss have noted, “Even though operating in highly politicized circumstances, humanitarian action does not have to be political.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0304375412469315">19</xref></sup> The world of the political is the state-centric world of <italic>Realpolitik</italic> based on raison d’etat. The world of concern for the individual is separate from and outside the political collective.</p>
<p>Within the political space of violence and war and group interest, humanitarianism is supposed to create a space for human security. But how is that nonpolitical space to be created outside the political?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0304375412469315">20</xref></sup> Politically? Nonpolitically?</p>
<p>What do we mean here by the political? Two short examples in terms of the ICRC are helpful. The first concerns the question of going public to highlight grave breaches of human rights and IHL. There was an enormous internal debate within the ICRC concerning the prison at Abu Ghraib, and the decision was made to work with the relevant parties behind the scenes. Here, the ICRC prioritized the importance of access over “respecter et faire respecter” international law. Indeed, President Kellenberger was quite clear on this point in responding to mounting criticism of ICRC’s silence: “Characteristic of the ICRC are its absolute commitment to remaining in close proximity to the victims of armed conflict and its unremitting pursuit of that goal. It seeks above all to gain access to the victims of armed conflict and internal violence in order to protect and help them. All other considerations . . . are strictly subordinated to this goal.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0304375412469315">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second example involves the testimony of ICRC delegates who have witnessed clear violations of international law before International Courts. The position of the ICRC in this is quite clear as well. First, in a decision on July 27, 1999, Trial Chamber III of the International Tribune for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) decided that ICRC delegates are not obligated to testify before the Tribunal. As an adviser in the ICRC’s Legal Division wrote, “The ICRC has indeed consistently taken the position that its officials and employees, past and present, may not testify before any court or tribunal in respect of matters which came to their attention in their capacity as officials or employees of the organization.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0304375412469315">22</xref></sup> This position was broadened from ad hoc tribunals to the International Criminal Court in Rule 73 of its Rules of Procedure and Evidence, provided that the ICRC does not waive this privilege.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0304375412469315">23</xref></sup> No other organization was granted this status.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0304375412469315">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>To return to the relationship between humanitarian and political, one could easily argue that not only is it impossible to remove an individual from the political but that it is a very political move to separate the humanitarian from the political. To create a humanitarian space, such as a safe haven, is in itself a political move. And, following the creation of that space, one could ask if living in a safe haven or refugee camp is a form of suspended animation, as if refugees are in orbit. To give refugee status to someone is a legal process removed from operations and supposedly based on an objective process of determination. Indeed, the Protection Division of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was designed to be separate from operations just as the Legal Department of the ICRC is distinct from Operations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0304375412469315">25</xref></sup> In other words, by focusing on the protection of civilians in humanitarian crises, the international community can easily avoid dealing with the real political situations at hand or root causes which caused the crisis. Humanitarians can then focus only on the “humane” removed from the political, unless one enters the slippery slope of prevention, just as those involved in development try to avoid the causes of violence and displacement. The two examples above of ICRC’s “political engagement” are fascinating attempts to avoid becoming involved in obvious political situations.</p>
<p>Recent events in Libya are another excellent example. The Security Council Resolution 1973 calling for the protection of civilians did not call for the ouster of Colonel Qaddafi or a fundamental change in the political situation. However, the bombing of his compound and the assistance given to the rebels led several countries to question whether there has been a mission creep moving away from the defensive protection of civilians toward the offensive political removal of the leader. Does protecting civilians in the Security Council Resolution necessarily mean arming the rebels or attacking the government’s military installations?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0304375412469315">26</xref></sup> How does one make and maintain the demarcation between protecting civilian populations and militarily/politically acting for regime change? Mission creep here clearly moves between the humanitarian/political divide. And, as we shall see later on, the political regime change carried out in Libya had negative consequences for the humanitarian cause in Syria.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0304375412469315">
<title>Responsibility to Protect (R2P)</title>
<p>Humanitarianism in its most recent incarnation of trying to be separated from the political has become the cornerstone of the R2P and it is there where we can see most clearly the tense relationship between humanitarianism and politics and the limits of humanitarianism separated from the political in the imagined community of classical humanitarians.</p>
<p>Kofi Annan launched an appeal in 1999 and 2000 which became a Commission Report that articulated the concept of the R2P.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0304375412469315">27</xref></sup> The underlying message of R2P was based upon this divide, that there could be actions by states to intervene in the internal affairs of other states in the name of humanitarianism that were not political. In the foreword to the Report of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, it is clearly stated that “This report is about the so-called ‘right of humanitarian intervention’: the question of when, if ever, it is appropriate for states to take coercive—and in particular military—action, against another state for the purpose of protecting people at risk in that other state.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0304375412469315">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>What is most relevant in the Report to our discussion here<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0304375412469315">29</xref></sup> is its assumptions about humanitarianism and protecting civilians. Even a cursory examination of the Report indicates that the major concern of the authors, including the former President of the ICRC Cornelio Sommaruga, was the question of intervention to protect civilians and the authorization to intervene in the internal affairs of a country. The fundamental question dealt with in the Report was the intervention dilemma in terms of breaching state sovereignty in order to protect individuals. In the Report, the tension of human rights vs raison d’etat was transformed into the general category of human security instead of state security by piercing the veil of domaine reservé and changing the meaning of absolute state sovereignty. From the responsibility to protect to the responsibility to prevent to the responsibility to react to the responsibility to rebuild, the Report lays out a rational roadmap for legitimization and operationalization of protecting civilians. Individuals, according to the Report, should be the focus of international attention as opposed to sovereign states, the traditional primary subject of international law.</p>
<p>Just as the ICRC had laid out the rules for protecting civilians in war, the Report lays out a roadmap for how to intervene to protect civilians in civil wars within countries and other “humanitarian” crises within borders. What the Report and the excellent supplementary volume on research, bibliography, and background do not do is to analyze the very concept of humanitarian and to examine its relation to intervention. The focus of the Report is entirely on justifying humanitarian intervention, assuming that is a given and that the relationship between humanitarian and intervention is obvious. The question is not the meaning of humanitarian intervention in its deeper sense, the question is how to justify and legitimize intervention in the name of humanitarianism. Intervention itself is a political act; therefore, the act of intervening is a political act that requires not just legitimization, but a thorough explanation of how the political relates to the humanitarian.</p>
<p>The recent interventions in Libya and the Ivory Coast through Resolutions 1973 and 1975 of the United Nations Security Council are the culmination of the application of the R2P and the operationalization of the humanitarian concept. In both instances, the protection of civilians took priority over state sovereignty; in both instances, the United Nations Security Council aggressively decided to authorize intervention to protect civilians and to counter threats to international peace and security under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0304375412469315">30</xref></sup> In the Libyan case, the Resolution said, “<italic>Considering</italic> that the widespread and systematic attacks now taking place in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya against the civilian population may amount to crimes against humanity . . . ” and in the Ivory Coast Resolution it said, “<italic>Considering</italic> that the attacks currently taking place in the Cote d’Ivoire against the civilian population could amount to crimes against humanity . . . ”</p>
<p>In a larger sense, both authorizations to intervene represent a proactive vision of political/military action in the name of humanitarianism; they are both highly political responses through the use of military means to save civilian lives. Both Resolutions go to great pains to emphasize the humanitarian—averting grave crimes against humanity—to deny the political. There are no calls for regime change; there are no authorizations for “boots on the ground.” They are seemingly neutral, passive humanitarian calls to protect innocent lives in danger, but there is no deeper understanding of what it would take politically to prevent, protect, and rebuild.</p>
<p>What we are seeing, I believe, is a further blurring of a conceptual differentiation between the political and humanitarian in the sense that there is a denial that by its very nature any creation of a humanitarian must be by political action while at the same time there is a call for political/military activity. We are not talking about just separating belligerents here to create a neutral demilitarized zone, essentially a passive activity once the belligerents have been separated or the wounded removed or civilians successfully separated with peacekeepers or refugee camp authorities making sure those separated remain separated and safe. Whereas to vote a resolution for humanitarian intervention is obviously political, there is little attention to the politics of the actual intervention or to the meaning of humanitarian.</p>
<p>As one who has argued against the possibility of an isolated humanitarian space and the radical, binary humanitarian/political divide,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0304375412469315">31</xref></sup> it is instructive to go back to the origins of the separation by Henry Dunant and the founding of the Red Cross to understand the foundations of the differentiation in this thinking to see how this essentialist distinction risks losing its relevance. My interest comes from a strong belief in a rejection of binary distinctions in general, as cogently articulated by Rob Walker in his critique of modern, liberal subjectivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0304375412469315">32</xref></sup> Specifically, I would like to examine the religious antecedents of the binary distinction through an examination of the early life of Henry Dunant and his radical Protestantism. While the ICRC and humanitarianism in general are certainly not based on a specific religious tenet, as Caroline Morehead observes, there is no question that the early religious background of Dunant affected his perception of what he saw at Solférino and how he envisaged the work of the ICRC. The Cathedral of St. Pierre was not far from his apartment.</p>
<p>Current discussions about politicizing humanitarianism or bemoaning that reality accept a distinction that has a very particular religious orientation. To say that humanitarianism is separate from the political comes from a very specific theological reading that has come to be accepted in general discourse, but is not at all obvious when closely examined. Indeed, Gary Bass’ highly detailed description of the origins of humanitarian intervention in the nineteenth century is so biased toward imperial infighting that he does not even mention Dunant or the ICRC.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0304375412469315">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>I will do this in the following section in four parts. First, I will describe the general environment of Geneva during Dunant’s youth, with specific emphasis on the Protestant Reformation and the evangelical movement he was part of. Next, I will concentrate on Dunant’s life itself and the importance of religion in his upbringing. A special section will examine the Réveil and the role it played in Dunant’s life and thinking. Finally, I will make some observations about the effect of these ideas on the creation of the Red Cross and the historical foundations of humanitarianism in Geneva before making some general conclusions about the tragic through the specificity of Dunant’s Protestantism and its relevance to humanitarianism and the political.</p>

<title>Geneva, Henry Dunant’s Early Life<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0304375412469315">34</xref></sup> with the Réveil Movement and the Founding of the Red Cross</title>
<p>In her recent biography of Henry Dunant, Corinne Chaponnière describes his background as follows: </p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Born in 1828 into a Geneva bourgeois family with certain unequivocal baggage, Dunant is marked from his youth by the Protestantism of his family, their milieu and that of the city, which gave him a template unto the world which was not just religious, as most children of the 19th century, but most of all <italic>confessional</italic>. The division in the Christian world between Catholics and Protestants was particularly evident in Geneva. Dunant never got rid of that distinction, neither in his apprehension of the world, nor in the complicated game of alliances and suspicions . . . From his attitude towards the wounded at Solférino in 1859 up to his refusal of a minister at the hour of his death, Henry Dunant was intimately marked by the religion of his time . . .<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0304375412469315">35</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The story of the life of Henry Dunant is not without relevance to the radical binary separation of politics from humanitarianism. Some observations on his life are therefore pertinent to our discussion. It should be noted from the beginning that there is a certain reluctance for historians and biographers to connect Dunant’s early religious activities and the general milieu of his time with the founding of the Red Cross. Part of this is due to a fear of presenting the Red Cross as a religious organization and its representatives as proselytizers in any way. The emblem of the ICRC, after all, is a cross. Indeed, in a short twenty-three-page biography of Henry Dunant by Pierre Boissier, former Director of the Henry Dunant Institute, there is only one paragraph about Dunant’s involvement in the Réveil and YMCA religious movements which played such an important role in his early life as well as the tempestuous religious tensions in Geneva at the time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0304375412469315">36</xref></sup></p>

<p>What was Geneva like in the period of Henry Dunant? Geneva was an independent republic until 1798 when it was annexed to France during the Napoleonic Wars, not only losing its independence but 6/7 of its new population was Catholic. There was a general fear among the population of losing their Protestant, Calvinist identity and the specificity of Geneva as the Rome of Protestantism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0304375412469315">39</xref></sup> Geneva was politically freed from the Napoleonic Empire in 1813 and became a separate Republic. In 1815, it joined the Swiss Confederation to become the 22nd canton. The implications of these events for us are twofold. First, in the new Constitution Geneva had to absorb a Catholic population included in the French and Savoyard territories along Lake Geneva at the Congress of Vienna. As a consequence, second, many Genevans wished to return to the Protestant establishment that had existed before the French Revolution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0304375412469315">40</xref></sup> Indeed, the French Revolution had imparted ideas of the importance of the liberty of conscience which threatened much of the hierarchical authority of established churches and can be seen as the impetus behind many of the Réveil movements in Europe, certainly those in France and Switzerland. As described by Olivier Fatio:</p>

<p>In reaction to the rationalist piety of the Enlightenment, with its emphasis on morality, the early nineteenth century witnessed the rebirth of a more fervent faith, tinged with a mysticism influenced by English Methodism, and founded on the principles of the Reformation . . . During the French restoration, a number of evangelical movements and free churches appeared in Geneva, which contributed to the renewal of the Reformed movement but divided and weakened the historical Church of Geneva.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0304375412469315">41</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The results of this political activity had enormous consequences for Dunant. The Geneva of his youth was filled with tensions concerning the determination of the role of religion in political life; the separation of church and state was a vibrant issue at the time. In addition, and most importantly, there was the question of the nature of religion itself. On one hand was the question of the integration of the new Catholic population into traditional Protestant Geneva. On the other hand, there was a revival or awakening (Réveil) with its call for piety and ecclesiastical reform to separate itself from the National Protestant Church as well as the Catholic Church.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0304375412469315">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>As described by John Roney, “By the early 1830s, three distinctive groups or parties (parti) emerged, two Protestant and one Catholic, that had a vested interest in redefining the meaning of the Reformation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0304375412469315">43</xref></sup> The larger and most established of the parties was the National Protestant Church which was in favor of a plural society under the influence of a State Church. Within the Protestant party developed the Réveil that sought to reform individual religious beliefs and practices. The tensions between the National Protestant Church and the Réveil movement increased throughout the early period of Dunant’s life as he became more and more involved in and a leader of the splinter movement.</p>

<p>Even at the end of his life when he refused a Christian burial and was against the formal Church, Dunant was a true believer. He was born into what might be considered the landed bourgeoisie of Geneva in what has been described as a most comfortable childhood. Indeed, it was so comfortable that Roger Durand goes so far as to call it bordering on “the otherworldly.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0304375412469315">45</xref></sup> He was a mediocre if not poor student at the Collège Calvin who excelled and won prizes for religion in 6eme as well as first prize in 5eme and 4eme. He was dismissed from the Collège at 14 for having twice failed the year.</p>
<p>Dunant lunched every day during Collège with the sister of his father near the Cathedral. She was a member of the Evangelical Society which had grown as a form of reformation within the Reformation, and was a member of the Society from 1837 until her death in 1856. Listening to the speeches of the Pasteur Gaussen,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0304375412469315">46</xref></sup> Dunant was drawn to the community which met in the Chapel of the Oratory in the Old Town in what has been described as “those crazies of Evangelism who assemble in the Réveil . . . ”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0304375412469315">47</xref></sup> At age twenty, Henry Dunant entered into the Alms Society, visiting the poor, and passing his Sunday afternoons reading the Bible with condemned prisoners for the next five years.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1847, while walking in the Alps with two friends, Dunant had a spiritual moment resembling a conversion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0304375412469315">48</xref></sup> Upon returning to Geneva, the three decided to meet every Thursday evening to read the Bible together and pray. The Evangelical Society was growing in numbers and easily opened its doors to Dunant and his young friends. </p>
<p>Dunant began communicating with other similar evangelical groups in England, France, Germany, Holland, and the United States. He played a founding role in the formation of the Christian Union in Geneva in 1852 as an extension of the Thursday meetings, and he became the secretary-correspondent at the age of twenty-four, assuming the role of the active leader, recruiting new members as well as continuing to animate the Thursday meetings. Dunant was much more than just a secretary writing letters for the Union. As described by Roger Durand, “He provided a quarter of the initial capital and recruited nearly half the new members. He galvanized his fellow-disciples as well as his ‘brothers in Christ’.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0304375412469315">49</xref></sup> Members of the Christian Union continued to maintain close contact with the Evangelical Society.</p>
<p>Not content with only a Geneva movement, Dunant was instrumental in the creation of the international YMCA in 1855 in association with other evangelical groups which had initially met in London in 1846.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0304375412469315">50</xref></sup> He was present at the founding meeting in Paris in 1855, and he is often spoken of as one of the most distinguished and influential of the ninety-nine young representatives.

</disp-quote>
<p>What was this Réveil or Revival or Awakening movement? First, and foremost, it must be distinguished from Catholicism. As Roney states, “The Reformed Church in Geneva considered itself to be a better expression of the pure Church than the corrupted Catholic Church it replaced . . . ”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0304375412469315">53</xref></sup> By 1860, there were 43,000 Catholics and 41,000 Protestants in the canton of Geneva.</p>
<p>The Franco-Swiss Réveil was part of a larger movement that had its roots in Germany, Scotland, and England and which spread on the Continent after Napoleon’s fall.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0304375412469315">54</xref></sup> In general, it was a reaction to the rationalism of the Enlightenment. In Switzerland, it was a movement begun around 1814 that was within the Swiss Reformed Protestant Church and was started by young students, many studying theology and from modest backgrounds, who were dissatisfied with their teachers. Already in 1817 there were tensions between the traditional theological faculty and the young students and splinter groups.</p>
<p>In other words, having seen the Reformation delineate itself from Catholicism, the supporters of the Réveil accused the Protestant Church of not being truly Christian, and established a separate church based on a strict religious way of life. Most of the followers left the State church in 1831 to set up the Evangelical Society of Geneva based on piety and ecclesiastical reform.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0304375412469315">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>The followers of the Réveil believed in inspiration directly from God and were close to movements such as Transcendentalism in the United States. Crucial to the followers was a direct relationship with God outside a formal Church as well as a certain separation from others. Indeed, “Naming themselves and their enemies became an important part of developing a new identity: The Genevese called themselves ‘Evangelicals,’ a direct reference to Scripture as the sole authority . . . Calvinists believed that they were a people chosen by God in the tradition of both the primitive church and the original covenant given to the Israelites.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0304375412469315">56</xref></sup> Geneva took on many aspects of a New Jerusalem for the reformers.</p>
<p>What we are talking about in terms of the distinct form of religion that formed the early life of Henry Dunant is a series of separations. The first is the separation with Catholicism and the influx and influence of Catholics during the Napoleonic times. Second is the separation from the Reformed Church of Geneva<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0304375412469315">57</xref></sup> within the evangelical movement. And, third, there is even a separation within the evangelical groups. As Roney states, “By the 1830’s the most influential Réveil group was a congregation meeting in the Chapelle de l’Oratoire under the leadership of Gaussen, Jean Merle d’Aubigné and Antoine Galland . . . They founded the Société évangélique de Genève as an organization to promote traditional orthodoxy, Bible study, and evangelization . . . .”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0304375412469315">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, in the new Geneva Constitution of 1847, the National Protestant Church no longer had the status of the only National Church and some Protestants of the Réveil formed the Free Evangelical Church of Geneva, many of whom had left or been forced out of the National Church such as the Pastors Gaussen. Merle D’Aubigné and Gallard, who had been dismissed from their ministries in 1831.</p>
<p>The basis of the differences between the National Church and Geneva Evangelical Society focus on two points of interest for us. The first is the very nature of the original Reformation. It is important to note here that the primary criticism of the Catholic Church during this period was its corruption, and not just in Rome. For just as we have referred previously to the Realist notion of moral man in an immoral society in a fallen world, the Reformation clearly changed the political landscape away from domination by corrupt Rome and its institutions and representatives throughout Europe. This both churches seem to have agreed upon.</p>
<p>The second reformation period in Geneva after the fall of Napoleon, sometimes called the Radical or Evangelical Reformation, is slightly different and saw disagreements between the two churches. It is relevant to quote Roney at length for the necessary background:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Geneva became known as the New Jerusalem, a promised land for God’s people who had wandered in the desert of persecution. As a chosen people, Cellérier affirmed, they ‘quit their family and <italic>patrie</italic> in order to go as Abraham, where God led them, thinking: go to Geneva; the conscience of Protestantism is free there.’  . . . Whether part of the established church or the parties of the <italic>Réveil</italic>, reference to the Reformed Church of Geneva as the chosen people and Israel was clearly part of their identity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0304375412469315">59</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The question that raised tension between the National Church and the Réveil was the very nature of the original reformation and the relevance of Calvin to the nineteenth century. For the National Church, Calvin’s teachings were somewhat historically situated, relevant to the period of his time wherein the great battle was against the Catholic Church. In this sense, the National Church looked favorably on Calvin’s teachings related to loyalty to Church and Bible and less to confessions of individual conscience and catechisms. The Church, obviously, was worried about its authority and the authoritative role of conscience as the voice of God.</p>
<p>For the Réveil, the Calvin of his confessions was as relevant in the nineteenth century as they were originally. The “orthodoxy” of the Réveil was “centered on the divinity of Christ and his atonement of for sins that they found to be unmistakably the central teaching of the Bible and the Christian Church in every century.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0304375412469315">60</xref></sup> If the Evangelical Society found legitimacy in the individual and individual confessions, what was to happen to the authority of the National Church if instead of conscience authority rested on confessions? The use of the Book of Daniel is particularly relevant here and an apocalyptic vision of God directly involved in saving man without going to the Church as intermediary.</p>
<p>Also important is the relation of the Church to the state. The National Protestant Church was an official church with a very political role in Geneva. The Réveil was a reform movement based more on direct prayers, Gospel and Scripture as the sole authority among its members rather than a formal organization, although certain members of the Réveil did form The Free Evangelical Church of Geneva in 1849. The new Geneva Constitution of 1847 revoked the official status of the National Protestant Church as the center of church/state relations in Geneva, although the Church continued to play an important role and to be paid by the State.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0304375412469315">61</xref></sup> And, it is interesting to note that in both the ICRC and the YMCA Dunant clung to the notion of loose, decentralized organizations based on good works, rather than a formal hierarchical structure intimately interwoven with any political environment. Individuals and small groups were the center, distinctly outside of the political.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0304375412469315">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>This is how Alice Wemyss cites the relation between the religious ideas of the Réveil and the revolt against the church and the political in this world:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the elements of this revolt is the refusal of ecclesiastical institutions. But as the absence of any organization inevitably leads to anarchy, the sects usually adopted a Congregationalist system where each group formed an independent community which elected and chose spiritual leaders . . . The sect was essentially ‘anti-world.’ ‘The moral rigor, the asceticism in the sects, the absolute value given to certain prohibitions . . . are clear signals of the refusal of this world. The world is bad; it must be escaped.’ This escape sometimes went so far as a total rupture . . . .<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0304375412469315">63</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To return to my description of moral man in immoral society and the notion of the fallen world, it is noteworthy that the tradition of the revival movements was closely intertwined with a decline of faith among European Protestants, especially in Francophone Europe. Kenneth Stewart, in tracing the history of this decline, cites a work by the Swiss Pastor and theologian Jean Frédérick Ostervald already in 1700 entitled “Treatise Concerning the Causes of the Present Corruption of Christians.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0304375412469315">64</xref></sup> Stewart describes the decline and resurgence of French-speaking Protestantism from the seventeenth to early nineteenth centuries as follows: “Evidently the religious and political struggles of the seventeenth century had left the population of Europe sated with religious controversy; the Christian faith was now neglected in consequence.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0304375412469315">65</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section8-0304375412469315">
<title>Relation to the Red Cross</title>
<disp-quote>
<p> . . . Dunant was an evangelical and fundamentalist Christian, and the origin of the Geneva committee was steeped in notions of Christian charity and good works.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0304375412469315">66</xref></sup></p>
<p> . . . it is Christianity and Christian faith-based organizations that so far have had the most significant influence on contemporary humanitarian action. They were present at the creation—usually dated to the nineteenth century—and, in fact, helped to give it life. The various ‘awakenings’ fed into new kinds of social reform movements: Quakers and evangelicals took the lead in abolitionism, various missionaries were in the forefront of trying to improve the lives of those at home and the colonized, and faith-based organizations were prominent in delivering relief to victims of war and natural disasters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0304375412469315">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was within the Réveil’s youth organizations that Jean-Henri Dunant, founder of the Red Cross . . . received his inspiration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0304375412469315">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>Founded in 1864, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), through its apolitical practices and principles, has shined as a beacon of humanitarianism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0304375412469315">69</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>David Forsythe is a political scientist, and much of his book on the Red Cross deals with the politics and policy of the ICRC. This article seeks to develop a deeper understanding of what this meant and means, but again we see an extensive history of the ICRC with little mention of religion in Dunant’s background. The specific question that must be asked concerns the character of Dunant’s evangelicals and the humanitarianism he advocated. While I agree with Michael Barnett that “Evangelism provided a calling for public action and social reform,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0304375412469315">70</xref></sup> it is the very nature of evangelism and movements like the Réveil<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0304375412469315">71</xref></sup> which caused the inherent tensions in humanitarian action and the frustration of those today who straddle the border between the humanitarian and the political.</p>
<p>In describing the spiritual basis of the Red Cross, Maurice Lador quotes the Pastor Frank Thomas, “ . . . it was in the nest of the momiers that was born the idea of the Red Cross.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0304375412469315">72</xref></sup> Indeed, it was the Evangelical Society which had brought assistance to foreign armies not directly involved in conflicts with Switzerland. The Interim President of the Red Cross, Edouard Naville, is quoted by Lador as saying in remembering June 29, 1859; “It is not the Evangelical Society that had the idea of the Red Cross, but one could say that it prepared the grounds . . . ”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0304375412469315">73</xref></sup> The Evangelical Society was in no means a philanthropic institution, although good social works were very much a part of Geneva religious activities at that time,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0304375412469315">74</xref></sup> and its concern for others and service led to the creation of “The Committee for the Wounded” in 1859 following the famous reprinting of Dunant’s letter describing the battlefield suffering at Solférino in a local newspaper. Henry Dunant was named “Member of the Committee on the Spot.” Members of the Committee left on a mission which lasted seven weeks. They included several students of Gaussen. The Committee itself met seven times in one month and was dissolved at the end of the war. Nonetheless, it could be surmised that this was the first neutral, international mission to help the wounded and could be considered a precursor of the ICRC based on religious ideals. Indeed, of the five founding members of the committee of the Red Cross who met near the Cathedral, two, Henry Dunant and Louis Appia, were members of the Committee for the Wounded of the Evangelical Society.</p>
<p>On a more practical and personal level, it is interesting to note the following comment by Gustave Moynier on his first meeting with Dunant and the beginning of the creation of the Red Cross:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I thought that he must have reflected on how to realize his dream and that he could perhaps give me some helpful suggestions with regard to establishing the institution that, until then, he was the only one to have thought of. In the latter regard, I have to admit that I was mistaken, as I caught him off guard, before, he assured me, he had conceived the slightest plan for the implementation of his invention.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0304375412469315">75</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>So, there is ample evidence that Dunant was an idealist, in many ways a “romantic humanitarian,” although Gabriel Mützenberg goes to some pain to show how he participated in “real” activities such as interacting two or three times a month with orphans invited to play in his garden or visiting the poor or helping the blind.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0304375412469315">76</xref></sup> There are certainly other examples of his realism, such as his intensive lobbying before the major meeting of the YMCA in 1855. Many of these personal traits can be found in Dunant’s description of the Battle of Soférino<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0304375412469315">77</xref></sup> and a close reading of the text is highly informative. It is in his very words that we can understand Dunant’s reactions to the realities of war, and hence his vision of what humanitarianism should be and the nature of his imagined community of humanitarians.</p>
<p>The first part of his account is full of laudatory comments about the soldiers in the battle. Positive descriptions abound: “the brave and dauntless Field Marshall Benedek,” “brave troops,” “indescribable fighting,” “resisted with indomitable energy,” “enthusiasm,” “glorious,” brilliant,” “Nothing could stop these men,” “admirable calm and self-possession.” Heroism is everywhere:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Lieutenant de Guiseul, carrying his regimental flag, was surrounded with his battalion by a force ten times the size of his own. He was shot down, and as he rolled on the ground he clutched his precious charge to his heart. A sergeant who seized the flag to save it from the enemy had his head blown off by a cannon-ball; a captain who next grasped the flag-staff was wounded too, and his blood stained the torn and broken banner. Each man who held it was wounded, one after another, officers and soldiers alike, but it was guarded to the last with a wall of dead and living bodies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0304375412469315">78</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Then, abruptly, from the heroic descriptions of the battle with no negative judgment except for consistent praise for heroism and strength of character, there comes this phrase from a totally different perspective: “From the midst of all this fighting, which went on and on all over the battlefield, arose the oaths and curses of men of all different nations engaged—men, many of whom had been made into murderers at the age of twenty!”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0304375412469315">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>How had they become murderers? Where does this negative comment come from after all the positive identification with honor and heroism in the previous descriptions of the battle? After all, at Solférino nearly 40,000 men were killed in just fifteen hours of fighting. There are two separate worlds here: the observation of the battle with admiration for the participants and suddenly the drastic descriptions of the horrors of the wounded and dead. There is absolutely no politics here, neither in the lack of description of the causes of the battle nor in the description of the fighting itself. There is no preparation for this sentence, or for what comes after. What caused the men to become murderers?</p>
<p>Dunant radically moves from the battlefield as a venue for competing forces for domination to the horrible consequences of that heroism in his descriptions of the equally heroic actions of those helping the wounded and dead, beginning, of course, with the religious workers such as the chaplain of Napoleon’s army. Keywords are now “consolation,” “sympathy,” “martyrs,” “harassed, “groans,” “stifled sighs of anguish and suffering,” “tragic,“ “suffering,” “agony,” “Heart rendering voices kept calling for help,” “There were solemn scenes and pathetic episodes . . . .” Instead of heroism in clutching the flag, we now have a very different type of heroism: “A Hungarian officer saw one of his men aiming at the boy; the officer stopped him, and then, going up to the wounded man, wrung his hand compassionately and gave orders for him to be carried to a safer place.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0304375412469315">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>He goes on and on to describe the generosity and devotion of those caring for the wounded and dead. The heroic field becomes a place of slaughter; the situation of those lying wounded is catastrophic. Little medical attention, often no food or water, comes to be the reality of those left alive after the fighting. “A son idolized by his parents, brought up and cherished for years by a loving mother who trembled with alarm over his slightest ailment; a brilliant officer, beloved by his family, with a wife and children at home; a young soldier who had left a sweetheart or mother, sisters or old father to go to war; all lie stretched in the mud and dust, drenched in their own blood!”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0304375412469315">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dunant’s admiration for the heroism of the fighting men now turns to compassion for those who were wounded, with little attention to the fact that the day’s wounded were yesterday’s murderers. There is a rapid change from the observer’s perception of the heroism of the fighters to his compassion for the wounded, with no relation between the two. Battle is battle, and there seems to be no point in trying to stop it. On the contrary, the heroism shown by the warriors is to be admired. And, with the wounded and prisoners, there is to be compassion, with no accounting for their previous actions or what brought them to this state. Even if they were murderers, they are to be taken care of as wounded or prisoners with no discrimination.</p>
<p>What are the attitudes of the wounded or those captured by the enemy? They seemed to bear no ill will to their conquerors. “ . . . most of them were by no means ungrateful or refractory to kindness, and sincere gratitude might be seen on their surprised faces.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0304375412469315">82</xref></sup> Dunant speaks of the captured with great sympathy, as if they had been forced into service, forced into battle against their will. He deals with them and their suffering completely divorced from politics, from the reasons for their being there. Just as he had extolled the heroism of the soldiers, he is filled with compassion for their situation as prisoners or wounded.</p>
<p>In ways, perhaps similar to what he had had on the mountaintop during his conversion experience, Dunant writes the following as he reflects on the horrors of war: “The moral sense of the importance of human life; the humane desire to lighten a little the torments of all those poor wretches, or restore their shattered courage; the furious and relentless activity which a man summons up at such moments: all these combine to create a kind of energy which gives one a positive craving to relieve as many as one can.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0304375412469315">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the battle ends and some form of normalcy returns, people are treated kindly, towns are transformed into hospitals, and beds are improvised for the wounded. The heroism on the battle is now transformed into mercy, with officers even distributing their wealth to the men. A more idyllic situation could not be imagined once the horrors of the war are excluded. But again, absolutely no politics, everything is on another scale. All social classes are involved. “The humblest widow, the poorest old crone, felt it her duty to go herself, with her tribute of sympathy and her modest offering.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0304375412469315">84</xref></sup> “One great lady of Milan, the bearer of a historic name, had placed one of her palaces at the disposal of the wounded, with 150 beds in it . . .  and hearing the sad story of a Grenadier and his family went immediately off to give them money and bring the mother back to be near her wounded, dying son.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0304375412469315">85</xref></sup> Generosity abounds in the face of tragedy by all involved, especially religious figures.</p>
<p>The heroic becomes transformed metaphorically in the chivalrous role of women admiring the heroes and then welcoming the wounded, as Dunant describes the return from Solférino by the ladies: “The gracious and lovely young ladies of the aristocracy, made lovelier still by the exaltation of passionate enthusiasm, were no longer scattering rose-leaves from the beflagged balconies of sumptuous palaces to fall on glittering shoulder-straps, on silk and ribbons, and gold and enamel crosses; from their eyes now fell burning tears, born of painful emotion and of compassion, which quickly turned to Christian devotion, patient and self-sacrificing.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0304375412469315">86</xref></sup> What chivalry! How romantic!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0304375412469315">87</xref></sup></p>
<p>Having described the heroism of battle, the horrors of the wounded, dying, dead, and captured, and the Christian devotion of those tending to the wounded and captured, Dunant poses a simple question: “Would it not be possible, in time of peace and quiet, to form relief societies for the purpose of having care given to the wounded in wartime by zealous, devoted and thoroughly qualified volunteers?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0304375412469315">88</xref></sup> He goes through numerous examples, often religious, of people who had shown devotion to the wounded and sick during wartime, with the highest praise for Florence Nightingale.</p>
<p>But, the lack of the political remains predominant and there is a certain acceptance of wars and what causes war when he writes “ . . . in an age when we hear so much of progress and civilization, is it not a matter of urgency, since unhappily we cannot always avoid wars, to press forward in a human and truly civilized spirit the attempt to prevent, or at least alleviate, the horrors of war?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0304375412469315">89</xref></sup> This is the crux of the argument. He is not talking about preventing wars, something that almost all those involved in development or conflict resolution see as primary. The imagined community of Dunant is outside the political realities that trigger wars, “since unhappily we cannot always avoid wars.” He conceives of societies that will deal only with alleviating the horrors of war, but not war itself. There is absolutely no room here for prevention or dealing with root causes of conflict.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>It is difficult to imagine how humanitarian assistance could remain fully neutral in complex emergencies . . . Aid in complex emergencies is always determined by a highly politicized context and has political implications itself, whether as a direct consequence of its provisions or by way of intentional or unintentional side-effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0304375412469315">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>Terrible things happen all the time to people who did nothing to deserve such fates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0304375412469315">91</xref></sup></p>
<p>We live in an age in which personal moral idealism is easily accused of hypocrisy and frequently deserves it. It is an age in which honesty is only possible when it skirts the edges of cynicism. All this is rather tragic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0304375412469315">92</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To pierce the veil of the binary humanitarian/political in trying to understand the religious background is not to deny that the veil has benefits. I have tried to point to some of its implications without a cost–benefit analysis. What would it mean to have the imagined border removed? What are the benefits of trying to keep politics out of humanitarianism?</p>
<p>When Thomas Weiss refers to “The intersection of politics and humanitarianism—obvious to elected officials, pundits, and political scientists—but not to classicists . . . ”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0304375412469315">93</xref></sup> he poses more than just an obvious problem. For the intersection haunts both classicists and political humanitarians by the very nature of being posited. Is political humanitarianism an oxymoron? We have tried to show peculiarities of the classical model by going back to some of its religious bases. For to say that Dunant and his conception of the ICRC had an imagined community from his religious beliefs that was grounded in radical Protestant theology and decidedly nonpolitical is not to deny the benefits of that community as well as the risks that political humanitarianism runs by being too involved in this world. Tensions between absolute and situational ethicists are certainly not new; charitable activities can be counterproductive just as political humanitarianism can wind up being nonhumanitarian.</p>
<p>Discussions about differentiating between relief and development or gaps between the two are fundamental to this debate and very much reflective of Dunant’s worldview. He never tried to change the world in a Wilsonian sense: the world was dark and in many ways fallen and there was nothing to be done about that. What could be done, on the other hand, was to maximize relief to those in need during and around conflicts. Stopping the conflict itself or trying to prevent future conflicts was not part of his theological background.</p>
<p>“If humanitarianism claims the moral high ground, politics occupies the nether terrain because it refers to jockeying for power, prestige, and a piece of the pie.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0304375412469315">94</xref></sup> While it is certainly true that the very nature of conflict has changed since Dunant’s descriptions of the noble conflict on the battlefield of Solférino and the noble efforts of relief workers, we are also much more skeptical today in our vision of goodness and charity and we are much more aware of moral hazards. Political realities are more a part of our daily lives. We are more cynical in our judgments of what it means to do a good deed and we are often reduced to merely trying to do no harm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0304375412469315">95</xref></sup> But staying above the political is exactly what Dunant’s imagined community was all about.</p>
<p>Does classical humanitarianism and political neutrality have a place in this world? The answer, I believe, is a resounding yes. The difficulty is in the very separation of activities. Those involved in humanitarian activities along the lines of Dunant would do well to read his description of the limited role of humanitarianism. The religious background of Dunant, as I have tried to explain, was very much otherworldly; he had no further agenda. Those who wish to follow the humanitarian principles he founded must accept the situation on the ground as it is; there is no pretense of more or less. The world, for the true Realists,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0304375412469315">96</xref></sup> is as it is. Fundamental change will not take place. This is the tragic worldview that is such an integral part of Dunant’s imagined community, and one that is so frustrating to those who want to change the world.</p>
<p>The politicization of humanitarian action has its own rationale. But, there is no question that it is a very different one than that which drove Dunant and that which led to the creation of the ICRC as well as the YMCA. The irony that we are pointing to here is that for most writers on humanitarianism, the binary split is between politics and humanitarianism. For most writers on politics, the binary split is between politics and ethics. The relation between the two splits comes from a similar tragic view of this world and what is possible. Dunant’s theological, radical Protestantism is very close to the ethical position of the classical realists, as described by Richard Ned Lebow. One can only read Dunant’s <italic>A Memory of Solférino</italic> in its descriptions of the nobility of the warriors and assistance workers if one is within the tragic sense of history. Innocent men were turned into murderers, bucolic towns were turned into hospitals; lives were lost and crushed.</p>
<p>But, there was heroism everywhere as men and women struggled. Tragedy exists in the very effort to overcome the inevitable. Modern political humanitarians cannot accept that reality. They try to overcome wars and suffering by attempting to understand the causes of war,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0304375412469315">97</xref></sup> with its alleviation the ultimate goal. The tragic view begins quite differently, and as Lebow has stated, “The modern academy has introduced a false dichotomy between political and moral behavior and political and moral theorizing.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0304375412469315">98</xref></sup> Dunant was not a problem solver in the current sense; his problem solving involved getting relief to victims, nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>It is the hubris of modern man to try to find the causes of war to try to stop them. Dunant came from a totally different tradition that understood man’s limitations. His religious background, associated with Calvin’s confessions and the Réveil, was deeply rooted in a tragic vision of man’s limitations. This is how Ned Lebow defines these differences in Ancient Greece and helps us to understand how it relates to Dunant as well:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Greeks distinguished between <italic>techne</italic> and <italic>sophia</italic>. The former described practical knowledge, of the kind that enabled people to fashion things, cure illnesses and reach concrete goals . . . Socrates applied <italic>techne</italic> more broadly to the social realm . . . In his search for knowledge, Socrates professed to be greatly impressed by the genius of craftsmen (<italic>tecknikos</italic>) . . . Modern social science aspires to produce knowledge in the form of <italic>episteme</italic>. As understood by Aristotle, <italic>episteme</italic> consisted of propositions and theories that facilitate explanation and prediction. Unlike Aristotle, modern social science mistakenly considers <italic>episteme</italic> the final goal of knowledge. This is a variant of the error of ancient craftsmen who equated limited forms of knowledge with wisdom (<italic>sophia</italic>). For the tragedians . . . <italic>sophia</italic> describes an understanding of life that goes beyond discrete knowledge to grasp and integrate deeper meanings . . . And as Aristotle reminds us, the most universal things are the hardest to know, for they are the farthest from the senses. For the playwrights, tragic wisdom starts from the premise that suffering cannot fully be explained by justice. Recognition of this truth, and of the limited ability of either knowledge or power to protect us from suffering, is the first step toward acquiring wisdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0304375412469315">99</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>What is the relationship between the tragic as understood by the Greeks and classical realists and religion? And eventually Dunant and humanitarianism? A most helpful avenue here is to mention two works by Reinhold Niebuhr. The first, <italic>Moral Man and Immoral Society</italic>, already referred to, highlights the cleavage between the individual as a potential moral agent and immoral society and nations, that which can turn the moral man into a murderer. As Niebuhr states quite clearly in the beginning, “The thesis to be elaborated in these pages is that a sharp distinction must be drawn between the moral and social behavior of individuals and of social groups, national, racial, and economic . . . ”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0304375412469315">100</xref></sup> He attributes the lack of group morality to “the order of nature and can never be brought completely under the dominion of conscience or reason.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0304375412469315">101</xref></sup> Like Lebow, he bemoans the attempts by social science to find immutable laws to improve mankind, in the manner of John Dewey at the time. And, like Dunant, Niebuhr believes that conflict is inevitable, arguing that only the use of power can offset social injustices. Quite bluntly, he states, “What is lacking among all these moralists, whether religious or rational, is an understanding of the brutal character of the behavior of all human collectivities, and the power of self-interest and collective egoism in all inter-group relations.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0304375412469315">102</xref></sup></p>
<p>Niebuhr is arguing against religious idealism, against the euphoria of the interwar period and the hopes of the League of Nations and perpetual peace. He also argues against the idealism of fascism, communism, and even the rationality of Henry Ford. Specifically, in terms of international relations, he is arguing against the hypocrisy of using moral language to justify the obvious self-interest of states. For the individual, the highest moral value is disinterested selflessness. For society, the highest moral value is justice. For Niebuhr, religion emphasizes the former, with attempts to harmonize the two running the risk of “deleterious social consequences,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0304375412469315">103</xref></sup> as much of the literature on political humanitarianism and attempts to do no harm have shown.</p>
<p>As he clearly argues, Niebuhr believed that “Pure religious idealism does not concern itself with the social problem . . . This type of moral idealism leads either to asceticism . . . or at least to the complete disavowal of any political responsibility . . . ”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0304375412469315">104</xref></sup> We are very far here from the Ancient Greek notion of the polis or the liberal tradition of citizenship. The imagined community of humanitarians created by Dunant in Geneva is not at all related to traditional political conceptions of what it means to be human. Contrast Dunant’s vision with Lebow’s description of this tradition:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p> . . . the Anglo-American liberal traditions looked back to Aristotle and his conception of human beings as political animals who could only find fulfillment in the life of the polis. Poleis were created and sustained by affection and friendship . . . because these bonds encourage us to define our happiness in terms of the well-being of our family, friends and fellow-citizens. <italic>Philoi</italic> constitute expanding circles of affective networks that cumulatively add up to the civic project . . . <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0304375412469315">105</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>What is the relationship between Lebow’s sense of tragedy and its relation to politics and religion? Here again Niebuhr is helpful and important. In a series of essays, what he calls “sermonic essays,” Niebuhr lays out a possibility for a resolution between what he distinguishes between man within history and “the centric, source and fulfillment of history beyond history.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0304375412469315">106</xref></sup> Niebuhr is concerned, as he theologically must, with what he refers to as “a dualism between an eternal and spiritual world without content and a temporal world without meaning or significance.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0304375412469315">107</xref></sup> This, as we have seen, echoes the tension between the Dunantists and the Wilsonians, between the classical humanitarians and the political humanitarians.</p>
<p>Niebuhr’s resolution of the tension is in the atonement of Christ. As he says, “Without the cross men are beguiled by what is good in human existence into a false optimism and by what is tragic into despair.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0304375412469315">108</xref></sup> It is the figure of Christ that shows how God became man and overcame the tragic and the sense of despair. He notes, “Yet this crucifixion becomes the revelation of that in human history which transcends human striving. And without this revelation, that which is beyond tragedy in life could not have been apprehended.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0304375412469315">109</xref></sup> Indeed, for Niebuhr, “Christianity is a religion which transcends tragedy.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0304375412469315">110</xref></sup></p>
<p>But the tragic is ever present in Niebuhr’s thinking. In his wonderful sermonic essay on “Christianity and Tragedy,” he describes the closeness of Greek tragedy to his vision of Christian tragedy and traces truly heroic figures in Ibsen and Shakespeare, figures who have loyalty and courage, and who enter into this world with all the power and faults of humanity. In turning to Greek drama for the “purest conception of tragedy,” Niebuhr notes that “in pure tragedy the suffering is self-inflicted.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0304375412469315">111</xref></sup> That is, it is man with all his powers of courage and imagination who reaches out to bring order to the world but fails because of the very insufficiencies in his own being without help from the infinite.</p>
<p>In his description of the tragic, Niebuhr captures much of what we have analyzed in our exegesis of Dunant’s text about Solférino. Dunant, as you remember, waxed so positively about the heroes of the battle as well as the heroes of the humanitarian helpers. Niebuhr captures succinctly the close relationship of the Christian view of life and Greek tragedy as seen in Dunant’s description:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In that sense Greek tragedy is both romantic and aristocratic: romantic because it affirms the whole of life . . . ; aristocratic because only a few titans and heroes dare to break the bounds which check ordinary men. Greek tragedy declares that the vitality of life is in conflict with the laws of life . . . However wide and deep the differences which separate the Christian view of life from that of Greek tragedy, it is apparent that there are greater similarities between the two than between either and the utilitarian rationalism which has dominated contemporary culture. Both measure life in the same depth; and neither gives itself to the simple delusion that the titanic forces of human existence . . . can easily be brought under the control of some little scheme of prudent rationality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0304375412469315">112</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>How are Niebuhr’s essays helpful in understanding Henry Dunant and his imagined humanitarianism and its tension today with political humanitarianism? Reinhold Niebuhr was very much in this world. While teaching at Union Theological Seminary, he was also a most influential commentator on political affairs, especially dealing with fascism and the Cold War. His influence went well beyond the theological community. Hans Morgenthau’s <italic>Politics Among Nations</italic>, by far the largest best seller on international relations, was dedicated to Reinhold Niebuhr. Niebuhr was an important figure in world politics as well as classical political realism.</p>
<p>Niebuhr is quite clear that human striving for fulfillment is not possible without divine intervention. Those social scientists, so eloquently scoffed at by Lebow, and the humanitarian interventionists who see progress in a brave new world are rejected by Dunant’s refusal to politically enter into this world and Niebuhr’s pessimistic perception that human fulfillment in this world without divine intervention is not possible, his rejection of “some little scheme of prudent rationality.” One can only imagine what Niebuhr would have said about The Responsibility to Protect! As Niebuhr states, “The problem of good and evil cannot be completely resolved in history.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0304375412469315">113</xref></sup> Dunant and Niebuhr both understand the limits of the human in and of itself in different ways, but the contrast with political humanitarians is striking for both.</p>
<p>The imagined humanitarian community of Henry Dunant had a totally different understanding of the theological basis of humanitarianism from Wilsonians’ optimism. The schism between Dunant’s classical humanitarians and the political humanitarians is enormous. Dunant never successfully entered this world, as his business failures and later hermetic existence so evidently testify. While today he is lionized as the creator of the ICRC, in fact it was Gustave Moynier who played the leading role in the early success of the organization. Dunant’s life was truly tragic until he was “discovered” by a journalist while living in poverty alone in northern Switzerland and “resurrected” as a hero and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. In many ways, Dunant never truly entered this world.</p>
<p>This exposé of the life of Dunant and his involvement in both the Réveil movements and the YMCA is meant to show that the imagined community of Dunant and classical humanitarians has a life of its own outside the political. He might have done otherwise, as Niebuhr certainly suggests. But the rigid evangelical Protestant separation between religion and politics did not and does not allow the overcoming of this tension, and hence the tragic sense that Lebow and Niebuhr describe. For all those who bemoan the classic humanitarian position toward politics, it is obvious that going back to the theological origins of Dunant and the Red Cross movement shows that the divide cannot be overcome. It is not just the politics of the political/humanitarian divide that cannot be resolved, but more fundamentally the theological divide as well.</p>
<p>The euphoria of the R2P and its liberal interventionism has recently been played out in Libya. The United Nations Security Council, thanks to abstentions by China and Russia, agreed to protect civilians in Benghazi. That is what the Resolutions clearly called for. However, the aggressive military action for regime change by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and certain countries quickly soured Russia and China; they both recognized that the supposed divide between humanitarianism and the political had been crossed. Soon after the politicization of the intervention became evident, it was condemned by Russia and China. And soon after, as the crisis in Syria unfolded, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said, “Russia will never allow the United Nations Security Council to authorize a Libya-style operation to resolve the political crisis in Syria.” He was further quoted as saying, “The international community unfortunately did take sides in Libya and we would never allow the Security Council to authorize anything similar to what happened in Libya . . . A second Libya would be a disaster for the Arab world and world politics.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-0304375412469315">114</xref></sup> Cornelio Sommaruga, one of the authors of the report on R2P, was even more critical of the Libyan intervention and the crossing of the political/humanitarian divide: “The original terms of the UN resolution were quickly overtaken by events. The responsibility to protect is being murdered.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0304375412469315">115</xref></sup> Even Kofi Annan, who had commissioned the Responsibility to Protect Report and was subsequently named Special Envoy of the United Nations and the Arab League to Syria, admitted, “I will tell you frankly that the way the responsibility to protect was used in Libya created a problem for the concept. Russians and Chinese consider that they were tricked; they adopted a UN Resolution which was transformed into a process of regime change. This was not, according to them, what was initially intended. When we discuss Syria, it is the elephant in the room.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-0304375412469315">116</xref></sup></p>
<p>An investigation into the religious background of Henry Dunant is helpful in reminding political humanitarians as well as those who misunderstand the limited intentions of the R2P of the origins of humanitarianism and the dangers of crossing the political/humanitarian divide. While we sit and watch the destruction taking place in Syria with no simple solution to the humanitarian catastrophe, it is also helpful to go back to Niebuhr and Lebow’s understanding of the tragic which in many ways mirrors Dunant’s vision. This is not to condone Donald Rumsfeld’s famous, “Stuff happens.” It is merely to put humanitarianism in its proper perspective.</p>

<p>The relationship between certain ideas in the nineteenth century, such as the antislavery movement, and Dunant’s radical Protestantism is beyond the scope of this article, but certainly not irrelevant. Dunant did, for example, meet Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of <italic>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</italic>, in Geneva in 1853. For an excellent brief history of humanitarianism, see Michael Barnett and Thomas G. Weiss, “Humanitarianism: A Brief History,” in <italic>Humanitarianism in Question: Politics, Power, Ethics,</italic> ed., Barnett and Weiss, 1–48. The book presents several perspectives on humanitarianism from the social sciences with little on the theological foundations, preferring to discuss certain ethical questions rather than moral questions. Nevertheless, it quite rightly interrogates the fact that “Humanitarian organizations generally present themselves as outside of politics, devoid of power, and ethically chaste . . . ” 36. Some brief references to the relationship between Christianity and humanitarianism can be found in the chapter by Craig Calhoun, “The Imperative to Reduce Suffering: Charity, Progress, and Emergencies in the Field of Humanitarian Action,” 73–97, with no specific reference to the type of Christianity involved.</p>

<p>We focus on Dunant’s early life for two reasons. First, it was during his early life that his activities led to the foundation of the Red Cross and a specific vision of humanitarianism. Second, Dunant, a complex person to say the least, went through a definite change in his ideas about religion in the 1850s, a change that has been attributed to psychological difficulties and his bankruptcy. He remained, however, a devout Christian and follower of many of the ideas and practices of the Réveil. Although Dunant was disillusioned about any form of formal religion toward the end of his life, he never became cynical and remained a devout believer up until his death.

<p>A possible explanation of why Henry Dunant himself did not include more about his early religious experiences is put forth by Gabriel Mützenberg in quoting a letter written by Dunant responding to a critique concerning the lack of religious references in the 4th edition of his book: “You see, Sir, that publicity arrived all by itself . . . I think that I did well to avoid giving to my book a too religious emphasis, or even a Protestant one, since I see that in all of Europe one is interested in the idea of creating societies to help the wounded to be founded in times of peace . . . ” Mützenberg goes on to say, “It is not a question of denial, as a testimony too engaged, to a work which is for the benefit of all humanity. The work is humble and for the glory of God, proclaims Dunant. He is only the modest author. He was called.” Gabriel Mützenberg, <italic>Henry Dunant, Le prédestiné</italic>, 150.

<p>It is in this sense that a Humanitarian Policy Group HPG Briefing states that “Three main historical strands or traditions have been important in the evolution of modern humanitarian action: the religious, the ‘Dunantist’ and the ‘Wilsonian’.” The “Dunantists” are clearly separated from the religious and specifically categorized as being outside of state interests. <italic>HPG Briefing</italic> Number 12, July 2003, 1. Thomas Weiss poses this difference as between “classicists” and “political humanitarians” in “Principles, Politics, and Humanitarian Action,” <italic>Ethics &amp; International Affairs</italic> 13, no. 1 (2006): 2. Another way of posing this would be, in Calhoun’s terms: “Do (humanitarians) seek to improve the human condition, the well-being of all humanity? Or, do they seek to alleviate suffering impartially, neutrally, and wherever it may occur?” Craig Calhoun, “The Imperative to Reduce Suffering: Charity, Progress, and Emergencies in the Field of Humanitarian Action,” in <italic>Humanitarianism in Question</italic>, ed. Barnett and Weiss, 72. The first is obviously Wilsonian, the second Dunantist.</p>

Gaussen was a member of the upper class as were some of his followers and his dismissal by the National Church was not without incident.

<p>Forsythe, <italic>The Humanitarians</italic>, 27. It should be noted, however, as Roger Durand has indicated to me, that several of the founding members of the ICRC such as Appia, Dufour, and Moynier were members of the National Church and not directly associated with the Réveil. Unlike Dunant, they were also part of the dominant political party, the Radicals. Indeed, as the Geneva historian Bernard Lescaze has indicated to me, perhaps one of the reasons why Dunant turned away from the political was because he was part of a generation of the grand bourgeois conservatives who were not included in the Radical Party from 1846 until 1864. In this sense, we are focusing on Dunant himself rather than the entire founding group. However, in a document written on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the ICRC, the President of the Evangelical Society of Geneva wrote in defending the role of the Society and its charitable work as a precursor of the ICRC: “And on the 5 founding members of the ICRC, two were part of the ‘evangelical’ committee of July 1859, the great Henry Dunant and the fervent and efficient Dr. Appia . . . .” M. H. Chautems, “Préface,” Maurice Lador “L’enracinement Spirituel de la Croix Rouge” (Geneve: Société évangélique de Genève 1963), 10. Translation by the author. It is obvious that certain people remained members of the National Church at the same time they participated in Réveil activities and thus the separation between the Church and the Réveil must be understood within the context of the time.</p>

<p>As Chautems brags about the relationship between the Evangelical Society and the idea of the Red Cross: “ . . . it is the seriousness and the joy with which the piety of the Réveil rediscovered the rights and love of God that caused among Christians, laic for the most, that efficient concern for others to help in the circumstances of 1859 . . . ” Chautems, “Préface,” 11.</p>

<p>As noted by Olivier Fatio, “As a direct consequence of revivalism, throughout the nineteenth century, Protestants of all creeds created a profusion of philanthropic institutions aimed at relieving the moral and social miseries of modern civilization.” See Olivier Fatio et al., <italic>Understanding the Reformation</italic>, 84.</p>

<p>Gustave Moynier, cited in Francois Bugnion, <italic>Gustave Moynier</italic> (Geneva: Humanitarian Geneva. 2010), 26. The relationship between Dunant and Moynier was tense at best, as was vividly shown in an exhibit at the Museum of the Red Cross in Geneva from September 22, 2010, to May 8, 2011. In the publicity of the exhibit it is stated that “Although they shared the same cause, history very often opposed Dunant and Moynier. Allies during the early stages, the two men quickly confronted each other on the general orientation of their humanitarian action and then competed to obtain recognition. Motivated by his pragmatism and committed to build a solid structure for the institution, Moynier played an active role in isolating Dunant, the idealist, after his financial difficulties, and prevented him from returning to business to the point of jeopardizing his means of subsistence. This conflict lasted throughout their lives and they never reconciled.” Corinne Chaponniere, in discussions with the author on June 21, 2011, plays down the binary differences between the pragmatic Moynier and the idealistic Dunant, citing Dunant’s lobbying at a Berlin conference in 1863 dealing with the heads of sanitary organizations in Europe to get them to come to Geneva the next month as an example of his political pragmatism. However, as Lador explains, his letters of recommendation as well as the people he met in Berlin were predominantly associated with the evangelical movement. Lador, “L'enracinement...,” 33. Perhaps, it is also interesting to note that Dunant had similar problems with Maximilien Perrot after the founding of the Christian Union.</p>

<p>When Dunant writes of the suffering of the wounded without assistance in a famous letter that appeared on July 8, 1859, in a Geneva newspaper, he writes to the Countess Gasparin-Boissier. Several members of the Boissier family were members in the Evangelical Society and were friends with Gaussen. The Count had given a series of lectures in Geneva organized by the Christian Union. In fact, upon reading the letter in the Geneva newspaper, Merle d’Aubigné talks before the Evangelical Society in the Oratory that very evening of the suffering of the soldiers in Northern Italy and of the need to help the wounded in God’s name. </p>

<p>Without going into the entire history of the Réveil movement in Europe, we can note that “The Réveil was part of that great movement of revolt against reason which was born in the 18th century . . . and came to fruition two or three generations later in Romanticism.” Alice Wemyss, <italic>Histoire du Réveil: 1790–1849</italic>, 11.
