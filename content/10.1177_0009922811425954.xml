<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Until now our clinical laboratory, in a children’s hospital, has reported the normal value for serum 25(OH)-vitamin D (25(OH)D) in children to be ≥30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811425954">1</xref></sup> The recent, 2011 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report recommends that serum 25(OH)D ≥20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) should be considered acceptable for skeletal health including children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811425954">2</xref></sup> Although nutritional rickets can develop secondary to severe dietary calcium deprivation as is the case in infants and small children in some developing countries, in the majority of cases it is due to vitamin D deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811425954">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811425954"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811425954">5</xref></sup> The hallmark of the latter is low serum level of 25(OH)D, which is the indicator of body stores of the fat-soluble vitamin. Insufficient calcium absorption from the gut because of the hypovitaminosis leads to an elevation in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH); frequently even before radiological manifestations of the rickets become apparent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811425954">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811425954"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811425954"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811425954"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811425954"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811425954">9</xref></sup> Consequently, the IOM report states,
<disp-quote>
<p>Serum PTH level has thus been explored and suggested as a measure indicative of adequate vitamin D nutriture, notably on the basis of the level of serum 25(OH)D at which serum PTH level rises or, alternatively, the level of serum 25(OH)D at which serum PTH level no longer declines.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Based on the above we analyzed our laboratory database to assess the serum 25(OH)D level at which we could appreciate a change in serum PTH level and to learn whether there is indeed an indication to change our reference value of 25(OH)D, as recommended by the IOM.</p>

<title>Material and Methods</title>
<p>Our institution is a tertiary-level, free-standing 314-bed children’s hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, that provides care to children from 6 different bordering states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811425954">10</xref></sup> We analyzed the electronic database of our clinical laboratory from July 2009 to January 2011 for children who had their serum 25(OH)D, PTH, calcium (Ca), and creatinine (Cr) measured. In case of multiple measurements on a child, only the initial value was included in the analysis. Data were included in the analysis only if all the above analytes were measured simultaneously. Children’s age and gender were recorded as well. Serum 25(OH)D was measured by tandem mass spectrometry on Applied Biosystems (Carlsbad, CA) 4000QTrap (normal ≥30 ng/mL), PTH (normal 7-75 pg/mL) by immunoassay (Siemens Immulite, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Deerfield, IL), Ca and Cr were measured on Ortho’s Vitros (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Rochester, NY) autoanalyzer and age-appropriate reference range were reported. To exclude patients with possible primary hyperparathyroidism and psuedohypoparathyroidism we excluded children with PTH ≥ 200 pg/mL, and to exclude children with possible renal dysfunction, we analyzed the data at 2 different stringency levels of Cr; ≤1.0 mg/dL (group A) and ≤0.6 mg/dL (group B).</p>
<p>The inflection point of 25(OH)D was determined by Guass–Newton statistical analysis after the convergence criteria were met (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0009922811425954">appendix</xref>). Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency were defined as 25(OH)D ≤30 ng/mL and ≤15 ng/mL, respectively, by conventional criteria, and as 25(OH)D ≤20 ng/mL and ≤12 ng/mL, respectively, by the 2011 IOM criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811425954">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811425954">2</xref></sup> The association between PTH and vitamin D status were evaluated by χ<sup>2</sup> tests. All statistical analysis was performed using the SAS 9.2 and SPSS 18.</p>

<title>Serum Creatinine ≤1.0 mg/dL (Group A)</title>
<p>There were 553 children in group A. The mean ± SD age was 10.1 ± 5.9 years (274 girls and 279 boys). Children were equally distributed across the age range. The mean ± SD for 25(OH)D was 33.7 ± 12.8 ng/mL, PTH 42.1 ± 34.7 pg/mL, and Ca 9.7 ± 0.6 mg/dL. By Pearson’s correlation test and as expected there was a negative correlation between serum 25(OH)D and PTH (<italic>r</italic> = −.20, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .000l). Serum Ca correlated with 25(OH)D (<italic>r</italic> = .31, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) and inversely with PTH (<italic>r</italic> = −.28, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Thus, the children in the database were not inappropriately skewed or biased for their age, gender, or biochemical profile. The inflection point for serum 25(OH)D at which PTH would stop to decrease was found to be at 30.1 ng/mL (95% confidence interval [CI] = 24.1-36.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922811425954">Figure 1</xref>). The percentage of children at different serum 25(OH)D levels is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922811425954">Table 1</xref>. In this group of children, 39.4% were insufficient/ deficient by conventional criteria compared with 11.4% by 2011 IOM criteria. PTH ≥ 75 pg/mL was recorded in 65 (11.8%) of the 553 children, of whom 36 (55.4%) had serum 25(OH)D &lt; 30 ng/mL compared with only 14 (21.5%) with serum 25(OH)D &lt; 20 ng/mL. Thus, 22 of 65 (33.8%) children with hyperparathyroidism would have been missed by lowering the reference range for serum 25(OH)D by the 2011 IOM criteria.</p>

<title>Serum Creatinine ≤0.6 mg/dL (Group B)</title>
<p>There were 304 children in group B. The mean ± SD age was 7.2 ± 5.6 years (150 girls and 154 boys). Children were equally distributed across the age range. The mean ± SD for 25(OH)D was 34.7 ± 13.5 ng/mL, PTH 38.1 ± 31.8 pg/mL, and Ca 9.8 ± 0.6 mg/dL. By Pearson’s correlation test, there was a negative correlation between serum 25(OH)D and PTH (<italic>r</italic> = −.26, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .000l).

Thus, the children in the database were not inappropriately skewed or biased for their age, gender, or biochemical profile. The inflection point for serum 25(OH)D at which PTH would stop to decrease was found to be at 31.7 ng/mL (95% CI = 26.4-37.0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922811425954">Figure 1</xref>).

In this group of children 39.1% were insufficient/ deficient by conventional criteria compared with 9.9% by 2011 IOM criteria. PTH ≥ 75 pg/mL was recorded in 35 (11.5%) of the 304 children, of whom 23 (65.7%) had serum 25(OH)D &lt; 30 ng/mL compared with only 9 (25.7%) with serum 25(OH)D &lt; 20 ng/mL. Thus, 14 of 35 (40%) children with hyperparathyroidism would have been missed by lowering the reference range for serum 25(OH)D by the 2011 IOM criteria.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on fracture rate, osteoporosis, and bone biopsy data Heaney and Holick<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811425954">11</xref></sup> have carefully argued that in adults normal reference value for serum 25(OH)D should be &gt;30 ng/mL. Because of the well-known adverse effects of elevated PTH levels on the skeleton, a biologically relevant value for skeletal physiology would be a serum 25(OH)D concentration at which serum PTH does not start to increase. As analyzed by us, studies in adults have used these biological criteria to investigate for serum 25(OH)D at which serum PTH levels rise and/or no longer decrease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922811425954">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811425954"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811425954">14</xref></sup> Our analysis shows that if one uses the inflection point of PTH as the method to identify the “cutoff” point at which lower serum 25(OH)D will result in higher PTH values, then normal reference value for 25(OH)D should be ≥30 ng/mL in contrast to the 2011 IOM recommendation of ≥20 ng/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922811425954">Figure 1</xref>). The results were similar even when we used a more stringent criterion of ≤0.6 mg/dL despite the group having significantly younger children. In essence, whereas the group B excluded all children with potential secondary hyperparathyroidism due to renal failure, the former may have included a few young children who might have been in that position. The study population in our study was normally distributed for age and gender. The serum PTH, Ca and 25(OH)D made their physiological relationship as would be expected from correlation analysis suggesting that although it was a hospital based population it was not markedly skewed/ biased in one direction to affect the results.</p>
<p>The difference in cut of point between 20 as recommended by the IOM and 30 as recommended by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811425954">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811425954">11</xref></sup> and supported by us is beyond theoretical exercise. The difference in identifying 25(OH)D insufficiency/deficiency using the 2 cutoff values would have been 28% in group A and 29% in group B. Furthermore, the inadequacy of 20 ng/mL as cutoff value is reflected by the fact that many more children in both groups with 25(OH)D values &gt;20 had elevated PTH compared with those with 25(OH)D &lt; 20 ng/mL. In 14.2% in group A and 15.7% in group B, children with serum 25(OH)D levels of 20 to 30 ng/mL had an elevated serum PTH. On the other hand, in both groups A and B, when using 30 ng/mL as cutoff value the majority of children with PTH &gt; 75 had 25(OH)D below this cutoff value as physiologically expected.</p>
<p>In both groups A and B, the 95% CI for the inflection point did not cross the 25(OH)D value of 20 ng/mL, the normal cutoff value recommended by 2011 IOM. In contrast to our study in children, the studies evaluated by 2011 IOM that showed inconsistent PTH plateaus at different 25(OH)D levels, were all done in adults, and most of them were in elderly adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811425954">2</xref>(Box 4-7)</sup> We do not believe that it is appropriate to extrapolate it to children. One of the concerns raised by the 2011 IOM report was the statistical analysis used in these studies, as some studies suggest that the serum PTH has an exponential inverse relationship, that is, it is linear when the data is log transformed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811425954">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811425954">16</xref></sup> We also analyzed the data with log-transformed serum PTH against serum 25(OH)D, and the results were consistent, and on the contrary the inflection point for serum PTH was higher rather than lower (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0009922811425954">appendix</xref>). We also analyzed the data using serum Cr as a covariate in the analysis to further adjust for serum Cr in both strategies, that is, with and without log-transformed serum PTH, and the inflection point of serum 25(OH)D was within ±1.0 ng/mL of the reported data (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0009922811425954">appendix</xref>).</p>
<p>The 2011 IOM report does recognize that there is a correlation between higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations and increased bone mineral content in older children and adolescents. Our analysis shows that 28.0% to 29.2% children would be deemed normal using the 2011 IOM criteria over the conventional criteria. We do recognize that rapid bone formation occurs in childhood and peaks in late adolescence followed by a gradual loss starting in the third decade. Thus any condition that impairs bone acquisition by young adulthood is a risk factor for osteoporosis later in life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922811425954">17</xref></sup> The misidentification of almost a third of the children as normal over insufficient serum 25(OH)D level will have significant impact at the preventive care level.</p>
<p>We do recognize that our analysis has limitations as it was an outcome evaluation from a clinical laboratory database, and clinical information such as underlying disease condition, calcium intake, and nutritional and pubertal status of children were not known. Furthermore, it is unclear if data from children who were mostly studied because of an illness can be projected to the healthy population. Further studies on healthy children will be required. Nevertheless, our analysis does raise the concern that a decrease in 25(OH)D normal cutoff value without adequate outcome skeletal data in children puts a third of ill children at risk for poor skeletal health. We believe that based on our analysis pediatricians should maintain the normal cutoff for serum 25(OH)D at ≥30 ng/mL.</p>

<caption>
<p>The LOESS (locally weighted regression smoothing scatter plot) model curve based on the Epanechnikov kernel function between parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25(OH)-vitamin D is shown on the left for group A and right for group B</p>

<p>In group A, when serum 25(OH)D was under the inflection point of 30.1 ng/mL, PTH decreased significantly with the slope (rate of change) <italic>b</italic>1 = −1.6 pg/mL (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05, 95% CI= −2.3 to −0.9). When serum 25(OH)D was above the inflection point of 30.1 ng/mL, there was no significant change in PTH with respect to 25(OH)D (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). Similarly, for group B, when serum 25(OH)D was under the inflection point of 31.7 ng/mL, PTH decreased significantly with the slope (rate of change) <italic>b</italic>1 = −2.0 pg/mL (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05, 95% CI = −2.8 to −1.2). When serum 25(OH)D was above the inflection point of 31.7 ng/mL, there was no significant change in PTH with respect to 25(OH)D (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
<p>We further analyzed data using log-transformed PTH. In group A using log(PTH), the inflection point for 25(OH)D was higher at 40.5 ng/mL (95% CI = 31.3-49.4). Similarly, for group B, the inflection point for 25(OH)D was 37.9 ng/mL (95% CI = 29.2-46.5). In addition, to further clarify the role for serum Cr, we further analyzed all children with serum Cr ≤1.0 mg/dL using serum Cr as a covariate. Thus, in this analysis the relationship between PTH and 25(OH)D was adjusted by taking Cr into account. Again the inflection point for 25(OH)D was 30.9 ng/mL (95% CI = 25.0-36.9) and for log(PTH) was 40.1 ng/mL (95% CI = 31.5-48.7).</p>
