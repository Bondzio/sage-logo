<abstract>
<p>New technologies and virtual environments are emerging globally, yet the way these tools can impact the learning and future career paths of students who are gifted is limited in the literature at this time. The purpose of this article is to provide a summary of how a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) summer camp, based on virtual and simulated environments, impacted the self-confidence of targeted diverse secondary science students from low socioeconomic backgrounds who were considered gifted with strong potential in these future STEM fields.</p>

<p>Using virtual environments to prepare doctors for surgery, train pilots for flight and prepare soldiers for military combat is a common occurrence. A less common occurrence, but one that is emerging at the University of Central Florida (UCF), is the use of these environments to professionally develop teachers or rehabilitate stroke victims and war veterans. With these new uses of virtual or mixed reality environments (part real, part synthetic) comes the emergence of new careers and opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. This article provides a summary of the summer camp experience provided to 108 students from diverse backgrounds considered gifted from four surrounding counties. The overarching goal of the camp was to expose talented youth to future careers and to start the journey towards STEM fields through exposure to virtual environments.</p>
<p>The University of Central Florida has a long-standing record as a leader in simulation technology. Students have experienced systems already employed in military and corporate training, entertainment, free-choice learning and rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261429411427647">Hughes et al., 2005</xref>). Most projects that the students experienced combined the creativity in teacher training of the UCF College of Education (CED), the basic computer science research of the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), the expertise in simulation and cognitive sciences at the Institute for Simulation Training (IST), the integrative strengths of the UCF Media Convergence Lab (MCL), and the strength of a local corporation rich in simulation with experiences behind the scenes at Lockheed Martin Simulation and Training Systems (LMSTS) in Orlando.</p>
<p>The MCL at UCF has developed a series of experiential learning landscapes for education. These experiences have provided rich interactive and immersive simulated environments with content models that have increased the educational, entertainment and economic value of existing formal and informal learning environments. EECS faculty and graduate students, in partnership with MCL researchers, have developed the software infrastructure for creating and delivering mixed-reality experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261429411427647">Hughes et al., 2006</xref>). For cases where behaviors are beyond the ability to simulate through software agents, prototypes have been designed which allow digital puppeteering of virtual characters by specially trained human actors, called inter-actors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261429411427647">Figure 1</xref>). These environments provided a rich playground for students interested in STEM careers to learn and experience through fun, rich, and interactive environments. The inter-actor’s wrist and head are tracked to control the animation of the virtual students whom the teacher is directly addressing. The glove on the inter-actor’s hand is used to lip sync and control non-verbal communication features (smiling, frowning, and blinking). All other virtual students have artificial intelligence (AI)-controlled behaviors. </p>

</fig>
<p>In addition, students were given the chance to consider a career in teaching through UCF’s new teacher preparation simulation tools. This tool, created by Drs Dieker and Hynes in the CED, along with Dr Hughes and Ms Smith, researchers from the MCL at IST, created this newly validated tool called TeachME™. Partners from the UCF CED, UCF/Lockheed Martin Academy for Mathematics and Science (LMA), EECS, IST, Workforce Central Florida and Lockheed Martin Corporation worked together to combine their rich background and numerous experiences available on campus and through the local corporation to provide students a rich summer experience across multiple virtual learning environments with one being specifically focused on TeachME™. This environment has been validated for use in teacher preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261429411427647">Dieker et al., 2007</xref>) and beginning work in mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429411427647">Andreasen et al., 2008</xref>); however, the student use of simulation was to impact their self-concept and career choices by exploring numerous new and emerging technologies used in this simulated environment.</p>
<p>So why focus on self-confidence as a goal in exposure to simulated environments? To date, much research has been conducted in an effort to isolate variables hypothesized to have a significant impact on student achievement in STEM. Self-confidence is one such variable. Who can deny the role self-confidence plays in any endeavor? Even professional athletes hire sports psychologists to help them with their mental game. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261429411427647">Frost (2008</xref>) expresses that the greatest limitation that prevents athletes from achieving their peak performance is the lack of self-confidence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261429411427647">Adler and Stewart (2004</xref>) maintain that self-confidence ‘has been related to virtually every other psychological concept or domain’ (p. 1). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261429411427647">Tavani and Losh (2003</xref>) found self-confidence to be a significant predictor of students’ academic performance. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261429411427647">Matzicopoulos et al. (2008)</xref> found that this phenomenon begins as early as kindergarten. There is a need for investigating the role that self-confidence plays in increasing the numbers of underrepresented students achieving in STEM.</p>
<sec id="section1-0261429411427647">
<title>STEM careers for gifted students of low socioeconomic status (SES) and the importance of self-confidence</title>
<p>When considered in the context of science, student self-confidence in a standards-based era may not be a primary focus of public education. Yet, overlooking this important construct may contribute to continued poor performance. For example, the Nation’s Report Card: Science 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261429411427647">Grigg et al., 2006</xref>) reported that only 29% of eighth grade students performed at proficiency level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261429411427647">Stone and Glascott (1997</xref>) assert that students who possess a high degree of self-confidence are more likely to be fully engaged in learning and to be less anxious about school failure.</p>
<p>In a meta-analysis of 74 studies published between 1990 and 2000, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261429411427647">Sirin (2005</xref>) found a medium to strong relationship between SES and academic achievement. Evidence exists that poverty can weaken children’s self-confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261429411427647">Duncan et al., 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261429411427647">Adler and Stewart (2004</xref>) found a relationship between self-confidence and SES. The importance of self-confidence and the correlation with SES is a vital consideration to our economy and global competiveness and cannot be overstated.</p>

<title>Building self-confidence in gifted students via virtual environments</title>
<p>The collaborative effort of UCF and local industry focused on middle school students transitioning to high school. Researchers imbedded esteem-boosting strategies to expose gifted students to highly engaging STEM experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0261429411427647">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 108 students from four local school districts in central Florida participated in STEM summer camps at UCF. Each of the targeted school districts identified schools with 75% or more of the students on free or reduced lunch, then from that group selected gifted and talented students interested in STEM careers. Special focus was on recruiting diverse, English language learners, and girls, while keeping the opportunity open for any undeserved middle school student transitioning to high school.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0261429411427647">
<title>Settings and experiences</title>
<p>Students engaged with simulators and computers in a collaborative, problem-solving setting to focus on what is required to become competitive in the STEM job market. University partners hosted an assortment of hands-on activities that included student exploration in TeachMe™, behind-the-scenes simulation training at IST, and interactions with simulators and engineers at LMSTS. The goal of using TeachME™ was to allow students to practice the skill of teaching as an additional STEM career option and then to go behind the scenes to talk about other simulators and the numerous career paths emerging daily from virtual and mixed reality environments.</p>
<p>The camps consisted of a two-day site visit where the students were engaged in learning as though they were employed. Students were first exposed to the word STEM and the possibilities of numerous careers in STEM. Students also were provided on-campus experiences to discuss the importance of college and the pathway to STEM careers via college programs. The range of activities that students experienced from typical classroom engagement strategies, kinesthetic learning to atypical simulations of flight or sensory hepatics can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0261429411427647">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Mentorship was a major focus of the program. The University of Central Florida, as part of its core mission, is dedicated to diversity and mentorship. Students experienced mentorship through the support of the Student Diversity Office, STEM student athletes, faculty advisers, and business partnerships. Critical in shaping student self-confidence and attainability of STEM careers were mentors from diverse backgrounds who mirrored students’ diverse demographics. Student athletes majoring in STEM at the university participated in the camp by guest lecturing and providing answers to student-life and college attendance questions.</p>
<p>The community of learners and experts had many opportunities for interaction. Conversations explicitly addressed students’ future goals and the importance of financial and emotional support available to diverse students who want to attend college. Additionally, Lockheed Martin Corporation engineers provided mentorship through a ‘working-lunch’ where students and professionals engaged in problem-solving conversations focused on what engineers do in their everyday lives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0261429411427647">
<title>Lessons learned and outcomes of exposure to virtual environments</title>
<p>Overall attendance to the camp was strong and students left with a knowledge of STEM and STEM-related careers. A pre-test showed only 58% of students could define <italic>one</italic> part of the acronym STEM, with only 39% of the students able to identify a career representative of STEM fields. At the conclusion of just two days of exposure to STEM careers in simulated environments, the post-test indicated that 100% of students could identify <italic>all</italic> parts of the STEM acronym and 95% of students could name and explain the education required to attain a career in related STEM fields. In addition to a pre–post analysis, a qualitative analysis of student exit interviews was conducted related to the experiences. The analysis of students’ perceptions after experiencing the camps revealed discussions related to (a) the danger of an overemphasis on high-stakes testing, (b) the importance of making instruction ‘real’ to students, and (c) the role of technology in learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0261429411427647">
<title>Overemphasis of high-stakes testing</title>
<p>One student said ‘they [teachers] push FCAT [Florida Comprehensive Achievement Test – high-stakes test] too hard to the point where you think you are going to fail, when, in fact, you might not’. Students shared that they wished the professionals who taught them in their classrooms believed in them, made learning fun, and focused less on completing drills that helped them pass a test. Teacher chaperones shared that these students at the camp are able to access computers only for the sake of test preparation and not to complete exploratory science experiments when they return to their schools.</p>
<p>Overall, students shared that the camp provided them with rich opportunities to ‘do technology’ related to their interests. One student said, ‘I liked everything, but this camp could be a week long, because I would really like to go to the cubbies of the engineers and see the systems that they are working on now’. Students’ comments permeated the need for our gifted and talented students to not just read about but experience STEM careers in their daily lives and not just to pass a test but to experience future job opportunities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0261429411427647">
<title>Making instruction real to students</title>
<p>Students collectively agreed, ‘Teachers rely too much on text books.’ One student stated, ‘I wish science involved as much cool stuff, you know, technology, at my school.’ Students were able to explore personal interest inventories (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.youthhood.org">www.youthhood.org</ext-link>). Through the use of the inventory, the STEM summer camps were then tailored to student interests while providing opportunities to further explore individual profiles. Each of the students presented their career materials to the whole group. Reported careers paralleled many of the mentors who participated in the camps. The summer camps were unique in that many of the guest speakers and volunteers over the two-day experience were female and diverse. An engineer from one of the laboratories was a Hispanic woman, and a student mentioned, ‘She was so smart and um, it is so cool, to see her making million dollar machines to train people.’ Students were able to see, participate, and do in this camp many things that are important in life; they expressed an overall satisfaction with the experience. They also were able to see people from backgrounds similar to their own having successful careers in STEM fields. The teaching force is 90% white (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261429411427647">National Center for Education Statistics, 2009</xref>), yet students of color rarely get to receive STEM instruction from someone who looks like them. All students need experiences with ‘real life’ applications of STEM in conjunction with professionals in STEM fields with whom they can relate and show how they can be successful in these critical shortage fields.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0261429411427647">
<title>Technology and learning</title>
<p>Students reported being motivated using technology. During the camps, students completed a WebQuest and participated in high-fidelity simulations. Students completed an online published WebQuest that is supported by a National Science Foundation grant (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.marinebiotech.net/">www.marinebiotech.net/</ext-link>). After exploring their likes and dislikes through taking a profile inventory and viewing career videos and fact sheets to see what a typical work day looks like, students gathered materials to share with the group. Teachers validated those comments by adding, ‘Media center computers are largely allocated for reading intervention, for these students (diverse and bilingual), the computer keeps data tracking to support the school in making AYP (Adequate Yearly Progress) for our kids.’ Students shared that they know that to be successful in the future they require knowing more about technology. Through this high-technology approach to learning where kids ‘played’ on million dollar simulators, students were exposed to technological possibilities. One student, who had a Transition Individualized Education Plan (TIEP) goal of exploring getting a driver’s license, shared that her family did not have a car; however, during the camp she drove a car simulator. She shared that she had been fearful to drive; after the simulation experience, she said, ‘I am actually good at this [referring to driving]’. Allowing students to fully immerse themselves in technology-rich learning was motivating; furthermore, the experiences allowed students to do things they had not believed were possible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0261429411427647">
<title>Bringing it back to reality</title>
<p>Although every classroom in America does not have high-fidelity simulators on which students can experience flying or driving, teachers can allow students access to these experiences through career days, field trips, and virtual field trips. Schools can invite engineers to visit via Skype (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.skype.com">www.skype.com</ext-link>) or in person. Allowing students access to mentors and teachers who come from similar backgrounds, ethnicities, or cultures enables the creation of the belief that they too can succeed in STEM. At the same time, teachers need to know the pathway to the career options in STEM and the route students have to take to access university-based programs. Students need to not just see the jobs of today, but dream about and see potential jobs that are emerging in the future.</p>
<p>Students who emerged as team leaders during the camps reported feeling confident in their ability to learn both science and mathematics on a five-point Likert-scale survey that was conducted. Students who self-reported having high self-confidence in both science and mathematics made the largest learning gains on post-test analyses. Findings point toward a positive correlation between high self-confidence and learning STEM. It is clear that a high level of self-confidence boosts learning in many areas, especially for students engaged in problem-solving simulations that are underrepresented in STEM fields. What is not clear is how self-confidence emerges in STEM-related classrooms under the pressure of high-stakes testing or in a world where technology is not accessed by students to go beyond reading about and moving to experiencing and talking with professionals in STEM areas about future careers.</p>
<p>Through the community-supported STEM summer camp, we learned several important pathways to STEM careers. If students who are gifted but have limited opportunities are to stay connected with STEM education and be the future leaders in these fields, districts, schools, and teachers need to provide every opportunity to bring STEM-related futures into the students’ worlds. While it is understood that not all schools have access to resources like those found at the university and business settings, each community has something unique to offer their students. For diverse populations, educators must seek out technology and real-life applications created by professionals that represent the students in their classrooms. When students were asked about their perceptions of learning STEM-related subjects after experiencing the camps, they shared ideas that closely mirrored what industry values. For instance, students spoke about teamwork, brainstorming, and collaborative work that supported individual strengths and revolved around planning and problem solving. They clearly saw technology as a tool, but seemed to also understand that it is the people who use, manipulate, change, rearrange, or create the new technology that truly impacts the future of society, which is the true meaning of being a gifted learner.</p>
