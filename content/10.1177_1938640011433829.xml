<p>Chronic tendinopathy is characterized by pain in the tendon, generally at the start and completion of exercise. Most patients with chronic Achilles tendon complaints can be treated conservatively. However, tendinosis may lead to decreased blood flow, increased stiffness of the tendon and reduced tensile strength, and predispose to rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640011433829">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640011433829">3</xref></sup> Operative treatment is indicated to restore the function of the Achilles tendon and alleviate the prerupture heel cord pain.

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 56-year-old retired garment factory worker complained of right heel cord pain on walking for 2 years. All along she did not consult any medical professionals and did not take local injection or have surgery for her heel cord problem before. She experienced acute right heel cord pain after a sudden hyperdorsiflexion of her right ankle while walking upstairs. She was admitted to our department on the same date. Clinically, a gap was felt over her right heel cord about 4 cm above its insertion. There was 6 cm length of thickening of the Achilles tendon proximal to the rupture site with local tenderness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed acute rupture of her right Achilles tendon with the presence of extensive tendinosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640011433829">Figure 1</xref>). Resection of the degenerated segment together with double thickness FHL transfer with a minimally invasive approach was performed.</p>

<title>Description of Technique</title>
<p>The patient was put in prone position with thigh tourniquet. The posteromedial portal was established at the intersection point between the medial margin of the Achilles tendon and a line joining the sustentaculum tali and the inferior border of the medial cuneiform and first metatarsal. The posterolateral portal was located 1 cm anterior to the lateral margin of the Achilles tendon insertion. A proximal medial wound was made at the proximal end of the degenerated segment of the Achilles tendon. The wound should have the size to allow the passage of the surgeon’s finger and the delivery of the diseased tendon segment through the wound. Finger breakdown of the adhesion around the proximal tendon segment was performed. The proximal tendon rupture end can be pushed proximally to the proximal wound by milking of the overlying skin. The proximal tendon segment can then be held to the level of the proximal wound with one hand and the tendon end can be squeezed through the proximal wound by milking of the overlying skin from lateral to medial with the other hand. In case of split tendon, only the medial part of the tendon was delivered through the proximal wound with the milking maneuver. The surgeon can pass his index finger to the proximal wound to reach the lateral edge of the tendon and the remaining lateral part of the tendon can be “hooked” and delivered to the proximal wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640011433829">Figure 2</xref>). The diseased segment was cut and stay stitch was applied to the remaining proximal end. Posterior ankle endoscopy was then performed and the FHL tendon posterior to the ankle joint was identified. It was traced proximally toward the FHL muscle belly and the overlying fascia was released with arthroscopic scissors to facilitate the later tendon transfer. A small longitudinal incision was made at the plantar surface of the proximal phalanx of the big toe. The FHL tendon was identified and cut. A stay stitch was applied to the free tendon end. The fibrous tendon sheath was released proximally to the intersesamoidal level. The Master knot of Henry and the interconnecting tendon between FHL and FDL was released by a tendon stripper. The FHL tendon was retrieved to the posteromedial portal and a stay stitch of No. 2 Ethibond (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) is applied to the free tendon end. A bone tunnel was made at the posterior calcaneal tubercle with a 6.0-mm drill bit through the posterolateral portal wound. A suture loop was passed medially from the posterolateral wound through the bone tunnel by means of a long-eyed guide wire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640011433829">Figure 3</xref>). The suture loop was retrieved to the posteromedial portal wound. The stay stitch of the FHL tendon and the tendon graft was retrieved to posterolateral portal wound by means of the suture loop. The tendon graft was then passed to the proximal medial wound and sutured to the proximal Achilles tendon end with the Pulvertaft technique. The ankle was kept in maximal plantarflexion and the FHL tendon was kept slightly less than maximal tension during the repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1938640011433829">Figure 4</xref>). The tension of the Achilles tendon was then restored after the reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1938640011433829">Figure 5</xref>). The wounds were closed with 3/O Ethilon (Ethicon) and an equinus short leg cast is applied. The cast was kept for 6 weeks and the patient was advised on non-weight-bearing walking during this period.</p>

<p>On 14-month follow-up, she can walk normally. She can actively dorsiflex the ankle to 20°. She can perform single leg tiptoeing with sense of weakness over the right side. She sensed some tightness of her right heel cord while walking downstairs. The big toe plantarflexion power was weak as compared with the other side but she did not have any complaint about that. There was no numbness over the plantar nerves territory.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main symptom of chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy is pain. However, the source of pain and its underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Neovascularisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640011433829">4</xref></sup> or the neural ingrowth accompanying the vascular ingrowth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640011433829">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640011433829">7</xref></sup> has been suggested as the source of pain. It is highly possible that with the resolution of the neovascularization by a given treatment the closely associated nerve endings would also be disturbed, resulting in pain relief. Most of the patients can be treated conservatively. In patients with symptomatic Achilles tendinopathy who develop tendon rupture, surgery is indicated to restore the Achilles tendon function and relieve the pain associated with tendinopathy. However, the tendinopathy segment, which was symptomatic before the rupture, is a potential source of persistent chronic pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640011433829">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640011433829">9</xref></sup> Complete excision of the tendinopathy segment was proposed to minimize persistent pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640011433829">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640011433829">10</xref></sup> Excision of a few centimeters of abnormal tendon will create a large tendon defect as in our case. Reconstruction of the defect using FHL transfer might better restore Achilles function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640011433829">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640011433829">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640011433829">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640011433829">12</xref></sup> Because of the anatomical relationship of the FHL tendon to the Achilles tendon and the fact that both tendons act in the same phase, transfer of this tendon in chronic Achilles tendinosis or rupture is a reasonable option.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640011433829">13</xref></sup> Postoperative MRI study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640011433829">14</xref></sup> showed that the FHL tendon is well integrated into the Achilles tendon with hypertrophy of the FHL muscle. This suggests functional incorporation of the FHL into plantar flexion of the ankle. Long FHL tendon can be harvested with minimally invasive technique to reconstruct the large Achilles tendon gap.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640011433829">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640011433829">17</xref></sup> The indications of this minimally invasive technique of FHL transfer are the same as other open FHL transfer. It is reserved for those cases with Achilles tendon defect of more than 5 cm. It has the potential advantage of minimally invasive approach, such as, better cosmetic result, less postoperative pain, minimal soft tissue dissection, less wound complication, and less scarring. There are 2 motor units in the construct as the tendon graft is sutured to the proximal Achilles tendon stump. The loss of active flexion of the hallux is expected but clinical studies showed that the mobility of the hallux after FHL transfer is low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640011433829">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938640011433829">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938640011433829">19</xref></sup> The main potential risk of this approach is injury to the medial plantar nerve during harvest of the FHL tendon.</p>
