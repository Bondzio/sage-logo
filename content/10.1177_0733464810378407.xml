<abstract>
<p>This study assessed health-related changes of participants attending A Matter of Balance/Volunteer Lay Leader (AMOB/VLL) model falls-prevention program for older adults based on their residential location. Data were examined from 1,482 older Texans enrolled in AMOB/VLL over a 2-year period and assessed at baseline and postintervention. Results indicate participants significantly increased falls efficacy by an average of 14.4% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), reduced activity interference due to their health by an average of 6.5% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and decreased the number of days limited from usual activity by an average of 28.2% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Regression models show that rural participants, despite entering and exiting the program with lower health status, report greater rates of positive change for falls efficacy and health interference compared with their urban counterparts. Findings contribute to the understanding of geographic variation with falls-prevention program outcomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recognition of environmental characteristics as a major determinant of health and its role in differential access to health care resources has given renewed attention to residential location as an area for research and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0733464810378407">Booth et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0733464810378407">Brownson et al., 2007</xref>). In 1990, the total population in the United States was nearly 249 million with approximately 188 million (75%) residing in areas defined as urban and 62 million (25%) in nonmetropolitan or rural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0733464810378407">U.S. Census Bureau, 1995</xref>). By 2007, the U.S. population had grown to approximately 299 million with the number of people residing in rural areas representing 21% of the total population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0733464810378407">U.S. Census Bureau, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0733464810378407">2008</xref>). Although Texas contains some of the largest cities in America, 17.5% of its 23.4 million residents resided in rural areas in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0733464810378407">U.S. Census Bureau, 2000</xref>). Differences in daily life across the rural–urban continuum and the influence of interventions that might promote health and ameliorate negative health outcomes for older adults residing in areas with fewer resources are of growing interest among researchers and practitioners alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0733464810378407">Glasgow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0733464810378407">Rogers, 1999</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0733464810378407">
<title>Differences Between Urban and Rural</title>
<p>Rural settings have a larger percentage of older adults than urban populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0733464810378407">Glasgow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0733464810378407">Goins &amp; Krout, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0733464810378407">Rogers, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0733464810378407">U.S. Census Bureau, 2008</xref>). Rural populations face some of the same challenges as urban or suburban counterparts but at a higher degree of severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0733464810378407">Brand &amp; Morris, 2009</xref>). Older adults in rural areas disproportionately grapple with problems that affect functional decline and loss of independence: high levels of chronic conditions, low levels of available health support, limited personal and community resources, geographic isolation, and poor nutritional health, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0733464810378407">Auchincloss, Van Nostrand, &amp; Ronsaville, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0733464810378407">Sharkey et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, both rural men and women have higher rates of self-reported obesity than men and women in other areas; and rural minorities face an added burden of health risk behaviors based on rural residence and race- and ethnicity-related health disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0733464810378407">Meit, 2004</xref>). Rural residents have higher poverty rates, inadequate or nonexistent transportation infrastructure, and less health-related resources (e.g., doctors, hospitals) resulting in poorer health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0733464810378407">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0733464810378407">U.S. Census Bureau, 2006</xref>). Poverty rates for rural residents in 2000 were 13.4% compared with 10.6% for those residing in urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0733464810378407">U.S. Census Bureau, 2000</xref>). Access to quality health care services remains a major concern when considering rural communities; in addition, there are less health promotion/disease prevention programs in rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0733464810378407">Coon &amp; Zulkowski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0733464810378407">Goins &amp; Krout, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0733464810378407">Institute of Medicine, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Falls As a Major Public Health Problem</title>
<p>As adults age, falls become more common and have potential to instigate a downward cycle of injury, disability, and even premature death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0733464810378407">Shekelle, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0733464810378407">Stevens &amp; Sogolow, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, fear of falling may impede older adults’ engagement in exercise and activities of daily living, thus potentially contributing to falls among this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0733464810378407">Fletcher &amp; Hirdes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0733464810378407">Friedman, Munoz, West, Rubin, &amp; Fried, 2002</xref>). The consequences of falling include greater demands on individual, family, and community resources; higher hospital-use rates; increased levels of disability; and greater utilization of health care and home- and community-care programs for a longer period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0733464810378407">Mor, Wilcox, Rakowski, &amp; Hiris, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0733464810378407">Ponza, Ohls, &amp; Millen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0733464810378407">Sharkey et al., 2003</xref>). Rural populations have disproportionately higher rates of unintentional fall injuries and related mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0733464810378407">Coben, 2009</xref>). Risk factors for falls include being older, female, of low socioeconomic status, having chronic illness, taking mood stabilizers, living alone, and having dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0733464810378407">Horton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0733464810378407">Weeks, 2007</xref>). Falls and the fear of falling may affect confidence in engaging in daily activities without falling or losing balance and restrict functional activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0733464810378407">O’Grady et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0733464810378407">Simonsick, Guralnik, &amp; Fried, 1999</xref>). Frequent fear of falling increases the odds for the inability of older adults to maintain balance or complete a usual walk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0733464810378407">Sharkey et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to these risk factors, access to health care facilities and community-based organizations that offer fall-prevention programs is less among rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0733464810378407">Weber, White, &amp; McIlvried, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0733464810378407">Yates &amp; Dunnagan, 2001</xref>). Barriers, such as the time needed to travel to and from delivery sites, may impede the effectiveness of falls-intervention programs. Barriers to resource accessibility are often different for individuals residing in rural verses urban areas and may include distance to be traveled, ability to drive long distances, socioeconomic variation, and density of health care facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0733464810378407">Smith &amp; Morton, 2009</xref>). Few studies have examined the differences in falls-prevention program utilization or effectiveness between rural and urban communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0733464810378407">Casteel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0733464810378407">Li et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0733464810378407">
<title>The Context of Falls-Prevention Programs</title>
<p>Despite the recent attention on geographical health disparities as a priority for improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0733464810378407">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2002</xref>), differences in the location or population size of residential areas are typically not considered when delivering falls-prevention programs. Given the uniqueness of behavioral and environmental characteristics found in different residential areas, a more in-depth focus on risk factors unique to population-dense and sparse residential areas should be considered when planning and delivering falls-prevention and intervention efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0733464810378407">Coben, 2009</xref>). Considering the demonstrated effectiveness of evidence-based falls programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0733464810378407">Healy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0733464810378407">Tinetti et al., 1994</xref>), it is important for researchers and practitioners to understand how evidence-based falls-prevention strategies could be more effectively disseminated across urban, suburban, small-town, and rural areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0733464810378407">
<title>AMOB Falls-Prevention Program</title>
<p>AMOB is an evidence-based program to reduce falls and improve health indicators whose positive outcomes were first documented in a randomized trial conducted in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0733464810378407">Tennstedt et al., 1998</xref>). AMOB/VLL is an adaptation of AMOB which delivers the program through a volunteer lay model versus the original model which was professionally delivered. The program is intended to reduce the fear of falling and increase physical activity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0733464810378407">Area Agency on Aging of the Capital Area, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0733464810378407">National Council on the Aging, 2007</xref>). A training infrastructure has been developed to disseminate AMOB/VLL to large numbers of community-dwelling older adults.</p>
<p>The AMOB/VLL intervention includes eight classes, each lasting 2 hr, presented over either a 4- or 8-week period by trained VLLs. These leaders serve as facilitators and use an extensively detailed training manual and two instructional videos. AMOB/VLL focuses on practical coping strategies to reduce fear of falling and to diminish the risk of falling. The intervention is unique in its two-pronged approach to falls prevention because it focuses on changing both attitudes and behaviors that predispose older adults to falls. Early sessions focus on diminishing the fear of falling and promoting participants to adopt the mindset that falls are preventable. Later sessions assist participants to change their environments to reduce fall-related risk factors and learn exercises to increase strength and balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0733464810378407">Area Agency on Aging of the Capital Area, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0733464810378407">Graafmans et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0733464810378407">Stevens &amp; Dellinger, 2002</xref>). The curriculum includes lectures, group discussions, mutual problem solving, role-play activities, exercise training, assertiveness training, and home assignments. Intervention processes are designed to change behavior with a focus on building fall self-efficacy and set realistic goals for increasing activity. The goal is to instill adaptive beliefs such as greater perceived control, greater confidence in one’s abilities, and a more realistic assessment of failures.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0733464810378407">Figure 1</xref> reflects the conceptual framework associated with this study. This schematic provides the rationale for the relationships between the personal demographics, fall-related risks, and intervention variables important for addressing the goals of this study. As indicated in the narrative, rurality is associated with access to health care and prevention programs, although these access variables were not directly measured and are therefore outside the scope of this study. Furthermore, this conceptual framework illustrates the point of intervention and the AMOB/VLL components to enact attitudinal, behavioral, and physiological changes associated with falls and their related ramifications.</p>

</fig>
<p>Texas has established an infrastructure to deliver the intervention to seniors statewide. The majority of Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) regions in Texas (i.e., 26 of 28 regions) signed an agreement with Texas Association of Area Agencies on Aging to implement AMOB/VLL through the aging services network. With the potential to reach older adults in 236 of the 254 Texas counties, the Texas AMOB/VLL program has a large and diverse geographic reach, targeting low-income minority seniors and their caregivers. Texas AAA sites continue to build fall-prevention capacity within existing and new partners including residential facilities, health care institutions, public health departments, faith-based organizations, business sectors, and local government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0733464810378407">Ory, Smith, Wade, Wright, &amp; Parrish, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although AMOB/VLL has been primarily delivered in urban areas of Texas, some small-town or rural communities are adopting the program and delivering it to their residents. As the reach of this program extends beyond urban areas into rural and small-town communities, a preliminary investigation is needed to inform researchers and program planners about the enrollment and changes experienced by rural participants in relation to their urban counterparts. The purposes of this study are to (a) identify characteristics of rural and urban participants entering the AMOB/VLL, (b) document the health-related changes experienced by participants through the examination of baseline and postintervention measures, and (c) compare the changes experienced by rural and urban AMOB/VLL participants.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-0733464810378407">
<title>Participants and Procedures</title>
<p>A total of 3,092 participants enrolled in the Texas AMOB/VLL Falls-Prevention Intervention between September 2007 and October 2009. Participants were recruited to the program through local AAA and other community-based organizations. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained at Texas A&amp;M University for this secondary data analysis. Identifying information was not collected from participants, thus anonymity was maintained.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0733464810378407">
<title>Instrument and Measures</title>
<p>Participants were surveyed using similar instruments at baseline and on completion of the 8-week intervention. The nine-page long, paper-based self-report questionnaire consisted of 28 items. Survey instrument items included Likert-type scales, yes/no, closed-response, and open-ended formats. Baseline and postintervention instruments took participants approximately 15 min to complete each.</p>
<p>This study analyzed data collected from a subsample of 1,482 older participants who completed both the baseline and postintervention survey instruments. Participants were drawn from up to 26 AAA regions and 227 classes in Texas. This study included two types of variables: personal characteristics of the participants measured at baseline and variables hypothesized to be influenced by the 8-week intervention (i.e., intervention variables measured at baseline and postintervention). <italic>Personal characteristics</italic> of participants used in this study were age (i.e., treated as a continuous variable based on the participant’s birth date), sex (i.e., scored 0 if <italic>male</italic> and 1 if <italic>female</italic>), race/ethnicity (i.e., scored 0 if the participant is <italic>non-Hispanic White</italic> and 1 if <italic>racial/ethnic minority</italic>), education (i.e., scored 0 if the highest level of education received by the participant was <italic>less than high school</italic>, 1 if <italic>graduated high school</italic>, and 2 if <italic>more than a high school education</italic>), number of chronic conditions (i.e., scored 0 if the participant self-reported having <italic>no chronic conditions</italic>, 1 if <italic>one chronic condition</italic>, 2 if <italic>two chronic conditions</italic>, and 3 if <italic>three or more chronic conditions</italic>), living situation (live alone versus lived with others), percentage of the population residing in the participant’s ZIP code area above age of 65 years (i.e., geocoded based on the participant’s residential ZIP code, scored as a ratio to the overall population in that ZIP code), median income of the population residing in the participant’s ZIP code area (i.e., geocoded based on the participant’s residential ZIP code).</p>
<p>Geographic location of the participant’s residence is designated as a major contextual variable. Using rural–urban continuum codes based on the participant’s ZIP code, participants were identified as urban residents if they lived in areas coded 1 to 3 (from counties in metro areas of 1 million or more to counties in metro areas of fewer than 250,000 population). Rural residents were identified as participants who resided in areas coded 4 to 7 (from counties in an urban area of 20,000 or more adjacent to a metro area to completely rural areas of less than 2,500 population, not adjacent to a metro area; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0733464810378407">United States Department of Agriculture, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive, nonparametric bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed using STATA 10. Data were analyzed to determine score changes associated with the AMOB/VLL intervention, explain relationships between variables of interest. Frequencies were calculated for participant personal characteristics and intervention variables of interest. Pearson’s chi-square tests were performed to assess the goodness of fit for frequency distributions and the independence between categorical participant personal characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0733464810378407">Chernoff &amp; Lehmann, 1954</xref>). Independence was also examined between rural and urban participants. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were calculated to identify the strength and direction of ordinally scaled associations between participant personal characteristics and baseline outcome variable scores, baseline variable scores and postintervention variable scores, and participant personal characteristics and postintervention variable scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0733464810378407">Spearman, 1904</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess the health-related changes experienced by participants, baseline and postintervention variable values between and within rural and urban subsamples were compared using a series of three Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. These analyses examine the equality of matched pairs of observations by calculating differences between baseline and postintervention scores (i.e., assuming a null hypothesis of equal score distributions or differences of zero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0733464810378407">Snedecor &amp; Cochran, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0733464810378407">Wilcoxon, 1945</xref>). Positive and negative change scores from baseline to postintervention were assessed for urban and rural subgroups (i.e., postintervention values were subtracted from baseline values). A positive change score indicates a larger baseline score when compared with postintervention.</p>
<p>Baseline and postintervention score differences were analyzed with three random effects generalized least squares regressions. Random effects models use a feasible estimator that considers measures collected at different time intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0733464810378407">Wooldridge, 2003</xref>). These regression models allow for interaction between rural residence and time from baseline to postintervention to see how participants’ residential rurality is associated with changes in scores from baseline to postintervention. In these regression models, two additional variables were included. The time variable examines the effectiveness of the intervention from baseline to postintervention for all participants. The rural rate change variable compares the rate of change in scores (i.e., interaction or change in slope) from baseline to postintervention between rural and urban participants.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>A total of 3,092 participants enrolled in the program. Investigators selected 1,482 participants with complete baseline and postintervention data for inclusion in this study. A comparison between those included in study analyses and those omitted for incomplete data was conducted. Study participants were similar in age and sex, but the included sample was significantly more educated, and comprised more non-Hispanic Whites and urban-residing individuals. When comparing the analytic sample to Texas demographics, the study sample included a slightly higher percentage of non-Hispanic Whites (74% compared with 69%) and individuals residing in urban areas (92% compared with 87%).</p>
<p>Sample characteristics of study participants are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0733464810378407">Table 1</xref>. The study population included 1,482 older adults (i.e., 160 cases were not included due to missing rurality data). Of these participants, 1,221 were considered to reside in an urban area and 101 in a rural area. The mean age of participants residing in an urban area was 76.8 (±8.2). The majority of these urban participants were non-Hispanic White (74.7%), female (81.2%), had more than a high school education (61.1%), resided alone (53.8%), and had one or no chronic conditions (43.9%). The mean age of participants residing in a rural area was 75.6 (±8.8). The majority of these rural participants were non-Hispanic White (64.3%), female (86.9%), had more than a high school education (42.6%), resided alone (61.2%), and had three or more chronic conditions (40.4%). Participants residing in rural areas were significantly more likely to be non-White, less educated, and to report more chronic conditions. These differences were accounted for in the multiple regression analyses of this study by being added as covariates in the regression models.</p>

Recalling that a positive score indicates a larger baseline score when compared with postintervention, this finding indicates over three times as many urban participants improved their falls efficacy score as compared with those with decreased falls efficacy from baseline to postintervention. Among participants residing in rural areas, results showed 66 negative changes in self-reported falls efficacy scores from baseline to postintervention relative to 6 positive changes (<italic>z</italic> = −6.59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).

This finding indicates two times as many rural participants reduced their health interference score as compared with those with increased interference from baseline to postintervention.

<p>Personal characteristics were examined to determine changes in participants’ falls efficacy from baseline to postintervention (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0733464810378407">Table 3</xref>). In adjusted models, from baseline to postintervention, participants residing in rural areas had a 1.58 point lower falls efficacy score relative to their urban counterparts (<italic>z</italic> = −4.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Older participants had a 0.07 point lower falls efficacy score relative to their younger counterparts (<italic>z</italic> = −6.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and female participants had a 0.50 point lower falls efficacy score relative to their male counterparts (<italic>z</italic> = −2.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Non-White participants had a 0.42 point lower falls efficacy score relative to their non-Hispanic White counterparts (<italic>z</italic> = −1.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Participants with one, two, and three or more chronic conditions had a 0.87 (<italic>z</italic> = −2.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), 0.98 (<italic>z</italic> = −3.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and 1.57 (<italic>z</italic> = −4.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) point lower falls efficacy score relative to their counterparts with zero chronic conditions, respectively.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Findings from this study suggest that the AMOB/VLL model falls prevention intervention is generally beneficial for older adults in Texas. These results confirm the typically positive findings in the existing literature showing AMOB/VLL to be effective in increasing falls efficacy and levels of physical activity while reducing days of poor health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0733464810378407">Healy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0733464810378407">Tennstedt et al., 1998</xref>). From baseline to postintervention, positive outcomes were seen for participants who enrolled in the 8-week intervention for falls efficacy, interference with daily activity due to health, and days limited from usual activity; however, substantial variations were discovered when change scores were examined in the presence of participant personal and geographic residential characteristics.</p>
<p>These analyses contribute to the growing health and place literature by identifying nuances in rural–urban differences in intervention associations for disease prevention programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0733464810378407">Gamm, Hutchison, Dabney, &amp; Dorsey, 2003</xref>). In this study, Wilcoxon analyses revealed that rural participants benefited significantly in regard to two of the three examined outcomes (i.e., increased falls efficacy and reductions in activity interference); however, it is equally important to carefully assess the trajectories of change.</p>
<p>These study findings showed rural participants, on average, entered and exited AMOB/VLL with lower falls efficacy scores, higher health interference scores, and higher days limited from usual activity relative to urban counterparts; however, the rates of positive health-related changes was significantly greater for rural participants when compared with urban participants for falls efficacy and health interference scores. These findings indicate that health status on entry of the program has great influence on changes experienced from baseline to postintervention. Differences in change scores (and rates of change) between rural and urban participants may be attributed to participant’s personal characteristics, health status at baseline, the relatively short duration of this moderate intensity intervention, or a methodological artifact of having more opportunity for improvement. Regardless of the origins of these changes, results of this study highlight the importance of preventing falls episode among older citizens, given the high level of association of baseline scores with health status changes reported at postintervention.</p>
<p>Substantial literature documents differences in rural–urban health and social service resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0733464810378407">Gamm et al., 2003</xref>). This study stresses the importance of promoting programs in rural areas where there are typically fewer health prevention and wellness resources available to older adults. Even where programs are available, seniors may need to travel farther distances to gain access depending on county size which can be large in more rural areas. The potentially negative effects of the relative scarcity of health resources in more rural areas can be attenuated by the ability of AMOB/VLL to improve falls-related health outcomes. This potential benefit emphasizes the vast need to increase the adoption of these and other programs in areas considered more rural and frontier.</p>
<p>Despite the small number of rural adults participating in this study, Texas possesses a large capacity to deliver AMOB/VLL to seniors in 236 of its 254 counties. Although substantially more seniors in this sample resided in areas considered to be urban, a solid infrastructure has been established capitalizing on partnerships between the state government, Area Agencies on Aging, state universities, and other community-based organizations to generate the capacity to reach AMOB/VLL to all older Texans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0733464810378407">Ory, Smith, Wade, et al., 2010</xref>). Geospatial dispersion (e.g., travel time and distance) and characteristics of participants (e.g., ability to drive, residing alone, personal mobility) may be associated with challenges when attempting to deliver falls prevention programs to large numbers of seniors residing in areas considered rural or frontier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0733464810378407">Arcury, Preisser, Gesler, &amp; Powers, 2005</xref>). To overcome these barriers of rurality, program administrators need to increase the involvement of organizations in the aging and public health network and then work diligently to embed AMOB/VLL into their existing programming efforts across the full rural–urban continuum. As a strategy to increase participation in AMOB/VLL and other programs, transportation services may be created or used to bring older residents residing in rural areas (or those who live alone or cannot/should not operate a motor vehicle) to sites capable of delivering AMOB/VLL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0733464810378407">Arcury et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section15-0733464810378407">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There were limitations associated with this study. Given the volunteer nature of participant enrollment in the program, we acknowledge a limitation in our ability to generalize these study findings to the overall Texas population. To account for such sample biases, we have included participant personal characteristics as covariates in our multiple regression analyses. Another common limitation in translational research is subject attrition given the absence of resources for research staff to ensure high baseline to postintervention response rates in community settings. In addition, data collected from participants at baseline and postintervention were self-reported. Some measures required the participant to recall occurrences within the previous week or month, which may have introduced recall bias.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the current study had small numbers of rural participants, which limited the types of analyses that could be conducted. Hence, the results of this study should be viewed as more suggestive than definitive, with findings between participants residing in rural and urban areas worthy of further pursuit. The current study investigated outcomes from one intervention administered in one state; however, the included sample contained participants from a large geographically and demographically diverse state, which gives greater credence to these study findings. Participation in the intervention was voluntary, and therefore the study may have been subjected to self-selection bias. No comparison groups were used; however, this intervention has been researched previously and used successfully as an evidence-based program for seniors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0733464810378407">Healy, 2008</xref>). Assessing the fidelity of the delivery of this intervention statewide was beyond the scope of this study; however, the study outcomes attest to the robustness of community settings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0733464810378407">
<title>Implications for Research</title>
<p>Findings from this study have substantial implications for future research on public health and aging. First, data-collection efforts will target participants who reside in rural areas in an attempt to further investigate the effectiveness of AMOB/VLL and identify the characteristics of participants who benefit most from the intervention. Consistent with a recent synthesis of long-term maintenance of behavior change interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0733464810378407">Ory, Smith, Mier, &amp; Wernicke, 2010</xref>), relatively modest gains from prevention programs (i.e., as seen with the incremental changes based on the participant’s reported number of chronic conditions) can still be noteworthy. The accumulation of small improvements accumulated over a large number of participants can result in major public health impacts. Future efforts will relate this study’s findings pertaining to effectiveness to dose-response (i.e., 8-week attendance rates of AMOB/VLL classes) and other class characteristics (e.g., class size, delivery site type). In future research, the authors intend to complement currently used self-reported measures with clinical measures (e.g., timed get-up-and-go, stand-to-sits) to validate findings of this study. In addition to validating these findings with functional variables, future research will investigate the relationships between AMOB/VLL and cost variables and health care utilization to examine the emergence of any systematic differences across the rural–urban continuum.</p>

<sec id="section17-0733464810378407">
<title>Implications for Practitioners and Policy Makers</title>
<p>Implications of this study transcend this specific research and evaluation effort. Findings from this study have practical application and the potential to influence policy making and other legislative processes. Regression models suggested that changes (e.g., desirable or undesirable) of outcome variables between baseline and postintervention depended on participants’ baseline outcomes, especially among rural participants, implying the importance of policy makers’ timely intervention of falls-related health disparities among rural residents.</p>
<p>As indicated previously, more than 90% of participants who enrolled in AMOB/VLL resided in metro areas. Despite an established and expanding infrastructure and capacity to deliver AMOB/VLL and other programs to older adults, recruiting participants residing in rural areas (and in extreme cases, participants from frontier areas) remains a challenge for program coordinators. Innovative strategies must be employed to enlist additional community organizations to deliver AMOB/VLL and purposively recruit participants residing outside metro areas to support AAA’s capacity to reach participants in rural areas and even remote areas considered as frontier. Findings of this study confirm the generally positive health-related benefits of AMOB/VLL for older participants despite rural place of residence.</p>
