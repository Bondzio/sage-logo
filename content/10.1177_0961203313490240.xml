<sec id="sec9-0961203313490240"><title>Objective</title>
<p>The objective of this article is to investigate clinical presentations and outcomes of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with infection admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0961203313490240"><title>Methods</title>
<p>SLE patients with infection, SLE patients with noninfectious causes, and non-SLE patients with infection were identified from the Cooper University Hospital Project IMPACT database between 2002 and 2010. We examined demographic data, APACHE II scores, physiologic data, laboratory data, length of stay in the ICU and hospital, and mortality of the three groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0961203313490240"><title>Results</title>
<p>Twenty-five SLE patients with infection, 45 SLE patients with noninfectious causes, and 1466 non-SLE patients with infection were included in the study. SLE patients with infection had higher APACHE II scores, higher maximum temperature, higher minimum and maximum heart rate (HR), lower minimum and maximum systolic blood pressure (SBP), and longer ICU length of stay in comparison to SLE patients with noninfectious causes. There were no statistical differences in white blood cell (WBC) count. SLE patients with infection had a higher mortality compared to SLE patients with noninfectious causes. There was no difference in mortality between SLE patients with infection and non-SLE patients with infection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0961203313490240"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>SLE patients with infection in the ICU had a higher mortality and a higher APACHE II score compared to SLE patients with noninfectious causes in the ICU. Their physiologic signs including temperature, HR, and SBP were more reflective of infection than their WBC count.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203313490240" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem disease caused by tissue damage resulting from antibody and complement-fixing immune complex deposition. There is a wide spectrum of clinical presentations that are characterized by remissions and exacerbations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313490240">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>SLE patients are at an increased risk for infection due both to the disease and the use of immunosuppressive agents. According to one study, 108 out of 137 SLE patients (79%) had serious infections even though they took glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive agents sparingly. Infections documented in this study were usually associated with disease exacerbations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313490240">2</xref></sup> In a population-based study, a significant increase in bacterial infections was observed in SLE patients as compared to an age- and gender-matched cohort of normal controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313490240">3</xref></sup> Many immune abnormalities in SLE, including complement deficiency,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313490240">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313490240"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313490240">6</xref></sup> defects in chemotaxis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313490240">7</xref></sup> and phagocytic activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313490240">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313490240">9</xref></sup> may account for the susceptibility for infection.</p>
<p>Immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticoids are a risk factor for infection in SLE patients. A study showed that the infection rate in hospitalized patients increased from 0.43 to 1.63 per 100 hospital days with an increase in glucocorticoid dose from zero to more than 50 mg/d.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313490240">10</xref></sup> In another study, a fivefold increase in the frequency of all infections was found as average prednisone dose increased from zero to greater than 40 mg/d.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313490240">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is known that some SLE patients develop severe acute illnesses and require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Infection is one of the most common causes for admission to the ICU. Patients with SLE may have vague clinical signs and symptoms due to their impaired immune responses to infection and this can delay interventions including treatment in the ICU. In this retrospective study, we examined clinical presentations and outcomes of patients with SLE who were admitted to the ICU for infection and compared them to SLE patients who were admitted for noninfectious causes and to non-SLE patients who were admitted with infection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203313490240" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title>
<p>SLE patients with sepsis or respiratory infection (Group A), a comparison group of SLE patients with noninfectious causes (Group B), and another comparison group of non-SLE patients with sepsis or respiratory infection (Group C) admitted to Cooper University Hospital Medical ICU were identified from the Cooper University Hospital Project International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials (IMPACT) database between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2010. Project IMPACT (Cerner Corporation, Kansas City, MO) is a nationally representative, voluntary, fee-based database system used to measure and describe the care of intensive care patients. It was initially developed by a multidisciplinary group of critical care expert members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine. Participating institutions upload data quarterly to a central repository. Data fields include hospital and ICU organizational characteristics, admission source, demographics, physiological data (including hemodynamic indices and laboratory values), procedures, complications, hospital and ICU length of stay, and outcomes. All data are collected by dedicated onsite personnel who are trained and certified by Project IMPACT. Only those patients who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for classification of SLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313490240">12</xref></sup> after chart review were included in Group A and Group B of this study.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0961203313490240"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>The patients who met the following inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in this study. Group A inclusion criteria were: 1) age greater than 18 years old; 2) presence of clinical diagnosis of SLE (ICD9 CM 710.0) according to ACR criteria; and 3) admitted to ICU with sepsis or respiratory infection. Group B inclusion criteria were: 1) age greater than 18 years old; 2) presence of clinical diagnosis of SLE (ICD9 CM 710.0) according to ACR criteria; and 3) admitted to ICU with noninfectious causes. Group C inclusion criteria were: 1) age greater than 18 years old; 2) no clinical diagnosis of SLE (ICD9 CM 710.0), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (714.0), psoriatic arthritis (696.0), ankylosing spondylitis (720.0), systemic sclerosis (710.1), polymyositis (710.4), dermatomyositis (710.3), sarcoidosis (135), vasculitis (446.29), Wegeners granulomatosis (446.4), Churg Strauss syndrome (446.4), cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (273.2), Henoch-Schonlein purpura (287.0), polyarteritis nodosa (446.0), Kawasaki disease (446.1), primary central nervous system (CNS) angiitis, giant cell arteritis (446.5), and Takayasu’s arteritis (446.7); and 3) admitted to ICU with sepsis or respiratory infection.</p>
<p>Exclusion criteria for all groups were: 1) history of malignancy within the past five years; 2) history of viral hepatitis (ICD9 CM 070) such as hepatitis B or C; and 3) history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (ICD9 CM 042).</p>
<p>The following information was abstracted from the Cooper University Hospital Project IMPACT database: demographic data (age, gender), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, physiologic data (temperature, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP)), laboratory data (white blood cell (WBC) count, hematocrit, creatinine (Cr)), comorbidities, length of stay in the ICU, length of stay in the hospital, and mortality. The Cooper University Hospital Project IMPACT data set included entry of the maximum and minimum value of all physiologic and laboratory data within the first 24 hours of ICU admission. APACHE II is a type of ICU scoring system applied within 24 hours of admission of a patient to an ICU. A score from 0 to 71 is computed based on several measurements. The calculation of the APACHE II score was based on the worst physiological variables (furthest from the mean) collected in the first 24 hours.</p>
<p>The following additional information on SLE patients in both the infection and the noninfectious causes group was obtained from chart review: disease duration, clinical manifestations of SLE, and treatments prior to admission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203313490240"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Mann Whitney U (median difference) Pearson chi square and Fisher’s exact tests were used for all univariate significance tests. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted effects on odds of mortality between Group A and Group C.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0961203313490240" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Twenty-five SLE patients with infection (Group A) and 45 SLE patients with noninfectious causes (Group B) were admitted to the ICU at Cooper University Hospital from January 2002 to December 2010. The mean age of SLE patients with infection was 49.2 (41.0–57.5) years with mean lupus disease duration of 95.7 (49.1–143.3) months. The mean age of SLE patients with noninfectious causes was 42.8 (37.5–48.1) years with mean lupus disease duration of 121.6 (80.8–162.4) months. The majority in both groups was female (Group A 80.0% (61%–92.3%), Group B 88.9% (77%–95.8%)). The overall characteristics were similar in both groups. For this study, active SLE was defined as either having active SLE symptoms or requiring prednisone greater than 7.5 mg/d or immunosuppressive agents based on chart review, and the proportion of patients with active SLE was similar in both groups. The SLE group with infection received more immunosuppressive treatments and hydroxychloroquine in comparison to the SLE group with noninfectious causes but this was not statistically significant. Additionally, there was a trend toward more pleuritis in the SLE group with noninfectious causes admitted to the ICU (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203313490240">Table 1</xref>).

<p>ICU admission diagnoses for the SLE group with noninfectious causes were lupus nephritis two, cerebral hemorrhage two, cerebral infarction one, seizures three, pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage two, pleural or pericardial effusion three, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome one, aortic dissection two, mitral regurgitation one, congestive heart failure one, asthma one, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease one, gastrointestinal bleeding two, hemoperitoneum two, uterine bleeding one, retroperitoneal hematoma one, pseudoaneurysm one, Guillain Barre syndrome one, angioedema one, epidural hematoma one, adrenal insufficiency one, vertebral compression fracture one, opioid overdose two, altered mental status two, and post-operation care nine.</p>
<p>In the comparison to 1466 patients in the non-SLE with infection group (Group C), SLE patients with infection (Group A) were younger (49.2 (41.0–57.5) years vs 62.6 (61.7–63.5) years, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and more likely to be female (80.0% (61.1%–92.3%) vs 48.2% (45.6%–50.7%), <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The percentages of co-morbidities were similar in the SLE group with infection and the non-SLE group with infection; hypertension (48.0% (29.2%–67.2%) vs 60.6% (58.1%–63.1%), <italic>p</italic> = 0.10), diabetes mellitus (28% (10.5%–45.5%) vs 40.1% (37.6%–42.6%), <italic>p</italic> = 0.17), congestive heart failure (32% (16.1%–51.9%) vs 23.1% (21%–25.3%), <italic>p</italic> = 0.73).</p>
<p>SLE patients with infection had significantly longer ICU length of stay, higher APACHE II scores, higher maximum temperature, higher minimum and maximum HR and lower minimum and maximum SBP in comparison to the SLE with noninfectious causes group. There was a trend toward higher minimum and maximum WBC and higher minimum and maximum Cr in the SLE with infection group in comparison to the SLE with noninfectious causes group. However, this was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961203313490240">Table 3</xref>). The distribution of WBC count was generally less than 15,000/µl in the SLE group with infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203313490240">Figure 1</xref>). Among 24 SLE patients with infection, 63% (15/24) had a maximum WBC count less than 15,000/µl and 38% (nine of 24) had a WBC count less than 11,000/µl. The two patients who received cyclophosphamide in the SLE group with infection did not have leukopenia. Among the four patients who received cyclophosphamide in the SLE group with noninfectious causes, one patient had leukopenia. A history of lupus nephritis was present in 89% (17/19) of SLE patients with noninfectious causes who had a maximum Cr greater than 1.2 mg/dl and in 55% (six of 11) of SLE patients with infection who had a maximum Cr greater than 1.2 mg/dl.

<p>In this study, we examined clinical data of SLE patients who were admitted to the ICU for infection. Infection was one of the most common causes for ICU admission. Among the 70 SLE patients hospitalized in the ICU and found in the Cooper University Hospital Project IMPACT database between 2002 and 2010, 35.7% (25/70) were admitted with infection. The result was consistent with several other studies that showed infection as a main cause for ICU admission in patients with rheumatic diseases including SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203313490240">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313490240"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313490240"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313490240">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the comparison between SLE patients admitted to the ICU for infection and SLE patients admitted for noninfectious causes, we found that the overall baseline clinical characteristics were similar in both groups. SLE patients have an increased risk for infection due to their inherent immune system abnormalities; however, this does not appear to be associated with any particular clinical features according to our data. Regarding treatments, both groups had a similar percentage of prednisone and cyclophosphamide treatments. The use of other immunosuppressive agents including methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil was numerically higher in SLE patients admitted for infection but it was not statistically significant. The percentages of patients who were taking hydroxychloroquine were low in both groups. We found that many patients who were taking immunosuppressive agents did not take hydroxychloroquine (data not shown).</p>
<p>The study demonstrated that SLE patients were able to have appropriate physiologic responses to infection. SLE patients with infection had higher maximum temperature, higher minimum and maximum HR, and lower minimum and maximum SBP compared to SLE patients with noninfectious causes. However, their WBC count was not statistically different. In our analysis, many SLE patients admitted for infection had normal or mildly elevated WBC count. It is possible that SLE patients do not generate a robust increase in WBC count because of their preexisting leukopenia and immunosuppressive treatments.</p>
<p>Neutropenia is common in SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313490240">17</xref></sup> Neutrophils undergo a process called NETosis, which is a specialized form of cell death characterized by rupture of cellular membranes and expulsion of a mesh-like structure termed a neutrophil extracellular trap (NET).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313490240">18</xref></sup> A recent study demonstrated that increased NETosis of neutrophils was observed in lupus patients and that abundant autoantigens including double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) present in the NET released from neutrophils are hypothesized to trigger autoimmunity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313490240">19</xref></sup> The association between leukopenia and infection in SLE is not well studied. In one study, a low WBC count in SLE patients at admission is a risk factor for a poor outcome in the ICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313490240">15</xref></sup> It is possible that a normal WBC count in SLE patients could delay the diagnosis of an infection. Another recent study showed that inadequate antimicrobial treatment is a risk factor for mortality in SLE patients admitted to the ICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203313490240">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>SLE patients with infection had a higher APACHE II score and a higher mortality compared to SLE patients with noninfectious causes. Several studies have shown that infection is a main cause of death in the ICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313490240">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203313490240">21</xref></sup> Among SLE patients with infection, nonsurvivors had higher APACHE II scores. Many previous studies showed that APACHE II scores were associated with mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313490240">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203313490240">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203313490240"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203313490240"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203313490240"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203313490240">25</xref></sup> Of note, serum Cr and SBP were significantly higher in nonsurvivors among SLE patients with noninfectious causes and this suggests that lupus nephritis is a major risk factor for mortality in this group. It was supported by the fact that most of patients with elevated Cr in the SLE group with noninfectious causes had a history of lupus nephritis. Several other studies have showed renal involvement due to lupus predicts a poor outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313490240">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313490240">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203313490240">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the comparison between SLE patients admitted for infection and non-SLE patients admitted for infection, SLE patients were significantly younger, with more females than the non-SLE patients who were admitted for infection. There was no difference in mortality between the two groups before and after adjustment for age and gender. Previous studies showed inconsistent results. Patients with rheumatic diseases including SLE had a similar mortality compared to nonselected patients in the ICU in several studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203313490240">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313490240">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961203313490240">27</xref></sup> whereas they had a higher mortality in one study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313490240">14</xref></sup> Age is one of the major prognostic factors in the ICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203313490240">28</xref></sup> SLE patients with infection had a numerically higher mortality compared to non-SLE patients with infection even if they were younger. It is likely that an insufficient number of subjects in the SLE group with infection led to the lack of statistical difference in the mortality between the two groups.</p>
<p>This study is the first to our knowledge that examined a subgroup of SLE patients who are admitted to the ICU for infection. Our study has several limitations. First, our data were retrieved from a single tertiary-care medical center. As a result, it was difficult to obtain sufficient numbers of patients for analysis and the results may not be applicable to hospitals in other areas. Secondly, our study is a retrospective study that is subject to multiple potential biases, including unavailability of certain data. In addition, we were unable to obtain the validated SLE activity scores, including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) or European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement (ECLAM) for the patients. We noted many patients who were labeled as having SLE did not meet criteria and excluded those patients from our study. Further prospective studies are warranted to examine risk factors as well as long-term prognosis of SLE patients with serious infections.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study showed that SLE patients admitted to the ICU for infection had a higher mortality and a higher APACHE II score compared to SLE patients with noninfectious causes in the ICU. SLE patients had appropriate physiologic signs in response to infection, including increased temperature, increased HR, and decreased SBP. However, WBC count was normal or mildly elevated in many patients. Our data raise the possibility that WBC count is misleading in diagnosing infection in SLE patients admitted to the ICU.</p>
