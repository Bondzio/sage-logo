<abstract>
<p>Some students who have developmental disabilities avoid settings and activities that can improve their learning and quality of life. This two-phase study concerned an adolescent boy with autism who avoided the gross-motor exercise room, gymnasium, and music room at his school; he demonstrated distress, agitation, and problem behaviors when prompted to enter these areas. Using graduated exposure combined with positive reinforcement, he learned to enter these settings without resisting and eventually to participate in activities within the settings. This article discusses this intervention approach for reducing and eliminating avoidant behavior.</p>

<body>
<p>Children and adolescents who have an intellectual and/or developmental disability (IDD) sometimes avoid certain settings and activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512456547">Jennett &amp; Hagopian, 2008</xref>). Avoidant behavior is usually provoked by a particular stimulus or event and is then negatively reinforced when the stimulus or event is either removed or the person prevents contact with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512456547">Luiselli, 2010</xref>). For example, a child or adolescent with IDD may become agitated and disruptive to avoid activities that are stressful or excessively demanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445512456547">Miltenberger, 2006</xref>). Avoidance is also seen in cases of specific phobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512456547">Ricciardi, Luiselli, &amp; Camare, 2006</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512456547">Jennett and Hagopian (2008)</xref> proposed the term <italic>phobic</italic> avoidance to describe avoidant behavior that is “coupled with responses universally considered as indicators of anxious and fearful states (e.g., crying, screaming, physical resistance, running away, shaking, wide eyes, grimacing, and aggressive or other problem behavior)” (p. 151). Whatever the origin of avoidant behavior, it can seriously limit educational and habilitation opportunities as well as socialization with peers and care-providers.</p>
<p>As noted, avoidant behavior among youth with IDD can be highly situation-specific. To illustrate, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512456547">Rapp, Vollmer, and Hovanetz (2005)</xref> treated a 14-year-old girl with autism who avoided swimming pools. Positive reinforcement alone did not eliminate pool avoidance until the procedure was combined with response blocking (physically preventing the girl from leaving the pool). In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512456547">Ricciardi et al. (2006)</xref> eliminated avoidant behavior of an 8-year-old boy who had autism and specific phobia of animatronic objects. Intervention consisted of a fear hierarchy that initially exposed the boy to the objects at a safe distance. In successive steps, positive reinforcement was presented when the boy moved closer to and ultimately touched the objects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145445512456547">Shabani and Fisher (2006)</xref> used a similar procedure to treat an 18-year-old male’s phobic response to needles. In that study, gradual exposure to the lancet through a distance hierarchy and differential reinforcement for tolerance of the lancet were effective for decreasing the individual’s problem behavior. In addition, other studies reported positive effects from gradual exposure and differential reinforcement without response blocking in treating avoidance behaviors when children were required to get a haircut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445512456547">Schumacher &amp; Rapp, 2011</xref>) and wear prescription prostheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145445512456547">Richling et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The participant in the present study was an adolescent boy with autism who avoided and resisted exposure to distinct settings and activities at school. His setting and activity avoidance was associated with serious problem behaviors and had been resistant to previous interventions. As well, he appeared frightened and emotionally distressed when walking near or when someone urged him to enter these specific settings, but not all settings. We sought to extend the literature by evaluating graduated exposure and contingent reinforcement as a “desensitization” approach to avoidance of multiple settings that did not include physical intervention such as escape extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445512456547">Carr &amp; Newsom, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512456547">Rapp et al., 2005</xref>). Other aspects of the study included evaluating the intervention within a community-based environment as implemented by educational care-providers. The study was conducted in two phases, initially to establish approach toward the avoided settings and later to promote activity participation.</p>

<title>Participant and Settings</title>
<p>Jonah was a 16-year-old male who had diagnoses of severe intellectual disability and autistic disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445512456547">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). He did not speak but communicated using gestures and modified sign language. Receptively, he was able to follow familiar one-step commands. Jonah needed near continuous adult supervision and support to complete most daily living and self-care skills.</p>
<p>The study was performed at a specialized school for children and adolescents with IDD where Jonah received individualized instruction in a classroom for 6 hr each weekday. A primary teacher and four assistants conducted activities with him according to goals and methods outlined in his individualized educational program (IEP). The five individuals also implemented measurement and intervention procedures during the study.</p>
<p>Although Jonah complied with most classroom activities, he actively resisted entering three locations at the school: (a) music room, (b) gymnasium, and (c) gross-motor exercise room. These locations were used for outside-classroom activities and served as the three settings in the study. Previous efforts to have Jonah enter these settings and participate in activities included staff prompting him physically and preventing him from leaving without permission. These efforts were unsuccessful and associated with Jonah becoming agitated and vocally disruptive, eloping, and displaying aggressive, self-injurious, and destructive behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145445512456547">
<title>Measurement</title>
<p>In Phase I of the study, the dependent measure was the closest distance (meters) Jonah approached the threshold of the music room, gymnasium, and gross-motor exercise room before he demonstrated one of four problem behaviors: (a) self-injury (biting his finger or hitting his lower jaw), (b) aggression (slapping, punching, kicking, pushing, or head-butting staff), (c) property destruction (breaking or ripping an inanimate object), and (d) elopement (walking or running one or more steps in a direction opposite the settings). In effect, the first occurrence of a problem behavior during the transition from his classroom to the music room, gymnasium, and gross-motor exercise room represented the closest distance to these settings that Jonah would tolerate. For the purpose of data collection, a marker was placed on the floor where Jonah first demonstrated a problem behavior and the distance from the marker to the destination threshold was calculated using a tape measure.</p>
<p>In Phase II of the study, the dependent measure was the duration (minutes) Jonah remained in the music room, gymnasium, and gross-motor exercise room, to a maximum duration of 5 min, before the first occurrence of self-injury, aggression, property destruction, and elopement. Duration was measured by having a designated staff person activate a stopwatch when Jonah entered the setting and terminate the stopwatch when Jonah either demonstrated problem behaviors or the 5-min activity was completed, whichever came first.</p>
<p>The activities Jonah was expected to engage in within the three settings were manipulating a tambourine (music room), shooting a basketball (gymnasium), and completing an obstacle course (gross-motor exercise room). During intervention sessions (described below), these activities were performed with only Jonah and one staff person present in each setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0145445512456547">
<title>Interobserver Agreement (IOA)</title>
<p>In Phase I of the study, IOA was assessed during 95.7% of sessions distributed across baseline and intervention conditions for the music room, gymnasium, and gross-motor exercise room. To assess IOA, the senior author and one staff person independently recorded when Jonah had a problem behavior but used a consensus agreement regarding the location of the occurrence of the behavior. The senior author then placed a paper marker on the floor to indicate the closest distance Jonah approached the three settings. The distance to the doorway was then measured. Average IOA was 100%.</p>
<p>In Phase II, IOA was assessed during 60.6% (music room), 69.6% (gymnasium), and 58.6% (gross-motor exercise room) of sessions distributed across baseline and intervention conditions. To assess IOA, the senior author and one staff person independently recorded the duration of time Jonah spent in the three settings. An agreement was scored if both individuals recorded a duration measure that was ±2 s of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445512456547">Mudford, Martin, Hui, &amp; Taylor, 2009</xref>). Any duration discrepancies that were more than 2 s resulted in a disagreement. Average IOA for the duration of time ±2 s was 98%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0145445512456547">
<title>Procedures and Experimental Design</title>
<p>In Phase I, procedures were evaluated in a combined changing criterion design and concurrent multiple baseline design across settings. Immediately following Phase I, we implemented Phase II within a changing criterion design.</p>
<sec id="section6-0145445512456547">
<title>Phase I</title>
<p>The purpose of Phase I was to determine how close in distance Jonah would come to each activity area. After determining this, we created a distance hierarchy, and Jonah was provided a preferred edible when he crossed the predetermined threshold. The terminal goal of this phase was to have him walk to the doorway of each area without engaging in problem behaviors.</p>
<sec id="section7-0145445512456547">
<title>Baseline</title>
<p>Baseline sessions began with Jonah and a designated staff person in the classroom. The staff person instructed Jonah “It is time to go to the _______” (music room, gymnasium, gross-motor exercise room), opened the classroom door, and walked with him toward the setting destination. If Jonah displayed self-injury or property destruction during the transition, the staff person paused for 5 s and then said, “Jonah, its time to go back to the classroom.” If Jonah demonstrated aggression, the staff person physically stopped the behavior by holding his hands against the sides of his body for 30 s. After 30 s, the staff person stepped back and informed Jonah to return to the classroom. This aggression-contingent procedure was one component of a written behavior support plan (BSP) that staff implemented with Jonah within the classroom. Finally, if Jonah eloped, the staff person delivered the instruction to return to the classroom. Thus, during baseline, our objective was to measure how close Jonah approached the music room, gymnasium, and gross-motor exercise room without emitting problem behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0145445512456547">
<title>Preintervention assessment</title>
<p>Preceding Phase I, the senior author conducted a multiple stimulus with replacement preference assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512456547">Deleon &amp; Iwata, 1996</xref>) to identify edible items that could be included as reinforcers during intervention. As the result of assessment, several foods were selected including oatmeal cream pies and candy. Next, we conducted a functional behavioral assessment to identify influences on Jonah’s setting and activity avoidance. The assessment methods included (a) review of case history documents, (b) interviews with past and current staff using the Functional Assessment Interview (FAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445512456547">O’Neill et al., 1997</xref>), and (c) direct observations of baseline sessions. Although not conclusive, through this assessment we concluded that Jonah “disliked” and avoided the music room, gymnasium, and gross-motor exercise room because he only had minimal exposure to these settings and was unfamiliar with the respective activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0145445512456547">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>During intervention sessions, a second staff person stood at a designated distance marker on the route from Jonah’s classroom to the setting destination. When Jonah walked successfully to the marker without problem behaviors, the staff person delivered praise and gave him a small amount of one of his preferred foods. Jonah was then allowed to return to his classroom. If Jonah displayed problem behaviors during a session, staff implemented the identical procedures applied during baseline.</p>
<p>The first distance marker set for the music room, gymnasium, and gross-motor exercise room was calculated by taking 30% of the closest distance Jonah walked to each setting before displaying problem behaviors during baseline. We selected this criterion to increase the probability that he would be successful and contact positive reinforcement. Throughout intervention, distance was increased 20% of the first distance marker for each setting whenever Jonah was successful (absence of problem behaviors) at a criterion distance during two consecutive sessions. The distance continued to advance following two consecutive sessions until Jonah was able to stand at the threshold of each setting, without problem behaviors, for three consecutive sessions.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0145445512456547">
<title>Phase II</title>
<p>The purpose of phase II was to increase the duration of time that Jonah would participate in each activity area, without engaging in problem behaviors, using gradual exposure and differential reinforcement.</p>
<sec id="section11-0145445512456547">
<title>Baseline</title>
<p>With Jonah standing at the threshold of the music room, gymnasium, and gross-motor exercise room, the staff person requested that he enter the setting to participate in the respective activity. If he displayed problem behaviors, either before entering or within the setting, the staff person implemented the identical procedures applied during Phase I. That is, Jonah was told, “It is time to go back to the classroom.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0145445512456547">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>During intervention sessions, baseline conditions remained in effect with two exceptions. First, a second staff person was present in the music room, gymnasium, and gross-motor exercise room to greet Jonah when he arrived at the threshold. This staff person then gave Jonah a small edible when he crossed the threshold. Next, the staff person set a timer to a criterion duration, which represented the time Jonah had to remain in the setting. Jonah was verbally prompted to engage in the respective activity, and when the timer sounded, the staff person delivered praise and another edible. The staff person who had walked with Jonah then allowed him to exit the setting and return to his classroom. The criterion duration was initially 2 s in each setting and was increased over successive sessions to a maximum of 300 s. Criteria were advanced based on Jonah’s performance during preceding intervention sessions.</p>
<p>The staff person interacting with Jonah in the music room, gymnasium, and gross-motor exercise room initially prompted him during activities using partial physical guidance, verbal instructions, and demonstration. During early sessions, Jonah also received a small amount of one of his preferred foods when he completed each step of an activity. As Jonah began to perform successfully for longer periods of time in the music room, gymnasium, and gross-motor exercise room, the staff person prompted him less and “thinned” the schedule of reinforcement. For example, presentation of food was faded from completing every step to completing the entire activity. As well, the staff person gradually stopped guiding Jonah through every step until he was able to participate in the activity independently.</p>
<p>Starting at session 61 in the music room only, additional reinforcement was added by dividing the activity duration criterion into five equal intervals and giving Jonah a token (poker chip) following each successful interval. When Jonah acquired all five tokens, he exchanged them for a highly preferred food that was only available to him in the music room. Over several sessions, the previously delivered edible was removed in favor of tokens exclusively. This procedure was implemented in the music room so that tokens could substitute for the edible that had to be delivered more frequently.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0145445512456547">
<title>Staff training</title>
<p>Preceding the study, the senior author conducted training with the five classroom staff members by having them review written procedural guidelines (measurement, baseline, and intervention conditions), observe respective role-play scenarios, and implement procedures during simulated sessions. Training lasted approximately 1 hr. As a further component of training, the senior author observed staff during 100% of baseline sessions and 97.7% of intervention sessions during Phase I, and 100% of baseline sessions and 95.6% (music room), 95.5% (gymnasium), and 97.0% (gross-motor exercise room) of intervention sessions during Phase II. Following observations, the senior author commented briefly to staff about their performance and clarified procedures as warranted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0145445512456547">
<title>Maintenance</title>
<p>After the last day of intervention in the music room, gymnasium, and gross-motor exercise room, Jonah started attending these activities with his peers according to the regular classroom schedule. The goal of this condition was to evaluate whether he would continue to approach the settings and participate in activities beyond the individual intervention sessions. During the maintenance evaluation, there were between one to five peers and one to four staff in each setting. The maximum 5-min activity duration remained in effect and staff continued to implement intervention procedures.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145445512456547">Figure 1</xref> presents the multiple baseline design across settings evaluation. These data indicate that during intervention, Jonah was able to successfully remain at the threshold of the gymnasium (top panel), music room (middle panel), and gross-motor exercise room (bottom panel) over the course of multiple sessions. In total, he successfully achieved the Phase I intervention criterion for the gymnasium after 20 sessions, the music room after 15 sessions, and the gross-motor exercise room after 10 sessions.</p>

<p>Under maintenance conditions in the gymnasium, Jonah was successful during 100% of sessions. In the gross-motor exercise room, he displayed problem behaviors before entering the setting in four sessions but otherwise succeeded on every occasion. During maintenance in the music room, Jonah displayed problem behaviors in the first session but completed the remaining three sessions successfully.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Combining graduated exposure with positive reinforcement effectively eliminated long-standing setting and activity avoidance in an adolescent with autism. Before the study, Jonah would not enter three distinct settings at a specialized school, resisting efforts to do so; demonstrating distress, agitation, externalizing behaviors; and setting specificity consistent with “phobic” avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512456547">Jennett &amp; Hagopian, 2008</xref>). As a result, he was unable to participate in instructional activities that were critical to his learning and development. When the study concluded, Jonah was readily accessing these settings and engaging in activities without problem behaviors. In addition, the maintenance evaluation showed that the positive effects of intervention could be supported when Jonah was present with his peers and multiple staff.</p>
<p>Our objectives in the study were first, to teach Jonah to gradually approach previously avoided settings, reinforce the behavior accordingly, and, if successful, have him tolerate progressively increasing activity demands within those locations. In effect, we started by having him tolerate the earliest steps of the exposure chain (standing at the doorway of the settings) before trying to involve him in the respective activities, possibly changing the establishing operation for the avoidant behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445512456547">McGill, 1999</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512456547">Jennett and Hagopian (2008)</xref> concluded that exposure and reinforcement qualify as “a well-established treatment for the behavioral component of phobic avoidance in individuals with intellectual disabilities” (p. 160). In addition, we wanted the study to have strong external validity by having Jonah’s care- providers implement the intervention under naturalistic conditions. Results demonstrated that staff members were able to conduct the intervention successively. In particular, Jonah exhibited infrequent problem behaviors during intervention sessions. As well, there were few interruptions (setbacks) to the planned intervention criteria that were established. Although the first author’s presence may have served as an additional stimulus prompt for staff performance, this control was deemed essential to ensure intervention integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445512456547">DiGennaro Reed &amp; Codding, 2011</xref>) because the procedures used were atypical for this setting and staff.</p>
<p>Jonah performed differently within the three targeted settings. For example, he achieved the 5-min activity duration in the gymnasium and gross-motor exercise room more quickly than in the music room. Of note, observations preceding the study and Jonah’s clinical history revealed that he usually had fewer problem behaviors during activities that involved active movement. Thus, it is likely that he was better able to tolerate the gymnasium and gross-motor exercise room activities. By contrast, in the music room there were more sedentary activities, which he possibly found less desirable. As a result, he required a longer exposure period as well as the addition of supplemental intervention procedures in the form of token reinforcement to be successful.</p>
<p>One limitation to the study is that we did not conduct a functional analysis of Jonah’s setting and activity avoidance. However, the multiple baseline design demonstrated experimental control and was more feasible for the school setting. In addition, several other relevant studies in the behavioral field verified treatment effects without conducting a functional analysis, and instead had an escape baseline based on information that was collected (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512456547">DeLeon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145445512456547">Richling et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445512456547">Schumacher &amp; Rapp, 2011</xref>). Another limitation, due to limited staff availability in Phase I, is that we were only able to calculate consensus agreement on the exact distance that Jonah traveled before he displayed a problem behavior. However, because problem behaviors were clearly observable, and the respective IOA was 100%, there should be no error about distance.</p>
<p>When interpreting the results of this study, it is important to consider that we did not measure Jonah’s participation in the music room, gymnasium, and gross-motor exercise room beyond the maximum 5-min duration criterion. Moreover, staff continued to implement positive reinforcement during the maintenance evaluation. A question remains, of course, whether the effects of intervention would persist during lengthier activities in the three settings and with reinforcement withdrawn. Concerning reinforcement, our selection of edibles for Jonah was based on an individualized preference assessment, with eventual schedule fading and transfer to token stimuli. Certainly, reinforcers in a graduated exposure program must be sufficiently motivating to support initial approach responses.</p>
<p>Our findings lend support to the few studies that have evaluated “shaping” interventions for decreasing highly situation-specific avoidant behavior among youth with IDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512456547">Rapp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512456547">Ricciardi et al., 2006</xref>). In summary, it appears that the optimal strategy for practitioners is to construct an approach hierarchy and reinforce progressively closer proximity to and/or contact with avoided stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445512456547">Luiselli, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, this approach toward avoidance desensitization can be accomplished without provoking challenging behaviors or intervening physically with response blocking or similar methods. Concerning physical intervention, we reiterate that the aggression-contingent procedure that staff implemented with Jonah during the study was a component of an already existing BSP—The procedure was not intended to address his phobic avoidance.</p>
<p>Further replication of graduated exposure and positive reinforcement is needed to establish these procedures as recommended practice for overcoming avoidant behavior. On a clinical level, we recommend exposure hierarchies that are slow paced to promote “errorless” acquisition of approach behavior. From an experimental perspective, the changing criterion design fits properly with the objective of evaluating incremental (step-wise) adjustments to intervention or a multiple baseline design would be applicable when avoidance behavior is encountered in more than one setting or in the presence of several stimuli.</p>
