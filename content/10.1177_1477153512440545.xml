<abstract>
<p>Climate-based daylight modelling is based on the available weather data, which means that the weather data used as input to the daylight simulations are of great importance. In this paper, the effect on the outcome of the daylight simulations of using one weather data file rather than another for the same location was investigated. Furthermore, the effect of using weather data sets with an hourly resolution compared to a one-minute resolution was investigated. The results showed that the lighting dependencies varied by up to 2% depending on the chosen weather data file and indoor illuminance threshold. The energy consumption for artificial lighting was underestimated when simulating with time steps of hourly means compared to one-minute resolution. The findings from this comparison show that the dynamic, short-term effects of the weather have a surprisingly small impact on the simulation outcome.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1477153512440545"><title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>During the last decade, research in the field of daylighting has discussed the shortcomings of the conventional, static daylight factor method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477153512440545">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477153512440545"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477153512440545"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477153512440545">4</xref></sup> However, the good practice evaluation method for daylight in national standards (i.e. BR10<sup>5</sup> and British Standards Institution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153512440545">6</xref></sup>) is still the daylight factor method. In 2006, Mardaljevic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477153512440545">2</xref></sup> described this situation as being ‘because of its simplicity rather than its capacity to describe reality’. The daylight factor calculation evaluates the daylight conditions for one standard CIE overcast sky omitting the natural local variations in available daylight. In 2000, Mardaljevic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477153512440545">7</xref></sup> and Reinhart and Herkel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477153512440545">8</xref></sup> demonstrated that reliable predictions based on hourly climatic data are attainable when applying the climate-based daylight modelling (CBDM) principle. ‘CBDM is the prediction of various radiant or luminous quantities (e.g. irradiance, illuminance, radiance and luminance) using sun and sky conditions that are derived from standard meteorological datasets’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477153512440545">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477153512440545">6</xref></sup> CBDM thereby includes the dynamic effects of daylight described in the meteorological data files like changes in cloud cover, variations over time and seasons. The CBDM approach is based on available weather data, which means that the weather data used as input to the daylight simulations are of great importance.</p>
<p>Several weather data sets are available for the same location. For Copenhagen, the available data sets are the Design Reference Year (DRY), the data set from Meteonorm and the homepage of Energy Plus. The daylight simulation program Daysim encourages the designer to use the weather data files from the Energy Plus homepage, as Daysim supports the .epw file format.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477153512440545">9</xref></sup> In this study, the effect on the outcome of the daylight simulations if the designer uses one of the three above-mentioned weather data sets is investigated. Furthermore, the effect of using data with an hourly resolution compared to a one-minute resolution is investigated. In a study by Walkenhorst <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512440545">10</xref></sup> it is concluded that neglecting the short-term dynamics can introduce substantial errors in the simulation of the specific annual electric energy demand for automated control strategies of artificial lighting systems. In the study, they implemented a modified Skartveit–Olseth method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477153512440545">11</xref></sup> to create one-minute irradiance data from hourly means. By comparing the electricity consumption of lighting for simulations using irradiances from one-hour and one-minute data sets, they found that the consumptions are underestimated by 6–18% when using one-hour irradiance values. In another study by Roisin <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477153512440545">12</xref></sup> they compared simulations from hourly means to one-minute time steps obtained by applying the same method as in Walkenhorst <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512440545">10</xref></sup> Contrary to Walkenhorst <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512440545">10</xref></sup> they found less than 1% differences between the one-hour and one-minute simulations for simulation over a whole year. In this study, the one-minute data sets will also be generated following the Skartveit–Olseth method implemented in Daysim.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477153512440545">9</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1477153512440545"><title>2. Method</title>
<p>The two hypotheses to be tested are:
<list id="list1-1477153512440545" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Simulations with different weather data sets for the same location will have an insignificant influence on the estimation of the energy consumption for artificial lighting.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With the artificial lighting being automatically controlled, simulations with one-minute resolution compared to one-hour resolution will have a significant impact on the energy consumption of the artificial lighting.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The first hypothesis will be tested through simulations with different weather data sets for the location of Copenhagen. The second hypothesis will be tested through comparisons between the simulations of hourly means and one-minute means for different climatic locations and different types of automatic control. The different climatic locations chosen are Copenhagen, Geneva and Phoenix. Geneva was chosen as this was one of the locations which was also studied by Walkenhorst <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512440545">10</xref></sup> It has not been possible to access the measured data used in their study, and the weather data file used for the simulations is therefore the available International Weather for Energy Calculations (IWEC) weather data file from the Energy Plus homepage. Phoenix was chosen as this location compared to the location of Copenhagen and Geneva represents a sunny climate. Comparisons between the total annual global and diffuse horizontal irradiance for the different weather data sets and locations are given in Section 3.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1477153512440545"><title>2.1. Dynamic daylight simulations</title>
<p>The dynamic simulations of indoor illuminances due to daylight are performed using the Radiance simulation environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477153512440545">13</xref></sup> A daylight coefficient approach is applied following the three-phase method which permits reliable and fast dynamic indoor illuminance simulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477153512440545">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477153512440545">15</xref></sup> The sky simulated is the Perez all weather sky discretized using the Reinhart division scheme subdivided into 2306 patches. The Radiance routine gendaylit creates a sky according to the Perez all weather model. However, for some time steps, gendaylit fails to produce the right output, which occurs at dusk or dawn. For the location of Copenhagen using the DRY file with one-minute resolution, this happens 190 times. At these times, the illuminance is set to zero, assuming that it is night time. The illuminances obtained from Radiance are post-processed in Matlab. The data are corrected for daylight saving time and the office hours from 8:00 to 17:00 are investigated.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1477153512440545"><title>2.2. Weather data</title>
<p>Weather data for a large number of locations across the world are available for download from several websites. The weather data are derived from a longer measurement period and they are structured to have the same properties as the measured data, with averages and variations that are typical for the site.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1477153512440545"><title>2.2.1. Design Reference Year</title>
<p>The DRY consists of data describing the external climatic conditions compiled from 12 typical months for a given location. The irradiance values in DRY for Copenhagen are compiled from 15 years of measurements made at the measurement station at Landbohøjskolen, Taastrup.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477153512440545">16</xref></sup> A research project has just been initiated with the focus on generating a new DRY with a finer resolution taking into account the climate changes.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1477153512440545"><title>2.2.2. Meteonorm</title>
<p>For the available weather data from Meteonorm, the daily and hourly global radiation values are generated from monthly average values by the stochastic time-dependent, autoregressive, Gaussian model (TAG-model).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477153512440545">17</xref></sup> From the global radiation, the direct and diffuse components are deduced following the method of Perez <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477153512440545">18</xref></sup> from 1991, where they convert the hourly global irradiance to direct irradiance values. The irradiance data for Copenhagen are measured at the Technological Institute in Taastrup and Lund University, and interpolated values from these two stations are the basis for the weather data set. The measurement period was from 1981 to 2000. Uncertainties given for all sites are the same: 10% for global irradiation and 20% for beam irradiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477153512440545">19</xref></sup></p>

<p>Weather data are available from the Energy Plus home page, courtesy of the US Department of Energy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477153512440545">20</xref></sup> The data are derived from 20 different sources from all over the world. For Denmark, the data are generated from the IWEC file for Copenhagen. In total, 227 locations outside the USA are available in the IWEC weather files that were developed under the ASHRAE research project RP-1015.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477153512440545">21</xref></sup> The IWEC files are ‘typical years’ that normally stay away from extreme conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477153512440545">22</xref></sup> The data are generated based on a measurement period from 1982 to 1999. From these 18 years, 12 typical months were selected using the Typical Meteorological Year procedure and assembled into a ‘typical’ file. The Kasten model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477153512440545">23</xref></sup> is used for calculating global solar radiation and the output is then fed to the Perez <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1477153512440545">24</xref></sup> model from 1992 for the calculation of diffuse and direct radiation. The largest distance allowed between the radiation measurement station and the location of the site was 50 km.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477153512440545">22</xref></sup> The IWEC files are categorized based on how well the solar radiation model performs. For the locations analysed in this study, the category is 1, which implies that the performance is satisfactory and can be used with confidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477153512440545">22</xref></sup></p>

<p>Both the DRY and the Energy Plus files have been converted to annual one-minute irradiance values from the hourly weather data files following the stochastic Skartveit–Olseth model implemented in Daysim.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477153512440545">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512440545">10</xref></sup> The only required input data are the site coordinates, elevation and hourly irradiance data.

The relative standard deviation of the specific annual electric energy demand for artificial lighting resulting from ten different realizations of the model never exceeds 0.7%. Therefore, one single realization of the model should yield sufficient simulation accuracy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512440545">10</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec9-1477153512440545"><title>2.3. Evaluation methods</title>
<p>The presented results are based on the lighting dependency (LD). LD defines the percentage of the occupied hours per year when electric lighting has to be added to maintain a minimum work plane illuminance threshold. The LD is the reverse of the daylight autonomy (DA), defined by Reinhart and Walkenhorst.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1477153512440545">25</xref></sup> The DA describes the percentage of occupied hours per year when a minimum work plane illuminance threshold can be maintained by daylight alone.</p>
<p>For an on/off lighting system with daylight harvesting, the LD describes the relative energy consumption for delivering light to the room excluding energy consumption of the ballast and control system. The energy consumption (Wh/m<sup>2</sup>) can be calculated by Equation (1).

<p>Appropriate lighting controls are essential to make use of the available amount of daylight. The major distinctions among control strategies are whether they are open- or closed-loop systems, and whether they utilize on/off switching or continuous dimming.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477153512440545">28</xref></sup> In this study, we are looking at an ideal closed-loop control, based on the illuminance striking a sensor point on the working plane in the front and in the back of a room. The LD of the room is then given as the average of the LD at the two sensor points:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-1477153512440545"><label>(3)</label><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="math3-1477153512440545"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>LD</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>room</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>LD</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>front</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>LD</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>back</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula3-1477153512440545" xlink:href="10.1177_1477153512440545-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>In reality, the lights will be controlled after a sensor signal, which could be illuminance, dependent on the detection area and calibration of the sensor. As the scope of this study is to investigate the effect of different weather data files and time step resolution on simulation outcome, the distinction between ‘real’ and ideal control is beyond the scope of this study. For the automatic dynamic control of the artificial lights, four different control strategies have been applied: (1) photoelectric switch on/off for each time step, as illustrated by LD; (2) photoelectric dimming, as illustrated by LD<sub>con</sub> (proportional response); (3) photoelectric dimming for every 10 minutes, LD<sub>con,10 min</sub>; and (4) proportional integral (PI) dimming, where the response is averaged over the past 10 minutes (LD<sub>PI</sub>). It is assumed that the relationship between the light output and sensor signal is linear.</p>

<p>The hourly simulations obtained from the irradiance data available in the weather data files for Copenhagen show differences in LD up to 2%, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1477153512440545">Figure 4</xref>. This implies that even though the different weather data sets have a unique pattern for each day, the difference is balanced out when looking at the data over a full year. The largest discrepancy occurs at an illuminance threshold of 600 lx, with higher illuminances obtained from the DRY weather data file. In general, a slightly lower LD is seen when simulating with the DRY weather data file, which reflects the fact that the DRY weather data file is compiled to represent typical months including extreme conditions, whereas the Meteonorm and IWEC weather data files exclude extreme conditions. The potential energy savings, by implementing a photoelectric dimming system compared to a photoelectric switching on/off system, are presented by the difference in the bars of DRY and DRY<sub>con</sub>. The energy savings for the artificial lighting can directly be read from the difference in the histograms. Dependent on the threshold illuminance, the energy savings for the artificial lighting system vary between 5% and 21%.

<p>The comparison between lighting dependencies, both on/off and continuous, obtained from hourly means and one-minute data shows differences of up to 6% dependent on the indoor threshold illuminance and the chosen weather data, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1477153512440545">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1477153512440545">6</xref>.

<p>Even though the differences are small, the relative differences between simulations of hourly means and one-minute resolution can be quite high. For the sunny location of Phoenix, the relative differences are about 1250% and 350% with continuous control at threshold illuminance values of 100 lx and 200 lx. For the overcast locations of Copenhagen and Geneva, the relative differences are about 20% and 13% at illuminance thresholds of 100 lx and 200 lx. The general trend is that the relative differences decrease with higher illuminance thresholds.</p>
<p>When the purpose of the simulations is to investigate the finer dynamics of the control systems, one has to simulate with a finer time step. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1477153512440545">Figure 7</xref> shows the simulated lighting dependencies for four different automatic control strategies at Copenhagen and Phoenix simulated with the DRY and TMY3 weather data. The four different control strategies are given as follows:

</fig></p>
<p>The results show that there is no real difference in simulated lighting dependencies when simulating with continuous dimming for each time step, for every 10th minute or the PI control, where the response is averaged over the past 10 minutes. The reason for this is that when applying the control scheme for every 10th minute, the illuminance will either be over- or underestimated, and when evaluating for an entire year, the differences will be balanced out.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1477153512440545"><title>4. Discussion</title>
<p>As in the study by Walkenhorst <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512440545">10</xref></sup> it can be concluded that simulations of hourly means compared to one-minute resolution does not give a conservative estimate of the energy consumption for artificial lighting, since the LD is underestimated, resulting in decreased lighting demand. In the study by Roisin <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477153512440545">12</xref></sup> they found a difference of less than 1% using a threshold illuminance value of 500 lx. In the PhD thesis of Reinhart,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477153512440545">29</xref></sup> he elaborates further on the comparison between the weather data sets and finds that for the closed-loop system, the electrical lighting demand at a threshold illuminance of 500 lx is being underestimated by up to 9% when applying hourly means compared to one-minute simulations. This study shows that at a 500-lx threshold, the electrical lighting demand is underestimated by up to 6% for the sunny location of Phoenix and up to 3% for the more overcast climates of Copenhagen and Geneva when applying a resolution of hourly means compared to a one-minute resolution.</p>
<p>Typically, differences of up to 10% are considered to be good results in daylight simulations. The uncertainties regarding the simulation outcome could be derived from measurement error of irradiance values, the influence of the exact location of the sensor points and influence of surface reflectances within the room. Even though the differences between the simulations of hourly means and one-minute resolution are within the uncertainty for daylight simulation, the results show that by applying simulations of hourly means the energy consumption for artificial lighting is categorically being underestimated. Although the differences are small, the relative differences between the simulations can be quite high. For the sunny location of Phoenix, the relative difference is about 1250% and 350% with continuous control at a threshold illuminance value of 100 lx and 200 lx. However, at these threshold values, the overall energy demand for artificial light is small and the high relative difference can be of minor importance.</p>
<p>It is surprising that the short-term dynamics of the available daylight does not have a greater impact on the difference in continuous lighting dependencies between simulations of hourly means and one-minute resolution. One would have assumed that simulations of hourly means for most annual working hours would underestimate the LD to a higher degree, due to spikes with high illuminances increasing the hourly mean value. With an increased hourly mean value, the entire hour might have a sufficient daylight level, whereas the estimation with one-minute resolution might fall below the threshold illuminance value at some time steps causing lights to be switched off. However, this is not reflected in the results. The maximum discrepancy is 4.5% depending on the indoor threshold illuminance and type of lighting control.</p>
<p>In Walkenhorst <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512440545">10</xref></sup> they investigated the non-deterministic influence of the stochastic model on the simulation outcome and found that the impact is negligible. The relative standard deviation of the specific annual electric energy demand for artificial lighting resulting from ten different realizations of the model never exceeds 0.7%. The discrepancies found in this study are larger than 0.7%, which implies that it is the differences in weather data and not those in the stochastic model that are being simulated. In Walkenhorst <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477153512440545">10</xref></sup> they furthermore compared lighting electricity consumption of simulations using measured irradiances from one-hour and one-minute data sets and found that the consumptions are underestimated by 6–18% when using one-hour irradiance values. The discrepancies found in this study are smaller which points to the fact that the simulations of one-minute resolution, with the current data and models available do not behave as dynamically as expected. As pointed out in the PhD thesis of Reinhart,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477153512440545">29</xref></sup> the amount of intra-hour variations in the modified Skartveit–Olseth model are less pronounced than in reality as the model is stochastic. While differences between measured and simulated values may be substantial for a single day, the differences tend to vanish if a greater number of hours are considered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477153512440545">29</xref></sup> In the development of the IWEC files, the Skartveit–Olseth model was discarded, as they found that the model seemed to be tuned to European conditions and had not undergone extensive testing at other locations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477153512440545">22</xref></sup> To include the true dynamic behaviour of the sky, there is therefore a need for creating better models or to have measured irradiance data with a finer resolution than the hourly means.</p>
<p>The results show that there is no distinct difference in simulated lighting dependencies when applying continuous dimming for each time step compared to the PI control with the response averaged over the past 10 minutes. It is the authors’ belief that this result reflects the limitations in the modified Skartveit–Olseth model to imitate the intra-hour variations in available daylight. At present, using values of hourly means for the daylight simulations is therefore a reasonable predictor for the LD.</p>
<p>When evaluating the simulations based on hourly means for the different weather data files for the location of Copenhagen, no difference is observed when the threshold illuminance value for general lighting is 200 lx as prescribed according the Danish Standard DS700.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1477153512440545">30</xref></sup> The energy consumption for artificial light will therefore yield the same result independent of the weather data used for the calculations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1477153512440545"><title>5. Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, the effect on the outcome of the daylight simulations was investigated when simulating with different weather data files for the location of Copenhagen. It was found that the lighting dependencies generated based on the different weather data files for Copenhagen varied by up to 2% depending on the chosen indoor illuminance threshold. Each of the different weather data sets was therefore found to give a reasonable prediction of the LD.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the effect of simulating with weather data sets of an hourly resolution compared to a one-minute resolution showed that the LD was underestimated when using weather data of hourly means. However, the findings from this study show that the dynamic, short-term effects of the weather obtained from the modified Skartveit–Olseth method have a surprisingly small impact on the simulation outcome.</p>
<p>In terms of control of electrical lights, no distinct difference in simulated lighting dependencies was found when applying continuous dimming for each one-minute time step compared to the PI control with the response averaged over the past 10 minutes. At present, using values of hourly means for the daylight simulations is therefore a reasonable predictor for the LD.</p>
