<p>The current global economic and financial crisis that hit Europe in autumn 2008 and is currently bringing the euro area to the brink of collapse affected industrial relations in EU Member States in different ways. While in central western and northern Europe trade unions, employer organizations and the state played a crucial role in drafting and implementing measures to maintain and promote employment during the recession via collective bargaining and social dialogue, social partners in the central and eastern European (CEE) EU Member States (hereafter EU-10) were less able to mitigate the negative social consequences of the crisis. Thus, while in a number of western European countries the crisis resulted in a strengthening of collective bargaining and social partnership, in most of the EU-10 industrial relations – already decentralized, disorganized and fragmented – were further weakened.</p>
<p>As yet, the bulk of research has focused on western European countries, as for example presented in <italic>Transfer</italic> (see the 3/2011 issue). Much less systematic consideration has been given to the changing power constellations between social partners and state actors that underlie collective bargaining and social dialogue in the EU-10. As a contribution to closing this research gap, this special issue portrays developments in industrial relations in the EU-10 against the background of E(M)U accession and the current financial crisis.</p>
<p>The aim of the articles found in this issue is to shed light on social partner and policy responses to the crisis, addressing differences between the different types of CEE industrial relations and looking at individual sectors and employee groups (such as precariously employed workers). Most articles address collective bargaining in times of crisis at national and sectoral level, looking at such sectors as public health care, metalworking and construction where industry-wide collective bargaining is relatively well entrenched. However, while in some countries the crisis has resulted in a consolidation of collective bargaining at sectoral level, in others – dependent on trade union power and/or the degree of structural-economic power of highly skilled or scarce labour – national-level tripartite social dialogue has proved to be less effective and in some cases has even been regarded as ‘PR corporatism’. In sectors where collective bargaining institutions are lacking and where labour is weak (e.g. the retail sector), trade unions have increasingly pursued membership-based strategies such as media and organizing campaigns targeting an improvement in the working conditions of – for the most part – precariously employed workers. However, it is government decisions and political change that have had the most immediate impact on industrial relations and workers’ rights, directly affecting union and employer organization involvement in political decision-making.</p>
<p>As the findings presented in the articles indicate, responses to the crisis have differed across countries and sectors. However, the general trend towards increasing neoliberalism in industrial relations regimes in the CEE region seems to have accelerated during the economic downturn, resulting in a further decentralization and fragmentation of collective bargaining and a weakening of organized labour. It remains to be seen whether trade unions are able and willing to make use of alternative resources of power, such as strengthening their membership base and mobilizing workers and citizens against austerity measures and government unilateralism.</p>
