<p>Since its beginning in India, Buddhism in Buddhist countries has always been structured around the monks, the monasteries, and monasticism, and it would be impossible to imagine Buddhist studies without these topics. The essays in <italic>Buddhist Monasticism in East Asia: Places of Practice</italic> are collected from the conference held at the University of British Columbia in 2003. The editors, James A. Benn, Lori Meeks, and James Robson, and contributors, who are reputed scholars in Buddhist studies, religious studies, art history, and anthropology, collectively discuss a variety of topics in which they examine how monastic cultural practices and political functions of monasticism in medieval China and Japan were shaped by literary and artistic traditions.</p>
<p>Drawing exclusively on classical textual materials from China and Japan, the book provides diverse doctrinal and ritual contents as well as cross-cultural and comparative insights into the artistic tradition of Eastern Buddhist monasticism. I find James Robson’s introductory essay and the essays of Koichi Shinohara, William Bodiford, Paul Groner, and Lori Meeks to be the most impressive features of the volume. Robson’s introductory essay draws our attention to some methodological concerns and the greater challenges in Buddhist monastic studies. By placing himself in the line of Max Weber, Louis Dumont, Robert Buswell, Paul Harrison, and Gregory Schopen, Robson suggests that Buddhist monasticism should be situated within a comparative context of Christian and Hindu monastic studies. This essay is more interesting due to the inclusion of the issue of the Buddhist monastery being not only the place of spiritual practice, enlightenment, and soteriological function but also, like other established institutions, the source of the problematic political and economical realities (7). Although it is quite readable, I find this chapter to lack nuance and sophistication.</p>
<p>One of the most visible religious practices in Buddhist countries, particularly in South and Southeast Asian countries, is the taking of a ceremonial meal at lay supporters’ residence by the monks. Based on the Chinese translation of fragmentary Sanskrit manuscripts (<italic>āgama</italic>), in the first chapter, Koichi Shinohara examines Chinese interpretations of the ritual ceremonial meals offered to the community of the monks. He begins his examination by reviewing the popular stories of Ambapāli and Śrīgupta and he then includes the Vinaya commentaries of Daoxuan and Daoshi. Why does the laity serve the meal to the monks at their residence? In Shinohara’s hypothesis, it generates enormous merits for the laity (35). In the appendix, he provides comparative passages between key parallelisms found in the Mahāsamghika and Dharmguptaka Vinaya.</p>
<p>Unlike other essays that discuss the roles of the monks, James Robson’s contribution highlights another aspect of monasticism—that of the sacred characters and spaces of Chinese monasteries. Appropriately referring to the western monastic theorists such as Holmes Welch, Jacques Gernet, Denis Twichett, John Jorgensen, and T. Griffith Foulk, he reinstates the belief that Buddhist monasteries are not only a place for contemplative practice but also the centers for translation, scholasticism, and education. They even serve as orphanages, treasuries, granaries, etc. For him, the Buddhist monasteries are more than simple buildings (59). Art historian Eugene Wang contributes a paper emphasizing the dynamics of the iconography of the wall painting, icons, and other visual arts that were produced in 7th- to 8th-century China. He argues that wall paintings in the monasteries should not be interpreted primarily as mere decoration, but instead as real representations of the monastic space and meanings. The chapter contains 13 pictorial documentations found in the Jing’ai Monastery and at Dunhuang cave 217. T.H. Barrett, an East Asian historian, strengthens the volume by assessing the role and history of the medieval Japanese monastic cat. Interestingly, he finds that greedy people and lazy monks reincarnate as cats (109). Nevertheless, minor criticism should be raised regarding the term “monastic cat.” Barrett does not explain what is meant by the term and does not discuss the characteristics or qualifications required for a cat to be called a “monastic cat.”</p>
<p>William M. Bodiford, on the other hand, argues that one way of understanding medieval Japanese Buddhist society is to look at an insider’s perspective on the monastic institution and its relation to socio-political powers in medieval Japan. Much more interesting is Lori Meeks’s account. Here she investigates bodhisattva-precept-conferral ceremonies in medieval Japan. Her studies are based exclusively on a Vinaya revivalist priest Eison (1201–1290) who introduced precept-bestowal ceremonies to the masses. The real reason why a large number of people take bodhisattva-precept all at once is to accrue merits. Meeks observes that in medieval Japanese religious culture the merit of leaving home was strongly emphasized and widely practiced. Her historical exemplars could be related to the temporary ordination in Southeast Asian Buddhist countries. She, however, dismisses this similarity. A distinction between mass bodhisattva-precept ceremony events in East Asia and temporary ordinations in Southeast Asia can be found in the fact that “The practice related to home-leaving that came to be valued as a merit-making activity in East Asia was not time spent living as an ordained member of a monastic community, but rather the act of receiving precepts in a formal ceremony” (151). Many of the points discussed in the final article of the volume are more prescriptive than descriptive. Paul Groner, an expert on Japanese Buddhism, gives a meticulous explanation, structured around the Tendai school of Medieval Japanese Buddhism, of the hagiographical account of a monk, Kōen, and the rules for monasteries established by him, and the ritual of consecrated ordination.</p>
<p>Overall, the volume aims to achieve a better understanding of social, ritual, educational, political, and economic dimensions of Eastern Buddhist monasticism. It is nicely arranged and produced and is certainly a worthwhile book for those specialists who already have a good knowledge about monasticism. It has a comprehensive and up-to-date bibliography. It is a useful contribution to the literature on Buddhist studies, monastic studies, and East Asian religions. Finally, perhaps the greater depth of this work will inspire other academics, particularly students of Buddhist monastic studies, to carry out future research on Buddhist monasticism.</p>
