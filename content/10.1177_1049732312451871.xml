<abstract>
<p>In this article, we communicate transformative findings from a case study on the resilience of a young woman with fragile X syndrome (FXS), a genetic condition involving mental impairment and physical, emotional, and behavioral challenges. We explored the resilience of “Lucy,” a spirited 16-year-old North American, using informal interviews with her, formal interviews with significant adults in her life, and observations (visual and anecdotal) over 20 months. In reporting the information-rich case of Lucy, well supported by her ecology to rise above full-mutation FXS, we encourage a positive perspective of living with FXS. Although we recognize the limitations of a single case study, our findings offer tentative, process-oriented insights into resilience in contexts of genetic disability, previously unreported in conjunction with FXS. We concluded that the processes informing Lucy’s resilience were partly her responsibility and partly her social ecology’s, and comprised intrapersonal agency, unconditional positive acceptance and belonging, and support toward mastery.</p>

<body>
<p>In the United States, approximately one in every 4,000 men and one in every 6,000 to 8,000 women are affected by fragile X syndrome, or FXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312451871">Glaser et al., 2003</xref>). Although this is not a high incidence, FXS is associated with multiple, rigorous challenges, including mental and physical impairments, attention deficit and hyperactivity, and anxiety and unstable moods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312451871">Braden, 1996</xref>). These challenges predict nonresilient outcomes.</p>
<p>In 2008, the first author was a live-in carer to an adolescent woman diagnosed with FXS. What struck her was that this young woman (named Lucy for the purposes of this article) was cheerful and forward-looking, despite the many physical, mental, and emotional challenges her disability created. These observations were at odds with the literature on FXS, which emphasized the deficits and challenges associated with FXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312451871">Hagerman &amp; Hagerman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312451871">Hessl et al., 2001</xref>). The discrepancy between how the literature described youth with FXS and how Lucy responded adaptively piqued our curiosity about her positive adjustment.</p>
<p>The literature on resilience, or adaptive functioning despite being challenged by adverse life circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312451871">Masten, 2001</xref>), details numerous protective processes and resources that encourage young people to be resilient. Resources that buoy the capacity to cope well lie in individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312451871">Rutter, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312451871">Werner, 2006</xref>), but also in their social ecologies (Masten; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312451871">Ungar, 2011</xref>). Although the resilience literature amply describes these resources, no studies have focused on resilience in youth challenged by FXS. This prompted the following research question: What contributes to positive adjustment in an adolescent woman with FXS?</p>
<p>Because of the first author’s live-in proximity to Lucy, we believed it was an ideal opportunity to explore what contributed to her doing well, despite the daily challenges of living with FXS. Thus, the purpose of this article is to communicate the findings that emerged from this case study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312451871">Creswell, 2009</xref>) and, in so doing, to shed light on what the protective processes are that specifically encourage a young woman with FXS toward resilience. Although we are mindful of the limitations of generalizing findings from a qualitative study, these findings potentially transform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312451871">Mertens, 2009</xref>) the current deficit perspective that governs perceptions of youth with FXS and should be of interest to teachers, mental health professionals, other service providers, and parents who work with and care for young people diagnosed with FXS.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312451871">
<title>Resilience and FXS</title>
<p>A precondition for resilience is risk. Risk can be defined as “a measurable characteristic . . . that predicts negative outcome” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312451871">Wright &amp; Masten, 2006</xref>, p. 19). In the sections below, we briefly review what is known about the mechanisms that encourage youth to cope adaptively with difficult lives, before reporting how living with FXS denotes risk.</p>
<sec id="section2-1049732312451871">
<title>Resilience-Promoting Transactions</title>
<p>Resilience is manifested when a young person “does well” despite difficult life circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312451871">Ungar, 2010</xref>). Doing well is a variable process across cultures and contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312451871">Boyden, 2003</xref>). The process entails transactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312451871">Sameroff, 2010</xref>) between individuals and their social ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312451871">Ungar, 2011</xref>). In the process of adjusting well, young people aspire toward or “navigate to and negotiate for” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312451871">Ungar, 2010</xref>, p. 6) health resources that could protect them against risk, but resilience also demands that a social ecology reciprocates these aspirations by making appropriate protective resources available in culturally relevant ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312451871">Ungar, 2010</xref>). Thus, resilience is considered a cooperative person–context transaction, influenced by a given ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312451871">Lerner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312451871">Ungar, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Although resilience is variable across cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312451871">Ungar, 2011</xref>), researchers agree that there is some overlap of resilience-promoting resources across cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312451871">Masten &amp; Wright, 2010</xref>). We are comfortable providing a brief review of these resources because they are mostly based on studies conducted in Eurocentric or North American settings, which align well with the context of our current study. Typically, such resources are found at all levels of a social ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312451871">Bronfenbrenner, 1979</xref>) and operate through different mechanisms, including those of the individual, family, community, and culture. It is important to emphasize that the presence of these resources does not guarantee resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312451871">Rutter, 1984</xref>). More typically, these resources inform health-promoting transactions between young people and their ecologies. Masten and Wright argued that young people and their ecologies draw on health-promoting resources to facilitate protective processes such as attachment, mastery, meaning making, problem solving, and self-regulation. Thus, to understand a young person’s resilience, closer attention to the processes rooted in protective resources, rather than the resources themselves, is urged. Nevertheless, most studies to date have reported protective resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312451871">Werner, 2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-1049732312451871">
<title>Individual protective resources</title>
<p>The qualities, skills, and behaviors intrinsic to resilient adolescents, and their self- and worldviews, feed the processes of resilience. Inter alia, these typically include intelligence, an outgoing temperament, optimism, self-awareness, empathy, peacefulness, attractiveness, positive self-esteem, self-efficacy, social competency, a sense of humor, an internal locus of control, assertiveness, and autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312451871">Kumpfer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312451871">Masten, Cutuli, Herbers, &amp; Reed, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732312451871">
<title>Protective resources in the social ecology</title>
<p>Healthy families are a primary source of emotional and practical support toward resilience. These supports include care and encouragement, realistically high expectations, family connectedness, and parents who provide access to early intervention when their children are physically, scholastically, or emotionally vulnerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312451871">Kumpfer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312451871">Masten et al., 2009</xref>). Communities offer protection to youth, including access to mentors, prosocial peers, and caring nonparental adults (Masten et al.). Schools are a primary potential protective community resource when they are staffed by well-trained, caring teachers, promote positive teacher–learner relationships, and foster positive expectations and a climate of feeling safe. Within communities, a strong cultural identity protects young people in that it provides a sense of collective belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312451871">McCubbin &amp; McCubbin, 2005</xref>). Religious affiliations also serve to encourage a sense of belonging and additional networks of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312451871">Masten &amp; Wright, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732312451871">
<title>Working Definition</title>
<p>Given the above understanding, we adopted the following working definition of resilience: Resilience is more than an individual’s adaptive skills; it is a positive process between the individual and his or her ecology, which includes his or her relationships within and to family, community, and culture that encourage positive adaptation. Our knowledgeable advisory panel (as explained in the method section) endorsed this definition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312451871">
<title>The Risks Inherent to FXS</title>
<p>FXS is an inherited (genetic) condition, caused by a change in a single gene, the “FMR1” or “fragile X mental retardation 1,” located in the region of the fragile X site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312451871">Reiss &amp; Hall, 2007</xref>). It leads to a wide range of mental impairment, from mild learning disabilities to severe mental retardation, and is seen as the most common inherited cause of mental impairment. Mental impairment connotes risk for optimal development, not least because it is accompanied by learning difficulty, which is correlated with school failure, negative teacher and peer feedback, poor self-esteem, limited life options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312451871">Mather &amp; Ofiesh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312451871">Wiener, 2003</xref>), and peer rejection (Wiener). In short, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312451871">Goldberg, Higgins, Raskind, and Herman (2003)</xref> criticized extant understanding of the challenges facing individuals with learning disability as “shortsighted” (p. 234).</p>
<p>In addition to the learning difficulties associated with FXS, this syndrome is characterized by physical, emotional, and behavioral challenges. Although there is no typical example of a young woman with FXS, associated physical disabilities might include lost connective tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312451871">Reiss &amp; Hall, 2007</xref>), hypotonia or low muscle tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451871">Hagerman, 2000</xref>), poor gross motor and fine motor coordination, visual impairment, high and sometimes narrow palate, and motor tics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312451871">Hagerman, 2002</xref>). Other associated characteristics include behavioral and emotional issues, such as hyperactivity, poor attention span, and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312451871">Harris-Schmidt &amp; Fast, 2004</xref>); speech and language development issues, such as immature verbal skills, verbal perseveration, and pragmatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451871">Hagerman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312451871">Scharfenaker, 2004</xref>); sensory integration issues, such as tactile defensiveness and hyperarousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312451871">Braden, 1996</xref>); and cognitive development issues, such as poor short-term memory, limited executive functioning, and perceptual difficulties (Reiss &amp; Hall). As with mental impairment, these symptoms potentiate social exclusion and experiences of rejection and/or failure. The above negative impacts associated with FXS encouraged us to conceptualize FXS as threatening to positive outcomes. In all probability, FXS predicts negative outcomes. Related to this, we struggled to find studies that suggested that individuals with FXS led full or satisfying lives.</p>

<sec id="section7-1049732312451871">
<title>Protective Resources Reported for Young Women With FXS</title>
<p>Although there has been an increasing movement away from deficit-focused studies, applying a resilience lens to disability in general is recent and limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312451871">Margalit, 2003</xref>). The few studies that we could locate pertained to resilience and learning disability and focused on the identification of protective resources more than processes. For example, researchers reported, among others, that in the presence of learning disability, children’s resilience was encouraged by school-based interventions, which included differentiated instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312451871">Mather &amp; Ofiesh, 2006</xref>), supportive adults who were mostly parents and teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312451871">Margalit, 2003</xref>; Mather &amp; Ofiesh; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312451871">Wong, 2003</xref>), close friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312451871">Al-Yagon &amp; Mikulincer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312451871">Margalit, 2003</xref>), experiences of nonacademic success (Mather &amp; Ofiesh), opportunities to develop self-understanding and self-acceptance (Mather &amp; Ofiesh), and meaningful leisure activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312451871">Margalit, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312451871">Goldberg et al.’s (2003)</xref> longitudinal study of successful outcomes despite the challenges of learning disability added success attributes (self-awareness, proactivity, perseverance, goal determination, constructive use of social support networks, and emotional coping strategies) to the aforementioned.</p>
<p>Despite the limited nature of what we know about the resilience of individuals with disability, resilience-focused studies have encouraged more positive understandings of the disabled. They have also recommended continued research into the mechanisms that encourage positive adjustment among the disabled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312451871">Wong, 2003</xref>). We need a deeper understanding of such protective processes to improve the health of those living with disability, particularly because such understanding can be translated into health-promoting policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312451871">Margalit, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although we found some studies on resilience in generalized contexts of disability, we could locate no studies on resilience in the presence of FXS. There was some mention of positive traits associated with individuals diagnosed with FXS, such as their being caring and loving, and having a sense of humor, strong desire to socialize, talent for imitation, and excellent long-term memory skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312451871">Braden, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451871">Hagerman, 2000</xref>), but these were not overtly described as protective. This gap in the literature on resilient cohorts of youth with FXS, coupled with calls to study disability from a resilience perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312451871">Wong, 2003</xref>), further convinced us of the salience of the opportunity of exploring what contributed to Lucy’s resilience and then making this public.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732312451871" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>We employed a qualitative, single case study design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312451871">Creswell, 2009</xref>). The increasing publication of single case studies, particularly when these offer rich contributions to theory and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312451871">Mertens, 2010</xref>), strengthened our motivation for reporting Lucy’s case. This case study design was embedded in a transformative paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312451871">Mertens, 2009</xref>). Extant theory and practice typically highlight the deficits of young people living with disabilities, and this contributes to their continued marginalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312451871">Mertens, 2010</xref>). Following a transformative paradigm meant that we focused on the positives, or the protective resources and processes, that encouraged Lucy’s resilience, rather than on the risks she faced. Although we comment on the difficulties she faced in our contextualization below, our attention is on how she mastered these challenges. This paradigmatic approach guided our hope that focusing on what contributed to Lucy coping well with FXS might give voice to her story of positive adjustment and transform the traditional deficit conceptualization of young women living with FXS.</p>
<sec id="section9-1049732312451871">
<title>Participants</title>
<sec id="section10-1049732312451871">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>As noted initially, convenience sampling took place because the first author was Lucy’s live-in carer. Because convenience sampling is not very credible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312451871">Merriam, 1998</xref>) and because the first author might have been biased in her opinion of Lucy’s resilience, an advisory panel (AP) was engaged to comment critically on Lucy’s apparent resilience and whether community members who understood what resilience encompassed did indeed see Lucy as resilient. Although it is probable that her parents and even Lucy could have made this judgment, we relied on an AP to verify Lucy’s recruitment to this study, given the growing deferment to APs in recent resilience studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312451871">Didkowsky, Ungar, &amp; Liebenberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312451871">Ungar &amp; Liebenberg, 2011</xref>). Involving an AP (locals who advocate for youth, know a resilient young person in question well, and understand resilience) is favored because it offers more objective participant recruitment and, particularly, a means of inviting community participation in a contextually relevant definition of resilience. The AP consisted of three individuals who were all members of the FXS community (i.e., one psychologist, one teacher, and Lucy’s mother).</p>
<p>The first author interacted with the AP to reach consensus on the behaviors that indicated resilience in the presence of FXS. The AP specified the following indicators of positive adjustment: independent behaviors, inclination to problem solve, demonstration of emotional stamina (when needed), willingness to persevere with challenging tasks (which is unusual for young women with full mutation; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312451871">Hagerman, 2002</xref>), and help-seeking behaviors. Using these indicators, the AP was unanimously confident that Lucy coped adaptively with the challenges of FXS. As is customary in a case study, we invited additional or secondary participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312451871">Creswell, 2007</xref>) to contribute to our understanding of which resources were operating protectively for Lucy. These participants were all significant adults in her life and included her mother, a previous primary school teacher, and her current tutor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732312451871">
<title>Contextualization</title>
<p>The participant, Lucy, was a White American young woman, 16 years of age, who had been diagnosed with full-mutation FXS. Lucy experienced physical, behavioral, emotional, language, sensory integration, and cognitive challenges. For example, she struggled with fine motor skills, low muscle tone, and visual acuity. It was difficult for her to concentrate, and she easily became fretful. When she was anxious, she sometimes threw tantrums, flapped her hands, or behaved inappropriately and impulsively. Although Lucy generally struggled with social language use, it was particularly difficult for her to express herself when anxious. She did not find arithmetic or tasks that relied on close attention and/or decisive judgment easy. Although these difficulties were not as severe as those in other reported cases of FXS (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312451871">Wills, 2011</xref>), Lucy’s disability challenged her daily.</p>
<p>Lucy had access to multiple supports. Her parents facilitated early diagnosis (she was diagnosed with full-mutation FXS when she was 6 years old) and concomitant interventions. She attended mainstream schooling until the end of the seventh grade. During this time, she had a one-on-one assistant and differentiated instruction. This allowed Lucy to take frequent breaks, learn differently, and receive additional support when needed. Thereafter, she transferred to a school exclusively for children with special needs. The classes consisted of no more than eight children, facilitating individualized attention. Each child received an individualized education program (IEP), including life skills contents. Lucy’s development was closely monitored: Her teachers, parents, and school district collaborated to promote her progress. Her school also offered numerous supportive resources such as occupational therapy, speech therapy, and psychological services. Furthermore, the school organized monthly social events to encourage its students to interact with peers at other local, mainstream schools.</p>
<p>Lucy’s immediate and extended family and Jewish affiliation offered psychosocial support. Her community was accepting of people with disability, made supportive resources accessible, and organized opportunities for employment and social interaction. A case manager, social worker, and job coach were made available to her. Lucy’s parents were very involved in an FXS support group as part of a national FX foundation. This group held regular conventions and offered access to the latest relevant theories and interventions and to professionals specializing in FXS. Moreover, members of this group provided emotional support to one another.</p>

<sec id="section12-1049732312451871">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>We collected data by means of in situ observations and interviews. The first author observed Lucy over 20 months. The observations were recorded in a reflection journal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312451871">Merriam, 1998</xref>) and visually in the form of photographs and video clips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312451871">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 2007</xref>). Lucy was interviewed informally twice; because of her language difficulties and tendency toward anxiety, these were akin to an informal conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312451871">Mertens, 2010</xref>) sparked by open-ended questions and much probing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312451871">Patton, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The first author interviewed the secondary participants. She used formal semistructured interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312451871">Merriam, 1998</xref>) because these offered secondary participants the opportunity to share their understandings of Lucy’s resilience. We preferred interviews to in situ observations because the latter might have prolonged secondary participant involvement unnecessarily or intruded on the interaction with Lucy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312451871">Mertens, 2010</xref>). The questions were based on an ecosystemic understanding of resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312451871">Schoon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312451871">Ungar, 2011</xref>) and included questions about how FXS affected Lucy’s life and what resources (intra- and interpersonally) appeared to buffer these impacts. All the participants were asked the same questions. The first author probed their responses by asking for examples or deeper information.</p>

<sec id="section13-1049732312451871">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>We relied primarily on inductive qualitative analysis to organize, code, and categorize the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312451871">Creswell, 2007</xref>). We worked with one data set (i.e., the transcribed interviews, the research journal, or the visual data set) at a time and coded the data independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312451871">Creswell, 2009</xref>). This meant that we each labeled sections of data that answered the guiding research question (“What contributes to positive adjustment in a young woman with FXS?”). The data themselves prompted these open codes, but what we understood about resilience and the impact of FXS on young women also influenced them. So although our primary approach was inductive (we looked for issues within the data that shed light on how young women with FXS coped resiliently), we also assigned deductive codes (i.e., coding influenced by our theoretical knowledge and prior resilience-focused research). A combination of inductive and deductive coding is common to analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312451871">Creswell, 2009</xref>). Thereafter, we grouped similar open codes into themes that identified the resources operating protectively for Lucy (i.e., we conducted axial coding) before comparing our coding. This was an iterative process because we repeated it per data set and then across data sets.</p>
<p>The themes emerging from all three data sets were congruent, so that we were able to triangulate our emerging analyses. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312451871">Mertens (2010)</xref> noted that this allowed conclusions about consistency of findings, it did not address the limitations of a single case study or obviate steps to further heighten trustworthiness (see the section on trustworthiness). Nevertheless, this triangulation enabled us to gain an “in-depth picture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312451871">Creswell, 2007</xref>, p. 76) of the resources and transactions that encouraged Lucy to cope adaptively with her FXS and added richness to the descriptions of these resources.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732312451871">
<title>Ethical Aspects</title>
<p>Because our study focused on an adolescent with FXS, we were vigilant about ethical aspects. Before the study commenced, the ethics board of the university at which the second author is a full professor provided ethical clearance. We were careful to respect Lucy and not cause her undue harm (either physical or emotional) in the course of the study. In particular, we were mindful that cognitive impairment (CI) potentially compromised participant capacity to consent; nevertheless, researchers have respectfully engaged persons with CI in meaningful qualitative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312451871">Szala-Meneok, 2009</xref>) and individuals with FXS in intervention studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312451871">Wills, 2011</xref>). For this reason, we were steadfast about the consent procedure detailed below.</p>
<p>The first author spent 3 months building a relationship of trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312451871">Ginsberg &amp; Mertens, 2009</xref>) with Lucy before introducing the possibility of her participation in this project. Before speaking to Lucy, we provided her parents with detailed information (verbal and written) about the proposed study and requested their permission to continue. Once they had formally consented, we asked them to explain to Lucy as simply as possible the aim of the study and what her participation would entail. We emphasized that Lucy ought not to be coerced, and her parents were unequivocal in their support of her exercising choice, whatever it might be. The first author again explained to Lucy what the study was about and what would be expected of her, using simple wording and slow, detailed explanations to encourage more complete understanding. She especially emphasized that it was Lucy’s choice to participate and gave her an opportunity to ask questions about the study. Lucy was excited about participating and consented eagerly.</p>
<p>We were aware that the first author had dual roles: She was Lucy’s live-in carer and the primary researcher. We were, therefore, very sensitive to the possibility of the researcher role being intrusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312451871">Ntseane, 2009</xref>). To facilitate this challenge, the first author, Lucy’s parents, and Lucy agreed that the presence of a voice recorder would signify formal research activity. Whenever she would interview Lucy (even though it took place in a conversational way), the first author would start the “conversation” with a reminder that what followed would form part of the study. Then she would, with Lucy’s permission, activate the voice recorder. Because she wished to make the research process as comfortable for Lucy as possible, she would forewarn her that she was thinking of interviewing her a bit later. In simple language, she and Lucy would revisit the study’s focus and what Lucy would be asked to do. Lucy was reassured that if she did not want to be interviewed later (or at any other time), or if she would prefer not to answer a question, her choice would be respected. On no occasion did Lucy not want to participate, and, in fact, she verbalized feeling important about being interviewed. This was reassuring because we were mindful that the duality of the first author’s roles potentially escalated power issues present in all qualitative research relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312451871">Lincoln, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The first author invited Lucy’s mother to actively monitor that the research process did not cause Lucy discomfort. Because Lucy’s mother was on hand most of the day and because she and Lucy had a healthy bond, she was well placed to supervise the research process. Finally, Lucy was carefully debriefed after each conversational interview. This included asking her about her experience of the “interview.” When she had recalled a negative experience, the first author specifically asked her how she was feeling after talking about this incident and then helped her refocus on the present. Lucy was seeing a social worker regularly, and this would have been a good time to talk about subsequent discomfort, if there were any. However, at no stage was she visibly perturbed by her participation, and the social worker reported no harm. The debriefing was concluded with the voice recorder being packed away, thereby providing Lucy with tangible evidence that the formal research process had been concluded.</p>
<p>The secondary participants received comprehensive letters of information and, subsequently, signed consent forms. They were made aware that participation would be voluntary and that they could terminate participation at will or restrict which of their responses we reported. None of the participants’ real names were used, even though they were not averse to their identities being disclosed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049732312451871">
<title>Trustworthiness</title>
<p>The first author’s prolonged engagement with Lucy and her family heightened credibility, particularly because it offered the opportunity to develop a rich, saturated understanding of Lucy’s resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312451871">Mertens, 2010</xref>). In addition, the extended opportunity allowed for member checking: The first author verified her emerging findings with both the primary and secondary participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312451871">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312451871">Mertens, 2009</xref>). With Lucy, this was done very simply (e.g., “So, I’ve been thinking that your school has helped you a lot to do well in life. What do you think about that?”). We asked Lucy’s parents to read the article we submitted for review and comment critically on our interpretation. The first author also had the opportunity for peer debriefing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312451871">Mertens, 2010</xref>) in the FXS community: She tested her emerging findings at two FXS conferences and more informally with a respected professional in this community. We factored the comments all the aforementioned made into our final interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312451871">Creswell, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Because we were sensitive to the duality of the researcher/carer role, the first author engaged in regular reflexivity and recorded this in her research journal. She noted her developing argument, feelings, and interpretations, revisited them throughout, and reflected on her situatedness in this study. The second author acted as a peer debriefer because she was physically and emotionally removed from the study: The first author shared these reflections electronically and, on occasion, in person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312451871">Mertens, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>We provided a thick description of Lucy and her context with the express purpose of facilitating transferability. Although, as qualitative researchers, we were not concerned with issues of generalizability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312451871">Creswell, 2007</xref>), we were wary of the criticisms leveled at case study methodologies (particularly with regard to theorizing from case studies). Although this thick description does not nullify the limitations of case study methodologies, it guides transferability of the working hypotheses emerging from Lucy’s case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312451871">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1049732312451871">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Analysis of the written and visual data suggested that Lucy’s resilience was rooted in multiple protective resources underpinning protective processes. We clustered these processes into three themes: intrapersonal agency, unconditional positive acceptance and belonging, and support toward mastery.</p>
<sec id="section17-1049732312451871">
<title>Intrapersonal Agency</title>
<p>A number of protective antecedents seemed to be part of Lucy’s agentic makeup. These included determination and motivation, assertiveness, being socially inclined, a sunny temperament, and engagement in meaningful pastimes. We describe these strengths below.</p>
<sec id="section18-1049732312451871">
<title>Determination and motivation</title>
<p>Lucy’s determination was obvious. She struggled with a number of everyday tasks but was tenacious about mastering them. For example, Lucy struggled to walk down stairs, although she had been able to do so independently to the age of 6. When the first author asked Lucy about this, she replied, “I will do it again.” These were not hollow words: In the 20 months that the first author lived with her, she repeatedly recorded Lucy’s attempts to walk down steps unassisted (e.g., Research Journal—July 8/10/11, 2008). We noted similar determination in her attempts to overcome anxiety related to shopping at the local grocery store: Lucy had had an anxiety-provoking experience there when an assistant had approached her unexpectedly and insisted on talking to her (Research Journal—August 6, 2008). When asked about this and her subsequent reluctance to return, she responded, “I went there with [name] and I tried. . . . When I tried it, it was okay. But I really wanna try when it’s like quieter.” Lucy’s words emphasized her willingness to persevere and insight into what (e.g., quieter shopping hours) might support her doggedness.</p>
<p>Lucy’s teacher corroborated this tenacity and reflected, “I think she’s got tremendous courage, you know, that she gets through the day the way she does.” Furthermore, she believed that Lucy’s determination and motivation were interwoven: “She’s willing to learn, she is motivated to learn. She works very hard.” Likewise, her tutor commented that this determination to progress could be seen in how organized Lucy was: “She’s very organized—I would say, more than other kids. . . . That, I think, is a real strength.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1049732312451871">
<title>Assertiveness</title>
<p>Lucy could assert herself and ask for help when needed. For example, she was comfortable requesting clarification and often enquired, “Ummm, what do you mean?” Lucy’s mother confirmed that her child was not shy to enlist support: “Lucy is very aware that they [teachers and students] work together as a team. So if she wanted to know something she knows she can approach the teacher.” Lucy was also assertive in how she communicated her experiences so that she could be more comfortable in a world that was often anxiety-provoking for her. For example, when her father’s actions provoked anxiety, she would caution him: “Stop creating anxiety, Father” (Research Journal—August 23, 2008).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1049732312451871">
<title>Being socially inclined</title>
<p>On numerous occasions, Lucy showed a desire to socialize with others and also verbalized her love of spending time with others. The first author recorded this social inclination as, “She is such a social butterfly” (Research Journal—May 10, 2009). Her mother confirmed this desire to socialize, as did her tutor, who commented, “Oh, she was so happy to be sitting with the other kids.” At school, her social inclination was positively acknowledged: She was elected as the secretary of the student council. Her tutor reflected that this probably demonstrated recognition of Lucy’s capacity to act responsibly in social situations. Her anxiety and limited language skills hampered her proclivity for social interaction. For example, her mother reflected on how poor mastery of social language use stymied this interaction:
<disp-quote>
<p>But I think one of the main problems for Lucy too is the language issue and the fact that she just does not seem to get the social language . . . where she can make friends with somebody and just sort of build up that small talk to the point where she has something in common, or something to say, or, you know, find a way to include herself into the group.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Lucy continued to navigate toward, and be helpful to, others. The first author recorded anecdotes in her research journal, illustrating Lucy’s caring nature (e.g., May 23, 2008; September 1, 2008; February 21, 2009). Likewise, her mother described her as “such a kind person . . . very generous. She likes to help people.” Her teacher and tutor confirmed her caring other-centeredness. Her teacher said,
<disp-quote>
<p>She’s got more heart than ten adults or people I know. And that’s what I love about her. She’s got a lot of heart and she’s got a lot of strength. And I think that pulls her through. That allows her, give the right circumstances to advance and to make progress.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1049732312451871">
<title>Sunny temperament</title>
<p>Lucy was an attractive and likeable person to others. Her teacher remarked,
<disp-quote>
<p>When she laughs and smiles, she’s so engaging. When she’s pleasant, there’s nobody more pleasant than her. And I think that is her greatest asset. . . . She’s so blessed with a sunny disposition. Her personality will take her very far.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lucy’s mother confirmed this when describing Lucy as “a likeable person as opposed to the kids that can be very, very difficult.” A good sense of humor often accompanied her cheerfulness. Her mother, teacher, and tutor remarked on her appreciation of jokes and her capacity to make others laugh, as did the first author on numerous occasions in her research diary (e.g., January 24, 2008; May 13, 2008). In their opinion, this facilitated positive adjustment to daily tasks that she found difficult and strengthened peer and extended family acceptance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1049732312451871">
<title>Meaningful pastimes</title>
<p>The first author diarized Lucy’s engagement in role play and her preference for spending time acting and singing (e.g., April 22, 2008; May 5, 2008). She generated video footage of Lucy passing time rehearsing for the school play and/or pretending to be interviewing celebrities, as well as Lucy and a friend role-playing. On the way to and from school, Lucy would practice the songs of their upcoming school play. Lucy’s mother confirmed this penchant for acting and love of theater. The first author’s journal entries interpreted Lucy’s love of acting and singing as an opportunity to feel good about herself, and possibly even as a form of healthy escapism.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1049732312451871">
<title>Unconditional Positive Acceptance and Belonging</title>
<p>Lucy’s social networks offered her multiple opportunities to experience unreserved belonging. These included familial acceptance, acceptance by her religious community, friendships with youth who also had disabilities, and community acceptance.</p>
<sec id="section24-1049732312451871">
<title>Familial acceptance</title>
<p>Although her parents reported accepting that Lucy was disabled as a difficult journey, they were accepting of her. The first author recorded the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is very interesting and comforting to see how accepting Lucy’s family is of her. I can tell that it is difficult for her parents to see her struggle with certain things. But they really go out of their way to make life easier for her. They are aware of her struggles and they have accepted her. I can really tell that they love her unconditionally. She loves her parents and her home. Home is where she feels safe and loved. (Research Journal—February 5, 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Likewise, the extended family spent a lot of time together and included Lucy warmly and unconditionally. Lucy’s mother and tutor confirmed this observation during interviews. For example, Lucy’s mother commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think her family accepts the disability. Lucy’s family see . . . all the positive things about her and . . . see her as, as being a very sharp little girl with a great sense of humor and a lot to offer. And I think that, as a result of that, within the immediate family there has been acceptance with the grandparents and aunts and uncles and cousins. Umm, so that’s a good thing for Lucy. She’s always been just like everybody else, just part of the family.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Her tutor echoed this perception that Lucy enjoyed acceptance within her immediate and extended family:
<disp-quote>
<p>But they seem to do a lot as a family and they are very accepting and loving of their family. . . . So I think they have a real extended family that’s really involved, and as she ages, you know, that’s gonna become more important, ’cause I don’t know if she’ll ever live independently.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1049732312451871">
<title>Acceptance by the religious community</title>
<p>Lucy belonged to a local Jewish synagogue, which afforded the opportunity for unqualified, active belonging. Her mother spoke of how Lucy enjoyed taking part in Jewish customs and synagogue-facilitated activities: “She feels accepted and loved there. She goes on camps with the temple. She is now busy with her confirmation classes.” Lucy’s tutor reflected on the cohesiveness integral to Jewish culture: “I think there’s a real sense of family within the Jewish culture. That I don’t see as much in other cultures maybe.” Her teacher drew similar conclusions: “Yeah, the synagogue has made her part of their community.” Her teacher recounted how accepting this religious community was of Lucy when her behavior during her bat mitzvah was impulsively spontaneous and probably not aligned with the seriousness of the occasion:
<disp-quote>
<p>That, that temple is supportive of her. You know, for her bat mitzvah, I mean for her to get up there and do it, I mean it was amazing. But, there were some funny moments, but everybody kinda laughed. Here is this serious ceremony, you know, and she kind of called her dad up and made a joke and it was funny and we laughed. And people were very cool about it. It was Lucy being Lucy. So instead of being like shocked, they were all—it was, it was entertaining.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1049732312451871">
<title>Friendships with youth with disabilities</title>
<p>Lucy experienced intimate acceptance (friendship) among her peers who had also been diagnosed with FXS. Her tutor believed that her having these friends with the same disabilities had helped Lucy experience a sense of peer belonging: “Well, I think having friends that have the same disability, you know, that she’s had for a long time, umm, probably helps, and you know there is kind of a community and connectiveness there.” The first author spent time with Lucy and her three friends, all of whom had FXS, and recorded how their cohesiveness encouraged Lucy to socialize in typical adolescent ways and to cope with situations she normally avoided:
<disp-quote>
<p>Today we met up with some of Lucy’s friends. Three out of the four have been diagnosed with full mutation FXS. What an interesting day it was. These girls are each other’s best friends. . . . We met them for lunch and after lunch we went shopping a bit. Today, Lucy went down the escalator for the first time. Her mother and I couldn’t believe what we were seeing. The girls each hooked their arm in hers and they went down the escalator, no issues! It’s amazing what peer pressure can do. (Research Journal—February 14, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1049732312451871">
<title>Community acceptance</title>
<p>Lucy was well-known in her immediate community and familiar with it. For example, her teacher related, “Well I think probably that people know her, or she goes to the same places and you know she has a familiarity with that.” This allowed Lucy to be more comfortable going out into the community. Lucy’s tutor echoed the local community’s acceptance of Lucy: “And you know, because people really do like her, she’s got a huge, you know, community of support.” Lucy’s parents’ acceptance into the FXS community with its network of knowledgeable professionals and similarly affected families strengthened them. This belonging enabled them to deal constructively with the challenges of having a child with disabilities. As Lucy’s mother explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think that is a tremendous support thing for anybody that has a kid with a disability . . . so that you can meet other parents and be able to bounce things off of them and umm, you know, to just sort of be in a group that way.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1049732312451871">
<title>Support Toward Mastery</title>
<p>Lucy’s parents, tutor, teacher, and other community members admired her for the way she mastered the daily challenges of FXS. However, the practical, medical, and motivational networks and systems to which she had access supported her mastery. This support was also in the form of opportunities that afforded mastery experiences.</p>
<sec id="section29-1049732312451871">
<title>Practical support</title>
<p>Lucy received extensive practical support from her parents, school systems, peers, and professionals. Although the paragraphs below detail how she was supported, we are cognizant that this support would have had limited value had Lucy not accepted it and cooperated with these supportive systems. Lucy’s parents supported her practically to cope with the challenges of FXS and offered tangible backing through necessary medical, therapeutic, and scholastic interventions and frequent communication with her school system. Lucy told the first author how her mother had supported her by securing professional support for her: “She sent me to a pediatrician. And, I was helped all my life. And I got help.” Lucy’s tutor acknowledged Lucy’s mother’s supportive involvement: “And I do think Lucy’s mother has a really good handle on stuff. I think she kinda knows how Lucy learns. I think more so than maybe other parents.” Lucy’s tutor noted how protective it was that her parents could provide well for her financially and that they kept abreast of developments related to FXS:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think the fact that her parents can provide so much for. That they can give her extra help or provide her with those things. . . . And they’ve been to all these conventions and so they are into like “the newest techniques and research,” and that I think really helps.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This parental supportiveness was encouraged by accessible systemic resources, such as knowledgeable professionals who aided acceptance and management of FXS. Her tutor was unequivocal that when Lucy’s parents had accepted her disability and could speak about it publically, and had the disability acknowledged at school, this assisted Lucy toward mastery, partly because she was understood, rather than labeled. Her teacher commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>She [Lucy’s mother] was lucky because they always had the resources to get her a lot of outside help. And she was working with a disability awareness specialist. . . . She [the specialist] talked to the kids about disabilities in general and Lucy in particular, and everything changed then, because kids then were able to relate to Lucy as somebody with a disability, not as someone who is weird or crazy. And they weren’t afraid of her anymore. So that was huge.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The schools Lucy attended offered multiple practical supports, which promoted her progress at school. For example, when she was included at the mainstream primary school, this accommodated her special learning needs. Her teacher commented on how the school’s instructional support facilitated Lucy’s progress:
<disp-quote>
<p>So they [the mainstream primary school], and the school system, were great to let her repeat first grade, because they were paying for an extra year of a lot of extra services for her. Including me; I was a one-on-one. And at that point Lucy was the first inclusion child that school has ever seen. . . . [Nevertheless] there was a specific program for her . . . we did that from first grade up until she left school, so that was terrific. That was how she learned how to read.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Likewise, her tutor reflected that her special-needs high school offered practical support in its attention to providing a structured context with minimal distractions:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think the building and the space of that building is very good. It’s very quiet. So I think that helps buffer it [being overwhelmed by sensory stimuli]. I think if they were in a big public school there would be kids moving around, there would be the noise and the distractions—I think she’d be very overwhelmed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lucy’s peers supported her practically in that they taught her how to master everyday tasks, such as petting her dog and tying her shoelaces. Her tutor remarked on phone calls that she had witnessed Lucy receiving from friends not attending her special-needs school. These peers (and, to a lesser extent, those with disabilities) helped Lucy to acquire handy skills. For example, when explicitly asked what her peers had done for her during difficult times, Lucy answered that a boy a year older than she had once helped her deal with her fear of dogs by modeling how to hold and pet a dog, in so doing demonstrating that dogs responded positively to such attention:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I was a freshman, he was a junior, he helped me with Huron [her dog] actually. . . . By like, he like put his hand on top. He like petted it first. And then he hold Huron and then I hold the leash, and then . . . and then he really helped.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-1049732312451871">
<title>Supportive medical interventions</title>
<p>Supportive medical interventions encouraged Lucy’s positive coping with the challenges of FXS. Her mother experienced the early diagnosis of Lucy’s FXS as promotive, particularly because this facilitated appropriate and necessary intervention, thus enabling optimal progress:
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the reasons that I personally feel early intervention is so important, even though there might not be a cure for fragile X, they can identify this condition at birth, they can work with these kids at a very early age so that they don’t have these delays and you can keep them as much on a normal track of umm a, a normal developmental track as possible.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lucy’s teacher also referred to the significance of medical support, particularly suitable medication, in Lucy’s positive adaptation:
<disp-quote>
<p>But finally they were convinced to put her on some medication. She was like a different child. She came back in January after she’d been on it for about a week or two and you could see the change. She was able to sit. She was calmer. She was focused. So the second half of first grade she started to pick some of the stuff up because now she was able to concentrate.</p>

<title>Motivational support</title>
<p>Significant others in Lucy’s life motivated her by believing steadfastly that she could and would progress and by holding concomitant positive expectations of her. In her teacher’s words, “And that’s when I learned to say, ‘Never, never say this child can’t get this or can’t learn this.’ You have no idea what this child is capable of. She’s amazing!” Lucy’s mother reported experiences of encouraging school systems. For example, regarding Lucy’s early mainstream schooling, her mother explained that the teachers and students together enabled Lucy’s success through their inclusive and positive attitude to her:
<disp-quote>
<p>The kids and the teachers were very supportive of her. They were a real team, because there were some key players that . . . really invested in her. So there was just this attitude that people wanted to work together as a team, for her.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Part of this motivational support related to teacher insistence that Lucy was capable of behaving prosocially. Lucy was expected to comply with, and attempt to achieve, set standards (such as respect for teachers and peers). Her teacher related an incident, showing how their being inflexible about socially appropriate behavior motivated Lucy to regulate her behavior:
<disp-quote>
<p>In school we never put up with that [impulsive or disrespectful behavior]. She was never allowed to talk in an ugly manner to me or to the teacher. And even other kids. We called her on it: “You sit down. You do not talk like that.” . . . One time she got very anxious. I think we were going somewhere she didn’t want to go. She was “Blah blah blah blah.” I said, “Excuse me. You don’t talk like that. You don’t talk like that to me. You don’t talk like that to anybody.” So she said, “Are you angry?” So I said, “I’m not angry at this point cause it’s gonna stop, but that’s not the way you are gonna operate. So take a deep breath.” So she took a deep breath. So, she ended up being fine.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These positive expectations and attention to her successes encouraged Lucy. As her mother explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think that the teachers in school saw the things that Lucy could do. There was so much she couldn’t do, that I think they focused on, “Look what Lucy did today!” And it was so minor compared to where the other kids were at. But they were watching and helping her to accomplish, and because of that created a very high self-esteem and it made school a very pleasant thing for her. It transformed it for the other kids, you know, they saw what Lucy had accomplished and they were proud of her, of what she could do as opposed to what she couldn’t do. So I think that helped a lot.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Likewise, Lucy’s parents continuously encouraged her and held positive expectations. For example, Lucy told the first author that she was afraid of dogs, and her behavior when dogs were present bore testimony to this fear. However, Lucy’s parents realized that this anxiety was, to some extent, holding her back from socializing and from moving freely about her neighborhood. They bought Lucy a little dog so that she could master her fear. Another example of their understanding of her anxiety and support to manage this related to Lucy’s mother’s meticulous preparation when Lucy attended summer or religious camps. For example, her mother packed paraphernalia that would help Lucy feel connected to family she was leaving behind.</p>

<title>Opportunities to experience mastery</title>
<p>Lucy’s community was well resourced, with many opportunities for socialization, recreation, and meaningful participation, which were often tailored to suit the needs of people with disabilities. Her mother commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>Our community also offers a lot of activities for those with disabilities. They have this program that you can join if you have a disability and they organize activities for you to do fun things with others. Like bowling, or laser tag, or stuff like that. And also, the community is great about providing jobs for those with learning disabilities. Lucy actually worked at the library one summer. . . . And she also had a job coach with her, to kinda watch and help her . . . so that is great experience for them and they feel a part of the community and as if they are offering something. Lucy is actually talking about finding a job this summer.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lucy had opportunities to experience peer group success at her special-needs school, too. Her tutor reflected on this: “And being able to have a leadership role. If she was in a local public school, I don’t think she’ll be secretary of the student council. So the opportunity she has to do those things, I think is really, really important.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Lucy’s resilience was encouraged by interactive protective processes of intrapersonal agency, unconditional positive acceptance and belonging, and support toward mastery. Her reaching out to others and resolve to progress, combined with systemic belonging, appreciation, and encouragement, buffered her. These protective transactions promoted her positive adjustment to the daily challenges of FXS.</p>
<p>Observation of these protective processes suggested no causal pattern. Instead, they interacted dynamically and reinforced one another and, ultimately, Lucy’s resilience. Lucy’s determination and motivation, assertiveness, social inclination, sunny temperament, and engagement in meaningful pastimes helped her to steer toward resources and experiences that sustained her. Simultaneously, her agency was motivated and/or reciprocated by the protective social ecology in which she was situated: Lucy was nurtured and enabled by dedicated parents, an accepting extended family, a supportive school (teachers and students), helpful peers, positive medical interventions, and an accepting community (her immediate neighborhood and her Jewish community). Their actions and attitudes offered her opportunities to experience belonging, meet expectations, and make consistent progress, and she made the most of these. Essentially, the protective processes that emerged from our study of Lucy fit conceptualizations of resilience as a cooperative person–context transaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312451871">Lerner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312451871">Ungar, 2011</xref>). They signal that positive adjustment, also in contexts of disability, appears to be dependent on health-promoting actions and attitudes from both the individual and the individual’s social ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312451871">Ungar, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>We are cognizant of the limitations of theory building from a case study, particularly with regard to end results that offer a description of an “idiosyncratic phenomenon” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312451871">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>, p. 532), with limited potential for generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312451871">Creswell, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, the resilience-promoting processes that emerged from the study of Lucy offer insight, albeit tentative, into resilience in contexts of genetic disability. For example, although it is neither possible nor necessary to prioritize the resilience-promoting resources informing the processes that nurtured Lucy’s resilience, it is important to acknowledge that she and her parents had wider ecological support. Her parents’ dedication to her seemed to be protected by their involvement in a broader FXS community and by accessible teachers and other professionals. Similarly, her acceptance and progress at school were encouraged by an accommodating school district and system, complementary professionals, and supportive medical interventions. In short, Lucy’s social ecology was both service-rich and accepting of people with disabilities. This encourages consideration of the import of a service-rich, nonjudgmental ecology to resilience in contexts of disability.</p>
<p>Similarly, the cooperative nature of the processes that encouraged Lucy to adjust well encourages the supposition that if resilience is to be nurtured in young people challenged by disabilities, then this task needs to be shared. If resilience is partly the young person’s responsibility (consider Lucy’s agency) and partly the ecology’s (consider her parents’ agency, support, and demands; or the encouragement, expectations, and confirmation of her school and religious systems), then youth and their ecologies appear to be coresponsible for processes of positive adjustment. This hypothesis begs ecologies to partner with youth who are challenged by disabilities, rather than judge or reject them.</p>
<p>The protective processes promoting Lucy’s resilience were rooted in both intra- and interpersonal protective resources that have been reported in previous resilience-focused studies, but for cohorts of young people placed at risk by circumstances other than FXS. For example, personal strengths, familial support (primary and extended), reasonable expectations, supportive school and community contexts, and religious affiliation are well-known resilience-promoting resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312451871">Kumpfer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312451871">Masten et al., 2009</xref>). Some of the protective resources underpinning the processes reported as integral to Lucy’s resilience (i.e., personal agency, differentiated instruction, supportive adults, close friendships, experiences of nonacademic success, meaningful leisure activities) have specifically been reported in association with resilience in the presence of learning disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312451871">Al-Yagon &amp; Mikulincer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312451871">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312451871">Margalit, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312451871">Mather &amp; Ofiesh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312451871">Wong, 2003</xref>). However, neither these resources nor the resilience-promoting processes that these resources support have previously been associated with an adolescent placed at risk for maladaptive outcomes because of a genetic disability such as FXS. The value of this overlap (between Lucy’s case and previous studies) lies in the finding that resources that have buoyed youth in similar Eurocentric contexts, but facing different risks, appear to be equally protective in Lucy’s context of FXS. One implication is that interventions targeting youth with genetic disabilities should probably promote access to “ordinary adaptive resources and systems” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312451871">Masten, 2001</xref>, p. 234), as advocated for nondisabled youth and those with learning disabilities. Follow-up studies with larger cohorts of young people challenged by disabilities are, however, needed to confirm this inference.</p>
<p>Our findings offer one refinement to the commonly reported protective intrapersonal resource of peer support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312451871">Masten et al., 2009</xref>): Peer support offered Lucy varied protection, depending on whether the source was peers with or without disabilities. Typically, nondisabled peers supported her to gain age-appropriate skills, whereas disabled peers offered her opportunities for socialization and characteristic adolescent outings. It seems that, for Lucy, peer support that brought about change and facilitated new learning came from individuals and groups who were not disabled (e.g., Lucy learning to tie her shoelaces from nondisabled peers at camp), and peer support that provided companionship or friendship was more likely to come from those who were disabled (e.g., Lucy going shopping and using an escalator). A working hypothesis flowing from this is that when youth are disabled, they need to experience a sense of community with other similarly disabled peers, but they should not be closeted away from nondisabled youth.</p>
<p>Finally, when we review literature on FXS, our study offers a positive perspective on living with FXS. Though a handful of studies on women with FXS reported positive traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312451871">Braden, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451871">Hagerman, 2000</xref>), historically, women with FXS were considered in terms of their deficits and vulnerabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312451871">Abbeduto, Brady, &amp; Kover, 2007</xref>). Although we in no way wish to suggest that FXS is without rigorous challenges or that all young women living with FXS are like Lucy, the portrayal of Lucy as resilient, and insight into the roots of her resilience, posits a transformative perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312451871">Mertens, 2009</xref>). Our study, therefore, discourages blind stereotyping of young women with FXS as at risk only. In so doing, it challenges communities, educators, and parents to partner with individuals living with FXS and collaborate with them to co-promote their resilience.</p>
