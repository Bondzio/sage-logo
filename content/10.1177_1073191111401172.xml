<abstract>
<p>The authors developed the Interpersonal Behavior Questionnaire for Children with the aim of assessing the constructs of the interpersonal circumplex model, that is, Dominance and Love and their possible combinations, via third- to fifth-grade children’s self- and peer reports. In the three studies presented herein, the authors examined several psychometric properties of the questionnaire. Results demonstrated that children’s ratings along the questionnaire yielded the hypothesized circumplex structure of the interpersonal variables; that they reached significant association levels with external criteria; and that they were reliable. Specifically, interrater correlations were shown to reach substantive levels when inspected in older children, when scores were aggregated over raters, and when dominant behaviors were evaluated. Overall, the findings demonstrated the tenability of the circumplex model in young ages via children’s ratings. The authors suggest that both personality assessment and personality development research may take advantage from using children’s evaluations, in addition to adults’ ratings of their children’s personality.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the research presented herein was to develop a new self- and peer-rating questionnaire for 8- to 11-year-old children and examine its psychometric properties based on theoretical and psychometric assumptions of the interpersonal circumplex (IPC) model.</p>
<p>The circumplex model was conceived by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191111401172">Guttman (1954)</xref>, who demonstrated that a variable set can be adequately represented by two factors only, when the variables in the set yield a correlation matrix presenting a sinusoidal pattern. Moreover, the model holds that the two extracted factors will typically present a loading pattern that deviates from a simple structure model, because some variables will load on only one of the two factors (i.e., pure variables), but others will load on both factors (i.e., interstitial variables). This factor structure—a circumplex structure—geometrically corresponds to a circular array of the variables around the two dimensions, wherein the pure variables are located near the reference axes of the circular space, and the interstitial variables lie between the axes. Strictly speaking, however, although the two factors are useful for practical and conceptual purposes, they are not required for the structuring and interpretation of a circular configuration. In fact, the essential information lies in the variable intercorrelations, which can be directly expressed as angular distances between variables, such that the higher the correlation between two variables, the higher their proximity along the circle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191111401172">Browne, 1992</xref>). In brief, the plausibility of a circumplex configuration depends on the circular order of the variables, that is, on a law of neighboring, which poses that two variables will be neighbors along the circle when they share more content with each other than they do with other variables. The reference axes positions are defined so as to concisely represent the basic contents that are presumed to be embedded in the variables.</p>
<p>Research has amply shown the usefulness of the IPC for systematizing and understanding both normal and abnormal interpersonal variables in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1073191111401172">Plutchik &amp; Conte, 1997</xref>). Specifically, Wiggins developed his IPC model based on the idea that people in interaction exchange two basic psychological resources, namely, status and love/warmth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1073191111401172">Wiggins &amp; Trapnell, 1996</xref>). Status resources (e.g., esteem and regard) concern hierarchical relationships between people, whereas love resources (e.g., acceptance, liking, and support) refer to collaborative relationships and have emotional consequences involved therein. Furthermore, Wiggins constructed his IPC model assuming that people grant or deny these resources to each other. He thereby defined eight possible combinations of status and love and differentiated eight interpersonal variables on the basis of what (status/love) is given (or denied) to whom (self/other). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191111401172">Table 1</xref> illustrates how each of the eight variables combines status and love resources in Wiggins’s model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073191111401172">Figure 1</xref> illustrates how the IPC variables are assumed to be circularly arranged around two reference axes labeled Dominance (DOM) and Love (LOV). It also shows how each interpersonal variable differs from the adjacent variable by a single element only, whereas opposite variables have opposite profiles, in agreement with the law of neighboring.</p>

<p>After the pioneering research conducted in the 1960s by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1073191111401172">Walker (1967)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1073191111401172">Schaefer (1961</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1073191111401172">1965</xref>), a small number of studies have more recently focused on the IPC in young age. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073191111401172">Markey, Markey, and Tinsley (2005)</xref>, for example, asked adult unacquainted judges to observe and rate 9- and 10-year-old children’s behaviors while interacting with their parents. The judges used a Q-sort instrument developed to represent the eight Wiggins’s IPC variables. Results showed that the judges’ ratings yielded a circumplex array. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073191111401172">Di Blas (2007)</xref> used a bottom-up approach to explore the IPC in childhood, by first selecting a set of adjectives that parents commonly use to describe observable behavioral differences in 4- to 10-year-old children while interacting with peers. She then analyzed the structure of the adjectives by using parents’ ratings of their children’s interpersonal behaviors. Results revealed a circular ordering for the adjectives around two basic components sharing the basic IPC elements in adulthood of dominance and love/warmth but also presenting their own distinctive features. Specifically, the adjective contents suggested that activity levels represent a distinctive quality of dominance in childhood, and control of aggression and over negative emotionality were found to characterize the love component. Thus, whereas little leaders achieved their social status by successfully investing and directing their energy toward others, that is, competing with them, organizing games, entering into play, and making friends, lovable children were ready not only to share, help, and support but were also capable of inhibiting their aggressive behaviors and expressions of anger and susceptibility in social contexts. Di Blas’ results generally reflect other findings from personality development research. In fact, activity has been found to be a key trait in childhood and is typically associated with dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073191111401172">Eaton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1073191111401172">Shiner, 1998</xref>), whereas agreeableness-like domains have been shown to be broader in content in childhood than in adulthood and to encompass elements not only of generosity and kindness but also of voluntary inhibition of disruptive behaviors and of negative emotions of anger, irritability, and anxiety, in social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191111401172">Bierman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073191111401172">Donahue, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1073191111401172">Laursen, Pulkkinen, &amp; Adams, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1073191111401172">Schaefer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1073191111401172">Shiner &amp; Caspi, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191111401172">Broughton, Boyes, and Mitchell (1993)</xref> investigated the IPC from children’s perspective. A multidimensional scaling approach was used to examine the structure of self-ratings provided by first to third graders, who expressed their self-evaluations in terms of perceived similarity to eight hypothetical characters, each of whom displayed behaviors representing prototypical acts of each of the eight circumplex categories as defined by Wiggins. Results revealed a developmental trend and showed that younger children yielded a unidimensional <italic>good/bad</italic> solution, but older children produced a two-dimensional solution, in which the eight measured variables yielded a roughly circular structure and maintained the expected order. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073191111401172">Sodano and Tracey (2006)</xref> analyzed ratings provided by fourth and sixth graders, who evaluated themselves along the Child and Adolescent Interpersonal Survey (CAIS). This measure is a brief questionnaire presenting short sentences tailored to children’s own language and developed with the aim of representing the Wiggins’s IPC categories. Their results yielded a circumplex structure for the eight CAIS variables, regardless of the children’s ages, although the empirical circular array revealed that some octant scales poorly approximated their expected angular location. With respect to preadolescence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1073191111401172">Ojanen, Grönroos, and Salmivalli (2005)</xref> demonstrated that 11- to 13-year-old children’s reports on their social goals as related to dominance and love constructs conformed fairly well to the circumplex structure. Overall, these studies using children’s self-reports demonstrated that the established IPC model is also tenable in childhood. Moreover, they suggest a developmental trend in children’s ability to provide self-reports from middle childhood to preadolescence, by first yielding a weak and then progressively fairly good psychometric correspondence between expected and observed variable locations along the circular continuum.</p>
<sec id="section1-1073191111401172">
<title>The Present Research: Aims and Operational Definitions</title>
<p>In the studies presented herein, we independently paralleled the abovementioned studies in developing a new questionnaire—the <italic>Interpersonal Behavior Questionnaire for Children</italic> (IBQ-C)—that assesses interpersonal behaviors via children’s self- and peer ratings. We specified, however, the broad interpersonal domains in such a way as to encompass both the main features of the traditional IPC model and the main distinctive components of interpersonal traits in middle and late childhood. Moreover, we used a multirater approach to verify the validity of the children’s ratings and also tested for the possibility of any age-related differences in the psychometric properties of the new questionnaire.</p>
<p>Specifically, in agreement with the Wiggins’s model, we used DOM and LOV as the reference domains of the circumplex space. We also focused on assessing how a child generally behaves toward an unspecified peer by assuming that asymmetric relationships exist among children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1073191111401172">Schaffer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073191111401172">Hawley, 1999</xref>). This choice was coherent with findings showing that, although the vertical axis in an IPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073191111401172">Figure 1</xref>) can differ in content, it is usually defined in terms of dominance when the unit of analysis is a single person, the focus is on interpersonal styles toward an unspecified other, and when there is a possibility of asymmetrical relations between the people interacting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073191111401172">Pincus, Gurtman, &amp; Ruiz, 1998</xref>). We then included (physical) energy among the dominance subcomponents and control of anger and vulnerability expressions among the love subcomponents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073191111401172">Di Blas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073191111401172">Donahue, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191111401172">Ely, Melzi, Hadge, &amp; McCabe, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1073191111401172">Schaffer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1073191111401172">Shiner &amp; Caspi, 2003</xref>). Operationally, the DOM resource was defined in terms of assertion of ideas and preferences, actively seeking company, and competencies and energy invested in organizing and competing in games. The LOV resource was defined based on expressions of generosity, positive affect, support, respect for rules, and control over aggression. Last, we combined these basic DOM and LOV resources (what is given/denied to whom) and operationalized eight interpersonal behavioral styles for children in detail, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191111401172">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>Three studies were conducted. Study 1 developed the questionnaire and examined how third- to fifth-grade children’s frequency ratings of their own and their peers’ interpersonal actions are organized in a circular space. The extent to which the children’s ratings showed internal as well as interrater consistency, and correlated with ratings provided by parents on a five-factor measure was analyzed as well. Study 2 verified whether the results observed in Study1 were replicable. Study 3 merged data collected in the previous two studies and examined the hypothesis of developmental changes in the circumplex structure of the same interpersonal behavior-descriptive sentences. Overall, we expected that 8- to 11-year-old children’s ratings would yield a circular ordering of the interpersonal variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191111401172">Broughton et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073191111401172">Sodano &amp; Tracey, 2006</xref>). Yet in agreement with the developmental trend suggested by the results observed in the above-cited studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191111401172">Broughton et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073191111401172">Sodano &amp; Tracey, 2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1073191111401172">Quartier &amp; Rossier, 2008</xref>), we also hypothesized an increasing correspondence between empirical and theoretical variable circular arrays across third to fifth grades. This hypothesis was moreover based on findings from the personality–perception development literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191111401172">Alvarez, Ruble, &amp; Bolger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191111401172">Barenboim, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1073191111401172">Ruble &amp; Dweck, 1995</xref>), which indicate 9 to 10 years as a critical age in this regard—that is, the age in which children start to show a significant increase in their capacity to organize information from a trait-like perspective. Furthermore, we expected to find that the children would be capable of providing reliable and coherent self- and peer ratings across raters and instruments, although it was also expected that the coherence levels might be found to be generally lower than those usually observed for adults’ ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1073191111401172">Quartier &amp; Rossier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073191111401172">Sodano &amp; Tracey, 2006</xref>) but might increase with children’s age.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample consisted of 463 children (209 boys, 254 girls), who had been recruited in elementary schools in northeastern Italy; 156 were attending third grade, 134 were fourth graders, and 173 were fifth graders. All children provided self-ratings; 314 of these (146 boys, 168 girls: 110 third graders, 82 fourth graders, 122 fifth graders) also described a classmate, and the remaining 148 children (70 boys, 78 girls) participated in a retest session held 1 month later and once again produced self-reports. The adult participants were 171 mothers (<italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub> = 39.9 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.0) and 64 fathers (<italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub> = 41.7 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.9). Hence, a total of 235 children were rated by either their mothers or their fathers. Overall, we collected self- and peer ratings for 303 children; self- and parental ratings for 232 children; and self-, peer, and parental ratings for 220 children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1073191111401172">
<title>Materials and Procedure</title>
<p>We aimed at representing each of the eight interpersonal variables of the IPC by generating statements describing children’s concrete behaviors while strictly avoiding the use of adjectives (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191111401172">Table 1</xref>). We conducted two preliminary studies in which we openly discussed instructions and items with children and progressively modified them until the children evaluated that the instructions and statements were clear, made sense for them, and described their peers’ easily observable behaviors. The preliminary studies were also dedicated to collecting self- and peer reports in order to explore the structure of the sentences and select valid items for each octant of the IPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073191111401172">Di Blas, Grassi, Luccio, &amp; Silvestri, 2007</xref>). In the present study, we used 57 items—with six to eight sentences for each octant; 41 of the items had been selected in our previous studies, and 16 were generated specifically for the present study to more accurately represent the IPC sectors of HI—Submissive, FG—Introverted, PA—Dominant, and NO—Sociable. The sentences were formulated in the Italian language for administration to samples of Italian children and parents; they were then translated into English following the back-translation procedure to be presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1073191111401172">Table 2</xref>.</p>

Children providing peer ratings were also asked to report the degree to which they liked their classmate on a 4-point scale (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, to 4 = <italic>very much</italic>). The children completed the task in their classroom during class hours. All testing was conducted in the spring of the school year, so the children had had ample time to be familiar with one another. Random assignment of the classmate to be evaluated made it possible to obtain one peer report for each child and to control for peer likeability levels. The parents were asked to describe their children in terms of the Hierarchical Personality Inventory for Children (HiPIC) and the 57 items administered to children (parents, however, responded using a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 = <italic>never or almost never</italic> to 5 = <italic>always or almost always</italic>).

<title>IBQ-C Item Structure and Selection</title>
<p>Exploratory factor analyses were applied to the children’s self- and peer ratings, separately. In agreement with the IPC model, attention was focused primarily on two-factor solutions;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1073191111401172">1</xref></sup> qualitative and quantitative criteria were considered, with the aim of evaluating whether the two-factor solutions yielded item structures that were psychometrically and substantively consistent with the expected model.</p>
<p>After two factors had been extracted from each data set, the loadings observed for each item served as coordinates to locate the sentence in a circular space and to obtain its angular position and vector length<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1073191111401172">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1073191111401172">Wiggins &amp; Broughton, 1991</xref>). Low vector lengths (VL &lt; .30) were observed for four items in both data sets, and these were deleted; factor analysis was then conducted on the remaining 53 sentences. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1073191111401172">Table 2</xref> shows how the items were circularly ordered around the two factors, for both self- and peer reports. We then used the following tests: Rao’s <italic>G</italic> test to verify whether the items were arranged uniformly around the circumference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1073191111401172">Upton &amp; Fingleton, 1989</xref>); Fisher’s variation coefficient to verify another property of a circumplex structure, that is, constant radius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073191111401172">Acton &amp; Revelle, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191111401172">Fisher, 1997</xref>); Fisher’s <italic>A</italic>° to have a quantitative index of agreement for locations of like variables along the two circumplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073191111401172">Fisher, 1983</xref>); and Fisher’s χ<sup>2</sup> to test the hypothesis that the agreement level between the two empirical circular arrays could have arisen by chance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1073191111401172">3</xref></sup> <italic>G</italic> values were 305.8 (<italic>z</italic> = 1.697) and 274.8 (<italic>z</italic> = 0.408), respectively, for self- and peer ratings, indicating thereby that the empirical item arrays did not deviate from uniformity for the two data sets. Fisher’s variation coefficient values were .30 for self-ratings and .21 for peer ratings and indicated that the item distance from the center of the circular space was not constant. Mean angular separation (<inline-formula id="inline-formula1-1073191111401172">

</mml:math>
</inline-formula>) between corresponding item placements along the two circumplexes was equal to 24°, with a Fisher’s <italic>A</italic>° value of .87, indicating that the two circular arrays reached a substantive agreement degree, equal to 87% of the possible agreement. Moreover, the yielded Fisher’s χ<sup>2</sup> value of 202.8 (<italic>df</italic> = 106, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) showed that the angular positions of the 53 sentences along the two circumplexes were not generated by independent processes. Last, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1073191111401172">Table 2</xref> shows that the item continua replicated the expected variable sequence, from LM- to JK-related sentences, indicating a substantial correspondence between the IPC model and the circular structure of children’s own interpersonal behavior ratings thereby. Yet strict psychometric criteria applied to evaluate this correspondence showed that 68% of the sentences were clustered within the expected IPC octant for peer ratings, but only 53% did so for self-ratings.</p>
<p>Based on the results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1073191111401172">Table 2</xref>, we developed six-item octant scales to represent the IPC of children’s behaviors as viewed by children—that is, a selected set of 48 statements referred to from herein on as the IBQ-C. Specifically, given the high degree of convergence between the item circular sequences for the two data sets, we opted for the construction of a common IBQ-C version to be administered to children for both self- and peer evaluations and to their parents as well. We followed an iterative procedure to obtain eight reliable and structurally valid scales. For each octant scale, items were selected for inclusion in the final measure on the basis of the specific DOM and LOV combination they were hypothesized to represent; their empirical angular location (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1073191111401172">Table 2</xref>), by favoring the items matching observed and expected position along the circle; their vector length, by favoring those with the highest values; and their item-total scale correlation, by selecting the items enhancing alpha internal consistency values. Psychometric properties were verified for a preliminary version, which was progressively modified until its psychometric properties were acceptable. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1073191111401172">Table 2</xref> specifies which sentences were selected for each of the eight possible DOM/LOV combinations. Nearly 80% of the selected items fell within their theoretically expected octant for peer and/or self-ratings solutions, whereas 94% were selected in agreement with their theoretical DOM/LOV combination. All the items contributed to enhance the internal consistency levels of their respective octant.</p>

<title>Structural Validity of the IBQ-C</title>
<p>We used both exploratory (principal axis factoring) and confirmatory structural equation modeling (Browne’s model) approaches to test the circumplexity of the structure of the eight IBQ-C scales.</p>
<p>We used the CIRCUM program to evaluate the fit between our empirical data and the expected circular variable arrangement. Specifically, CIRCUM tests the fit between observed data and an analytical model—that is, a circular stochastic process model with a Fourier series correlation function—developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191111401172">Browne (1992</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191111401172">Fabrigar, Visser, &amp; Browne, 1997</xref>) in agreement with the basic assumptions of the circumplex model. In fact, Browne’ s model explicitly assumes that the underlying correlational structure among variables can be represented as a circular ordering; it also assumes that correlations among common score variables (ρ) reveal the true underlying structure of a sample correlation matrix, given that observed scores contain not only common scores but also unique and measurement error variance; and that the correlation between two variables is an inverse function of their angular distance (θ<sub>D</sub>), that is, ρ = inverse ƒ(θ<sub><italic>D</italic></sub>).</p>
<p>CIRCUM makes it possible to specify models varying in their restrictiveness, with the <italic>circulant</italic> model assuming that communalities and distances among variables are constant along the circle, and the <italic>quasi-circumplex</italic> model (i.e., an imperfect circumplex; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191111401172">Guttman, 1954</xref>) assuming a circular arrangement of variables, without imposing the constraints of variable equal spacing and equal radius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1073191111401172">Tracey, 2000</xref>). In agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073191111401172">Gurtman and Pincus (2000)</xref>, we tested three models, the first of which was a circulant model specifying equal-spacing and equal-communality constraints. Specifying an equal-spacing model implies that octant variables are located at regular distance of 45° from each other (i.e., θ<sub>45</sub>), on the circle, and an equal-communality model specification implies variables with a constant distance from the center of the circle. After testing the circulant model, we first relaxed the equal-spacing constraint and then the equal-communality constraint. The maximum likelihood estimation was used to fit the model; and the LM octant was specified as the reference variable and fixed at 0°.</p>
<p>To evaluate model fit, we used some complementary descriptive and alternative indexes, including: the χ<sup>2</sup> likelihood ratio, which indicates a good fit when nonsignificant; the adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI), which generally indicates that models are good approximation to the data when AGFI ≥ .90; the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), an alternative fit index, which evaluates the extent to which the model fails to fit the data and is generally interpreted as indicative of acceptable-fitting models when values ≤ .08 (although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073191111401172">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>, indicate a more conservative cutoff of .06); and the expected cross-validation index (ECVI), which represents a measure of the degree a model might be expected to replicate in another sample from the same population and the lower its value the more robust the model is considered to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191111401172">Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1073191111401172">Table 3</xref> presents the results. For self-ratings, RMSEA and AGFI values coherently demonstrated that the underlying structure of this sample correlation matrix fit the circulant model, although the Δχ<sup>2</sup> indicated that relaxing the equal-spacing constraint led to an improvement in model fit. For peer ratings, all fit indices values supported the unequal-spacing and unequal-communality model but not models placing constraints on radius and/or polar angle values. Last, fit indices did not show acceptable levels for any of the models (although AGFI did for the unequal spacing/equal communality model only) when the parent sample correlation matrix was analyzed.</p>

The empirical structures for self- and parents’ ratings were slightly rotated in an effort to better match the expected circular array. In fact, although CIRCUM requires indication of a reference variable, which is fixed at 0° (i.e., the LM octant), rotating the solutions does not influence the ordering of variables on the circle or the distances between variables on the circle and, therefore, has no impact on the model fit. Polar angles showed that each IBQ-C octant scale was located within its 45° theoretical arc, for each data set.

Fisher’s χ<sup>2</sup> values were statistically significant, and they allowed the rejection of the null hypothesis of independence of the empirical circumplex structure from the expected circular array. Communalities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1073191111401172">Table 4</xref>) were generally higher than .70, and coefficients of radius variations ranged from .058 (parents’ ratings) to .097 (peer ratings), indicating a constant radius for the IBQ-C circumplexes thereby.</p>

Test–retest reliability values indicated that children reported on their own interpersonal behaviors coherently across a 1-month interval. Domain-level alphas indicated satisfactory coherence levels for the children’s evaluations. At the octant scale level, alphas as well as mean interitem correlations were lower and generally modest when children reported on their own interpersonal behaviors but satisfactory when the same children evaluated their peers’ interpersonal behaviors. Alphas remained adequate also when peer likeability levels were partialled out from each item scores and octant reliabilities estimated on residual score correlations, that is, peer likeability did not spuriously inflate mean interitem correlations for peer reports. Both self- and peer reports yielded lower alphas for the HI—Submissive and PA—Dominant scales.</p>

<title>Cross-Rater Convergence for IBQ-C</title>
<p>Convergence levels across raters were examined in terms of structural convergence and simple correlations. To examine structural convergence, we conducted a joint factor analysis on the matching ratings provided by children and parents (<italic>N</italic> = 156) and extracted two factors so as to verify whether the IBQ-C scales exhibited a circular sequence coherently with the model, with matching octant scales being located next to each other, in narrow arcs. The two-factor solution (which accounted for 31.1% of the total variability) is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1073191111401172">Figure 2</xref>: Twenty of the 24 IBQ-C scales were located within their target octant, and, with few exceptions, the octant scale continuum was consistent with the IPC model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1073191111401172">Figure 2</xref> also reveals that peer evaluations along LM—Agreeable, NO—Sociable, and FG—Shy notably diverged from both self- and parent ratings, and that parents’ evaluations along the BC—Overbearing scale diverged from children’s ratings. Systematic comparisons between self/peer, self/parent, and peer/parent pairings showed that self/parent ratings converged substantially (<inline-formula id="inline-formula6-1073191111401172">

<p>Cross-rater correlations were considered in terms of validity rather than reliability, because raters presumably observed the target in different contexts (e.g., school for classmates, home for parents, both for self-raters), and were thereby exposed to different samples of a given child’s interpersonal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191111401172">Achenbach, McConaughy, &amp; Howell, 1987</xref>). In agreement with the structural convergence results, the correlations shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1073191111401172">Table 5</xref> indicate that peer ratings tended to be associated modestly, but significantly, with both self- and parental ratings on matching IBQ-C scales and domains. Self/parent ratings were in the .40s; moreover, substantial concordance relations emerged when self-ratings were associated with aggregated IBQ-C scores, which were calculated by summing peer and parental ratings. Regressing self-reports on peer and parent report scores revealed that both predictors were uniquely associated (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .001) with self-rated DOM levels (<italic>sr</italic> = .27 for parent reports, and <italic>sr</italic> = .30 for peer reports), whereas only parent-reported LOV levels were associated with self-rated LOV (<italic>sr</italic> = .34; for peer reports, <italic>sr</italic> = .14, <italic>p</italic> = .05). The associations remained unchanged after controlling for target child sex as well as for parent gender.</p>

<title>External Validity: IBQ-C and HiPIC</title>
<p>When parental reports on the HiPIC were correlated with parental reports on the IBQ-C, simple correlations showed that IBQ-C DOM was associated with both Extraversion (<italic>r</italic> = .61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and Benevolence (<italic>r</italic> = −.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); similarly, IBQ-C LOV was associated with Benevolence (<italic>r</italic> = .65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and Extraversion (<italic>r</italic> = .32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). These results indicated that IBQ-C domains are rotational variants of the HiPIC interpersonal dimensions: an angle of 32° separated Extraversion and DOM, and an angle of 26° separated Benevolence and LOV. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1073191111401172">Table 6</xref> presents <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> and part correlation observed when IBQ-C rotated (27° clockwise) domains were regressed on HiPIC domains.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We proposed an IPC measure for late childhood by interpreting the Wiggins’s IPC categories in agreement with the main literature findings on personality development in the elementary school years. Operationally, the IPC variables were represented through a number of simple sentences describing everyday observable behaviors, which were requested to be reported in terms of frequency. Our findings empirically demonstrated that the model proposed and operationalized into the IBQ-C is useful for systematizing children’s ratings of their interpersonal behaviors. In fact, results showed that the IBQ-C octant scales were structurally organized in agreement with the IPC model. Specifically, the exploratory factor analysis results supported the hypothesis of a circular arrangement for the ratings provided by classmates and parents but not for the participants’ self-evaluations. Conversely, the CIRCUM results showed that the self-rating correlation matrix fit the circulant model, the peer ratings fit an imperfect circumplex, but the parent ratings correlation matrix did not reach acceptable fit values. Despite the discrepancy between exploratory and confirmatory analysis findings for self-reports—which might have depended on the modest octant scale alphas—the children’s evaluations of their interpersonal behaviors met the stringent confirmatory analysis criteria and generally showed small average departures from the theoretically prescribed circular arrangement of octant scales. Remarkably, the present findings are fully comparable with those reported for adult samples providing self-ratings on IPC measures. For example, adults’ self-ratings on the Wiggins’s IAS measure hardly meet the stringent confirmatory analysis criteria when the circulant model is tested, and the different fit indices generally support the imperfect circumplex model, that is, when both equal-spacing and equal-communality indices are relaxed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073191111401172">Gurtman &amp; Pincus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073191111401172">Pincus et al., 1998</xref>). Furthermore, angular departures for children’s self-evaluations are in the range of those generally observed for adults (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073191111401172">Gurtman &amp; Pincus, 2000</xref>) and have no practical consequences.</p>
<p>The present study also showed that children provided reliable test–retest self-ratings as well as internally coherent ratings. As compared with internal consistency values observed for the adult sample at the scale level, coherence was higher when children evaluated their classmates but lower when they provided self-ratings. Although the self-rating alphas were modest, they were within the range of values reported in other studies using children’s self-ratings along short-form scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1073191111401172">Quartier &amp; Rossier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073191111401172">Sodano &amp; Tracey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1073191111401172">Soto, John, Gosling, &amp; Potter, 2008</xref>). The present study further showed that peer likeability slightly contributed to inflate interitem correlations and alphas, but that peer internal consistency levels remained in the range observed for the adult sample, when peer likeability was partialled out. From a developmental perspective, these findings substantiate the hypothesis that elementary school children are capable of providing reliable ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191111401172">Barbaranelli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1073191111401172">Quartier &amp; Rossier, 2008</xref>). Moreover, the observed self/peer discrepancies in internal coherence levels suggest that children might be more capable of coherently evaluating people and behaviors from an observer rather than an actor perspective.</p>
<p>Cross-rater convergence also supported IBQ-C validity. The general structural convergence observed for the matching ratings provided by children and their parents indicated that the IBQ-C scores assess substantial behavioral styles in interpersonal relationships. Otherwise, such a similar variable alignment would not have occurred. Interrater associations then paralleled structural convergence results and showed modest, but significant, agreement levels between raters. Specifically, although peer raters were randomly assigned to each target child, self/peer convergent correlations were in the .20s and were comparable, for example, with the <italic>r</italic>s reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1073191111401172">Swenson and Rose (2003)</xref>, who observed associations between self- and friend reports for depressive symptoms and conduct problems. Peer/parent correlations were slightly higher in the .30s at the domain level and indicated that children are capable of providing valid information as compared with parental ratings, assuming that children display a certain degree of behavioral consistency across different environments and that parents are a valid external criterion (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191111401172">Asendorpf &amp; Van Aken, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191111401172">Bierman, 2004</xref>). Self/parent simple correlations were in the .40s and therefore in the correlation range reported in other studies for the same age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191111401172">Barbaranelli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191111401172">De Fruyt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1073191111401172">Quartier &amp; Rossier, 2008</xref>). In agreement with measurement theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1073191111401172">Epstein, 1983</xref>), self/other aggregated score associations were even stronger. Last, cross-rater information, explored via regression analysis, also demonstrated that peers and adults provided complementary information with respect to self-reports: Parents uniquely contributed to the self-rating variance of both the LOV and DOM interpersonal domains, and peers uniquely contributed to self-evaluated DOM levels. If we consider that accessibility to different contexts affects cross-informant correlations, the observed self/aggregate rating score correlations suggest that children are able to express self-views that accurately reflect their behavior across varying interpersonal situations.</p>
<p>Last, parents’ ratings on the HiPIC questionnaire were coherent with their ratings on the IBQ-C measure and supported the external validity of the IBQ-C interpersonal variables. In line with results observed in adult samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1073191111401172">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1989</xref>), the present findings showed that DOM and LOV are rotational variants of the interpersonal Big Five dimensions. Evidence of the external validity of children’s reports was also observed. In fact, despite their small associations, IBQ-C domains were fairly well aligned with the HiPIC interpersonal axes, especially for peer ratings. Furthermore, the findings achieve a very stringent external validity criterion—that is, that of comparing children’s and parents’ ratings of the same target along two different instruments.</p>
<p>In the subsequent study (Study 2) described below, the IBQ-C was administered to a new sample, with the aim of verifying whether the findings described above are replicable.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 382 children (176 boys, 206 girls), attending third (<italic>N</italic> = 126), fourth (<italic>N</italic> = 140), and fifth grades (<italic>N</italic> = 116) of elementary school and aged between 8 and 11 years.

</sec>
<sec id="section17-1073191111401172">
<title>Materials and Procedure</title>
<p>We followed the same procedure used in Study 1: Children completed the IBQ-C in their classrooms during class hours and rated both themselves and a randomly assigned classmate; a subsample of children also evaluated a second randomly assigned classmate. Overall, we collected self- and single-peer evaluations for 352 children, and 196 of these children were also rated by a second peer. Parents completed the <italic>Interpersonal Adjective Scales for Children</italic> (IAS-C, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073191111401172">Di Blas, 2007</xref>), a measure comprising 62 adjectives that represent categories used by adults to interpret children’s behavioral styles while they interact with peers. In agreement with the IPC, the adjectives measure eight scales, which are ordered circularly around the two basic dimensions of Extraversion and Social Appropriateness. These two dimensions share the essential status and love exchange resources of Wiggins’s model, converging into the DOM and LOV domains thereby, but they also represent these resources by including distinctive characteristics of children’s behaviors in interpersonal action, for example, the child interaction characteristic of energy and self-regulation of anger and fear. Alphas for the present sample were .89 for both IAS-C domains.</p>

Self-rating fit indices demonstrated that the underlying structure of the IBQ-C sample correlation matrix fit a circumplex structure; this also occurred when simpler models were tested, although direct comparison between models revealed that relaxing equal spacing yielded a better fit. When correlations between octant scores based on single-peer reports were analyzed, only AGFI yielded evidence of a quasi-circumplex model, but when classmates’ reports were averaged, all fit indices demonstrated that the unequal spacing/unequal communality model fit the sample correlation matrices.</p>

The mean angular distances between like octant angles observed for self and each of the two classmates’ evaluations were larger (24.6° ≤ <inline-formula id="inline-formula13-1073191111401172">

</inline-formula> ≤ 28.3°), with notable discrepancies (&gt;40°) for NO—Sociable, BC—Overbearing, and DE—Hostile; the proportionate average misalignment was approximately 15% of the possible range, and Fisher’s χ<sup>2</sup> values (30.10 ≤ χ<sup>2</sup> ≤ 30.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) were statistically significant, indicating a certain degree of convergence beyond chance.</p>
<p>Cross-child correlations were parallel to results observed in Study 1, with self/single peer <italic>r</italic> = .37 <italic>(p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>N</italic> = 352) for DOM and <italic>r</italic> = .21 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for LOV. The present results, however, revealed that self/peer correlations increased considerably for DOM when classmate report scores were aggregated (<italic>r</italic> = .56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Correlations between classmates evaluating the same target reached the relatively high level of .46 for DOM but were modest for IBQ-C LOV (<italic>r</italic> = .27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Furthermore, regression analysis showed that self-rated DOM levels were uniquely associated with both classmates’ ratings, with <italic>sr</italic> = .38 and <italic>sr</italic> = .23 (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .001) associated with each of the two peers; LOV self-evaluations were conversely unrelated to single-peer reports.</p>

<title>External Validity: IBQ-C and IAS-C</title>
<p>When children’s IBQ-C scores were correlated with their parent-reported DOM and LOV scores on IAS-C, the conceptually matching domains of IBQ-C DOM and IAS-C Extraversion showed substantive convergent correlations, <italic>r</italic> = .32 (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .001) for self/parent comparisons, and <italic>r</italic> = .38 (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .001) for parent/aggregated peer comparisons. A significant correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .30, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001) was also observed between IBQ-C LOV and IAS-C Social Appropriateness for self/parent comparisons, whereas a <italic>r</italic> = .17 (<italic>ns</italic>) was found for parent/aggregated peer comparisons; for conceptually divergent domains, a correlation range of −.15 &gt; <italic>r</italic>s &lt; .15 (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .01) was observed. Expressed in angular placements, these correlations show that IBQ-C DOM was fairly well aligned with IAS-C Extraversion (10.9° and 15.1°, respectively, for self- and peer ratings), whereas IBQ-C LOV was less well aligned, with displacements of ≥ 26°. Expressed in vector lengths, the same correlations indicated that parents’ and children’s evaluations along the interpersonal domains of the two instruments shared weak to modest variance proportions (.05 ≤ <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> ≤ .16). Last, when IBQ-C variables were projected onto the IAS-C space (using simple correlations between IAS-C domains and IBQ-C scales), the octant scales were arranged coherently with the IPC model, but they were unequally spaced for both self- and peer (single and averaged) reports.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This second study replicated results from Study 1 and provided support for the hypothesis that third- to fifth-grade children are able to rate both their own and their peers’ interpersonal behaviors in accordance with the IPC model. The self-reported interpersonal behavior structure once again met stringent psychometric confirmatory analysis criteria, even through testing of the simpler circumplex model. Peer reports were shown to be organized in agreement with a quasi-circumplex model, when report scores were averaged across the two rating classmates. Again, empirical angular departures from target angles were in the range of those reported for adult samples, and Fisher’s statistics demonstrated a significant agreement between observed and target octant arrays, for both self- and peer data. Last, the modest misalignment between the IAS-C and the IBQ-C reference axes further demonstrated the external validity of children’s evaluations of their interpersonal behaviors along the IBQ-C.</p>
<p>This study also replicated the cross-rater results found in Study 1. Specifically, interrater correlations in Study 2 were higher between classmates than between self and peers, in agreement with results reported for adult samples (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073191111401172">John &amp; Robins, 1993</xref>). Furthermore, cross-rater associations revealed a domain effect. Indeed, peer/parent (despite the use of different instruments), peer/peer, and self/aggregated peer correlations were weak for IBQ-C LOV, but in the 40s<italic>/</italic>.50s for IBQ-C DOM, with self-evaluations being uniquely associated with each of the ratings provided by the two classmates. This domain effect could be because of different influencing factors: DOM-related behaviors might be more easily observable; they might be more salient to children (i.e., bossiness, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073191111401172">Donahue, 1994</xref>); or children might be more consistent in exhibiting dominant/submissive behaviors rather than cooperative behaviors across different situations and specific dyadic interactions. A study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1073191111401172">Moskowitz (1982)</xref>, for example, supports this latter possibility. In fact, she found that preschoolers exhibited high behavioral consistency across time and situations for dominance, but not dependability. Last, Study 2 further demonstrated that children’ self-reported profiles show a higher convergence level, with evaluations provided by others, when other report scores are averaged.</p>
<p>In Study 3, described below, we examined the issue of whether the IBQ-C questionnaire also shows age-related psychometric property differences.</p>

<title>Study 3</title>
<sec id="section24-1073191111401172">
<title>Method</title>
<p>We merged data from the previous two studies and obtained self-reports provided by 272 third-grade children (123 boys, 149 girls); 270 fourth-grade children (119 boys, 151 girls); and 284 fifth-grade children (128 boys, 156 girls); we also obtained peer reports by 217 third graders, 209 fourth graders, and 229 fifth graders.</p>
<p>Analyses were conducted separately on each of the three school grade data sets. We tested the circumplexity of the IBQ-C scales and examined internal coherence and different forms of self/peer convergence for the IBQ-C scales and domains.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1073191111401172">Table 9</xref> presents results from confirmatory analysis for the same three models tested in Studies 1 and 2. Quantitative indices demonstrated acceptable fit levels for the least parsimonious model in all instances. The simplest model was supported for older children only, when providing self- but not peer reports. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-1073191111401172">Table 10</xref>, average empirical departures from ideal variable arrays were smaller for fifth graders, although they were also modest for younger children as well, with Fisher’s <italic>A</italic>° revealing misalignment levels in the range of 2% to 5%, and Fisher’s chi-square further supporting a nonrandom empirical/theoretical angle convergence for all ages.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-1073191111401172">Table 10</xref> also presents alpha values and self/peer correlations observed for the IBQ-C scales and domains across ages. Overall, the results suggest a slightly increasing coherent value pattern for rating statements across ages. With respect to the across–school grade self/peer correlations, younger children generally provided incoherent self- and peer reports, but fourth and fifth graders reached significant association levels, suggesting an increase in self/peer validity levels thereby. Testing of the school grade moderation effect on self/peer correlations, however, did not yield a statistical support for a significant association level increase from third through fifth grades. Target gender, rater gender, and possible target × rater gender combinations did not moderate self/peer associations either, although ratee gender, but not peer gender, was significantly related to children’s IBQ-C scores, with boys evaluating themselves, and being rated by peers as being more dominant than girls (for self-reports, η<sup>2</sup> = .084, for peer reports, η<sup>2</sup> = .044, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>This study showed that the structural organization of children’s ratings along the same octant scales was not linked to age. In fact, quantitative fit indices demonstrated that the underlying structure of both the IBQ-C interscale correlation matrices agreed with a quasi-circumplex model for both younger and older children. Yet our findings also revealed that only fifth graders’ self-evaluation structure fit a circulant model. From a developmental perspective, our results are in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191111401172">Broughton et al.’s (1993)</xref> findings, which demonstrated that a quasi-circumplex structure is already reproduced, when third-grade children’s self-ratings are analyzed. The present results, however, also yielded some mixed evidence in terms of the possibility of a developmental increase in validity levels, especially between third and fourth elementary school grades (or 9 to 10 years). In fact, younger children’s self-evaluations were not in agreement with those of their classmates, whereas the fourth and fifth graders’ were.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The studies described herein examined the several psychometric properties of a new questionnaire, the IBQ-C, which is aimed at assessing children’s behavioral styles in peer interaction, from children’s self- and peer perspectives. The questionnaire was developed in accordance with Wiggins’s IPC model, whose Dominance and Love reference domains were defined in the present research by also including some distinctive elements of interpersonal traits during elementary school years (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073191111401172">Di Blas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1073191111401172">Shiner &amp; Caspi, 2003</xref>). Overall, the results showed that the IBQ-C variables were structurally organized in agreement with the hypothesized model and that they showed theoretically consistent patterns of concurrent associations with parental reports on both the HiPIC and IAS-C personality measures.</p>
<p>The present studies did not include longitudinal research to examine possible links between child and adult personality. By demonstrating the construct validity of the IPC categories from children’s ratings, however, the present work establishes a precondition, that of structural continuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073191111401172">Biesanz, West, &amp; Kwok, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191111401172">De Fruyt et al., 2006</xref>), for research aimed at directly addressing the question of personality development across and within children over time, by examining both adult and child perspectives.</p>
<p>Results also showed that children provided ratings that were internally consistent and test–retest reliable. Moreover, although generally in the range of .20/.30, both self/other and child/adult correlations were in the expected direction and reached substantial levels (in the range of .50) under specific conditions. In fact, self/other associations were higher when target scores were summed across peers or peers and parents; when both children and adults evaluated dominant instead of collaborative behaviors; and when raters had access to the same environment (i.e., school). Last, our findings revealed that children’s self-reports were uniquely associated with parents’ reports as well as with peers’ reports, that is, with evaluations provided by raters who presumably have access to different and independent environments. These findings suggest that children are capable of evaluating their own interpersonal behaviors by taking the complex pattern of their social behaviors and relationships into account.</p>
<p>Overall, the modest interrater association levels herein observed were fully coherent with those typically reported in literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191111401172">Barbaranelli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1073191111401172">Quartier &amp; Rossier, 2008</xref>), even if we consider studies using independent adult raters (i.e., parent/teacher or clinician/parent) only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191111401172">Achenbach et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191111401172">De Los Reyes &amp; Kazdin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073191111401172">John &amp; Robins, 1993</xref>). In fact, personality evaluation accuracy and cross-rater consistency depends on several moderator variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073191111401172">Funder, 1995</xref>). The present results therefore substantiate the need for both a multirater approach in personality assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073191111401172">Achenbach, 2006</xref>) and aggregation over raters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1073191111401172">Epstein, 1983</xref>). They also provide support for the idea that interrater associations may vary across personality domains (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1073191111401172">Moskowitz, 1982</xref>), presumably because of different degrees of indicator observability. Mainly, however, our findings indicate that children are capable of providing accurate descriptions of both themselves and their peers and provide support to the hypothesis that children’s perspectives may validly contribute to personality assessment in childhood (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191111401172">Arseneault, Kim-Cohen, Taylor, Caspi, &amp; Moffitt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1073191111401172">Ladd &amp; Kochenderfer-Ladd, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>With respect to the possibility of age-related increase in validity of the children’s ratings, Study 3 yielded mixed findings. Although structural validity was verified for both younger and older children, only fifth graders provided self-ratings that displayed an octant scale structure reflecting an ideal circumplex. Moreover, self/peer convergence levels were significant for fourth- and fifth-grade children, but not for younger children, in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1073191111401172">Quartier and Rossier (2008)</xref>. In brief, fourth and fifth graders successfully passed the criteria of structural validity, internal consistency, and self/peer coherence, whereas third graders were less fully convincing. Further analyses (e.g., structural analysis at the item level, a larger age range) and new data, however, are required to validate the hypothesis of an increase in psychometric properties of children’s ratings across ages and (as suggested by personality perception development findings) that of 9 to 10 years (or fourth grade) representing a critical age for validly reporting on personality along traditional questionnaires.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate the structural validity of the IPC model in late childhood and indicate that there is no psychometric rationale for considering children to be less valid or reliable informants than adult raters, as long as they use <italic>age-emic</italic> or age-adapted instruments to rate themselves or their peers. Given that no single factor can account for substantial proportions of the actual variability of complex developmental systems that include children as well as other socializing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1073191111401172">Vandell, 2000</xref>), our demonstration of IPC construct tenability in late childhood makes it possible to more validly and systematically examine—both concurrently and across time—the ways in which self- and other views are interlinked, how they are associated with children’s concrete life events, how child profile changes, and how self- and other evaluations of children’s interpersonal behaviors help predicting (mal)adjusted developmental trajectories. We therefore believe that our studies could help advance both personality development and personality continuity research.</p>
<p>We acknowledge, however, important limitations of the studies described herein. Our research project, for example, did not investigate the ways in which children’s ratings along the IPC variables are linked to concrete events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073191111401172">Markey et al., 2005</xref>). It also did not examine the psychological processes underlying children’s item responses or the extent to which between-variable differentiation at the sample level reflects between-variable differentiation at the individual level—that is, the extent to which a single child can use refined categories, such as those of the IPC, to assess interpersonal qualities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191111401172">Cervone, 2005</xref>). It did not yield longitudinal data, which are necessary to directly examine how personality changes over time, across and within children, from their perspective. It also did not more closely examine the conditions in which children are capable of providing accurate ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073191111401172">Funder, 1995</xref>). Future research in this field should attempt to shed further light on these issues.</p>
