<body>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) presents with different clinical manifestations, including acute MS, relapsing–remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). The clinical manifestations in these different forms of MS as well as the response to anti-inflammatory treatment of patients vary profoundly, and therefore the question has been proposed whether the cause and disease mechanisms are the same or differ between patient subgroups or stages of the disease. However, the pathology of the disease in the different forms does not support this concept.</p> <p>The pathology of MS is defined by a spectrum of tissue alterations in the central nervous system. This includes plaques of primary demyelination and astrocytic scar formation in the white and gray matter that when active arise around inflamed veins. In addition diffuse inflammation, microglia activation, axonal and neuronal loss and reactive gliosis affect the normal-appearing white and gray matter. These changes finally result in profound tissue loss, reflected by brain atrophy. All these features are essential criteria for the pathological diagnosis of MS and are, thus, seen in all patients, irrespective of their clinical course. However, their extent and relative contribution to the global pathology seen in a given MS patient is variable, and this variability in quantitative terms also reflects different clinical disease courses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512474091">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Inflammation is a key element of MS pathology. Inflammatory infiltrates mainly consist of T-lymphocytes and a much lower number of B-cells and plasma cells. Activation of microglia cells and macrophages is associated with active demyelination and neurodegeneration. The inflammatory reaction is most intense in patients at early disease stages and declines with patient age and disease duration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512474091">2</xref></sup> Thus, in comparison to early (acute or RR) MS, the extent of inflammation is lower in patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and even lower in PPMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512474091">3</xref></sup> However, active demyelination and neurodegeneration is invariably associated with inflammation. In patients in whom inflammation has declined to levels seen in age-matched controls, active demyelination is absent and axonal injury too has declined to levels seen in the respective controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512474091">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, persistent meningeal inflammation is associated with active demyelination and neurodegeneration in the cortex not only in the early stages of MS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512474091">4</xref></sup> but also in patients with SPMS or PPMS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512474091">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512474091">6</xref></sup> The inflammatory response in part is fuelled by a new influx of inflammatory cells from the circulation, and this process is associated with blood-brain barrier injury, reflected by gadolinium (Gd)-enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Part of the inflammatory response, however, occurs in the brain parenchyme and around blood vessels in the absence of blood-brain barrier disruption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512474091">7</xref></sup> While inflammation, which is associated with blood-brain barrier damage, is mainly present in patients with acute and RRMS, it becomes rare in patients who have entered the progressive phase of the disease. The opposite is seen with inflammation, which is compartmentalized behind a normal (repaired) blood-brain barrier. This is more pronounced in patients with progressive compared to those with early MS. A similar shift is also seen in the quantitative relation of different types of tissue injury between early relapsing and late progressive MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512474091">8</xref></sup> New focal white matter lesions are frequent in the early stages of MS, but become rare in patients with progressive disease. In contrast, slowly expanding focal white matter lesions, the number and size of cortical lesions and the extent of diffuse injury in the normal-appearing white and gray matter increase with age and disease duration. Thus, the differences in the pathology between RRMS, SPMS and PPMS are of quantitative, but not of qualitative nature.</p>
<p>Recent data suggest that oxidative injury and subsequent mitochondrial damage may play an important role in driving demyelination and neurodegeneration in the MS brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512474091">9</xref></sup> Oxidative injury can be induced by inflammation, resulting in oxdidative burst, and can further be amplified by various mechanisms that are related to brain aging and preexisting neurodegeneration. Thus, it is proposed that MS starts with the invasion of inflammatory cells from the peripheral immune system, which results in tissue injury through different immunological mechanisms, including the induction of oxidative burst in microglia and macrophages. With increasing disease duration, the intensity of this inflammatory response declines. Thus, in the progressive stage of the disease inflammation and microglia activation is still required for the propagation of demyelination and neurodegeneration, but it becomes amplified by additional mechanisms related to brain aging and the accumulation of brain damage. Potential amplification factors are an age-dependent decrease of neuroprotective or repair mechanisms and age-dependent iron accumulation in the human brain, which is released from oligodendrocytes within active lesions and may amplify oxidative injury. In addition, accumulation of brain damage may lead to chronic microglia activation through anterograde or retrograde neurodegeneration as well as to further amplification of mitochondrial injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512474091">10</xref></sup> Thus it is likely that the threshold of the central nervous system for neurodegeneration becomes lower with increasing age and disease duration compared to that seen at early disease stages. This together with the compartmentalization of the inflammatory response within the brain may explain the lack of success of anti-inflammatory treatment in patients with progressive MS. On the basis of this concept, the differences between RRMS and PPMS may be related to a shift in the balance between inflammation and the susceptibility of the nervous tissue for neurodegeneration, but not to essential differences in pathogenetic mechanisms.</p>
