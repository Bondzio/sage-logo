<abstract>
<p>Mechanical properties of concrete specimens containing CuO nanoparticles which were cured in saturated limewater have been optimized. CuO nanoparticles were partially added to concrete as nano-fillers. The specimens were cured in water and saturated limewater for 7, 28, and 90 days after casting and then their strengths were evaluated by mechanical tests (compressive, split tensile, and flexural strength tests). The results showed that replacement of Portland cement with CuO nanoparticles up to 1.0 wt.% for the specimens cured in water and 2.0% for the specimens cured in saturated limewater produces concrete with the best strength. It has been observed that the specimens cured in saturated limewater for 28 days and then in water until 90 days produce more strengthened concrete than those cured only in saturated limewater for 90 days. Excess Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> crystals which form after 28 days, when the specimens cured in limewater, do not contribute to strength enhancement as strong as C–S–H gel and hence, the mechanical properties of the specimens do not reach the maximum level. On the other hand, curing the specimens in water after 28 days produces more strengthening gel resulting in a concrete with higher strength. The addition of nanoparticles improves the pore structure of concretes; thus, the refined extent of pore structure increases with decreasing nanoparticle content. The pore structure of concretes which were cured in saturated limewater is better than that of concretes cured in water.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1056789510397074" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>T<sc>here are several</sc> reports on the incorporation of nanoparticles in cement-based composites. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056789510397074">Li et al. (2003)</xref> investigated the properties of cement mortars blended with nanoparticles to explore their super mechanical and smart (temperature and strain sensing) potentials. Also, useful applications of nano-SiO<sub>2</sub> are addressed by the Fuji Chimera Research Institute (2002). However, until now, research performed over the years has been mainly aimed at achieving high mechanical performance with cement replacement materials in micro-level. Several researchers have demonstrated that the finer the SiO<sub>2</sub> particle sizes in micron level, the higher the compressive strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056789510397074">Erdogdu and Tucker, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056789510397074">Lee et al., 1999</xref>). But, there are less number of works on the effects of ultra-fine and nano-size particles on cementitious composite’s properties.</p>
<p>Lu and Young (1992) achieved high strengths on compressed samples which contain SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1056789510397074">Richard and Cheyrezy (1994)</xref> developed reactive power concretes by SiO<sub>2</sub> nano-fillers. The development of an ultrahigh strength cementitious composite was made possible by the application of densified system containing homogeneously arranged ultra-fine particles with super plasticizer and silica fume content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056789510397074">Jo et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056789510397074">Kuo et al. (2006)</xref> investigated the properties of waterworks sludge ash cement paste incorporating SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. In their study, the flowability of the cement pastes has been considered and it has been shown that the flowability of the cementitious composite decreases by increasing the nanoparticle amount. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056789510397074">Lin and Tsai (2006)</xref> investigated the influences of nano-materials on the microstructures of sludge ash cement paste. They noticed that the amount of crystallization in the hydrates increased with the increased quantities of nano-material added. Furthermore, denser crystallizations, smaller pore sizes, and a decreased number of pores were observed with the addition of nano-material results in decreasing water permeability.</p>
<p>There are few works about incorporating other nanoparticles in cementitious composites. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056789510397074">Li et al. (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056789510397074">2006</xref>) have investigated the compressive strength and aberration resistance of cement paste composites incorporating nano-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and nano-TiO<sub>2</sub> particles, respectively. Incorporation of zinc–iron oxide nanoparticles as a replacement of cement has been investigated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1056789510397074">Flores-Velez and Dominguez (2002)</xref>.</p>
<p>The other nanoparticles (such as CuO nanoparticles in this study) have rarely been investigated and some of researchers do not agree that the other nanoparticles could be pozzolans. It seems that several works are needed to introduce these new materials as cement replacement.</p>
<p>Previously, a series of works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056789510397074">Nazari et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056789510397074">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056789510397074">c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056789510397074">d</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1056789510397074">e</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056789510397074">f</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1056789510397074">g</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056789510397074">h</xref>) have been conducted on cementitious composites containing different nanoparticles evaluating the mechanical properties of the composites. In this study, the influence of nano-CuO on compressive strength, flexural strength, and split tensile strength of binary blended cementitious composite cured in water and saturated limewater for different ages has been investigated. The optimum replacement level of CuO nanoparticles determined in different curing media has been obtained and the method for achieving the optimum strength using a combination of two curing media has been discussed.</p></sec>

<p>Series N mixtures were prepared by mixing the coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, and powder materials (cement and nano-CuO particles) in a laboratory concrete drum mixer. The powder material in the series C0 mixtures was only cement. They were mixed in dry condition for 2 min, and for another 3 min after adding the water. Cubes of 100 mm edge for compressive strength tests, cubes with 200 × 50 × 50 mm<sup>3</sup> edges for flexural strength, and cylinders with diameter of 150 mm and height of 300 mm for split tensile strength were cast and compacted in two layers on a vibrating table, where each layer was vibrated for 10 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056789510397074">Bui et al., 2005</xref>). The molds were covered with polyethylene sheets and moistened for 24 h. Then, the specimens were demolded and cured in water (N–W series) and saturated limewater (N–LW series) at a temperature of 20°C prior to test days. To produce saturated limewater, the lime powder was dispersed in tap water and riled until the excess content of lime powder was precipitated. The strength tests of the concrete samples were determined at 7, 28, and 90 days. A series of the specimens were cured in saturated limewater for 28 days and then cured in water until 90 days (N–LW–W series) after casting and then were tested.</p>
<p>Compressive strength of nano-CuO particle-blended cement concrete cubes was determined as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056789510397074">ASTM C39 (2001</xref>) after 7, 28, and 90 days of moisture curing. Tests were carried out on triplicate specimens and average compressive strength values were obtained.</p>
<p>Split tensile test was carried out in accordance to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056789510397074">ASTM C496 (2001)</xref> standard. After the specified curing period was over, the concrete cylinders were subjected to split tensile test using universal testing machine. Tests were carried out on triplicate specimens and average split tensile strength values were obtained.</p>
<p>Flexural tests were done in accordance to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056789510397074">ASTM C293 (2001</xref>) Standard. Again, flexural tests were carried out on triplicate specimens and average flexural strength values were obtained.</p>
<p>There are several methods generally used to measure the pore structure, such as optics method, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), helium flow, and gas adsorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1056789510397074">Tanaka and Kurumisawa, 2002</xref>). MIP technique is extensively used to characterize the pore structure in porous material as a result of its simplicity, quickness, and wide measuring range of pore diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056789510397074">Abell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1056789510397074">Tanaka and Kurumisawa, 2002</xref>). MIP provides information about the connectivity of pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1056789510397074">Tanaka and Kurumisawa, 2002</xref>). In this study, the pore structure of concrete is evaluated using MIP.</p>
<p>To prepare the samples for MIP measurement, the concrete specimens, after 28 days of curing, are first broken into smaller pieces, and then the cement paste fragments selected from the centers of prisms are used to measure pore structure. The samples are immersed in acetone to stop hydration as fast as possible. Before mercury intrusion test, the samples are dried in an oven at about 110°C until constant weight to remove moisture in the pores.</p>
<p>MIP is based on the assumption that the nonwetting liquid mercury (the contact angle between mercury and solid is greater than 90°) will only intrude in the pores of porous material under pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056789510397074">Abell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1056789510397074">Tanaka and Kurumisawa, 2002</xref>). Each pore size is quantitatively determined from the relationship between the volume of intruded mercury and the applied pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056789510397074">Abell et al., 1999</xref>). The relationship between the pore diameter and applied pressure is generally described by Washburn equation as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056789510397074">Abell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1056789510397074">Tanaka and Kurumisawa, 2002</xref>):

where <italic>D</italic> is the pore diameter (nm), <italic>γ</italic> the surface tension of mercury (dyne/cm), <italic>θ</italic> the contact angle between mercury and solid (°), and <italic>P</italic> the applied pressure (MPa).</p>
<p>The test apparatus used for pore structure measurement is AutoPore III mercury porosimeter. Mercury density is 13.5335 g/mL. The surface tension of mercury is taken as 485 dyne/cm, and the contact angle selected is 130°. The maximum measuring pressure applied is 200 MPa (30,000 psi), which means that the smallest pore diameter that can be measured reaches about 6 nm (on the assumption that all pores have cylindrical shape).</p>
<p>SEM investigations were conducted on a Hitachi Model S-9260 CD-SEM apparatus. Backscattered electron and secondary electron (SE) imaging were used to study the samples, which were prepared under conditions that ensured their subsequent viability for analytical purposes.</p>
<p>For XRD analysis, a Philips PW-1730 unit was used for XRD analysis which was taken from 4° to 70°.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1056789510397074" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
<sec id="sec4-1056789510397074"><title>Compressive Strength</title>
<p>The compressive strength results of series C0–W and N–W mixtures are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1056789510397074">Table 4</xref>. Comparison of the results from the 7, 28, and 90 days samples shows that the compressive strength increases with nano-CuO particles up to 1.0% replacement (N2–W) and then it decreases, although the results of 2.0% replacement (N4–W) are still higher than those of the plain cement concrete (C0–W). It was shown that the use of 2.0% nano-CuO particles in N–W series decreases the compressive strength to a value which is near to the control concrete. This may be due to the fact that the quantity of nano-CuO particles (pozzolan) present in the mix is higher than the amount required to combine with the liberated lime during the process of hydration, thus leading to excess silica leaching out and causing a deficiency in strength as it replaces part of the cementitious material but does not contribute to strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056789510397074">AI-Khalaf and Yousift, 1984</xref>). Also, it may be due to the defects generated in dispersion of nanoparticles that cause weak zones. The high enhancement of compressive strength in the N series blended concrete is due to the rapid consuming of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> which was formed during hydration of Portland cement specially at early ages related to the high reactivity of nano-CuO particles. As a consequence, the hydration of cement is accelerated and larger volumes of reaction products are formed. Also, nano-CuO particles recover the particle packing density of the blended cement, directing to a reduced volume of larger pores in the cement paste.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1056789510397074">Table 4</xref> also shows the compressive strength of C0–LW and N–LW series. The results of this study show that the replacement of cement by CuO nanoparticles up to 2.0 wt% (N4–LW) in N–LW series produces concrete with high strength with respect to N–LW concrete. By comparison of the compressive strength results of C0–W and C0–LW series, we see that after 7, 28, and 90 days of curing the concrete in the saturated limewater, the compressive strength of the C0–LW series is smaller than the corresponding strength of C0–W series. This may be due to more formation of crystalline Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> in the presence of limewater which reduces the compressive strength in C0–LW series with respect to C0–W series. The production of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> from water and line has been addressed in the literature as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056789510397074">Mostafa and Brown, 2005</xref>):
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1056789510397074"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789510397074-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>On the other hand, the compressive strength of the N–LW series is more than those of N–W series. Lime reacts with water and produces Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> which needs to form strengthening gel. When CuO nanoparticles react with Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> produced from saturated limewater, the content of strengthening gel is increased because of high free energy of nanoparticles which reduces significantly when reacted by Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The compressive strength of N–W and N–LW series should be compared from two viewpoints. The first viewpoint is that the compressive strength of N–LW series increases by partial replacement of cement with CuO nanoparticles up to 2.0 wt% (N4–LW); while for N–W series, it increases by partial replacement of cement with CuO nanoparticles up to 1.0 wt% (N2–W) and then decreases. Once more, this confirms the more strengthening gel formation in the presence of saturated limewater in which the quantity of nano-CuO particles (pozzolan) present in the mix is close to the amount required to combine with the liberated lime during the process of hydration, thus leading to lesser silica leaching out with respect to the specimens cured in water. Second viewpoint is that the difference between the compressive strengths of the N–W and N–LW series after 28 days of curing is relatively high while this difference in compressive strength after 90 days of curing is not high. This may be due to the fact that formation of crystalline Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> in N–LW series after the 28 days causes reduction in compressive strength. In other words, curing of the CuO nanoparticles-blended concrete in saturated limewater after 28 days is completely suitable to achieve high strength especially with high weight percent of nanoparticles.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1056789510397074"><title>Split Tensile Strength</title>
<p>The split tensile strength results of series C0 and N mixtures are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1056789510397074">Table 5</xref>. The results again show the better split tensile strength in CuO nanoparticle-blended concrete with respect to the control concrete especially in high-volume fraction of nanoparticles in concrete cured in saturated limewater. This again may be due to more strengthening gel formation in the presence of nanoparticles especially for the specimens cured in saturated limewater after 28 days of curing.

<p>The effectiveness of nano-CuO in improving the pore structure of concretes increases in the order: N4–LW &lt; N3–LW &lt; N2–LW &lt; N1–LW, and similar results can be observed for the concretes containing nano-CuO which were cured in water; i.e., N4–W &lt; N3–W &lt; N2–W &lt; N1–W. The harmless and few-harm pores in N1–LW and N1–W series increase by the largest extent, while their harmful and multi-harm pores decrease by the largest extent, which indicates that the pore structure of N1–LW and N1–W is most significantly improved. With increase of nanoparticle content, the enhanced extent of harmless and few-harm pores and the reduced extent of harmful and multi-harm pores in concretes are all decreased, and the improvement on the pore structure of concretes weakens.</p>
<p>The mechanism that the nanoparticles improve the pore structure of concrete can be interpreted as follows. Suppose that nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in concrete and each particle is contained in a cube pattern, the distance between nanoparticles can be determined. After hydration begins, hydrate products diffuse and envelop nanoparticles as kernel. If the content of nanoparticles and the distance between them are appropriate, the crystallization will be controlled to be a suitable state through restriction of the growth of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> crystal by nanoparticles. Moreover, the nanoparticles located in cement paste as kernel can further promote cement hydration due to their high activity. This makes the cement matrix more homogeneous and compact. Consequently, the pore structure of concrete is improved evidently such as the concrete containing nano-CuO in the amount of 1 wt% of binder.</p>
<p>With increasing content of nanoparticles, the improvement on the pore structure of concrete is weakening. This can be attributed to that the distance between nanoparticles decreases with increasing content of nanoparticles, and Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> crystals cannot grow up enough due to limited space and the crystal quantity is decreased, which leads to small ratio of crystal-to-strengthening gel and increase in the shrinkage and creep of cement matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056789510397074">Ye, 2001</xref>); thus, the pore structure of cement matrix is looser relatively.</p>
<p>On the whole, the addition of nanoparticles improves the pore structure of concrete. On the one hand, nanoparticles can act as a filler to enhance the density of concrete, which leads to significant reduction in the porosity of concrete. On the other hand, nanoparticles cannot only act as an activator to accelerate cement hydration due to their high activity, but also act as a kernel in cement paste which makes the size of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> crystal smaller and the tropism more stochastic.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1056789510397074"><title>Optimized Strength</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1056789510397074">Tables 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1056789510397074">6</xref> give the compressive strength, split tensile strength, and flexural strength of N–LW–W series blended concretes. The strength of the N–LW–W series is more than that of N–LW series after 90 days of curing. As it mentioned above, this may be due to the formation of crystalline Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> in N–LW series after 28 days. After curing for 28 days in saturated limewater, curing the specimens in water prevents crystalline Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> formation and hence produces concrete with higher strength. In other words, after 28 days of curing in saturated limewater, only strengthening gel forms by curing the specimens until the day 90 in water.</p>
<p>Therefore, the optimized strength of nanoparticle-blended concrete was achieved by partial replacement of 2.0 wt% cement with CuO nanoparticles which was cured for 28 days in saturated limewater and then in water until 90 days.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1056789510397074" sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>The results show that the nano-CuO particle-blended concrete had significantly higher strength with respect to that of the concrete without nano-CuO particles. It is found that the Portland cement could be advantageously replaced with 2.0% or higher amount of nano-CuO particles with average particle sizes of 15 nm when the specimens cured at saturated limewater for 28 days. The optimum level of nano-CuO particle content was achieved with 1.0% replacement for the specimens cured in water 7, 28, and 90 days. The optimized strength of nanoparticle-blended concrete was achieved by partial replacement of 2.0 wt% cement with CuO nanoparticles which was cured for 28 days in saturated limewater and then in water until 90 days. It also has been seen that study of the pore structure of the specimens with nanoparticles showed that the distribution pattern of the pores shifts to harmless or few-harmless pores and harmful pores are removed from the concrete structure.</p></sec>
