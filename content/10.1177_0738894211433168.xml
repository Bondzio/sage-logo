<abstract>
<p>This article presents PRIO Conflict Site, a geo-referenced dataset on armed conflict, which provides geographic information on the location, scope, and size of all conflicts in the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset, 1989–2008. In contrast to earlier efforts to map the incidence of conflicts, this dataset is structured in a country-year format that accounts for the temporal dynamics of conflicts. The article reveals that unlike the well-known post-Cold War decline of conflict, there is no contemporaneous decline in the spatial extent of conflict. Furthermore, it is shown that governmental conflicts are more dynamic, both in terms of location and scope, than separatist conflicts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A recent stream of research has argued that existing quantitative studies on intrastate conflicts too often suffer from a discrepancy between theory and empirical analysis. Empirical evidence shows that civil war typically is a local phenomenon and the theorized causal mechanisms tend to operate at sub-national levels. Nevertheless, most empirical analyses have been carried out on the state level, which might lead to biased results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0738894211433168">Buhaug and Rød, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Naturally, some characteristics of a state, such as features of the central government, are constant across space and should therefore be measured on the state level, but other factors, for instance economic development and ethnic composition, exhibit substantive cross-regional variation. The appropriate level of aggregation is dependent on the purported causal mechanism and the research question.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0738894211433168">1</xref></sup> One way of overcoming the aggregation problem is to shift focus from the state level and carry out disaggregated statistical studies. Increased availability of data has made this possible and as a result there has been a spate of articles based on disaggregated data published in recent years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0738894211433168">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The PRIO Conflict Site project aims to contribute to the development of this field of research by providing a global dataset on the geographic location and scope of armed conflicts in the post-Cold War period. The spatial distribution of conflicts is a vital piece of information that potentially can help researchers to gain a better understanding of the causes and dynamics of war. For instance, by examining the geographic, economic, and social features of conflict zones—natural resource endowments, settlement patterns, etc.—we should be able to better identify drivers of conflicts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0738894211433168">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>This is not the first attempt to quantify the location of conflicts within states; however, earlier efforts either suffer from lack of temporal variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0738894211433168">Buhaug and Gates, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0738894211433168">Gleditsch et al., 2002</xref>), lack global coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0738894211433168">Buhaug and Rød, 2006</xref>), or are limited to the point location of conflict outbreak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0738894211433168">Braithwaite, 2010</xref>). The most ambitious project to date, the Armed Conflict Location and Event Dataset (ACLED; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0738894211433168">Raleigh et al., 2010</xref>), records violent political activity—such as battle events, transfers of military control, and rioting—at a more detailed level than the PRIO Conflict Site dataset. However, its geographic and temporal scope is currently more limited, and using the ACLED data to its full potential demands more of the user in terms of knowledge of geographic information systems (GIS). Hence, this dataset is not intended to take the place of ACLED; rather, they should be regarded as complementary.</p>
<p>By making these data available, the PRIO Conflict Site dataset will make it possible for researchers to carry out more fine grained analyses, in which the conflict itself or the conflict-affected area is the unit of analysis. The PRIO Conflict Site data can be combined with other disaggregated datasets—for instance the PRIO-GRID which contains a wide range of political, economic, demographic, and environmental variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0738894211433168">Tollefsen et al., 2012</xref>)—in order to test existing theories and hypotheses on a level of aggregation that corresponds closely to the relevant causal mechanisms. This is a promising research agenda that offers great potential for theory development in the field of conflict research, and that is likely to contribute new and valuable knowledge about civil wars and related phenomena.</p>
<p>The article proceeds with a brief description of the new dataset, including definitions and illustrations. Next, it presents some general trends of the global dispersion of conflict before providing a few examples of how the data may be applied to reveal new features about contemporary civil wars. A concluding section closes the article.</p>

<sec id="section2-0738894211433168">
<title>The New Dataset</title>
<p>The original version of the PRIO Conflict Site data was compiled by Halvard Buhaug for use in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0738894211433168">Buhaug and Gates (2002)</xref> and subsequently released as part of the official UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0738894211433168">Gleditsch et al., 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0738894211433168">4</xref></sup> Later, the geocoding component was separated from the main UCDP/PRIO project and released under its own name, the PRIO Conflict Site version 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0738894211433168">Raleigh et al., 2006</xref>). These data have since been used in numerous studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0738894211433168">Buhaug and Lujala, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0738894211433168">Levy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0738894211433168">Raleigh and Urdal, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0738894211433168">United Nations Environment Programme, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0738894211433168">Wood, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The allocation of geographic coordinates to each conflict facilitated geographically disaggregated empirical analysis where countries could be substituted by provinces, grid cells or conflict zones as units of analysis. At the same time, the earlier versions of the PRIO Conflict Site dataset suffered from a major limitation: a lack of temporal dimension. With very few exceptions, the size and location of the coded conflict zones did not vary over time; hence, the spatial data in essence reflected the maximum spatial extent of the conflicts during their course. This limitation was of little concern if one sought to understand geographic determinants of conflict prevalence and duration, but it hindered systematic analyses of conflict onset and dynamics. Besides, the geocoding rested on a much narrower selection of source material (mostly <italic>Keesing’s World News Archive</italic>) than the parent conflict dataset, which at least in principle means that some conflict zones may have been inaccurately coded.</p>
<p>The new version (3.0) of the PRIO Conflict Site dataset is a totally revised and recoded update that corresponds to the latest available version of the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset (Version 4-2010). One of the major improvements is that the data are structured in a conflict-year format, thereby adding a temporal—dynamic—aspect lacking in previous versions. The time period covered is 1989–2008. In addition, a wider range of sources than in earlier versions have been used, including news reports from <italic>Factiva</italic> and a generous selection of case-specific literature. Moreover, the use of GIS software and databases facilitates geo-referencing with high precision, which increases the quality of the conflict data.</p>
<p>Every conflict-year in the dataset is assigned a circular conflict zone, which is defined by a center point (<italic>location</italic>), given as latitude and longitude coordinates in decimal degrees, and a radius (<italic>scope</italic>) indicator that measures the distance from the center point to the most distant point in the conflict zone, rounded upwards to the nearest 50 kilometers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0738894211433168">Figure 1</xref>). The conflict zone covers the area directly affected by a conflict. It includes all</p>

</list>
<p>In intrastate conflicts, only armed encounters, occupied territories, and rebel bases <italic>in the country whose government is challenged by a rebel group</italic> are included in the conflict zone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0738894211433168">5</xref></sup> This is done to ensure consistency with the <italic>location</italic> indicator in the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset and to avoid selectively accounting for battle events in countries not hosting an armed conflict according to UCDP’s criteria.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the need for a geo-referenced conflict dataset, consider the civil war in Chechnya. In all major conflict datasets, Russia is coded as hosting a civil war in the mid-1990s. Does this mean that all of Russia was at war and that the fighting directly affected the whole population? No. According to the new PRIO Conflict Site dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0738894211433168">Figure 2</xref>), the conflict in Chechnya in 1995 covered an area of some 67,000 square kilometers, less than 0.5 percent of Russia’s total landmass (about 17,000,000 square kilometers). Accordingly, it makes little sense to “explain” this conflict by relying on conventional country-level regressors—e.g. ethno-linguistic fractionalization, GDP per capita, percent mountainous terrain—as proxies for phenomena that are inherently spatial (local dominance of ethnic minority, local poverty, local topography).</p>

</fig>
<p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0738894211433168">Figure 1</xref>, a drawback with circular conflict zones is that they cover more territory than is actually affected by the conflict, including territories of neighboring countries (cf. Footnote 4). Owing to the nature of armed conflict, it may be impossible to gain information on the exact location of all armed encounters, occupied territories, and rebel bases during the course of the conflict. Moreover, as the quality of reporting is prone to varying across cases as well as over time, a very detailed coding procedure (e.g. allowing for uniquely shaped, dynamic conflict polygons) would very likely introduce systematic bias and inconsistent precision in the data. The choice of circular conflict zones is essentially a trade-off between precision and simplicity, and in most cases a circular conflict zone will give a good indication of the <italic>core area of the conflict</italic>. More information on coding decisions and problematic cases can be found in the codebook.</p>

<title>The Dispersion of Armed Conflicts across Time and Space</title>
<p>Data from the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset show that the world has become more peaceful since the end of the Cold War. The number of armed conflicts today is considerably lower than at the beginning of the 1990s, although there has been a slight increase the last few years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0738894211433168">Harbom and Wallensteen, 2010</xref>). In terms of conflict severity, a downward trend is evident for the entire post-World War II period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0738894211433168">Lacina and Gleditsch, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the declining risk of death in battle could be that the average conflict has decreased in extent over time as a consequence of regimes becoming more successful in containing the fighting to small parts of their territories. An inspection of the data suggests that this is not the case. Although the number of conflicts is on the wane, neither the median size of conflict zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0738894211433168">Figure 3</xref>) nor the total conflict-affected area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0738894211433168">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0738894211433168">5</xref>) is decreasing in a similar fashion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0738894211433168">6</xref></sup> As regards the total conflict-affected area, the PRIO Conflict Site data reveal several peaks and dips, including a hump in 1997–2002, which is not found in the parent dataset. One reason for the discrepancy in trends is the fact that the high number of conflicts in the early 1990s was mainly caused by a sudden rise in short conflicts in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, but since these wars were relatively small they exerted a limited influence on the total conflict-affected area. Another reason for the irregular conflict area pattern is that conflicts that cover large swathes of territory exert a disproportionate influence on the aggregate conflict area, whereas all conflict-years are equally counted in the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset. Influential cases in the shown time period include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, and Turkey. The increase in total conflict-affected area from 2005 onwards is consistent with the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset conflict count.</p>

<p>The overall lack of decline in conflict area is an interesting finding that adds nuance to the notion of the post-Cold War decline of armed conflict. Whether this implies that the average conflict instead has relocated to peripheral and less populated areas remains to be uncovered though it is also consistent with better medical care and increased internationalism over time that have contributed to shrinking costs of war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0738894211433168">Human Security Report Project, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0738894211433168">Figure 4</xref> the data are divided by conflict type in order to investigate their relative influence on the global conflict area. As the diagram shows, interstate wars make up a tiny part of the data and are hardly discernable, which is mainly a function of the low number of interstate conflicts since the end of the Cold War. Intrastate and internationalized intrastate conflicts are the predominant form of war in the examined time period in terms of spatial coverage as well as absolute number of observations.</p>
<p>As a final visualization of trends in the data, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0738894211433168">Figure 5</xref> shows the dispersion of conflict across regions. The bulk of the temporal variation is driven by African conflicts, with the wars in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Sudan as the most influential cases. The Middle East is also relatively volatile, where the conflicts in Iran, Iraq, and Turkey drive most of the variance. As can be seen, the European conflicts are extremely marginal in the spatial context and can hardly be discerned.</p>
<p>Has the world become more peaceful since the end of the Cold War? In terms of battle-related deaths and the number of unique armed conflicts: yes. In terms of the spatial extent of conflict zones and, potentially, the number of people and economic activities affected, the answer is not so straightforward. The PRIO Conflict Site data show that there is no direct, linear relationship between the number and severity of conflicts and the total size of the conflict zones, so the widely acknowledged downward trend since the early 1990s is not unequivocal. Interestingly, there is no correlation (0.08) between the size of a conflict zone and the number of battle-related deaths in a conflict-year. Cases like the Naxalite rebellion in India are illustrating for this lack of relationship: in 2005 only 199 battle-related deaths were recorded but since the battle events were not spatially concentrated, the conflict zone covered an area of more than 2,000,000 square kilometers. At the other end of the spectrum is the civil war in Rwanda, with 1,125 battle-related deaths in a conflict zone of about 3,000 square kilometers in 1990.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0738894211433168">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Application: Spatial Characteristics of Separatist and Governmental Conflicts</title>
<p>The conflict-year format of the current version of the PRIO Conflict Site dataset captures the dynamic character of armed conflict, which was not possible in earlier versions. This allows for more nuanced studies in which the temporal aspect is taken into account. This section presents a simple analysis of the dynamics of internal conflicts that serves to demonstrate the applicability of the dataset and point to new directions for future research.</p>
<p>In the first systematic study of the spatial characteristics of civil wars, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0738894211433168">Buhaug and Gates (2002)</xref> argued that separatist conflicts are mainly confined to the areas the rebel groups seek to liberate, whereas conflicts over the central power are more dynamic and cover larger parts of the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0738894211433168">8</xref></sup> Due to the static nature of their conflict data, they were unable to offer empirical evidence to substantiate the claim. With the new PRIO Conflict Site dataset, we may for the first time assess and compare the spatial mobility of armed conflicts of different kinds.</p>
<p>A preliminary test of Buhaug and Gates’s assumption can be carried out using GIS software to visualize the conflict zones across time. The UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset incompatibility variable indicates if a conflict is fought over <italic>territory</italic>, that is, a separatist conflict, or <italic>government</italic>, in which the objective of the rebels is to oust the central government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0738894211433168">Harbom et al., 2009</xref>). A visual inspection of the data gives support to Buhaug and Gates: whereas conflicts over territory are more or less confined to the same geographic area throughout their duration, the data show that conflicts over state power are more dynamic, both in terms of location and scope, and cover larger swathes of territory. As an illustration, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0738894211433168">Figure 6</xref> depicts the separatist conflict in Bangladesh 1989–1992 and the 1999–2002 period of the conflict over state power in Chad. Evidently, the war between the Chittagong Hill Tracts People’s Coordination Association/Peace Force and the Bangladeshi government was only active in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, while the Movement for Democracy and Justice in Chad was more mobile and fought the government in large areas of the northern part of the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0738894211433168">9</xref></sup></p>

<p>The descriptive statistics in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0738894211433168">Table 1</xref> offer a more general demonstration of the observed pattern: the absolute size (measured in thousands of square kilometers) of conflicts over governmental power is on average about three times larger than separatist wars.

<p>As a more comprehensive and satisfactory demonstration of the different dynamics of territorial and governmental conflicts, the article next considers multivariate regression models. For the exploratory purposes of this article, a rigorous theoretical framework is not necessary. Instead, the expectations are formalized directly by means of the following two hypotheses:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>H1</italic>: Conflicts over territory are smaller than conflicts over state power.</p>
<p><italic>H2</italic>: Conflicts over territory are more static than conflicts over state power.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>
<?h-4?>To test these expectations empirically, the conflict-years in the dataset are aggregated to create one observation for each conflict,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0738894211433168">10</xref></sup> which constitutes the unit of analysis. The observations are clustered by country to account for multiple conflicts within one country during the examined time period (1989–2008).</p>
<p>In order to test Hypothesis 1, the measures from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0738894211433168">Table 1</xref> are employed as dependent variables: <italic>absolute size</italic> and <italic>relative size</italic>. Since the conflict-years have been aggregated to one observation, the mean values are used. The principal independent variable is a dummy variable (<italic>territory</italic>) indicating if the incompatibility concerns territory (1) or government (0). Country size in thousands of square kilometers (logged) (<italic>ln country size</italic>) and duration (<italic>duration</italic>), operationalized as a count of active conflict-years since 1989, are included as control variables. By nature, larger countries can harbor larger conflicts, and the country size sets an absolute limit to the size of the conflict zone. Duration should matter since protracted conflicts give insurgents time to spread the rebellion to larger areas. In addition, two of the “usual suspects” in the civil war literature are controlled for: population size in millions (logged) (<italic>ln population</italic>) and GDP per capita, measured in thousands of US dollars current prices purchasing power parity terms (<italic>GDP per capita</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0738894211433168">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results are presented in Models 1–2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0738894211433168">Table 2</xref>) and are in line with the hypothesis. The incompatibility variable is highly significant and has the expected sign, which implies that separatist wars are smaller than conflicts over state power both in relative and absolute terms. As expected, country size and duration have a significant positive effect in Model 1; large countries and protracted wars increase the size of the conflict-affected area. The average conflict over government is about 164,000 square kilometers larger than separatist conflicts, <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>. Interestingly, country size has a reversed effect when regressed on the relative size indicator, suggesting that conflicts tend to cover a larger share of the territory of small countries. A high GDP per capita has a mitigating effect, probably at least partly because strong states are better at curbing internal strife.</p>

<p>Two different operationalizations of conflict dynamics are used to test Hypothesis 2. The dependent variable in Model 3 is the difference in size (in thousands of square kilometers) between the areas of the smallest and the largest conflict zones (<italic>range</italic>) during the course of the conflict. In Model 4, the dependent variable is the distance in kilometers between the two center points lying farthest apart (<italic>mobility</italic>). Since the unit of analysis is conflict, <italic>range</italic> and <italic>mobility</italic> are calculated within each conflict time series. The main explanatory variable (<italic>territory</italic>) and controls remain the same as in Models 1–2.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 2 also gets strong support from the regression analysis: separatist wars are significantly more static in both models, and the difference is quite large. Country size and duration remain highly significant, whereas the effects of GDP per capita and population size are not robust and fluctuate across the models.</p>
<p>In this analysis the measures derived from the dataset are employed as dependent variables. However, spatial measures should also be useful as predictors in conflict analyses, as illustrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0738894211433168">Buhaug et al. (2009)</xref>, who use conflict location to predict civil war duration.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A central tenet in all research is that the choice of unit of observation should reflect the phenomenon being studied. While recent efforts to disaggregate conflicts by location or events have laid the foundation for new and innovative research programs (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0738894211433168">Cederman and Gleditsch, 2009</xref>), these datasets suffer from one of two limitations: lack of a proper temporal dimension or lack of global coverage. The PRIO Conflict Site project alleviates this shortcoming by providing new and better disaggregated data on the location and scope of all armed conflicts in the post-Cold War era.</p>
<p>The simple analysis carried out above demonstrated that valuable new insights can be gained by using these data. A quick glance at the data revealed that the total conflict-affected area has not decreased in a similar manner as the frequency or severity of war, and the data also showed substantial inter-continental differences in conflict size and trends. Furthermore, the analysis found that conflicts over state power are more widespread and dynamic in spatial terms than separatist conflicts. As the civil war scholarship increasingly demand high-resolution conflict data, the PRIO Conflict Site dataset should find much interest and, hopefully, contribute to further advancement of the field.</p>

<p>The UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset defines a conflict as “a contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths”. The variable <italic>location</italic> in the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset merely identifies “the government side of a conflict, and should not be interpreted as the geographical location of the conflict” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0738894211433168">Harbom et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

Map data from the CShapes dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0738894211433168">Weidmann et al., 2010</xref>) were used throughout this article.

<p>The figures show data where the circular conflict polygons have been clipped along national boundaries and coast lines. Since some conflict zones overlap, e.g. intrastate wars in Ethiopia and India, parts of those countries’ territory are counted more than once. However, this is unproblematic for this application, where the purpose is to point out a general trend. Since the conflict-size distribution is heavily skewed towards lower values, the median rather than the mean is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0738894211433168">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

<p>The data on government conflicts in the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset are not dyadic and thus there can be several rebel groups active in a conflict-year. This partly explains why these conflicts are more dynamic and affect larger areas, but a closer investigation reveals that this is also true for conflicts over government with only one active rebel group, as in the example from Chad above. However, due to the unstable nature of rebel groups, an analysis on the dyad-level would not be optimal either. Splits, mergers, name changes, and alliances between groups are common and would cause delimitation problems.</p>

Mean value of population is used, but since GDP per capita is endogenous to the model and therefore likely to change during the course of a conflict, the first value in the time series is used.</p>
