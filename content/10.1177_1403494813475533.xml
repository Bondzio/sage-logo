<p><italic>Background</italic>: Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality among older people. We have studied whether its prevalence can be reduced by a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA). <italic>Study design and setting</italic>: 1000 randomly-selected persons aged ≥75 years were divided into intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 500) and control groups (<italic>n</italic> = 500). We focused on those subjects in whom an orthostatic blood pressure test had been performed at least once during the study period (2004–2007) (<italic>n</italic> = 365 and 332 for intervention and control groups, respectively). A CGA, including evaluation of the adequacy of the medication, was performed annually in the intervention group but not in the control group. We conducted Markov models to study change in the OH profiles and the effect of CGA on it. Competing risk of mortality was modeled as an absorbing state to avoid attrition bias. <italic>Results</italic>: Over 3 years, the prevalence of OH decreased (35.0% → 28.0%) in the intervention group, whereas its prevalence increased in the control group (32.8% → 40.8%). By Markov models it was shown that CGA had a statistically significant effect on recovering from OH. In addition, CGA was shown to protect from developing OH. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: Repeated CGA performed annually can reduce the prevalence of OH.</bold></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Orthostatic hypotension (OH) has a major effect on the life of older individuals in whom its prevalence ranges from 5% to 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813475533">1</xref>]. OH is associated with significant morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813475533">2</xref>]. OH increases the risk of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813475533">3</xref>] which may be detrimental for older people, and the burden of health care system. In addition to demographic and clinical factors, such as old age, smoking, low BMI, hypertension, reduced kidney function, intravascular volume depletion, cardiac pump failure, venous pooling, carotid artery stenosis and carotid artery intima-media thickness, dementia, Parkinson’s disease and other autonomic neuropathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813475533">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813475533">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813475533"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813475533"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813475533"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813475533"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813475533"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813475533">10</xref>], several drugs, such as antihypertensive compounds, α-adrenergic blocking agents, antidepressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813475533">7</xref>] and drugs for Parkinson’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813475533">11</xref>], may evoke OH. Increasing the number of regular medications also increases susceptibility to OH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813475533">12</xref>] which further worsens the situation in older individuals in whom polypharmacy is a problem.</p> <p>Asymptomatic OH is common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813475533">13</xref>], but when symptomatic, its symptoms include lightheadedness, dizziness, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, cognitive impairment, nausea, palpitations, tremors, headache and neck ache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813475533">14</xref>]. Symptoms may also be atypical such as lower extremity discomfort and backache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813475533">15</xref>].</p> <p>A Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a multidimensional, interdisciplinary, diagnostic process to identify care needs, plan care, and improve outcomes of frail older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813475533">16</xref>]. Since drug use among the elderly is high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494813475533">17</xref>], and they are vulnerable to adverse drug reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494813475533">18</xref>], special attention should be paid to medication. Inappropriate prescribing practices take place in older persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813475533">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813475533"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494813475533">21</xref>]. Therefore, an essential part of a CGA is the critical review of the medication. This study aimed to evaluate whether the burden of OH for individual patients and health care system in general can be reduced by optimizing medication use as a part of the CGA. Our secondary aim was to characterize the stability of the presence or absence of OH over 3 years, and to study the time dependency of possible CGA effects.</p>

<sec id="section2-1403494813475533" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study is part of the population-based GeMS study (Geriatric Multidisciplinary Strategy for the Good Care of the Elderly), which has been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813475533">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494813475533">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494813475533">23</xref>]. In brief, a random sample of 1000 persons was drawn from the inhabitants aged ≥75 years of the City of Kuopio, Finland, including mainly home-dwelling but part of the sample were living in institutional care. They were divided into control and intervention groups (<italic>n</italic> = 500/group), and the health status of persons in both groups was monitored annually by a trained nurse during the years 2004–2007. This included blood pressure (BP) measurements, that were performed from the arm at the heart level by trained study nurses using an electronic sphygmomanometer or mercury sphygmomanometer when needed (e.g. in case of atrial fibrillation). Firstly the BP was measured after 10 minutes’ rest in the supine position, after which the measurement was repeated in sitting (at 1 minute) and standing positions (at 1 and 3 minutes).</p>
<p>In addition to health status monitoring by a trained nurse, those in the intervention group underwent CGA. This included an overall health status assessment including medication assessment (where the adequacy of the medication, both in terms of the drugs used and their doses, was reviewed annually and modified when necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494813475533">23</xref>]) by a physician (trainee in geriatrics). These modifications were monitored if needed. The health status assessment took place generally within two weeks after the patient’s visit at the study nurse. In case of OH, the physician attempted to decrease OH by searching for possible medications and other conditions that may provoke OH. The CGA also included nutritional status assessment and mobility, balance and muscle strength assessment conducted by clinical nutritionist and physiotherapist, respectively. Persons in the intervention group also had counselling and case manager services by a trained nurse.</p>
<p>Persons in the control group received no interventions. Standard health care services in public and private sector were available for them.</p>
<p>The flow of the GeMS study subjects is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494813475533">Figure 1</xref>. Those from whom the orthostatic test was conducted at least once during the study period were included into this study (<italic>n</italic> = 697). Most of them were home-dwelling (<italic>n</italic> = 671) at baseline.</p>

<p>Orthostatic hypotension (OH) was defined as a decrease of systolic/diastolic BP ≥ 20/10 mmHg measured 1 or 3 minutes after standing up from a supine position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813475533">14</xref>]. In our previous study (community-dwelling population, <italic>n</italic> = 653), the prevalence of OH at baseline was found to be 34% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813475533">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The list of the drugs associated with OH (referred in this study as causative drugs) was compiled based on the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813475533">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494813475533">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494813475533"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494813475533">26</xref>] and clinical judgment (RH, SH). These include the following (classified by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical system): cardiac therapy (C01), antihypertensives (C02), diuretics (C03), peripheral vasodilators (C04), vasoprotectives (C05), beta-blockers (C07), calcium channel blockers (C08), drugs affecting renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (C09), bromocryptine (G02CB01), sildenafil (G04BE03), tizanidine (M03BX02), opioids (N02A), dopaminergic Parkinson’s disease drugs (N04B), antipsychotics (N05A), tricyclic antidepressants (N06AA) and non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (N06AF).</p>
<sec id="section3-1403494813475533">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Differences between the intervention and the control group and the OH-positive (subjects having OH) and the OH-negative (subjects without OH) group were tested with Pearson chi-square test for categorical variables and with Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables using the SAS software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Abbreviations RR and OR refer to relative risk and odds ratio, respectively. The results are given with 95% confidence interval (CI). Markov models were used to examine stabilities and changes in OH status over time in the intervention and control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494813475533">27</xref>]. Death was modelled as an absorbing state and thus, transition probabilities were adjusted for the competing risk of mortality to avoid attrition bias. First, the manifest Markov model was applied to model changes in observed variables in the two groups when perfect reliability was assumed. Second, the manifest Markov model was extended to latent Markov model (LMM) in order to evaluate a possibility of measurement error. Death was assumed to be measured without measurement error. Finally, covariates were added to the LMM to determine which baseline factors were associated with having the OH.</p>
<p>Goodness-of-fit of the Markov model was evaluated using likelihood ratio chi-square and Pearson chi-square with a non-significant <italic>p</italic>-value (<italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.05) indicating a model to provide a good fit with the data. Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was used to compare the fit of the Markov models (smaller values of BIC represent better fit). Entropy was used to assess the separation of latent classes with values approaching 1 indicating good separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494813475533">28</xref>]. The group effect was assumed to be time-invariant and the effect of intervention was assessed by testing the statistical significance of the difference between two corresponding transition probabilities of the intervention and the control group.</p>
<p>Markov model analyses were performed within a structural equation modelling framework using the Mplus statistical package version 6.12 with the standard MAR missing data method where missing values are not imputed but, instead, parameters and standard errors are estimated with all available data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494813475533">29</xref>].</p>

<title>Medication assessment and OH</title>
<p>At baseline, there were 254 and 208 persons in the intervention and control groups, respectively, using one or more regular causative drugs. The only statistically significant difference between the groups occurred during the first year of the intervention, when there were more decreases of dosage of causative drugs in the intervention group (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.04–2.86). When medication changes were measured against OH status, causative drugs were stopped more often in OH-positive than in OH-negative subjects during the second year of the intervention (OR 2.14, CI 1.15–3.99) in the intervention group. However, during the third year of the intervention, there were more increases of dosage of causative drugs in the OH-positive than in OH-negative subjects (OR 2.15, CI 1.01–4.56) in the intervention group. In the control group, there were less initiations in the OH-positive than in OH-negative patients of causative regular (OR 0.27, CI 0.14–0.53) and as-needed (OR 0.19, CI 0.06–0.67) drugs, respectively, during the first year after baseline. There were no other statistically significant changes between the groups and/or OH status in as-needed causative medication.</p>

<title>Transitions of patients between OH-positive and OH-negative groups</title>
<p>In total, 141 subjects (out of 443 [31.8 %] OH-negative persons at baseline) remained OH- negative (90 and 51 in the intervention and control groups, respectively), and 25 (out of 228 [10.9 %] OH-positive persons at baseline) were OH-positive (10 and 15 in the intervention and control groups, respectively) throughout the study period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494813475533">Table III</xref>). However, the transitions between OH-positive and OH-negative status were frequent.

On the other hand, 241 to 304 and 75 to 85 persons remained in the OH-negative and OH-positive groups in two subsequent measurements (i.e. for 1 year), respectively. Similarly, from 195 to 208 and from 35 to 40 persons remained in the OH-negative and the OH-positive groups for three subsequent measurements (i.e. for 2 years), respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494813475533">Table III</xref>). There were no statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups except in the transitions 2–3 years after baseline, when individuals in the control group were over two times more likely to stay OH positive than subjects in the intervention group (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.36–3.55) and only 0.64 times as likely to stay OH-negative as those in the intervention group (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45–0.90).</p>

<p>In the intervention group, BP was recorded for 267 subjects in every measurement point while for 98 persons at least at one measurement point was missing. In the control group, the corresponding figures were 208 and 124, respectively. Chi-square tests for missing completely at random (MCAR) under the unrestricted latent class indicator model revealed that the missing data adhered to a MCAR mechanism, <italic>X<sub>P</sub><sup>2</sup></italic>(225, <italic>N</italic> = 697) = 167.30 with corresponding <italic>p</italic> = 0.999, <italic>X<sub>LR</sub><sup>2</sup></italic>(225, <italic>N</italic> = 697) = 151.67 with corresponding <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.999.</p>
<p>Based on the estimation results of the stationary manifest Markov model, the stabilities, the probabilities of being in the OH-negative latent class in two consecutive waves, were quite high, 0.75 in the intervention and 0.69 in the control group, whereas the stabilities of being in the OH-positive latent class in two consecutive waves remained lower, 0.41 in the intervention and 0.48 in the control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1403494813475533">Table IV</xref> A). Stationary process implied that persons were transitioning between the latent classes with the same probabilities across all measurement points. We saw that for the intervention group, the transition probabilities to develop the OH were 5.1 percentage points lower, and to recover from OH 7.3 percentage points higher than for the control group in each of the two consecutive waves. Transition probabilities to remain in the OH-positive group were 6.5 percentage points higher and, to remain in the OH-negative group 5.9 percentage points lower in the control group than in the intervention group. All of the above mentioned group differences were statistically significant. The entropy of the manifest model was very good (0.95).</p>

<p>When measurement error was included in the analysis to produce the LMM, the stabilities were higher and transition probabilities for recovering from or developing the OH-positive-status were smaller than in the manifest model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1403494813475533">Table IV</xref> B). Group differences were again statistically significant – for the intervention group, the transition probabilities to develop the OH were 3.9 percentage points lower than for the control group, and the transition probabilities to recover from OH were 10.1 percentage points higher than for the control group in each of the two consecutive waves. Transition probabilities to remain in the OH-positive group were 9.3 percentage points higher and, to remain in the OH-negative group 5.8 percentage points lower in the control group than in the intervention group. The estimated amount of measurement error involved in the measurement of OH outcome was 12%. The entropy of the latent model was 0.77 indicating uncertainty of classification of subjects into latent classes to increase when compared to the manifest model. Altogether, according to BICs, the LMM fitted the data slightly better than the manifest model.</p>
<p>According to univariate LMMs with one baseline covariate at a time for the OH state, the odds of individuals aged 85 years or over having OH in our study was 1.6 times (OR1.59, CI 1.05–2.40) greater than the odds of those aged 75–79 years. Subjects with Parkinson’s disease at baseline were more likely to have OH (OR 3.71, CI 1.17–11.75) during the study period. Having diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, cardiac insufficiency or dementia or use of drugs associated with OH at the baseline were not associated with having OH.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we have shown that the prevalence of OH can be reduced by CGA. However, its effect seems to accumulate during the study period and is first statistically significant after 2–3 years.</p>
<p>The prevalence of OH was statistically significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group 2–3 years after the CGA when the annual prevalences were compared. The intervention increased also an individual’s probability to convert from OH-positive to OH-negative. The probability for the control group to stay in the OH-positive group was twice the probability for the intervention group during the third year of the intervention. Furthermore, it was shown that subjects in the intervention group were 1.6 times more likely to stay OH-negative than individuals in the control group. However, at the individual level, there were many transitions between OH-negative and OH-positive status every year suggesting that OH may be a rather unstable condition. The small group of participants who were OH-positive throughout the study possibly has suffered irreversible damages to their autonomic nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813475533">10</xref>] which may make them immune to attempts to correct their OH.</p>
<p>In our study, older people (≥ 85 years) were more likely to have OH than their younger (75–79 years) counterparts. In addition, persons with Parkinson’s disease at baseline were 3.7 times more likely to have OH than persons without it.</p>
<p>A number of drugs have been shown to cause or to be associated with OH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813475533">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813475533">11</xref>], and a critical revision of these medications may reduce the OH. In our study, OH status did not result as any clear changes in medication prescribing pattern. The study physicians reviewed the medication of the patients in the intervention group as part of the CGA, while no organized medication review was offered to those in the control group. Unfortunately, no clinical data from BP measurements performed shortly after medication modifications were available for this study. However, in the annual time perspective, there was a clear improvement in the OH status of those in the intervention group despite minor changes in their medication. The CGA performed in this study is a multi-disciplinary process and medication assessment was only one part of it. Therefore, it is likely that the beneficial effect seen in the intervention group was mainly a result of the overall improvement of the patient’s status due to the repeated interventions in the multidisciplinary CGA. Appropriate lifestyle changes may be able to prevent OH during treatment of hypertension in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813475533">13</xref>]. The positive effect of the targeted intervention has already been shown on the mobility of the patients in the intervention group of the GeMS study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494813475533">30</xref>], and it is likely that improved nutritional status also contributes to the improvement of overall status.</p>
<p>Our study had some limitations. The number of persons that could not be evaluated for OH was quite high and the subjects included into the study varied from one year to the next. However, by using the Markov models, we were able to use every OH recorded and the included persons did not need to be studied every year. Competing risk of mortality was modelled as an absorbing state in Markov models to avoid attrition bias and thus, we did not have to exclude persons who died. BP recordings were made by trained study nurses instructed to measure BPs accurately, but the recordings were made at different times of the day and under different circumstances. In addition, delayed orthostatic hypotension was not assessed in our study. Furthermore, since BPs were measured only once a year, the results might contain some measurement error. However, this was taken into account by using the LMM.</p>
<p>Some of those who participated in the GeMS study were excluded from the present study because they were not tested for OH, mainly because they were not able to adopt an upright posture required time for BP measurements. Those subjects were generally in poorer condition than those who participated and thus, we cannot exclude selection bias in our study. It is known that the prevalence of OH is higher among frail elderly individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813475533">2</xref>], and most likely this was the case also in our study. Therefore, special attention should be paid also to those individuals who cannot co-operate in the orthostatic tests.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Repeated CGAs decrease the prevalence of OH in elderly subjects, although it may take 2 to 3 years before the effects are clearly seen. The complex nature of annually repeated comprehensive evaluation seems to be important for improving the general status of the subjects.</p>
