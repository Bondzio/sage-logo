<abstract>
<p>Protein-losing enteropathy is a rare manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus. We report the case of an 18-year-old woman that presented initially with diarrhoea and anasarca. During evaluation, there was low serum albumin of 1.6 g/dl (3.5–5.2 g/dl) and a positive antinuclear antibody test (1:2560). Anti-Sm antibodies (ELISA) were positive in addition to low serum C3 of 35 mg/dl. A scintigraphy using 99mTc-labelled albumin was positive for abdominal protein loss. A diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus related protein-losing enteropathy was made. She was started on prednisolone 40 mg/day without amelioration; a month later, azathioprine (100 mg/day) was added, leading to normalization of serum albumin and resolution of symptoms within 4 months. After 1.5 years, the patient developed a 2.9 g 24-h proteinuria while still in remission of the protein-losing enteropathy, receiving 5 mg prednisone and 100 mg azathioprine daily.</p>

<p>Protein-losing enteropathy causes hypoalbuminaemia and oedema due to excessive loss of plasma proteins through the gastrointestinal system. It can occur in a rather extensive list of diverse entities that includes tuberculosis, intestinal lymphoma, constrictive pericarditis, Crohn's disease, primary lymphangiectasia, and Whipple's disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203311425523">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although considered a rare event, there are reports of protein-losing enteropathy in patients affected by the so-called connective tissue diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203311425523">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203311425523">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>We report a patient with protein-losing enteropathy related to SLE, whose response to immunosuppressive treatment was satisfactory.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203311425523" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>An 18-year-old woman presented with lower limb oedema, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea that started 8 months prior to admission, followed 6 months later by ascites, generalized malaise, anorexia, and fever, coupled to 13 kg weight loss (20% of her usual weight). An abdominal ultrasound exam was normal except for ascites. After several unsuccessful paracentesis for symptomatic relief, she was then referred to our service in January 2009. She had no relevant personal or family antecedents. Her physical examination was normal except that she was pale and had anasarca.</p>
<p>Laboratory investigations revealed haemoglobin = 9.07 g/dl, leukocytes = 5.840/mm<sup>3</sup>, lymphocytes = 2.270/mm<sup>3</sup>, platelets: 651,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, and serum albumin = 1.6 g/dl (3.5–5.2 g/dl). Creatinine, aminotransferases, amylase, lipase and thyroid function tests were normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) = 4 mm/h, complement C3 = 35 mg/dl (90–180 mg/dl), and complement C4 = 22 mg/dl (10–40 mg/dl). Serologies for HIV, type B and C hepatitis were negative. Urinalysis revealed no abnormalities and 24-h proteinuria was 100.4 mg. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) using indirect immunofluorescence were present (nuclear; 1:2560), with speckled pattern as well as anti-Sm antibodies exceeding 200 RU/ml (positive &gt; 20 RU/ml, ELISA/Euroimmun, Germany). Anti-DNA, anti-Ro, anti-La, and anti-RNP antibodies were negative. A faecal fat study (SUDAM III) and anti-transglutaminase antibody tests were negative.</p>
<p>Analysis of the ascitic fluid revealed normal cellularity, negative culture for pyogenic bacteria and neoplastic cells absence in two samples. Serum–ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) was 1.1 g/dl that does not allow discriminating ascites caused by portal hypertension or peritoneal disease.</p>
<p>Imaging analysis of whole abdomen and pelvis using ultrasound and CT scanning were normal, except for ascites. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed mild pericardial effusion. Both upper endoscopy and colonoscopy were normal; histopathology of a duodenal biopsy showed chronic non-specific duodenitis.</p>
<p>A 99mTc-labelled albumin scintigraphy was positive for intestinal protein loss, being most relevant at the mesogastrium, suggesting the small intestine as the affected region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203311425523">Figure 1</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-0961203311425523" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Technetium 99 m (99mTc)-labelled albumin scintigraphy positive for intestinal protein loss in mid-abdomen. Suspected area: jejunum or ileum.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0961203311425523-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>A diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy secondary to SLE was made, and the patient was started on prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) in February 2009; although the diarrhoea subsided in 25 days, she remained in anasarca. Azathioprine was added to the regimen in March 2009, starting with 50 mg/day, rising to 100 mg/day within a month, leading to resolution of the anasarca in 2 months while we noticed photosensitivity and development of a malarrash. On July 2009 her serum albumin was 3.5 g/dl (3.5–5.2 g/dl) and her haemoglobin value rose to 10.2 g/dl; serum C3 levels remained low. Prednisolone was gradually decreased as the dose of azathioprine was maintained. She remained asymptomatic with no biochemical abnormalities until December 2010 when a 24-h proteinuria of 2.9 g was detected. Serum creatinine remained stable at 0.5 mg/dl and urinalysis revealed no haematuria or cellular casts. Laboratory investigations alsorevealed haemoglobin = 12.2 g/dl, leukocytes = 2950/mm<sup>3</sup> and serum C3 = 40 mg/dl. A kidney biopsy was performed. Observation after haematoxylin–eosin staining revealed five diffusely sclerotic glomeruli among 25 glomeruli in the sample. There was no hypercellularity and the glomerular basement membrane appeared normal except for mild degenerative abnormalities of podocytes. Indirect immunofluorescence was negative forcomplement and immunoglobulin deposition. In conclusion, the sample was not compatible with a diagnosis of classical lupus glomerulonephritis, andthe possibility of lupus podocytopathy was raised. The patient refused to be subjected to another sampling, as we informed her that this would not affect her treatment or outcome at this time. She is currently on azathioprine (100 mg daily), remaining asymptomatic with normal physical examination and serum albumin (3.6 g/dl).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0961203311425523" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Causes of hypoalbuminaemia usually include inadequate protein intake, decreased synthesis or external losses. This patient had no previous history of malnutrition in addition to displaying no alterations of both liver and renal function in her clinical evaluation. Therefore, the possibility of protein-losing enteropathy was raised.</p>
<p>The diagnostic approach to protein-losing enteropathy includes faecal α1-antitrypsin determination and/or 99mTc-labelled albumin scintigraphy, the latter being the most widely used. In this technique, albumin labelled with the radioisotope (99mTc) isendovenously infused, then its distribution is mapped out at certain time intervals, and albumin effusion into intestinal lumen can be detected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203311425523">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203311425523">10</xref></sup> The possibility of locating the site of effusion combined with higher sensitivity and specificity makes this test superior to faecal α1-antitrypsin determination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203311425523">5</xref></sup> Other diagnostic approaches such as gastroenteroscopy-driven biopsy as well as capsule endoscopy do not add to diagnosis. Usually, these lesions are inaccessible and the histological appearance lacks specificity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311425523">6</xref></sup> The diagnostic value of magnetic resonance enterography has not been evaluated, and a very recent study proving 99mTc scintigraphy to be superior to α1-antitrypsin determination in diagnosing protein-losing enteropathy has further substantiated the current validity of the method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203311425523">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>This 18-year-old woman tested positive for antinuclear antibodies, including anti-Sm antibodies, associated with low complement levels. Therefore, although she initially did not fulfil the American College of Rheumatism (ACR) criteria for SLE, an immune-mediated mechanism was considered as being operative to explain her clinical picture. This prompted the institution of immunosuppressive therapy starting with steroids followed by the addition of azathioprine. Remarkably, she developed a lupus malar rash and photosensitivity while still on medication, rendering the lupus diagnosis more probable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203311425523">11</xref></sup> The exclusion of other causes such as constrictive pericarditis, intestinal lymphoma, Crohn's disease, Whipple's disease, intestinal tuberculosis, or retroperitoneal tumours adds support to the diagnosis of SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203311425523">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most reported cases present protein-losing enteropathy as an early manifestation of SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203311425523">5</xref></sup> Northcott et al. described a similar case displaying antinuclear antibody and anti-DNA antibody seropositivity, which they attributed to SLE, despite not fulfilling the ACR criteria. The response to prednisone and azathioprine was also favourable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203311425523">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pathophysiology of protein-losing enteropathy in lupus remains to be determined. In a few cases, non-necrotizing vasculitis involving mesenteric vessels was reported and proposed as a possible pathogenetic mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203311425523">2</xref></sup> In our patient, a duodenal biopsy demonstrated no evidence of vasculitis. Although we cannot rule out the existence of other lesions in the jejunum, the possibility that such lesions would add to diagnosis is unlikely, since most are non-specific at histology. Increased microvascular permeability allowing leakage of protein fluid into the intestinal lumen, secondary to the release of inflammatory cytokines, has also been proposed as a causative mechanism that could also lead to lymphatic overflow and subsequent dilatation, as reported in some intestinal biopsies in such cases.</p>
<p>Yazici et al. found decreased serum complement levels in 13 out of 30 of reported patients with protein-losing enteropathy attributed to SLE, leading them to suggest complement activation provoking increased vasopermeability as a causative mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203311425523">9</xref></sup> Similarly, the presence of low serum C3 levels in our patient adds circumstantial support to this possibility.</p>
<p>Usually, a good therapeutic response to high-dose steroids in the reported protein-losing enteropathy cases in SLE patients is achieved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203311425523">2</xref></sup> Mok et al. treated 16 patients with corticosteroids 1 mg/kg/day and azathioprine 2 mg/kg/day combination as primary therapy. After 6 months of treatment, 14 patients were in complete remission, one in partial remission and one patient was refractory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203311425523">4</xref></sup> In cases refractory to this regimen, cyclophosphamide has been shown to provide control of this manifestation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203311425523">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, after our patient developed a 2.9 g 24-h proteinuria, and analysis of kidney biopsy on light microscopy and immunofluorescence revealed no classical lupus glomerulonephritis, we could not obtain another biopsy specimen for electron microscopy analysis in order to confirm a possible diagnosis of lupus podocytopathy. This entity is increasingly been recognized,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203311425523">12</xref></sup> and we would be the first, as far as we know, to describe its association with protein-losing enteropathy. Thus, we may only speculate that a common pathogenetic mechanism may be involved in SLE patients with protein-losing enteropathy and concomitant podocytopathy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we call attention to the possibility of immune-mediated protein-losing enteropathy as a manifestation of a SLE patient with hypoalbuminaemia after exclusion of the most common renal causes.</p></sec>
