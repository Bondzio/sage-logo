<p>Not long after WikiLeaks published thousands of confidential US diplomatic cables, the Al Jazeera network released hundreds of leaked classified internal documents related to the failed Palestinian–Israeli negotiations. The publication of what came to be known as the ‘Palestine Papers’ was an unusual scoop, which thrust Al Jazeera once more into the world’s attention, highlighted the potential of Arab media to shape regional politics, rekindled the debate over the Middle East conflict, and raised questions about the future of the fitful peace process. Although the revelations stemming from the negotiations documents attracted wide media attention, the broader significance of these ‘Arabian WikiLeaks’ has not been fully analyzed. The timing of the leaks precluded a continuous interest in the story and its implications. The coverage of the released Papers was overshadowed by prior events—the referendum which culminated in the independence of Southern Sudan and the street protests in Tunisia which put an end to President Ben Ali’s authoritarian rule—and eclipsed by subsequent developments—the eruption of mass demonstrations which led to the fall of Mubarak’s entrenched regime in Egypt and injected a revolutionary momentum in Libya, Yemen, Syria, Bahrain and beyond. The Palestine Papers are of renewed interest not only because they provide rare insights into the negotiations to end an intractable conflict and contain important revelations about the dispositions of the Palestinians and their willingness to show flexibility, but also because they offer a glimpse into the complex interpenetration between media, geo-politics and state interests in a conflict-ridden region which is geared for change. While situating the subtle affinity between Al Jazeera and its sponsor’s foreign policy within the context of regional rivalries and strategic alliances, the case under investigation sheds light on new trends that are redefining the nature of journalism in the post-WikiLeaks era.</p>
<sec id="section1-1750635212469910">
<title>Al Jazeera and the reinvention of Arab politics</title>
<p>The rise of Al Jazeera from an obscure Arabic-language channel in a small country on the Persian Gulf to a multi-lingual, multi-channel, multi-platform, multi-site network with a global reach is phenomenal. Key to Al Jazeera’s prowess is its ability to reconfigure the dynamics of the political sphere in the Arab world through uncensored news, intrepid reporting, daring commentary, open debate and candid talk. Al Jazeera’s keenness for addressing such taboo topics as authoritarianism, political reform, human rights records, police torture, political Islam and sectarian divisions in the Arab world has turned the network into an agent of change and branded it as a potent political player. Its determination to challenge the status quo is matched only by the Arab official apathy for change in a region that stands out for its distinctly non-participatory political culture. For decades, authoritarianism has been rampant throughout much of the Arab world, incumbent regimes seemingly immutable, political parties weak, dissident voices silenced, civil society undeveloped and public opinion irrelevant. At a time when state media grew to be an ideological state apparatus at the service of the regimes in power, Al Jazeera aligned itself with the Arab street. During times of crisis, this alignment earned it rebuke from those who perceived it as inciting the masses.</p>
<p>Within this context, no other issue resonates deeper with Arabs than the Palestinian question. As the most important political preoccupation for Arabs for decades, the Palestinian question has been and continues to be a cause for Arabs and ‘the prism through which all other issues are perceived and understood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1750635212469910">Ross, 2002</xref>). More than any other outlet, Al Jazeera has capitalized on the importance of the Palestinian question, bringing to millions of Arab viewers a grim account of the daily sufferings of the Palestinians. Not only did the network’s intense coverage of the second intifada play an important role in propelling the Palestinian question into the Arab public consciousness, but it has also helped revive and drive a new pan-Arab current of public opinion. The continued violence, the stalled peace process, the rifts among the Palestinian factions, the official Arab lethargy, and the international paralysis—all these considerations helped Al Jazeera ‘claim’ the Palestinian question media-wise and otherwise, further aligning itself with the Arab street.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1750635212469910">
<title>An unprecedented leak and an unusual scoop</title>
<p>In 2010, Al Jazeera came into possession of a massive number of classified Palestinian documents pertaining to the negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis as part of a peace process dating back to the 1991 Madrid Conference and leading to the Oslo Agreements, the end goal of which was to reach a lasting settlement within the framework of a two-state solution. While the documents cover years of mediated and direct talks, a substantial number of them detail meetings held shortly after the 2007 Annapolis Conference between top diplomats from the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli government of the then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. These voluminous documents consist of verbatim transcripts, minutes, memos, correspondences, reports, studies, strategy papers, emails, notes, draft agreements and maps detailing US-mediated talks between the Palestinian negotiating team, headed by former Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei and Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat, and the Israeli team, led by former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni. The leaked materials, which originated in the Palestinian Authority Negotiations Support Unit, provide intimate details about the negotiating room, the negotiators’ predispositions, and the negotiations’ dynamics.</p>
<p>Whether considered a political event or a media scoop, the publication of some 1684 sensitive documents from an Arab source by an Arab media outlet was a significant tour de force of its kind in Middle Eastern media politics. To deal with the acquired materials, Al Jazeera set up a small in-house team—and later established a Transparency Unit. The task at hand was to study the documents, determine their authenticity and decide how to proceed with them. For months, the team dug into a mountain of files, only to realize that what they had in their possession went beyond a single person, unit or media organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1750635212469910">Swisher, 2011</xref>). And so Al Jazeera deemed it necessary to seek the assistance of independent experts. To avoid accusations of taking statements out of context or tampering with the Papers, the network decided to make the entire documents available on its website for readers to draw their conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1750635212469910">Qurashy, 2011</xref>). It also made these ‘special revelations’ a top agenda item on its primetime Arabic and English news over four consecutive nights (starting on 23 January 2011), devoted extensive airtime to present them, and brought in expert commentators to discuss their political implications.</p>
<p>To ensure wider circulation and availability of the documents, the network decided to share them with the British daily newspaper, <italic>The Guardian.</italic> The latter cooperated with Al Jazeera in terms of document selection and timeline for publication, but retained full editorial control of its coverage. Once on board, <italic>The Guardian</italic> independently authenticated the documents, relying on input from former participants in the negotiations and intelligence sources before it started releasing them in small installments. <italic>The Guardian</italic>’s coverage was further substantiated with relevant diplomatic cables from the US diplomatic mission in Israel, which were previously published by WikiLeaks. As expected, the release of the Papers drew considerable attention and the revelations were followed at first hand both in the Arab world and internationally. For a few days, Al Jazeera dominated the news agenda on this issue, so much so that CNN and other major TV outlets covered the story with Al Jazeera as their lead.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1750635212469910">
<title>Key revelations</title>
<p>The leaked materials were arranged thematically into four main issues: the Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and the status of the Al Haram Al Shareef (Temple Mount in the old city of Jerusalem); the refugees and the right to return; the UN-mandated Goldstone report; and security cooperation with Israel. Overall, the documents expose a number of controversial dispositions and dealings, which went against the Palestinian popular and political consensus on some core issues. They reveal a great deal about concessions, some of which were made for the first time, and highlight the weakness of the Palestinian negotiators during their meetings with the Israelis, especially during the pre- and post-Annapolis peace talks.</p>
<p>Many of the documents and exchanges focused on how to deal with Gaza and how to keep Hamas out of the equation. The Papers revealed the negotiators’ apparent exasperation that not enough had been done to maintain the siege on the Hamas-controlled Gaza. Equally significant are the revelations about the covert cooperation between the Israeli security forces and the Palestinian Authority against Hamas as well as the close cooperation between the US and Israeli governments and the Mubarak regime, whose control over the Rafah border crossing turned it into an instrument of collective punishment in the eyes of the besieged Gazans. Finally, the Papers reveal that President Abbas had a foreknowledge that Israel was going to launch an attack on Gaza in December 2008 and that he gave in to pressure to defer the vote of the United Nations Human Rights Council on the Goldstone Report to allow for a favorable atmosphere for reviving and resuming the peace negotiations—a move which was perceived as having deprived the Palestinian victims of a rare legal and diplomatic victory.</p>
<p>The Papers also showed an unusual resignation on the part of the Palestinian team when it came to the Israeli annexation of illegal settlements in East Jerusalem and a willingness to swap parts of the Arab quarter of Sheikh Jarrah for land elsewhere. The records point to a move from what has always been a principled position on Islam’s third holiest site and a willingness to cede sovereignty over the Al Haram Al Shareef, the oversight of which would be placed in the hands of an international joint committee. Significantly, sovereignty over the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa Mosque was one of the issues which contributed to the breakdown of the Camp David talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Finally, the leaked documents reveal a deviation from the position the Palestinians had over the sensitive issue of the right of return to those displaced by the 1948 war and their descendants. The private agreement was to settle for 10,000 Palestinians a year for 10 years out of an estimated 5 million refugees in the diaspora. There was also an apparent willingness to give in to the Israeli demand to define Israel as a Jewish state, which would also entail the transfer of a number of Arab Israelis into the envisaged Palestinian state in return for Jewish settlements in the West Bank.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1750635212469910">
<title>Popular expectations and official reactions</title>
<p>Going public with the Palestine Papers caused a big controversy and generated disparate reactions. While some described the Palestinian negotiators’ positions as unprincipled and harmful to the peace process, others viewed them as a necessary pragmatism and downplayed their effect. Regardless of the reactions, what emerged from some of the documents was sobering. The Papers highlighted the disadvantaged position of the Palestinians in the negotiations, making major and unprecedented demographic and territorial concessions. The other issue was double talk, as the Palestinian Authority seemed to be doing in private what it denied in public, adopting a tougher stance in their public declarations than in the negotiations.</p>
<p>Embarrassed by these revelations, the Palestinian Authority reacted furiously to the leaks, questioning their motives and timing. While President Abbas contented himself with the statement that the Arab League had been fully briefed about the negotiations, his team condemned the publication of the documents in the strongest terms. Criticizing Al Jazeera for not consulting with his office and verifying the authenticity of the Papers prior to their publication, Erekat described the leaks as deceptions, lies and half-truths. He also rejected allegations that there were ‘back door dealings’, denied having made concessions and insisted that the negotiation documents were non-binding and that ‘nothing is agreed until everything is agreed’, pointing out that any final agreement would have to be submitted to and approved by the people in a national referendum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750635212469910">Black, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750635212469910">Erekat, 2011</xref>). On Al Jazeera, Erekat made a frenzied appearance, accusing the network and Qatar of instigating a fraudulent and vicious disinformation campaign aimed at overthrowing the Palestinian authority, and vowing to sue the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750635212469910">Mansour, 2011</xref>). Erekat’s reaction was part of a larger counter-campaign mounted by the reeling Palestinian Authority against Al Jazeera. In the West Bank, there were anti-Al Jazeera demonstrations by angry Palestinian protesters. As expected, Al Jazeera became a target; while Fatah announced that it was boycotting Al Jazeera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750635212469910">Anon, 2011c</xref>), the network’s bureau in Ramallah came under attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750635212469910">Bronner, 2011</xref>) and access to Al Jazeera’s Transparency Unit site was reportedly blocked by the Palestinian Telecommunication Group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750635212469910">Al-Shagra, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>For many Palestinians, though, the revelations about the concessions the Palestinian Authority made on their behalf and in their name were stunning. Among many people, a feeling of betrayal prevailed. Although much of the material in the leaks was not substantially new, the extent and scope of the concessions the Palestinian team was ready to make were sobering. The leaked information, which portrays the Palestinian Authority as a collaborator with Israel, struck at the heart of the Palestinian national pride and sense of dignity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750635212469910">Freedland, 2011</xref>). In the Gaza Strip, people took to the street to express anger and frustration over what was widely perceived as the Palestinian Authority’s betrayal of its people. The disapproving reaction to the Palestinian Authority’s conduct extended to Palestinians in the diaspora. In London, a group of Palestinian students took over the office of the Palestinian Ambassador to Britain, holding a peaceful sit-in to protest against the handling of the negotiations; they called for elections and demanded a ‘more inclusive political process that reflects and engages all Palestinians’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1750635212469910">Jones, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The disclosures were also not without political effect. They initially led to the resignation of the chief Palestinian negotiator and the disbandment of the Palestinian legal and political advisers. Rather than discrediting the individual negotiators, the publication of the Papers put into question the very legitimacy of the negotiators and the extent to which they can represent the demands of the Palestinians. The Papers also gave more weight to Hamas’s opposition to Fatah’s strategic choice of negotiations and more credence to the view that the negotiations may not be in the best of the national interest. Although the release of the Papers did not bring down Abbas’s government, it did affect the credibility of the Palestinian leadership and the standing of Fatah. Significantly, the revelations were a reminder of the irregular political situation as Abbas continued to hold on to the presidency for years even though his mandate came to an end in 2009. Not surprisingly, a few weeks after the release of the Papers, the Palestinian Authority announced that it wanted to hold presidential and legislative elections before September 2011—a measure which failed to materialize. Still, the revolutionary mindset in many an Arab country made regime change, accountability, and good governance an insistent homegrown popular demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750635212469910">Hijab, 2011</xref>). With the spread of unrest in the region, there were public demands for the end of divisions within the Palestinian political scene and a number of demonstrations took place, expressing people’s longing for a reconciliation of the feuding factions. It is also within this context that one can read the Palestinian Authority’s attempt to seek reconciliation with Hamas, its eventual signing of the Doha pact to form a unity government, and its decision to take the issue of statehood to the UN.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1750635212469910">
<title>The uncertain path to peace</title>
<p>The international reaction to the release of the Palestine Papers is also noteworthy. The Europeans and Americans deemed them harmful to the peace process. While expressing skepticism about their veracity, the US State Department lamented that the release of the Papers would make the situation more difficult, but undermined their effect on the overall objective of attaining peace, reiterating the US belief that a framework agreement was both possible and necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1750635212469910">Mozgovaya, 2011</xref>). The quartet’s Middle East envoy, Tony Blair, criticized the release of the documents as ‘destabilizing’ and characterized Al Jazeera’s intentions as ‘extremely damaging’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1750635212469910">Sparrow, 2011</xref>). Likewise, <italic>The New York Times</italic> columnist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750635212469910">Thomas Friedman (2011)</xref> condemned the release of the Papers, describing Al Jazeera’s actions as a ‘nasty job’. The Israeli newspapers also joined in the criticism. In a <italic>Jerusalem Post</italic> piece, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1750635212469910">Barry Rubin (2011)</xref> deemed the Papers to be detrimental to the peace process considering that no Palestinian leader would dare make the smallest concession, which would constitute a triumph of the radicals over the moderates.</p>
<p>Embarrassing as they may be, the released documents are not without a positive outcome. They reveal a reality at odds with the prevailing perception about the Palestinians’ (un)willingness to sit round the negotiating table. What the Papers suggest is that the claims that Israel had no partner it could negotiate with, and that the Palestinians were not serious about peace and did not want to reach an agreement are far from true. The willingness of the Palestinian delegation to cross what have always been considered red lines was matched only by the confident firmness of the Israelis who come off as tough negotiators. If anything, the revelations in the published documents raise questions about what it would take for Israel to make a deal with the Palestinians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750635212469910">Middle East Policy Council, 2011</xref>). The documents also reveal an ‘often dismissive attitude of US politicians towards Palestinian representatives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750635212469910">Milne and Black, 2011</xref>) and raise questions about the United States’ ability to be an independent arbitrator of the Palestinian–Israeli conflict and an even-handed peace broker.</p>
<p>More broadly, the partiality of the US mediators and the unyielding position of the Israeli negotiators raise questions as to whether peace is really achievable. The fact that the Palestinians have been losing ground both on the ground and on the negotiating table in ways which risk invalidating the two-state solution highlights the very problematic nature of the US-led peace process the Palestinians and Israelis have engaged in since the Oslo Accords. For Hanan Ashrawi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750635212469910">Anon, 2011b</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>There has not been a [peace] process. There have been sporadic attempts by the Americans to replace substance and objectives with negotiations, as though that was the end. We said no to that; either you make Israel comply to the freeze and stop all settlements and you articulate the objectives and the terms of reference [of the negotiations] within a specific time frame, or there is no use in entering into an endless process which Israel exploits in order to create facts on the ground and to annex East Jerusalem.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Frustration with the fruitlessness of the negotiations and the bleak prospects for a just peace is widely shared among Palestinians. For the author of <italic>There Will Be No Palestinian State</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750635212469910">Clot, 2011</xref>), the negotiations have done little more than enhance the plight and desperation of the Palestinian people:
<disp-quote>
<p>The ‘peace negotiations’ were a deceptive farce, whereby biased terms were unilaterally imposed by Israel and systematically endorsed by the US and EU capitals. Far from enabling a negotiated fair end to the conflict, the pursuit of the Oslo process has deepened Israeli segregationist policies and justified the tightening of the security control imposed on the Palestinian population as well as its geographical fragmentation. Far from preserving the land on which to build a State, it has tolerated the intensification of the colonization of the Palestinian territory.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Significantly, the author of these statements, Ziyad Clot, is the very source of the leaked documents. Clot, a French lawyer of Palestinian descent, served as an adviser to the Palestinian negotiating team in 2008, in charge of the refugee file. He was part of an elite group of Western educated lawyers and experts who made up the Negotiations Support Unit, but who gradually found themselves at odds with the old guards in the Palestinian Authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750635212469910">Al-Lawati, 2011</xref>). Growing disillusionment with the peace process, combined with resentment over the 2008 war on Gaza, led Clot to resign his position. In an article published on Al Jazeera’s website, he explains what prompted him to be a whistleblower:
<disp-quote>
<p>After I resigned, I believed I had a duty to inform the public of the most alarming developments of the Israeli–Palestinian talks. These talks were unfair, misleading and became unsustainable. Tragically, the Palestinians were left uninformed of the fate of their individual and collective rights in the negotiations and their divided political leaderships were not held accountable for their decisions or inaction … Today, I am relieved that this first-hand information is available to the Palestinian people. Palestinian rights are back in their holders’ possession and the people are now in a position to make enlightened decisions about the future of their struggle. I am also glad that international stakeholders to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict can access these documents. The world can no longer overlook that while Palestinians’ strong commitment to peace is genuine, the fruitless pursuit of the ‘peace process’ framed according to the exclusive conditions of the occupying power leads to disastrous compromises which would be unacceptable in any other region.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1750635212469910">
<title>What’s in it for Al Jazeera?</title>
<p>Interestingly, Clot’s remarks echo a similar statement by Al Jazeera’s General Manager that ‘the fate of the Middle East can no longer be decided behind closed doors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750635212469910">Khanfar, 2011</xref>). Not surprisingly, what compelled Clot to blow the whistle and to go public with the Papers—having access to important secret documents, breaking the control over information, and promoting transparency and accountability—is also what avowedly prompted Al Jazeera to release the Papers, to give them extensive media attention, and to establish a Transparency Unit to solicit these types of leaks. Al Jazeera’s proclaimed goal was to ‘instigate a broader conversation on such issues as whether a two-state endgame is achievable and desirable and whether international and US-led processes to reach that goal have only deepened Israeli occupation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750635212469910">Anon, 2011e</xref>). On Al Jazeera’s airwaves and beyond, the leaks thrust a number of questions to the fore and refueled an old debate about the fruitfulness of the negotiations and the prospects for peace.</p>
<p>Taken at face value, the airing of the Palestine Papers seems to be a variation of Al Jazeera’s modus operandi—getting scoops, acquiring tapes, conducting exclusive interviews, pursuing alternative journalism, etc. And in a way, these ad hoc moments have been a source of strength for a network that thrives on controversial issues, crises, debacles and wars. If we consider the Palestine Papers from the perspective of ‘the culture of Al Jazeera’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1750635212469910">Zayani and Sahraoui, 2007</xref>), the network has always adopted an aggressive reporting style and developed an interest in investigative journalism; add to that, Al Jazeera’s anti-establishment culture, its popular appeal and its advocacy brand. Equally important is the consciousness about the role some Arab journalists see themselves playing, whether it be ‘active agents’ and ‘cultural intermediaries’ who articulate and connect the production and consumption of news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750635212469910">Mellor, 2008</xref>) or ‘border guards of a new imagined pan-Arab nation’ and advocates of social and political change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1750635212469910">Pintak, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>For a network that prides itself on being ‘the first to break the freedom of information taboo’ in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750635212469910">Khanfar, 2011</xref>), the release of the Palestine Papers should come as no surprise. What is noteworthy, though, is the confluence between Al Jazeera’s pursuits and an emerging ‘modern transparency movement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1750635212469910">Sifry, 2011</xref>). The network joins a new breed of whistleblowing anti-secrecy sites that have sprung up, the most famous and most controversial being WikiLeaks. As conceived by its controversial founder Julian Assange, WikiLeaks is a stateless digital platform dedicated to bringing information into the public domain. Operating outside a geographical base and beholden to no country’s laws, it has a diffuse nature which proved to be hard to censor. As a hybrid concept which combines hactivism with aspects of traditional investigative journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750635212469910">Beckett and Ball, 2012</xref>: 3), WikiLeaks is redefining the conventional relation between media, publics and politics. By putting massive unauthorized information into the hands of people, WikiLeaks has reawakened the debate on the right to know and access information, the need to make the public privy to what happens behind closed doors, and the importance of pushing for counter-censorship action.</p>
<p>Only a few weeks before the release of the Palestine Papers, WikiLeaks made public a deluge of classified US diplomatic cables while entering into an agreement with major Western newspapers to release the documents, thus acquiring access to mass audiences. In a ‘WikiLeakiesque’ move, Al Jazeera launched a Transparency Unit and set up a secure terminal to solicit these types of leaks, vowing to protect the identity of its sources. The submitted leaks are encrypted during their transmission, and then stored in secure servers, which are accessible only to the journalists associated with the Transparency Unit. For the network, the ostensible aim of this initiative is to mobilize its audience to submit all forms of content for editorial review; through this initiative, the network sought to help its supporters shed light on underreported government and corporate activities.</p>
<p>As in the case of WikiLeaks, internet-induced anonymity is helping Al Jazeera push for a new kind of journalism—one in which information is provided directly to the public and in which the source of the information is less important than the information itself. What distinguishes Al Jazeera’s initiative from that of WikiLeaks though is the kind of verification, authentication and vetting that the leaked documents go through before publication:
<disp-quote>
<p>From human rights to poverty to official corruption, the Al Jazeera Transparency Unit will fairly evaluate and pursue all leads and content submitted … All submitted content is subjected to a rigorous vetting and authentication process that encompasses respect for individual privacy, contextualization, and fierce adherence to our tradecraft commitment of ‘journalism of depth’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750635212469910">Al Jazeera Transparency Unit, 2011</xref>)</p>

<p>And so Al Jazeera started to reach out for content from people, establishing a system whereby leaked information can be directly funneled to its Transparency Unit, where it undergoes rigorous vetting before it is released to the public. While this function ends up being ‘more an advanced citizen journalism news gathering exercise than an open whistleblowing platform’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750635212469910">Beckett and Ball, 2012</xref>: 128), such an initiative is nonetheless symptomatic of a new journalistic mindset. So attractive was Al Jazeera’s initiative that established mainstream news organizations like <italic>The Wall Street Journal</italic> set up a security drop box for submitting sensitive material which is then vetted and put in the public domain, while <italic>The New York Times</italic> has been considering setting up a similar in-house service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750635212469910">Khatchadourian, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>All this is happening at an interesting juncture in the history of the network. If the first decade of Al Jazeera’s existence was marked by its phenomenal rise from a small and obscure news channel to a powerhouse, the second decade of its existence is marked by its expansion from an Arabic-language channel to an international network with an established brand and a global reach. The developments the Arab world is witnessing have set Al Jazeera on a non-linear evolutionary trajectory, and the network has proven amenable to adopting and adapting new and alternative journalistic practices. From the early launch of its widely visited Arabic - and English-language news websites, with live streams to the creation of a supporting New Media Division that can help the network appropriate the potential of emerging media technologies, to the more recent introduction of <italic>Sharek</italic>, a citizen media function designed to solicit videos and pictures from eyewitnesses, Al Jazeera stands out for its strong online presence and its disposition to integrate a wide range of digital platforms in ways that promote a culture of connectivity, interactivity and engagement. Over the past decade, this strategy served it well, ultimately becoming a source of strength and creativity. Al Jazeera’s appropriation of new and social media during the tumultuous events that marked the Arab Spring is a pointed manifestation of this innovative spirit. While in line with the network’s style of journalism, the Transparency Unit initiative is also in synch with the political role it acquired. Much like the subsequent 9-month investigation of Al Jazeera’s Transparency Unit into what caused the mysterious death of Yasser Arafat, which revealed unusually high levels of polonium in his belongings and compelled the Arab League to call for an international inquiry, the Palestine Papers are a poignant reminder of the intricate political nature of Al Jazeera.</p>

<title>Media politics and state interests</title>
<p>When considering the Palestine Papers, it is hard to distinguish their media effect from their political dimension. The Qatari network has been closely associated with the Palestinian–Israeli conflict. Since its inception, it has pursued media normalization with Israel, positioning itself as a political force—even a <italic>de facto negotiator</italic> in the absence of an official Arab will to act—while at the same time shedding an unpleasant light on the Israeli occupation. Not surprisingly, the documents contain unflattering references to Al Jazeera, disapproving remarks about its editorial line and critical comments on its political agenda. As expected, when the documents were released, Al Jazeera was instantly pronounced as ‘the enemy’ and criticized for taking a hostile stand toward the Palestinian Authority. While Al Jazeera maintains that it ‘adheres to the highest editorial standards and offers viewers impartial, balanced and in-depth coverage of events’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750635212469910">Anon, 2011d</xref>), insisting that its decision to publish the Papers was made on professional grounds with the intention ‘to inform’ and not ‘to harm’, there is a wide perception that this was also a political decision as it is hard to disengage Al Jazeera from its Qatari sponsor. Some observers and analysts singled out Al Jazeera as an ‘obstacle’ to reaching an agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis, pointing out that ‘the path to Middle East peace [seems to] stop in Doha’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750635212469910">Bonsey and Koogler, 2010</xref>). The network is widely perceived as adopting an editorial line that is critical of Fatah and the Palestinian Authority, something which has played in favor of the rival faction Hamas and strained relationships between Qatar and the Palestinian Authority. Interestingly, the documents contain statements explicitly accusing Qatar of funding Hamas, and when Al Jazeera went public with the negotiations papers, senior Palestinian Authority officials lashed out at Al Jazeera’s sponsor, accusing it of taking a hostile stand toward the Palestinian Authority and of damaging the interests of the Palestinians. With the story of the leaks making headlines in the international media, the pan-Arab daily <italic>Asharq Alawsat</italic> reported that the Palestinian Authority was in possession of important documents, suggesting that it may release its ‘Qatari Papers’ as its own counter-leaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1750635212469910">Zaboun and Al-Naimi, 2011</xref>). So intense was the media campaign against Qatar and its political establishment that Abbas felt compelled to issue a decree prohibiting Palestinian officials and Fatah aids from abusing the leaders of Qatar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750635212469910">Anon, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>Speculations about the relationship between Al Jazeera and Qatar have always been rife. The pan-Arab appeal of Al Jazeera notwithstanding, the network remains first and foremost a Qatari venture that is based in Doha and sponsored by Qatar—a small Gulf country with immense oil and gas resources which is branding itself as a forward-looking microstate that is keen on modernization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750635212469910">Peterson, 2006</xref>). In one of the WikiLeaks diplomatic cables, a confidential US embassy report noted that Al Jazeera ‘has proved itself as a substantial source of leverage for Qatar’ and ‘a tool in the hands of its political masters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750635212469910">Booth, 2010</xref>). Naturally, Al Jazeera dismissed those claims, insisting that the network ‘is not the Emir’s poodle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750635212469910">Khanfar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750635212469910">Seddon, 2010</xref>). What can be ascertained though is that Al Jazeera fits within Qatar’s strategy to play an active role in Middle East politics and to gain regional prominence and influence. The prowess of Al Jazeera in a geopolitically tense region has helped give Qatar more political weight in the Middle East and position it as a mediator that is capable of diffusing tension in conflict-ridden countries like Lebanon, Yemen and Sudan—in some instances even outperforming the UN.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Qatar’s political initiatives and media dominance have irked key Arab states like Egypt and Saudi Arabia—countries with which the Palestinian Authority allied itself. If anything, Qatar’s pursuit of an ambitious and vigorous foreign policy that is marked by active diplomacy helped undermine the regional hegemony of neighboring Saudi Arabia and create a counter-political weight in the region. Similarly, Qatar’s relationship with Hamas and Al Jazeera’s reporting on the Palestinian question have undermined Egypt’s position and its role as a mediator between the Palestinian factions. The Palestinian Authority has relied heavily on Egypt’s support in dealing with Hamas while, for the Mubarak regime, the stakes were also high. Key to Egypt’s security approach to the Gaza strip on its Eastern border is Hamas’s relationship to the Muslim Brotherhood. Weary of the power and influence of the Islamists, Egypt sought to support and empower the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority. As expected, Abbas stood by Mubarak and supported him to the very end, banning Palestinians from demonstrating in support of the Egyptians’ demand for the removal of Mubarak from power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750635212469910">Abu Toameh, 2011</xref>). Earlier, and at the behest of the displeased Egyptian President, Abbas boycotted a crisis summit the Qataris held in 2009 in response to the war on Gaza. Likewise, Egypt did not favor Qatar’s decision to hold an Arab Peace Summit, which went ahead despite the lack of a quorum and with the presence of Hamas and Iran amidst renewed rifts among Arab states; nor did Mubarak attend the Arab League Summit which took place in Doha a few months later.</p>
<p>Seen from this perspective, the controversy about Al Jazeera’s release of the Palestine Papers is as much about geo-political rivalries and regional alliances as it is about the Middle East conflict. To the extent that Al Jazeera remains a key media player in Middle East politics, it is hard to ignore the complex relationship between the network and its sponsor. If Al Jazeera is to serve Qatar well, it needs to maintain its editorial independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750635212469910">Lamloum, 2004</xref>: 66). Seen from this vantage point, the apparent contradiction inherent in the very conception and strategy of Al Jazeera—as a foreign policy tool at the service of state survival and a rebellious voice in support of Arab causes—is a calculated risk and a case of <italic>realpolitik</italic> that has so far paid political dividends. Still, Qatar’s most valuable political asset could conceivably turn into a liability. Al Jazeera’s reporting on the popular movements in Arab countries where it has military involvement (Libya), geo-political stakes (Syria) and mediation initiatives (Yemen) has proved to be an uneasy challenge. More glaring, perhaps, is Al Jazeera’s scant attention to and toned-down report about the unrest in the neighboring Gulf monarchy of Bahrain. While championing popular demands for change and supporting uprisings against entrenched Arab regimes, ‘the network, and its owner, clearly drew the line when another Persian Gulf monarchy was threatened’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750635212469910">Erdbrink, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>Media-wise, the publication of the Palestine Papers highlights the ability of Al Jazeera to continue to be a leading media player in the region. Since its inception, the network, which managed to position itself as an independent voice, proved to be unmatched in its ability to break political taboos, take on controversial issues, set the news agenda, broadcast exclusive material, and scoop the world with stories. Significantly, the nature and timing of this new scoop are noteworthy, partly because they bear on a key issue in Middle East politics which Al Jazeera has fervently adopted and partly because they reflect evolving dynamics of a broader nature. More than any other channel, Al Jazeera has capitalized on the importance of the Palestinian question. Its intensive coverage of the Palestinian–Israeli conflict and its populist appeal helped revive a pan-Arab current, which in turn proved to be an engine for popular support to the Palestinians. In recent years, the stalled peace process, the deepening rift between the Palestinian factions, the Israeli siege of and war on Gaza, and the subsequent Flotilla raid have all contributed to thrusting the Palestinian question again into the spotlight and enshrining it as a narrative of collective destiny for Arabs and Muslims. These dynamics give the Palestine Papers an added significance. More than simply providing rare insights into the dispositions of the negotiators, the publication of the classified negotiations documents help rekindle the debate over the Middle East conflict, raising serious questions about the usefulness and future of the fitful peace process.</p>
<p>Seen from a geopolitical perspective, Al Jazeera’s move to publish the documents it came into possession of is a de facto no-confidence vote that could potentially disprivilege the Palestinian Authority and its traditional regional allies, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, while vindicating its rival faction Hamas and empowering the host and sponsor of Al Jazeera—a rising microstate that strives to acquire more political clout in a conflict- ridden region. The high profile mediating role Doha has played in recent years and its deep involvement with the Arab Spring point to subtle changes in the geopolitical scene of the Middle East region. Significantly, if the Middle East has been undergoing political change, Al Jazeera has been a symptom of that process of change. Interestingly, while in line with Al Jazeera’s politics, the publication of the confidential documents has broader implications. The Palestine Papers are as much about the new anti-censorship movement WikiLeaks has come to epitomize as they are about the Palestinian–Israeli conflict. If anything, they are indicative of a post WikiLeaks era in which the conventional relationship between media, publics and politics is reconfigured.</p>
