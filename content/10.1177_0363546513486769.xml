<title>Background:</title>
<p>Player activities in soccer matches are influenced by the match result and match venue. It is not known whether injury rates are influenced by these factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513486769">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To investigate whether there are associations between injury rates and the match result, venue, and type of competition in male soccer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513486769">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513486769">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Twenty-six professional clubs from 10 countries were followed prospectively during 9 seasons (2001-2002 to 2009-2010). All matches, and injuries occurring in these matches, were registered by the team’s medical staff. An injury was registered if it resulted in player absence from training or matches. Information about match result, venue, and type of competition for all reported matches was gathered by the authors from online databases. Injury rates in matches with varying match characteristics were compared by use of generalized estimating equations. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513486769">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>A total of 2738 injuries during 6010 matches were registered. There were no associations between odds of 1 injury occurrence and match result or type of competition, whereas the odds were decreased in matches played away compared with home matches (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80-0.99). The odds of 2 or more injury occurrences in a match were increased in matches resulting in a draw (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.15-1.69) or loss (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.38-1.98) compared with matches won and were decreased in other cup matches compared with league matches (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.84) and in matches played away compared with home matches (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.60-0.82). Finally, injuries with more than 1 week’s absence occurred more frequently in Champions League matches compared with league matches both for matches with 1 injury (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09-1.45) and matches with 2 or more injuries (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.13-2.20).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513486769">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The odds of 2 or more injury occurrences in professional soccer were higher in matches resulting in a loss or a draw compared with a win, whereas the odds of injury occurrences were lower in matches played away compared with home matches. The rate of moderate and severe injuries increased with the importance of the match.</p>

<body>
<p>The rate of time-loss injuries in professional European soccer matches has been shown to be between 24.6 and 28.2 injuries per 1000 match hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513486769">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513486769">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513486769">18</xref></sup> Many factors may contribute to injury occurrences in sports, and these are usually divided into intrinsic risk factors, such as age and flexibility, and extrinsic risk factors, such as physical load and variation in playing surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513486769">4</xref></sup> Although many studies have focused on intrinsic risk factors for injuries in soccer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513486769">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513486769">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513486769">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513486769">19</xref></sup> studies on extrinsic risk factors are fewer.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown associations between match characteristics and playing activity. The “home advantage,” for example, is a well-established phenomenon and is shown by the fact that home teams are more likely to win<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513486769">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513486769">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513486769">23</xref></sup> and more likely to have more shots on and off target and more ball possession,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513486769">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513486769">22</xref></sup> especially in the attacking zone of the playing field, compared with away teams.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513486769">22</xref></sup> In addition, fewer foul play decisions are taken by the referee against the home team.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513486769">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Few studies have examined whether match result, match venue, and type of competition influence injury rates in soccer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513486769">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513486769">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513486769">17</xref></sup> In one study on a French professional soccer team followed during 4 consecutive seasons, no significant difference was shown in injury rates in domestic matches compared with European Cup matches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513486769">7</xref></sup> Two studies have investigated the association between match injury rate and match result. One of these, including youth and senior national teams competing in European Championships, showed no association,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513486769">17</xref></sup> whereas the other, studying the Swedish senior national team, showed that the injury rate was increased during matches lost compared with matches won or drawn.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513486769">13</xref></sup> The latter study also investigated whether the injury rate was influenced by match venue, but it found no association.</p>
<p>Thus, only a few studies have investigated the association between different match characteristics and injury rates in soccer, and they are all limited by relatively small samples. The aim of this study was therefore to analyze the association between different match characteristics and injury occurrence in a large sample of male professional soccer players. Even though scientific data are scarce, we hypothesized that there would be higher injury rates in matches lost compared with matches won, in matches played away compared with those played at the home venue, and in matches played in European cups compared with those played in the domestic league.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-0363546513486769">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) injury study was initiated in 2001,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513486769">11</xref></sup> and the present study is a retrospective subanalysis of prospectively collected data on match exposure and injuries over 9 consecutive seasons between 2001 and 2010. Validation of the method and the general procedure for injury and exposure registration have been described in detail earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513486769">16</xref></sup> and are therefore only briefly summarized below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546513486769">
<title>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>The study cohort consisted of 26 professional soccer clubs from 10 European countries. All clubs competed at the highest club level of male soccer. All players in the first teams were invited to take part in the study. If any of the invited clubs failed to deliver complete data to the study group, the club was excluded from the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546513486769">
<title>Exposure and Injury Registration</title>
<p>All first team matches were registered on a standard attendance record. In addition, the club medical officer registered all injuries that occurred during these matches on an injury form. A recordable injury was defined as an injury occurring during a soccer match that resulted in a player being unable to take full part in future soccer training or match play: that is, a time-loss injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513486769">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513486769">16</xref></sup> A player was considered to be injured, and marked as absent on the attendance record, until the medical team allowed full participation in all team activities. Injury severity was categorized according to the number of days absent (slight/minimal, 0-3 days; mild, 4-7 days; moderate, 8-28 days; and severe, &gt;28 days).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513486769">16</xref></sup> Registration of injury occurrences due to foul play was based on the decision of the match referee. The injury forms and attendance records were returned to the study group monthly. The monthly reports were reviewed by a member of the study group, and prompt feedback was sent to the clubs to complete missing data and clarify any uncertainties, if necessary.</p>
<p>Information about match result (win, draw, or loss), match venue (neutral venue, home, or away match), and type of competition (friendly, league, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League [former UEFA Cup], or other cup match [mainly domestic cup matches]) was collected for each first team match included on the clubs’ attendance records. In case a match went to extra time or penalties, the match result after 90 minutes, including possible added time, was used as the final match result. All matches that were part of the domestic cups as well as matches in international cups other than UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and friendly tournaments were categorized as other cup matches. Friendly matches (n = 980, 13%) were excluded from the analyses since these matches were considered to have different characteristics than competitive matches. In addition, matches played at a neutral venue (n = 78, 1%) were excluded because of the limited number of matches.</p>
<p>The authors used online databases, primarily the included clubs’ official homepages, to retrieve data about the aforementioned match characteristics. All collected data were controlled with at least 1 additional online database.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Several generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with logit link were fitted on match-level data, with each first team competitive match as an observation. The GEE allows modeling of correlated observations, repeated measures within each team, by specification of the working correlation structure. The SPSS procedure GENLIN (link = logit, distribution = binomial, working correlation structure = independent) (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) was used. Injury occurrences per team, classified as zero injuries, 1 injury, and 2 or more injuries, were used as a primary response variable. Two separate models were fitted on injury occurrence (zero vs 1 injury and zero vs ≥2 injuries) with match results, match venue, and type of competition as explanatory variables. As an indication of model goodness of fit, the corrected quasi-likelihood under the independence model criterion (QICC) was used. Independent working correlation structure generated the lowest QICC in the models. As a sensitivity analysis, additional models were fitted including only moderate and severe injuries with more than 1 week’s absence.</p>
<p>Match results, classified as win, draw, and loss, were used as a secondary response variable. Two separate models were fitted on match results (win vs draw and win vs loss), with injury occurrence, match venue, and type of competition as explanatory variables. All models were adjusted for recovery time between matches (≤3 days vs &gt;3 days of recovery).</p>
<p>Associations between categorical variables (injury types, injury location, foul play, and match characteristics) were analyzed with Pearson chi-square test and an additional <italic>z</italic> test for pairwise comparisons of proportions, using Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons. All tests were 2-sided, and the significance level was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<p>In the analyses of injuries with more than 1 week’s absence, the same pattern for associations between match characteristics and injury occurrences persisted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513486769">Table 2</xref>). In addition, a statistically significant association between type of competition and injury occurrence was found, with increased odds of 1 injury occurrence, as well as 2 or more injury occurrences, in UEFA Champions League matches compared with league matches.</p>

<sec id="section15-0363546513486769">
<title>Injury Patterns Depending on Match Characteristics</title>
<p>There were no differences in injury proportions regarding injury type and location based on match result or type of competition (see the Appendix, available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajsm.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://ajsm.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>). There was, however, a significant overall difference in injury type proportions based on match venue, with a higher proportion of muscle/tendon injuries and a lower proportion of joint/ligament injuries, in home matches. There was also a significant overall difference in the proportion of injury locations for different match venues. No differences in the proportion of injuries caused by foul play were shown for any of the match characteristics.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The major finding of this study was that there were several statistical effects of match characteristics on injury occurrence in professional European soccer. Briefly, the odds of 2 or more injury occurrences in a given match were significantly higher in matches resulting in a loss or draw compared with matches won, in home matches compared with away matches, and in UEFA Champions League matches compared with league matches. Furthermore, injuries influenced match results, where the odds of a match ending with a loss or draw, as compared with a win, were increased in matches where 2 or more injuries occurred than in matches with no injury.</p>
<sec id="section18-0363546513486769">
<title>Highest Injury Rate in the Champions League</title>
<p>The UEFA Champions League is the most prestigious and important of all competitions in professional European soccer and was associated with an increased rate of injuries with more than 1 week’s absence compared with league matches. A possible explanation for this association is that the intensity in important matches might be higher than in matches of less importance, which, in turn, may lead to higher injury rates. It is also possible that the importance of a competition may influence a team’s willingness to let players with minor, not fully rehabilitated injuries play, and this may be reflected in our results as an increased injury rate. Injury recurrences are common in professional soccer and it has been suggested that this is due to insufficient rehabilitation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513486769">2</xref></sup> but it may also be a calculated risk to let players with minor complaints participate in an important match.</p>
<p>Our findings were not in accordance with a previous study in which a French professional soccer team was followed during 4 seasons and no difference in injury rates was found between European cup matches and domestic matches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513486769">7</xref></sup> In that study, the injury rates in all European cup matches (UEFA Europa League and UEFA Champions League matches) were compared with all domestic matches (cup and league matches combined), whereas in the present study all of these different competitions were analyzed separately. This difference in the study designs makes it difficult to compare the results between the two studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0363546513486769">
<title>Injuries More Frequent in Home Matches</title>
<p>The present study showed associations between a decreased injury rate and playing away matches and demonstrated that the injury type and location proportions varied somewhat depending on match venue. A possible explanation for these findings may be the difference in match activity and playing strategy between the home and away team as shown in several studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513486769">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513486769">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513486769">23</xref></sup> This is, however, speculative, and the reason for the observed association between decreased injury rates and away matches, as well as the reason for the slight variation in injury pattern, needs to be studied further. To the authors’ knowledge the association between match venue and injury rate has only been studied in one previous study, which showed no difference in injury rates between matches played at home, away, or on a neutral venue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513486769">13</xref></sup> This study was carried out in a national team setting exclusively, which makes comparisons with the present study difficult.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0363546513486769">
<title>Fewer Injuries in Matches Won</title>
<p>The present study showed that the odds of injury occurrence were greater in matches resulting in a loss or draw compared with matches won. One possible explanation why injury rates would increase when the team is losing or drawing a match is that the match result could influence a team’s match strategy. Previous studies have shown that soccer players perform fewer high-intensity activities when winning a match compared with when losing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513486769">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513486769">21</xref></sup> and it is possible that this decrease of high-intensity activities results in a decrease in injury rate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0363546513486769">
<title>Decreased Odds of Winning in Matches With Injury Occurrences</title>
<p>The study also showed that the odds that a team would lose or draw a match were greater when the team sustained 2 or more injuries during the match. Previous studies have found associations between injuries and team success in club soccer, with a correlation between final league standing and the number of injury days per team<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513486769">1</xref></sup> as well as correlations between injury incidence and team success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513486769">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>A similar trend has been shown in national team soccer, where teams that were eliminated in the group stage of the 2005 Women’s European Championships had a higher injury rate than teams that advanced to the semifinals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513486769">24</xref></sup> In addition, a few previous studies have analyzed the association between match results and injury rates, but with conflicting results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513486769">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513486769">17</xref></sup> One study showed a higher injury rate in matches resulting in a loss compared with matches resulting in a win or draw,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513486769">13</xref></sup> as the present study indicates, whereas the other showed no relationship between injury rates and match results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513486769">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Injury occurrences may decrease team performance by forcing the team to a substitution, thus affecting the game plan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513486769">13</xref></sup> It is, however, not uncommon that a player is able to complete a match even though he has sustained an injury, and the association between such injuries and the match result may therefore be less obvious. Even so, it is still possible that an injury may affect a player’s ability to perform even though it does not lead to out-of-pitch treatment or substitution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513486769">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>No matter the explanation, the association between injury occurrences and match result is an interesting finding that merits more research. Future studies should focus on establishing whether there is a causal relationship between low injury rates and team success since establishing such a relationship may be the most effective way of enhancing the priority of preventive measures in professional soccer clubs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0363546513486769">
<title>Methodological Considerations</title>
<p>The prospective design of the study, the large number of matches and injuries included, the homogeneous group of professional soccer players studied, and injury surveillance being carried out in harmonization with the methodological consensus in the field were the main strengths of the study.</p>
<p>Some further limitations of our study beyond those already discussed should be acknowledged. First, data were analyzed on team level per match and not on individual player basis. Several teams in our study are prominent and successful clubs involved in many competitive matches and have a congested playing calendar. They usually have large squads and may compete with different players in the various competitions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513486769">12</xref></sup> and this could possibly be reflected in our findings. For instance, injury rates have been shown to be lower in youth national teams compared with adult national teams,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513486769">17</xref></sup> and younger and less experienced players may have been used more frequently in competitions of less importance. Another potential explanation for our findings is that players might have an increased recognition of injuries and may be more willing to be substituted for injuries of less severity when losing a match than when winning,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513486769">13</xref></sup> but no such qualitative data could be extracted with the present study design. Second, the reliability of our data may be affected in that match characteristics were not collected in the same manner as information about exposure and injuries, but instead were gathered from online databases, and in that several different contact persons were responsible for collecting data from different clubs. To ensure as reliable data as possible, exposure and injury data were checked each month by the study group and requests were sent to the clubs to complete missing data and clarify any uncertainties, if necessary. In addition, all collected data on match characteristics were controlled with at least one additional online database. Finally, a description of the specific injury mechanisms leading up to injury might have helped to explain some of the differences in injury rates identified in the present study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513486769">5</xref></sup> but such descriptions were not collected. Because the analyses in the present study were all made on a team level, any individual risk factors that are suggested to contribute to the differences in injury rates between different match characteristics and injury rates are speculative and need to be confirmed in future studies.</p>

<sec id="section23-0363546513486769" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Even though causality cannot be established, the present study showed increased injury rates in matches resulting in a loss or draw compared with matches won and revealed that the odds that a match would end in a draw or loss were increased when a team had sustained 2 or more injuries during the match, thus suggesting an association between injuries and performance. It was also shown that injury rates were lower in matches that were played away compared with at the home stadium. Finally, injuries with more than 1 week’s absence occurred more frequently in UEFA Champions League than in league matches, suggesting that the rate of more severe injuries in professional soccer increased with the importance of the match.</p>
