<p>Leadership combines art and science and as we peel back the complexity of global leadership, we begin to recognize the complexity of the art and the science. <italic>Leading in Complex Worlds</italic> is a scholarly and practical treatise of the multifaceted, multidimensional, multidisciplinary, and multicultural aspects of leadership in a global world and, perhaps more significantly, within ourselves as we engage in the leadership dance of art and science.</p>
<p>There are refreshingly few assumptions about leadership in this volume because everything is <italic>on the table</italic>. The very definition of leadership comes into question on more than one occasion. As a result, do not look for 20th-century answers to tired questions such as, “Is leadership a noun or verb?” Rather, expect to be confronted with deeper questions such as, “What adaptive systems, which of themselves are fluid, may best manage the current chaos and complexity properly addressing the sociocultural elements of the challenge?”</p>
<p>The book is systematically organized into three distinct, yet complementary parts and is preceded and followed by two thought-provoking poems addressing leaders and leadership. Each part is introduced by an associate editor who, with the lead editor, organized the entries and set a theme for the parts. Part 1 addresses the complexity of leader development; Part 2 addresses the complexity of leadership practice; and Part 3 addresses the complexity of leading in a globalized world.</p>
<p>There is a reason why disclaimers are placed upon leadership programs and leadership studies. Developing a leader is a complex process that at best only begins in the classroom. Part 1, “The Complexity of Leader Development” succinctly, but effectively, addresses this issue. Analysis, reflection, risk taking, self-awareness, systems development, and interpersonal connections are just the start in the process of leadership development. And, not only do the <italic>elements</italic> change in the process of leadership development, but equally fluid is the environment in which the individual is tasked to lead. Part 1 will stimulate leadership educators, leadership consultants, and students of leadership.</p>
<p>Part 2, “The Complexity of Leadership Practice” immediately invokes visions of <italic>fluid dynamics</italic>—not so much the science of, but rather the nature of, fluid dynamics. The complexity is grounded in the nature of the organization, environment, community, etc. that is <italic>fluid</italic>, necessitating the need of those who interact with the entity to continually learn, develop, and adapt themselves if they are to be effective. Leadership lessons are gleaned from a variety of venues that amuse and enlighten the reader.</p>
<p>Part 3, “The Complexity of Leading in a Globalized World” raises the question, “What does leadership truly mean?” This question does not seek a <italic>definition</italic>, but begs an informed dialogue and even then the conclusions are only for that moment. Again fluidity, flexibility, adaptability, negotiation, acculturation, and more are elements that only begin the discourse. There are no easy answers here, but there are many pertinent questions. Each question is thoughtfully addressed and each conclusion is based on solid research. Nevertheless, as all good science, there is room for further research and discussion.</p>
<p><italic>Leading in Complex Worlds</italic> is a volume in the International Leadership Association’s <italic>Building Leadership Bridges</italic> series. The chapters are engaging and thought-provoking, the authors are knowledgeable and credible in their field. While the sections are thematic, the content at times is <italic>off the beaten path</italic>, but remains engaging and drives the point home. Other times, the volume grabs you by the collar and shakes loose your preconceived notions about leadership, not leaving you empty, but allowing you to ruminate upon different ways of knowing. In short, <italic>Leading in Complex Worlds</italic> opens your mind and invites you to consider not only new ideas but also new dimensions.</p>
