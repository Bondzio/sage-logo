<abstract>
<p>This study describes the role of compatibilizer i.e. styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer, its content and compounding method on the properties of polystyrene/clay nanocomposites. The nanocomposites were fabricated using three different methods: (i) simultaneous mixing of all the components i.e. polystyrene, required amounts of styrene-maleic anhydride and nanoclay using twin-screw extruder; (ii) stepwise mixing method i.e. in which blending of polystyrene and organoclay was first done using single-screw extruder and the mixed compound was then blended with varying amounts of styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer using twin-screw extruder and (iii) the effective combination of in situ polymerization of styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer in presence of varying amounts of nanoclay by free radical polymerization followed by melt mixing with polystyrene using twin-screw extruder. The effect of processing method on the micrsostructure of nanocomposites was investigated using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The mechanical properties of nanocomposites such as tensile, flexural and Izod impact strength were measured and discussed in relation to their microstructure. All the fabrication methods yielded nanocomposites with different microstructure ranging from intercalated to exfoliated structure of nanoclay. As expected the stepwise mixing method yielded more intercalated and exfoliated structure as compared to the simultaneous mixing method resulting in improvement in the properties of nanocomposites. On the other hand, combination of in situ polymerization with melt mixing method produced better exfoliation as compared to other two methods. Thermal stability and mechanical strength of polystyrene showed a significant improvement upon incorporation of nanoclay.</p>

<p>Recent research in polymer nanocomposites have shed some light on the use of layered silicates as a reinforcing nanofiller into the polymer matrix for increasing its mechanical, thermal, barrier and fire resistance properties. Layered silicates are inorganic materials, made up of several layers of platelet-like structures stacked in the tactoid form. These platelets have large aspect ratio ranging from 100 to 1000 and are highly agglomerated due to interlayer van der Waals forces. In order to obtain desired improvement in properties, there should be good interfacial adhesion between hydrophilic clay layers and organophillic polymer matrix. Thus clay particles should be homogeneously dispersed as individual clay platelet within the polymer matrix. Two types of nanocomposites are formed on the basis of clay dispersion into the polymer matrix – exfoliated and intercalated. In intercalated systems, organization between clay layers is maintained and there is an increase in gallery spacing of clay layers, where as in exfoliated systems, organization between clay layers is lost and clay layers are highly delaminated.</p>
<p>Polymer clay nanocomposites have been prepared by three methods namely – in situ polymerization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684413477770">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413477770"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684413477770">3</xref></sup> solution blending<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684413477770">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413477770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413477770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684413477770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413477770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684413477770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684413477770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684413477770"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684413477770">12</xref></sup> and melt blending.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684413477770">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684413477770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684413477770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684413477770"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684413477770">17</xref></sup> Melt blending is considered to be the most environmentally benign method and well suited for commercial production of nanocomposites due to its cost-effectiveness. It is considered that high shear mixer or twin-screw extruder has proven to facilitate the clay delamination in the molten polymer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684413477770">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684413477770"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684413477770"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684413477770">21</xref></sup> However, polymer /clay nanocomposites have been successfully prepared with polar polymers such as polyamides, poly(vinyl acetate) as polar groups enhance the affinity and adhesion between the clay and polymer. But, in case of nonpolar polymers like, polyolefins and polystyrene, representing a large segment of the plastic industry, the preparation of nanocomposites is quite difficult. There are many methods being proposed to improve the compatibility between hydrophobic polymer and hydrophilic clay layers, the most common being, exchanging inorganic ions in the clay galleries with organic ions using various quaternary ammonium salts, phosphonium salts and imidazolium salts, etc. Arora et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684413477770">22</xref></sup> studied the effect of nanoclay modified with different ammonium salts on the properties of polystyrene. Clay layers can also be modified with monomers which can help in improving its adhesion with the polymer. It has been recommended that the incorporation of polar groups into non polar polymers, could help in enhancing the compatibility between polymer and clay and thus provide better dispersion of clay inside the polymer matrix. These polar groups such as maleic anhydride can be introduced into the nonpolar matrix by copolymerization or by grafting which have been used as compatibilizer in such systems. Dong and Bhattacharya<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684413477770">23</xref></sup> prepared polypropylene (PP)/organoclay nanocomposites by using maleated polypropylene (MAPP) as compatibilizer. They showed that MAPP content had large influence on the impact properties of nanocomposites. Lopez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684413477770">24</xref></sup> studied the effect of two compatibilizing agents namely diethyl maleate and maleic anhydride on the clay dispersion in polypropylene clay nanocomposites. Kim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684413477770">25</xref></sup> reported enhanced thermal properties of PP/PP-g-MA clay nanocomposites than neat PP. Zheng et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684413477770">26</xref></sup> used an organically modified clay containing maleic anhydride to prepare polystyrene (PS)/clay nanocomposites. It has been reported that addition of maleic anhydride mostly leads to the improvement of dominant intercalated structures rather than complete exfoliation of clay layers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684413477770">27</xref></sup> The mechanical properties of polymer are directly affected by the intercalation/exfoliation level of clay in their nanocomposites which in turn are dependent upon clay content, compatibilizer content and even processing method. To further achieve full exfoliation of clay layers inside the polymer matrix, in situ method has been combined with melt blending method.</p>
<p>In this article, the effect of compatibilizer content and the compounding method on the final properties of polystyrene nanocomposites has been studied. Three different methods i.e. (i) all the components were mixed simultaneously using twin-screw extruder; (ii) step wise mixing; in which polystyrene and clay were melt blended in single-screw extruder followed by mixing with styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer (SMA) in twin-screw extruder and (iii) effective combination of in situ method and melt blending, were used for compounding and the effect of compounding method on mechanical and thermal properties was investigated. Morphological characterization of nanocomposites was done using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).</p>

<p>A commercial product polystyrene SC206 was purchased from Supreme Petrochem limited (manufacturer of polystyrene under technical collaboration of Chemical Corp. and ABB Lummus Crest of USA). Its melt flow index and softening point were 11.5 g/min (at 200℃ and 2.16 kg load) and 101℃ respectively. Styrene, xylene and diethyl ether obtained from Qualigens Chemicals Ltd., India were used as received. Initiator benzoyl peroxide was obtained from Merck and was recrystallized using methanol before use. An alkyl ammonium modified layered silicate, named Nanolin DK4, with cation exchange capacity of 110–120 mmol was obtained from Zhejiang Clay Chemicals Co. Ltd., China. The layered silicate used in this study had platelet thickness of 25 nm and aspect ratio of 100–1000.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0731684413477770"><title>Preparation of SMA in the presence/absence of nanoclay</title>
<p>Polymerization of styrene and maleic anhydride in molar ratio 1:1 was carried out at 75℃ using xylene as solvent and benzoyl peroxide as initiator. The polymerization was done in a four necked round bottom flask fitted with condenser, nitrogen inlet, mechanical stirrer and dropping funnel. Temperature was maintained by using thermostat. First of all required amount of xylene was placed in the reactor and then maleic anhydride (94.6 g, 0.96 moles) was poured into the flask and temperature was raised to 60℃ along with continuous stirring (300 r/min) under nitrogen atmosphere. After the complete dissolution of maleic anhydride in xylene, purified styrene (100 mL, 0.96 moles) was added into the solution and temperature was raised to 75℃. Benzoyl peroxide (0.264 g, 0.01%) dissolved in xylene was added to the reaction mixture once the homogeneous solution was formed. Polymerization was carried out at 75 ± 1℃ for 6 h. The precipitated polymer was separated by filtration. The polymer was washed repeatedly with xylene to remove the unreacted monomers and then dried in vacuum oven at 60℃ till the constant weight was obtained.</p>
<p>To prepare SMA copolymer in the presence of nanoclay, desired amount of nanoclay (1–2 phr of polystyrene) was swollen in a mixture of styrene monomer and xylene solvent for 12 h. After dispersion of clay in above mixture, the polymerization of styrene and maleic anhydride was carried out with the same procedure as mentioned above.</p>

<p>Polystyrene, SMA and organoclay were pre-dried in vacuum oven at 60℃ for 12 h before blending. PS/SMA/clay nanocomposites were prepared by three methods – step wise mixing, simultaneous mixing and effective combination of in situ polymerization and melt mixing.
<list id="list1-0731684413477770" list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item><p>In the first method, simultaneous mixing of all the components was carried out in co-rotating twin screw extruder, model Prism Eurolab-16. The temperature range was 160℃, 165℃, 170℃, 175℃, 180℃, 185℃, 190℃, 195℃, 200℃, 205℃ and 210℃ in the zones I to IX and in the die zone respectively. The screw r/min was kept constant at 300.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the second method, polystyrene and organoclay were melt mixed in single-screw extruder at temperature of 170℃ with 30 r/min screw speed. Extruded strands were quench cooled in water and cut into small granules with the help of granulator. The above prepared granules were dried in vacuum oven at 60℃ for 24 h and then melt mixed with SMA using co-rotating twin-screw extruder, model Prism Eurolab-16. The temperature range and screw r/min was same as used in Method 1.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the third method (Method 3), required amounts of SMA prepared with varying concentrations of nanoclay by in situ polymerization method were melt mixed with polystyrene in co-rotating twin-screw extruder, model Prism Eurolab-16 using the same processing conditions as mentioned in Method 1.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Neat polymer was also subjected to the same processing conditions to maintain identical thermal shear history. The compatibilizer content was varied from 5% to 15 % and clay content taken was 1–2 phr.

<p>The injection molded specimens were used for testing tensile and flexural properties using ‘Universal Testing Machine’ Zwick/Z010 (capacity = 1 ton).</p>
<p>For tensile testing, dumbbell shaped specimens (3.2 × 12.7 × 165 mm<sup>3</sup>) as per ASTM D638 standards were used. A cross head speed of 5 mm/min and gauge length of 50 mm was used in all the testing.</p>
<p>For flexural testing, rectangular bar (12.7 × 3.2 × 125 mm<sup>3</sup>) was used in accordance with ASTM D790. Notched Izod impact strength of rectangular shaped specimens (64 × 12.7 × 3.2 mm<sup>3</sup>) was measured using striking pendulum hammer according to the ASTM D256 method at room temperature. A notch of 2 mm depth at 45° angle was cut with the help of a notch cutter equipped with micrometer screw gage in the middle of the specimen. For all mechanical property testing, five specimens for each composition were tested and their average was taken so as to ensure persistence.</p>

<p>TA instrument Q-50 TGA was used for recording TG traces in nitrogen atmosphere at a flow rate of 60 cm<sup>3</sup>/min. Degradation test was performed using powder samples (10 ± 2 mg) obtained by filing injection molded specimens at a heating rate of 20℃/min.</p>
<p>Perkin Elmer Pyris 6 differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used for recording DSC scans of samples. About 5–6 mg of sample was first heated to 140℃ in nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10℃/min and held at this temperature for 5 min to remove any thermal history. The sample was then quench cooled down to 35℃ and reheated to 250℃ at the same rate.

An acceleration voltage of 40 kV and filament current of 30 mA were applied. The samples were scanned at a rate of 0.05°/min from 2° to 30° of 2θ. Compression molded film samples were used for recording X-ray diffraction patterns.</p>
<p>For TEM analysis, a Zeiss Transmission Electron Microscope (Netherlands) was used at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. Ultrathin sections (70 nm thick) of PS/nanoclay were cut with the help of Austria made Leica Ultracut S microtome at room temperature. The sections were collected in water trough and then directly floated on 300 mesh Cu grids. No external staining was done for the samples prepared as there was adequate contrast between the silicate layers (comprising of heavier elements such as Si and Al) and polymer matrix (comprising C and H) due to high electron density difference.</p>

<p>(i) X-ray diffraction analysis</p>
<p>XRD provides information about the changes in interlayer spacing of clay after formation of nanocomposites under different conditions. The increase in d-spacing results in the formation of an intercalated structure, whereas with complete loss of peak, an exfoliated structure is formed. In an exfoliated structure, the registry between the clay layers is completely lost, indicating homogenous dispersion of clay layers inside the polymer matrix. However, in some cases, immiscible structures may also be formed which also show no peaks. The XRD spectra of PS/clay nanocomposite films are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684413477770">Figures 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413477770">3</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684413477770">Table 2</xref> summarizes the d-spacing data for all the PS/clay nanocomposites prepared with different processing methods having varying amounts of clay/compatibilizer.

<p>For PS/clay nanocomposites containing varying amounts of nanoclay and compatibilizer, diffraction angle is lowered for all the samples indicating intercalation of clay layers. Diffraction angle 2θ is lowered from 2.7° to 2.4° in PS05C1M1, PS05C2M1, PS10C1M1, PS10C2M1, PS05C1M2, PS05C2M2 and PS10C1M2; from 2.7° to 2.3° in PS10C2M2; and from 2.7° to 2.2° in PS05C1M3. The maximum d-spacing was observed in PS10C2M3 (4.1 nm), which shows that polymer has entered into the clay galleries to the maximum extent in this sample. The process of re-compounding also accelerated the intercalation process as can be observed from XRD curves for samples PS10C1M2 and PS10C2M2. During re-compounding, the shorter chains of compatibilizer could easily penetrate inside the clay galleries as there was more mobility during melt blending. In case of nanocomposites prepared using method 3, clay was dispersed in styrene monomer and then copolymerization with maleic anhydride was carried out. This gave enough time for monomer to enter inside the clay galleries. This could have given the advantage of carrying out polymerization inside the clay galleries only which may result in better interaction between copolymer and nanoclay.</p>
<p>The compatibilizer content showed positive effect in increasing d-spacing for compounds prepared using Methods 2 and 3 only. No such effect was observed for samples prepared using method-1, which may be due to poor mixing as compared to Methods 2 and 3. The d-spacing increased from 3.8 to 3.9 nm as the compatibilizer content was increased from 5% (w/w) to 10% (w/w) for samples prepared by method 2 (clay content 1phr). For samples prepared using method 3 and clay content 1 phr, d-spacing increased from 4.0 to 4.1 nm as the compatibilizer content was increased from 5% to 10% (w/w). It is generally believed that the interlayer expansion mainly results from the penetration of maleic anhydride molecules between clay platelets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684413477770">28</xref></sup> Moreover, it has been observed that excessive amount of compatibilizer also causes negative effect on the final characteristics of nanocomposites. As a result, there may be decrease in mechanical properties of the polymer as well. Mechanical properties are in direct relation to the intercalation/exfoliation level of the clay layers. As determined from XRD patterns, an increase in d-spacing of clay layers was more after the addition of compatibilizer as compared to sample prepared without compatibilizer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684413477770">Figure 2</xref>). We have also prepared samples in the absence of compatibilizer where there was comparatively less improvement in mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684413477770">22</xref></sup> However, excessive amount of compatibilizer could show worsening effect towards mechanical properties of nanocomposites as explained earlier. There is a saturation level of SMA content to be added into the nanocomposite system. Before the saturation level, molecules of compatibilizer are located between clay interlayer spaces or in the interphase between polymer matrix and clay particles. However, above this level, excess of compatibilizer molecules get dispersed in the polymer matrix influencing the homogeneity of matrix and thus affecting the mechanical properties of polymer. This could create plasticization effect in the polymer, which may further compete with the positive effect of better clay dispersion. This explains the decrease in mechanical properties of polymer after addition of compatibilizer with more than 10% (w/w) content as explained later in mechanical section.
</p>
<p>As mentioned before, all the samples were prepared with 1 and 2 phr clay content only as agglomeration was observed at higher loading of clay. Increase in clay content did not show any significant effect on the d-spacing of nanocomposites thus showing that the morphology was not affected by the increase in clay content.</p>
<p>(ii) Transmission electron microscopy</p>
<p>To study the effect of compatibilizer and re-compounding on the structure of clay layers, TEM analysis was carried out for samples PS10C2M1, PS10C2M2 and PS10C2M3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684413477770">Figure 4</xref>). TEM pictures indicated that clay platelets consisted of some intercalated and some delaminated structures. As depicted from TEM images, it can be concluded that compounding method 3 gave better exfoliation/intercalation of clay layers. There is presence of single layer of clay in PS10C2M3, which indicates that clay was mixed with polystyrene to maximum extent in this method. It is also supported from XRD analysis, which showed that maximum d-spacing was observed for sample prepared with method 3. Although some intercalated layers were also present which support the WAXD data which showed the presence of peak with d-spacing 4.1 nm rather than full disappearance of the peak. TEM images clearly support the WAXD observations for PS10C2M1, PS10C2M2 and PS10C2M3 showing the increase in d-spacing of clay layers by the addition of compatibilizer. Presence of strong polar groups in the copolymer may have caused its interaction with hydroxyl groups present at clay surface. TEM image analysis for nanocomposites with compatibilizer content of 15% (w/w) was not carried out due to degradation of sample. Thus low compatibilizer concentrations are preferred (5–10% (w/w)) to prevent possible degradation reactions. In all the samples, clay was dispersed into domains which included delaminated or intercalated clay platelets. As mentioned before, in XRD analysis, the morphology of final nanocomposites was not affected by the increase in clay content.

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684413477770">Table 3</xref>, compounding method 3 gave maximum improvement in thermal stability of PS/clay nanocomposites. For clay content of 2 phr and compatibilizer 5% (w/w), <italic>T</italic><sub>10</sub> increased from 362 ℃ to 380℃ for sample prepared using method 1 (PS5C2M1), 387℃ for sample prepared using method 2 (PS5C2M2) and 397℃ for sample prepared using method 3 (PS5C2M3). Similar results were observed for <italic>T</italic><sub>50</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> temperature. With 2 phr nanoclay and 10% (w/w) compatibilizer, <italic>T</italic><sub>10</sub> increased from 362℃ to 387℃ for sample prepared with method 1 (PS10C2M1), 392℃ for sample prepared with method 2 (PS10C2M2) and 398℃ for sample prepared with method 3 (PS10C2M3). For same clay and compatibilizer content <italic>T</italic><sub>50</sub> increased from 403℃ to 422℃ for sample prepared with method 1, 432℃ for sample prepared with method 2 and 442℃ for sample prepared with method 3. <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> increased from 383℃ to 391℃ for sample prepared with method 1, 395℃ for sample prepared with method 2 and 405℃ for sample prepared with method 3. TGA analysis indicates that nanocomposites prepared using method 3 had maximum thermal stability which could be due to better dispersion of clay layers. Further clay content had positive effect on the thermal stability of polystyrene. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684413477770">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684413477770">10</xref> further show the effect of compounding method, clay content and compatibilizer content on the degradation temperatures With increase in clay content from 1 to 2 phr and compatibilizer being 5% (w/w), <italic>T</italic><sub>10</sub> increased from 376℃ to 380℃ for sample prepared with method 1, 381℃ to 387℃ for sample prepared with method 2 and 387℃ to 397℃ for sample prepared with method 3. Similar results were obtained when 10% (w/w) compatibilizer was added in all the formulations prepared. The compatibilizer also played a great role in improving the thermal stability of polystyrene nanocomposites. It can be concluded from the fact that when PS/clay nancomposites were prepared with 1 phr clay then <italic>T</italic><sub>10</sub> increased from 362℃ to 376℃. Whereas with addition of 5% (w/w) compatibilizer <italic>T</italic><sub>10</sub> increased to 380℃/387℃/ and 397℃ depending on the compounding method. With further increase in compatibilizer up to 10% (w/w) <italic>T</italic><sub>10</sub> increased to 387℃ (PS10CM1)/393℃ (PS10CM2) /398℃ (PS10CM3). Similar observations were made for <italic>T</italic><sub>50</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> temperatures. The increase in thermal stability of polystyrene/clay nanocomposites could be due to better dispersion of nanoclay inside the polystyrene matrix due to addition of compatibilizer.

<p>The thermal stability of samples prepared using 15% w/w compatibilizer was lower as compared to polystyrene–clay nanocomposites in absence of compatibilizer or having 5% and 10% w/w of compatibilizer.

<p>The glass transition temperatures of polystyrene and polystyrene nanocomposites prepared using all the processing methods was determined by recording DSC scans.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0731684413477770">Figure 11</xref> shows the plots of relative oxygen permeability for PS/SMA/clay nanocomposites as a function of clay content, compatibilizer content and method of compounding.

</fig></p>
<p>Keeping clay content 1.0 phr and compatibilizer content 5% (w/w), polystyrene nanocomposites showed a decrease in permeability of oxygen by 27% for sample prepared with method 1, 42% for sample prepared with method 2 and 72% for sample prepared with method 3. Similar observation was made when higher clay and compatibilizer content was used. Method 3 gave maximum improvement in barrier properties being 90% for sample having 10% compatibilizer and 2.0 phr nanoclay i.e. sample PS10C2M3. This is due to decrease in area available for diffusion as impermeable flakes of clay replace the permeable polymer and increase in the distance that gas has to follow as tortuous path is formed around the impermeable clay flakes. It was observed in XRD and TEM analysis that clay showed better dispersion in samples prepared using method 3, which caused better improvement in barrier properties by this method. With increase in compatibilizer content, barrier properties also showed improvement. As the compatibilizer content was increased from 5% to 10% w/w at a loading of 1.0 phr clay and method 3 for compounding, oxygen permeability decreased from 28% (PS05C1M3) to 10% (PS10C1M3) respectively. Similar results were observed for samples prepared with method 1 and 2 as well. The compatibilizer content had positive effect on the barrier properties of polystyrene. This could be due to the reason that the permeability of gas depends upon the particle size and dispersion of nanomaterials. From these results it can be concluded that clay dispersion in nanocomposites was better when method 2 i.e. step wise addition of clay and compatibilizer or method 3 i.e. in situ SMA–clay was prepared. The permeability increased when higher content of compatibilizer (15%) was used. This could be due to the irregularities in polystyrene matrix formed due to degradation of SMA copolymer. The degradation caused unequal distribution of clay layers, thus causing permeability to increase.</p>
<p>Clay content also had positive effect on the barrier properties of polystyrene. With increase in clay content from phr 1.0 to 2.0 (compatibilizer content 5% (w/w)) barrier properties showed 27% and 33% improvement respectively (nanocomposites obtained using method 1) and 42% and 51%, respectively (nanocomposites obtained using method 2) and 72% and 80%, respectively (nanocomposites obtained using method 3). Similar observation was made for samples prepared in the presence of 10% w/w compatibilizer. Maximum improvement was observed in case of samples prepared using 10% (w/w) of compatibilizer, 2 phr clay and method 3 for compounding.</p>

<p>At higher compatibilizer loading (i.e. 10 wt%) also, with clay content 1 phr, improvement in tensile modulus was highest i.e. 64% for PS10C1M3, when method 3 was used. Whereas with the same formulations, method 1 showed 35% (for sample PS10C1M1) and method 2 showed 51% (for sample PS10C1M2) improvement in tensile modulus. Keeping compatibilizer content constant (i.e. 10% (w/w)) and increasing clay content up to 2 phr, similar trends were observed for tensile modulus i.e. PS10C2M3 &gt;PS10C2M2 &gt;PS10C2M1.</p>
<p>The effect of different compounding method on tensile strength was also studied. It was observed that at lower clay (1phr) and compatibilizer content (5%), no improvement in tensile strength was observed for method 1, whereas for the same formulation prepared using method 2 and method 3, 20% and 30% increase in tensile strength was observed. With further increase in clay (2 phr) and compatiblizer content (10% (w/w)), maximum tensile strength was observed for sample PS10C2M3 (55% improvement), which was prepared using method 3.</p>

Flexural properties also showed similar trends as shown by tensile properties. Method 3 showed maximum improvement in flexural properties. By the addition of 1 phr clay and 5% compatibilizer, flexural modulus increased by 21%, 27% and 31% for PS05C1M1 and PS05C1M2 and PS05C1M3, respectively. With further increase in clay content i.e. 2 phr (compatibilizer content being the same) flexural modulii was improved by 26%, 34% and 44% for PS05C2M1, PS05C2M2 and PS05C2M3, respectively. For nanocomposites prepared with 10% compatibilizer, maximum enhancement in flexural moduli was observed for samples prepared using method 3 involving combination of in situ method and melt mixing. PS10C2M1, PS10C2M2 and PS10C2M3 showed 35%, 56% and 67% increase in flexural moduli, respectively.

<p>Flexural strength with clay content 2 phr and compatibilizer 10% did not show much improvement in properties when method 1 and 2 was used for compounding. However, when method 3 was used for mixing, 31% improvement in flexural strength was observed for sample PS10C2M3. This indicates that flexural properties were also dependent on compounding method chosen for the preparation of polystyrene nanocomposites and method 3 gave the maximum improvement in the properties.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684413477770">Figure 6</xref> further shows the plot of relative impact strength as a function of clay content, compatibilizer content and compounding technique used for mixing PS/SMA/clay. At any given clay content (2 phr) and compatibilizer content (10% (w/w)), compounding method showed a large effect on the impact strength. Improvement in impact strength was maximum in case of sample PS10C2M3 (64%) and minimum in case of sample PS10C2M1 (18%). Method 2 showed an intermediate value i.e. 40% increase in impact strength.
</p>
<p>These results clearly show that at any given clay and compatibilizer content the mechanical properties were maximum when method 3 was used for processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684413477770">Figures 12</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0731684413477770">16</xref>) of nanocomposites. Method 2 showed better improvement in properties as compared to method-1 which can be attributed to the positive effect of re-compounding. During method 2, re-compounding may enhance the chance of better mixing of nanoclays and polystyrene matrix as it involves mixing of filler and matrix twice at molten stage of polymer. Dong and Bhattacharya also showed that mechanical properties of polypropylene/clay nanocomposites showed better improvement when re-compounding was done.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684413477770">23</xref></sup> However, method 3 involving combination of in situ and melt mixing gave the maximum improvement in properties due to better penetration of styrene monomer inside the clay galleries while preparing SMA–clay nanocomposites.

<p>Mechanical properties showed increase in properties with increase in clay content irrespective of compatibilizer content and processing method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684413477770">Figures 12</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0731684413477770">16</xref>). We observed an improvement in the mechanical properties of polystyrene by incorporation of clay up to 2 phr. Further increase of clay content resulted in a decrease in the mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684413477770">22</xref></sup> Agglomeration of clay was clearly seen in the nanocomposites when its concentration was &gt;2 phr. Therefore to investigate the effect of compatibilizer content and method of compounding, the clay content was kept as 1 and 2 phr.</p>
<p>Further, in order to investigate the effect of compatibilizer, several formulations were prepared using 5%, 10% and 15% w/w compatibilizer, 1 phr/ 2 phr clay content and method 1, method 2 and method 3 for compounding the ingredients. Comparing the tensile modulus of PS/clay nanocomposites (PSC-10, PSC-20) with PS/SMA/clay nanocomposites (PS05C1(M1/M2/M3), PS05C2(M1/M2/M3)), a significant increase was observed in the presence of SMA, which further increased with increasing amount of compatibilizer (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684413477770">12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0731684413477770">13</xref>) up to 10% (w/w).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684413477770">23</xref></sup> Further increase in compatibilizer content up to 15% caused deterioration of tensile properties. Ultimate tensile strength also showed similar trend.</p>
<p>Keeping clay content 1 phr and using method 1, flexural modulus increased from 21% to 26% as the compatibilizer content was increased from 5% (w/w) to 10% (w/w). Similar observation was made when methods 2 and 3 were used for compounding. Flexural modulus increased from 27% to 40% (for method 2) and 31% to 56% (for method 3) in case of nanocomposites when compatibilizer content increased from 5% (w/w) to 10% (w/w). Similar trend was observed for nanocomposites having 5% and 10% (w/w) of compatibilizer and 2 phr of nanoclay.</p>
<p>Compatibilizer had great role in increasing impact properties of polystyrene. As reported in our previous paper, no significant improvement was observed when commercial or modified clay was added to polystyrene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684413477770">23</xref></sup> Along with effective processing method, compatibilizer content also contributed in improving impact properties of polystyrene. Keeping clay content 1phr, with increase in compatibilizer content from 5% (w/w) to 10% (w/w), impact strength increased from 10% to 13% (for method 1); 18% to 35% (for method 2); and 41% to 52% (for method 3).</p>
<p>A significant increase in mechanical properties was observed in the presence of SMA, which further increased with increasing amount of compatibilizer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684413477770">Figures 12</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0731684413477770">16</xref>) up to 10% (w/w). Further increase in compatibilizer content up to 15% caused deterioration of mechanical properties. This indicated that there should be an optimum amount of compatibilizer that should be added to have maximum improvement in properties. The anhydride groups in compatibilizer could produce some undesirable effects as well during the melt compounding such as odors and volatiles. Anhydride groups could react with each other or with hydroxyl groups at clay surface to form carboxylic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731684413477770">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731684413477770"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731684413477770">31</xref></sup> and this carboxylic acid group could again react with hydroxyl group at the clay surface and produce CO<sub>2</sub>. The above reaction generates bubbles and a yellowish color in the final product which was observed in samples PS15C1M1, PS15C2M1, PS15C1M2, PS15C2M2, PS15C1M3 and PS15C2M3. Furthermore, carboxylic acid could cause chemical degradation of PS, resulting in reduction of molecular weight and deterioration of properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731684413477770">32</xref></sup> However, it has been found that these processing problems were not observed when SMA was used in lower concentrations i.e. 5–10% (w/w).</p>

<p>This study provides some insight to the selection of appropriate amount of compatibilizer and processing method in order to achieve better performance of PS/clay nanocomposites. From the above studies following conclusions can be made:
<list id="list2-0731684413477770" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>PS/clay nanocomposites prepared using different compounding techniques clearly showed that dispersion of clay was dependent on the compounding method. Re-compounding (method 2) process allowed better dispersion of clay. This could be due to the increase in the residence time during compounding, which allows better interaction between nanoclay and polystyrene. Further, the effective combination of in situ polymerization method and melt blending (method 3) showed the best dispersion with formation of intercalated /or /exfoliated structures. Thermal stability and the mechanical properties of nanocomposites were dependent on the method of compounding and it was found to be best for composites prepared using method 3 i.e. combination of in situ polymerization and melt compounding.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In addition, the compatibilizer content was found to be the second significant factor for enhancing mechanical and thermal properties of polystyrene/clay nanocomposites. From these studies it can be concluded that nanocomposites prepared using method 3 (for compounding) and 10% (w/w) SMA (as compatibilizer) gave an optimum combination of properties.</p></list-item>
