<title>Objective:</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to reduce the physical load on coffee-harvesting workers while maintaining productivity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0018720812461272">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Coffee is second to oil in commodity trading. Water is becoming scarce worldwide. The global virtual water footprint for one cup of coffee is 140 liters. Shade-grown coffee is one approach to reducing the water footprint.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0018720812461272">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>A participatory ergonomics approach was used during two Nicaraguan shade-grown coffee harvesting seasons to reduce the physical load on harvesters with the use of a newly designed bag instead of a basket strapped around the waist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0018720812461272">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Productivity in the mountainous, shade-grown coffee farms was maintained while physical load on the worker was improved somewhat. Among basket users, 84.2% reported pain in at least one body area compared with 78.9% of bag users (<italic>ns</italic>). Nonetheless, 74% of participants liked the bag “much better” than the basket. Workers identified ways the bag could be improved further with the use of local materials. These suggestions included (a) reducing the horizontal distance of the bag to reduce reach and (b) having waterproof material on the bag between the worker and the bag to reduce moisture and damage to the berries. There was no difference in productivity between using the bag and using the small basket.</p>

<sec id="section5-0018720812461272">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Workers are extending this partici-patory approach to how to get the harvested coffee cherries down the mountain other than carrying 40-kg bags on their backs. The ultimate goal is to make the coffee-harvesting bag design available to harvesters around the world.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is an increased interest in identifying risks for musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) in agriculture, where there is significant physical labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812461272">Kirkhorn, Earle-Richardson, &amp; Banks, 2010</xref>), resulting in increased production costs. Public health issues, such as access to potable water, housing, and sanitation, have been described among coffee workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812461272">Loría Bolaños, Partanen, Berrocal, Alvárez, &amp; Córdoba, 2008</xref>) but not the working conditions. Almost 50% of Latino migratory vineyard workers in the United States lack access to health care services, and close to 50% experience musculoskeletal symptoms; back symptoms were present in 32% of men and 44% of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812461272">Brumitt et al., 2011</xref>). The California Agricultural Workers Health Survey of 970 hired farmworkers identified persistent pain (every day for more than 1 week) in the back, neck, and upper and lower extremities; for women, persistent pain was correlated with increased years of hired farmwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812461272">Villarejo &amp; McCurdy, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In another study, of vineyard workers in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812461272">Bernard et al., 2011</xref>), it was found that both biomechanical and psychosocial factors were associated with musculoskeletal symptoms of the back and upper extremity for both genders and of neck and shoulder and lower-extremity pain for men. The psychosocial factors were insufficient material means, overcommitment (both genders), effort–reward imbalance (men), and low job control (women), which were associated with back and upper-extremity symptoms.</p>
<p>Another study, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812461272">May et al. (2008)</xref>, assessed musculoskeletal injuries among 29 migrant and seasonal farmworkers who were harvesting blueberries in Maine, where there is largely manual harvesting. They compared an “extended” rake with a traditional short-handled rake (five configurations) after 5 hr of use and found that the extended rake resulted in increased productivity, acceptability, less force, and less pain.</p>
<p>In a review of the scientific bibliographic databases (PubMed), we identified no studies of the effects of harvesting on the coffee harvesters, yet coffee harvesters in Central America work long hours in rough terrain manually picking, bagging, transporting, washing, and drying coffee cherries.</p>
<p>Water is an integral part of the coffee growing and harvesting process, yet water is increasingly scarce because of global climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812461272">McDonald et al., 2011</xref>), which impacts food production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812461272">Cohen, 2010</xref>). Spatially explicit land-use simulations show that depending on the magnitude and location of ongoing forest conversion, the negative effects of deforestation reduce pollination potential and diversity. This effect is expected to result in reduced coffee yields by up to 18%.</p>
<p>“Shade-grown” coffee results in ecological and economic value. Water is an important part of this equation for coffee farmers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812461272">Priess et al., 2007</xref>). The global average water footprint to produce one cup of coffee is about 140 liters and 21,000 liters to produce 1 kg of roasted coffee. The world population needs 120 billion cubic meters of water per year to be able to drink coffee. International trade in coffee products is responsible for 80 billion cubic meters of virtual water exports, approximately 6% of international virtual water flows in the world. Among all crops and livestock products, coffee tops the list of global virtual water flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812461272">Chapagain &amp; Hoekstra, 2007</xref>). Identifying ways to reduce the physical load on coffee harvesters and reduce the amount of water required for growing and harvesting coffee is important to worker health and the economies of industrially developing countries. Shade-grown organic coffee growing and harvesting can have a positive impact on downstream chemical pollution of water and on worker families.</p>
<p>At the same time, polluted water takes a large toll on the world’s population, particularly, but not solely, in industrially developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812461272">Fishman, 2011</xref>). China (which has 20% of the world’s population and 7% of global water resources) has among the lowest availability of water in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812461272">Shobert, 2012</xref>), and China’s demand for coffee has increased dramatically. Where water is abundant, there is widespread pollution no longer suitable for human contact. The Middle East and North Africa have the least amount of water (approximately 1,500 m<sup>3</sup> per person per year). Water availability is a concern internationally, particularly for agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720812461272">Weiss, 2012</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section7-0018720812461272">
<title>Coffee Production</title>
<p>Water is essential for the sustainability of coffee production. Coffee is one of the most valuable primary products in world trade, second only to oil. The entire industry (from cultivation to marketing) employs hundreds of millions of people worldwide. It is crucial to the economies and politics of many developing countries (often more than 50% of their foreign exchange earnings). It is traded on futures and commodity exchanges around the world. There are 52 countries, primarily in Africa, Central and South America, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia, that produce coffee. More recently, coffee is being grown in Australia. The United States is the leader in coffee consumption, with about 25% of the world market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812461272">Strand, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Shade-grown coffee farms contribute to the biodiversity of the local area. For example, these farms support native bees that help maintain the health of some of the world’s most biodiverse tropical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812461272">Dick, 2010</xref>). Songbirds use shade-grown coffee plants as a natural habitat, reducing the need for fertilizers, herbicides, and irrigation, thereby promoting biodiversification. The production of a shade-grown coffee farm uses one third less water than a similar-size nonshaded coffee farm. Sustainable farming implements practices to minimize water consumption and to clean the water used. Harvesting consists of (a) examining the cherries for ripeness (skin turns red), (b) removing the skin from the bean, and (c) drying the beans. The beans are then sent to a local roaster but more likely shipped to coffee companies in developed countries that then roast the coffee. Roasting is the most profitable component of the process. We evaluated the musculoskeletal impact of coffee harvesting on Nicaraguan shade-grown coffee farms using symptoms questionnaires and biomechanical and electromyographic (EMG) estimates of physical load exposures.</p>

<title>Participatory Ergonomics</title>
<p>The first two authors conducted several ergonomics workshops in Central America as part of the International Scholars Program at the University of Washington, funded in part by the Fogerty Institute. Subsequently, the second author received a Fulbright Scholarship to teach ergonomics at the University of Nicaragua–Leon (UNAN-Leon) and became interested in the working conditions of coffee farmers. Because coffee is the primary crop traded on international markets, improving the working lives of coffee harvesters is important to Nicaragua’s future. The first author brought the plight of the coffee harvesters to the attention of the International Ergonomics Association (IEA) Executive Committee, which in turn adopted this effort as a “Lighthouse Project” aimed at transferring ergonomics applications to other parts of the industrially developing world.</p>
<p>In addition to IEA support, major support came from the 4C Association (Common Code for the Coffee Community), which addresses the mainstream coffee industry and provides it with a set of practices on the way toward more sustainable production, postharvest processing, and trading of coffee worldwide. In Nicaragua, 4C works with PAC (Associacion Pueblos en Accion Communitaria) to incorporate fairness and justice principles into its members’ practices. The two coffee farms chosen by PAC were in the Jalapa region of northwestern Nicaragua, very close to the Honduran border and approximately 5 km off the main road.</p>
<p>This project had two phases. The first involved (a) testing the introduction of a bag designed by Kate Stewart to replace the existing basket used by harvesters in 2010 and (b) worker feedback to assess usability of an improved bag for 5 consecutive days in 2011. The second phase of the project had funding from the IEA, which obtained some project financing from Ecom Agroindustrial Corporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812461272">Ecom, 2011</xref>), which is affiliated with the World Bank and is very interested in supply chain issues and sustainability of commodities, such as coffee.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The original harvesting basket had a cloth rag tied around the harvester’s back to secure it. There were several types of baskets commonly in use before this project (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812461272">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In Phase 1, the research team explained the project to the workers (in Spanish) at the beginning of the shift on the 1st day. If the worker agreed, an informed consent was read to them in Spanish and signed. They received the equivalent of $10 at the end of the 2nd day in addition to their regular pay from the farm for the amount of coffee cherries they picked. In this phase, a bag developed by Kate Stewart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812461272">Figure 2</xref>) was tested with the use of body map discomfort surveys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0018720812461272">Figure 3</xref>) and surface EMG recordings of the erector spinae and infraspinatus muscles at the beginning, middle, and end of the workday (approximately 8 working hours) with the use of Noroxan Telemetric equipment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0018720812461272">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0018720812461272">5</xref>).</p>

<p>The discomfort survey instrument also included questions about views on what was causing the discomfort and ideas for improving the bag. Test contractions were obtained prior to each recording in the field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0018720812461272">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<p>Electrodes remained in place during the course of the day. Percentage maximum voluntary contraction and referenced voluntary contraction were used as measures of muscle effort during the course of the day. Markings for electrode placement remained intact across the 2-day testing period for each participant. Nicaraguan researchers from UNAN-Leon assisted workers in completing discomfort surveys and the EMG test contractions as well as solicited worker input on positive and negative aspects of the new bag. A total of 19 workers (17 male, 2 female) from two farms participated in Phase 1.</p>
<p>Between Phase 1 and Phase 2, on the basis of worker feedback, the original bag was redesigned to make it smaller (shorter and with a smaller diameter). Local materials and manufacturing were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0018720812461272">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>In Phase 2, usability was the focus of worker and researcher interactions. The discomfort survey and opinions questionnaire were administered before and after work for 5 consecutive days. Usability testing was performed via on-site video observation and small-group discussions between workers and researchers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0018720812461272">Figure 7</xref>). Daily productivity data (volume of coffee cherries) picked during the study week, when the newly designed bag was used, was compared with the previous week, when the conventional basket was used.</p>

<title>Phase 1: Initial Data Collection</title>
<p>Participants used the bag one day and the basket the next day, or vice versa. Out of 19 basket users, 16 (84.2%) reported having problems in at least one of the 11 body regions, with a maximum score of 3 (moderate pain) in the back. Age, seniority, and days worked in the week were not correlated with any symptoms. Also, 15 bag users (78.9%) reported having at least one symptom in one of the body parts, with a maximum score of 3.</p>
<p>Symptoms score changes from start to end of shift for either bag or basket use were not significantly different for any of the body areas. However, there were different patterns of discomfort for the shoulder and back during the course of the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0018720812461272">Figure 8</xref>). For the shoulder, discomfort during bag use rose between the beginning of the shift (T0) and the middle of the shift (T1) and then leveled off, whereas during basket use, the discomfort was lower between T0 and T1 and then increased by the end of the shift (T2). The reverse was true for back discomfort, whereby discomfort increased steadily between T0 and T1 with the basket and decreased between T0 and T1 with the bag, suggesting improvement with the bag.</p>

<p>For the survey question, “If you use the bag, how much did you like this bag in comparison to your normal basket?” 14 (74%) of the participants said, “Much better”; 3 (16%) said, “Slightly better”; and 2 (10%) said, “Same.”</p>
<p>During Phase 1, EMG and biomechanical analyses showed high static loading in the L4/L5 region and contact stress from the rag used to secure the flat basket to the worker’s body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812461272">Figure 2</xref>). The flat basket was clearly not designed for steep terrain. There were no significant differences in EMG findings between the bag and the smaller basket for the left and right trapezius muscles or right erector spinae muscles during coffee cherry picking. There was no significant difference in right infraspinatus muscle between the bag and the small basket, although the large basket produced the highest load (<italic>ns</italic>) and was considered the worst by participants. The greatest load on the erector spinae and trapezius muscles was identified when workers had to lift a 40- to 50-kg sack onto their head or shoulder at the end of the shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0018720812461272">Figures 9a</xref> through <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0018720812461272">9c</xref>) and carry it down the mountain to the farmhouse, where it could be loaded onto a pickup truck.</p>

<p>Examining pictures and video recordings taken during the field collection periods, we identified possible explanations. The bag had a larger diameter compared with that of the small basket (although it was smaller than that of the large basket). The bag was also often adjusted with the straps so that it hung at a higher level compared with the location of the small basket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0018720812461272">Figure 10</xref>). When workers walked with a full bag to the location to dump the coffee cherries into the large sack, they often needed to go through dense coffee bushes. With the larger diameter and higher location of the bag, workers had to use their arms to help them go through the coffee bushes with frequent upper-arm abduction and external rotation movements. These movements probably created the higher left trapezius and right infraspinatus muscle loading when the bag was used.</p>

<p>Significant increase in reported ache or pain at the right shoulder was also noticed in the middle of the work shift compared with that at the start of the work shift, and such increase was significantly higher than that when the small basket was used. Similar but statistically nonsignificant trends were also shown in the left shoulder and neck region as well. Increased shoulder muscle activities (trapezius and infraspinatus muscles) were observed when the bag was used compared with when the small basket was used, although they were not statistically significant. These results suggest that the bag may have increased physical loading on the neck-shoulder region. A possible explanation is that the bag involved a lumbar-shoulder belt system, which redistributed some load onto the neck-shoulder region. From the worker survey, some workers also reported that the straps hurt their shoulders when the bag was full. Special attention needs to be paid to the lumbar-shoulder strap system to provide better load distribution and minimize physical stress to the workers’ bodies.</p>
<p>Some workers also complained about the size of the bag. It was too heavy when it was full, and it interfered with their legs during walking. The bag size may also be the reason that at the end of the workday, the left leg ache or pain rating was significantly higher than that before the shift when the bag was used. A smaller and shorter bag may solve this problem. A smaller bag could also help reduce the weight that workers carry, thus reducing muscle load on the shoulders and low back.</p>
<p>There were no significant differences in discomfort scores between the bag and small basket (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720812461272">Table 2</xref>), small basket and large basket (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018720812461272">Table 3</xref>), or bag and large basket (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0018720812461272">Table 4</xref>) at the end of the shift for all body areas. There were statistically significant differences in right infraspinatus muscle EMG when using the large basket because the worker had to reach farther to pick the cherries. During walking, the bag required significantly higher left trapezius and right infraspinatus loading compared with the small basket, and some participants indicated that using the bag was uncomfortable during walking (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720812461272">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Phase 2: Usability Testing</title>
<p>The usability phase of the project took place in November and December 2011. For the second phase, 19 workers (4 female, 15 male, mean age 31.5 ± 12.5 years, with some overlap with the original participants) used the second prototype bag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0018720812461272">Figure 6</xref>) for 5 consecutive days in different terrain and coffee bush conditions to test the usability of the new bag. An iterative participatory approach was used, with discussions at the end of each day about comfort and utility. Body discomfort and opinion questionnaires were administered before and after work for the 5 consecutive days. Usability testing consisted of on-site observations and video filming, followed by small-group discussions. Productivity data (volume of coffee cherries picked) for study week (bag used) was compared with the previous week (conventional small basket).</p>
<p>Workers confirmed that the second prototype bag overcame most of the problems with the first bag. They analyzed videotapes of different stages of coffee harvesting and identified and developed solutions to improve and finalize the most recent design.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0018720812461272">Figure 11</xref> shows the newly modified bag being used on very steep, slippery terrain. The workers reported that the horizontal distance was still too great when picking cherries. They also suggested that proper adjustment of shoulder strap length is important so the bag will not interfere with arm and leg movements. Usability testing indicated that workers reported discomfort in using straps that tend to be easily twisted. They suggested that wider straps would be better. In addition, a bag often hits against the legs when full; thus overall length should be shorter. Since the new bags can contain more cherries than the old ones, it is often difficult to dump cherries into a sack when the bag is too full. Thus work technique may be important; that is, workers suggested dumping the bag when it is half full. In terms of changes in productivity, there was no statistically significant difference between the present week (bag used) and the previous week (basket used) (<italic>p</italic> = .87, Student’s <italic>t</italic> test).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0018720812461272">Figure 9</xref> shows the task with the heaviest load on the erector spinae and right trapezius muscles, lifting the 40- to 50-kg full sacks from the ground to the shoulder and head to carry it down the steep, rugged path back to the farmhouse for transport. This load is similar to the high demands on the back identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812461272">Fathallah (2008)</xref>. Researchers suggested some kind of flexible tubing snaking through the forest into which beans could be poured. Workers improved on this proposal to suggest using water from the high terrain poured into the tubing to help propel the coffee cherries down the mountain and clean them at the same time. The farms will test this approach during the next harvesting season.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The ultimate goal is to make the design pattern of the bag widely available for general use in coffee-producing areas of the world where workers might find it more comfortable and productive than their current methods. The iterative process that included direct measurements of load (Phase 1) on the erector spinae and infraspinatus muscles combined with discomfort surveys not only identified issues with the first bag but also encouraged worker participation in design and testing of a new iteration with the second bag. Because the bag was made locally, with local materials and worker input, there is increased possibility for sustainment and continuous improvement with more testing at the local level. Word of this participatory ergonomics approach has spread throughout other coffee-growing regions via 4C and Ecom, with increasing interest in replicating the process in these countries.</p>
