<p><italic>Participatory Journalism: Guarding Open Gates at Online Newspapers</italic> is a critical read for scholars and journalism practitioners alike interested in the one of the most significant changes sweeping the journalistic landscape in a Web 2.0 world: the shift from one-to-many mass media to two-way communication. Enabled by the convenience of new technology, audiences can now play an increasingly active role in the journalistic process, though, as the authors show, this has been met with ambivalence by journalists who welcome the diversity of new voices but fear that participation will undermine their professional authority and values. The authors do an excellent job situating their study and the concept of participation within the broader body of research and theory on journalism, but also offer useful insights into the practical realities of how journalists are addressing an increasingly active audience in the newsroom today.</p>
<p>Informed by interviews with 67 print and online editors and other journalists employed by two dozen leading national newspapers in 10 western democracies, the book has a global perspective often lacking in newsroom research, although the similarities in attitudes and approaches to participation among journalists from diverse nations were more striking than the differences. Journalists’ attitudes toward participation can be divided into two general groups bearing some resemblance to the Lippman and Dewey debate of yore, though many expressed elements of both views, reflecting the complexities of managing newsroom change and integrating participation into journalistic culture and routines at a time of decreased resources.</p>
<p>One group, represented especially by younger journalists at more populist papers, believes increased audience participation serves the core journalistic function of providing a forum for criticism and compromise, enhances democracy by ensuring a greater volume and diversity of voices in the public sphere, and can build brand loyalty by creating a sense of community among users. The second group is concerned that participation undermines both journalists’ status as professionals and the brand by ceding some of newspapers’ control over what appears under their names, pointing out the often-abusive nature of comments and the difficulty in determining the origin and veracity of users’ posts. Even those in the latter group, however, see participation as increasingly necessary in a competitive economic environment, but they prefer to keep it clearly labeled as distinct and at a distance from professionally produced content. These two conceptions of participation reflect a host of legal and ethical issues the book also explores in detail, although interestingly, despite considerable fears, just one journalist interviewed for the book had faced a lawsuit or other legal claim over content generated by users.</p>
<p>Journalists’ conception of participation is of course tied to their views of their audience, and the book articulates a useful concept, ‘active recipients’, which positions the audience as ‘somewhere between passive receivers and active creators of content’ (p. 178). This term is apt at a time when, as the authors document, audience participation as sources of news is expanding, particularly in serendipitous breaking-news situations in which they can serve as journalists’ additional eyes and ears, and in the interpretation phase, when readers can comment on published news. However, journalists remain especially guarded about involving the reader in other phases of news production, especially when it comes to news judgment and the traditional gatekeeping role.</p>
<p>One chapter of the book questions whether journalists are transforming participation into a commodity, essentially exploiting unpaid contributors to juice eyeballs on content and promising more than can be delivered in terms of democratic ideals. While this Marxian analysis is valid, it risks viewing participation in an either/or paradigm, which is of dubious value given that capturing increasingly scarce attention to matters of civic importance and the independence fostered by sustainable business models are also important journalistic goals.</p>
<p>The authors offer some useful best practices for enhancing the quality of participation, such as privileging curation over heavy-handed moderation, involving the audience in reporting and rating others’ contributions, actively engaging with readers, and creating new job positions like community manager that help journalists deal with volume.</p>
<p>A relatively undeveloped aspect of participation in this book is the difficulty of getting the audience to actively contribute in more than the interpretive, post-publication stage of news. Even if journalists overcome their inhibitions about audiences taking a greater role in the selection/filtering and processing/editing phases of news production, it remains a valid question whether throwing open the doors to greater participation means people will be motivated to actually do so. The authors write that ‘some interviewees remarked that, actually, users may not be willing to submit journalistic content’ (p. 42), but this lack of motivation is largely addressed as an assumption rather than as a reality; however, the many more ambitious experiments with pro-am journalism like Assignment Zero did find this to be one of the challenges, if not insurmountable, these efforts face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911428023">Howe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911428023">Rosen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, perhaps the most fascinating nugget in the book: the authors note that in 18th-century England and early colonial America, newspapers contained blank spaces for readers to add their thoughts before passing it on for others to read. Participation, as it turns out, is not such a new phenomenon at all, but this book provides a comprehensive, detailed guide to its contours today.</p>
