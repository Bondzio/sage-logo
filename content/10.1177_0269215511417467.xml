<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As healthcare systems around the world move towards fee-for-service funding models, the Department of Health for England has embarked on a programme called ‘Payment by Results’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511417467">1</xref></sup> In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) is actually made up of four separate health services (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), each with slightly different contracting arrangements. The model described in this article relates, so far, to the English experience. However, the issues are wide-reaching and the principles discussed have relevance, not only for other parts of the UK, but also for other countries with socially supported health systems.</p>
<p>The Payment by Results programme introduces activity-based payment systems to reimburse providers on a case-by-case basis – as opposed to a ‘block contract model’, in which the provider is paid a flat annual fee to provide an agreed level of service. Payment is made according to a standard national ‘tariff’ – the price tag attached to any unit of care, wherever it is delivered. The challenge, however, is to develop a casemix classification and associated payment model which are fair to both the provider and purchaser, by accounting adequately for the mix and complexity of patients treated and the care and resources involved.</p>
<p>Rehabilitation poses some particular challenges for casemix development. These are described in a companion paper, alongside a description of other international casemix and payment models to explore how other countries have addressed this problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511417467">2</xref></sup> Readers unfamiliar with this area of work may find it helpful to read that article first, as it provides useful contextual background to this paper. Payment models range from ‘episode rates’ (prospective payment of a ‘fixed tariff’ for each episode regardless of length of stay), to ‘bed-day’ or ‘per diem’ rates (payment at a standard daily tariff). Both systems have disadvantages, so other alternative payment models have been explored for rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511417467">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511417467">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The English casemix classification of ‘Healthcare Resource Groups’ (HRG version 4) currently includes just 20 categories for inpatient rehabilitation, based on diagnostic codes. However, the Department of Health for England has accepted that further refinement is required for the classification to be fit for the purpose of defining casemix and associated tariff development. Learning from international casemix models, the Expert Reference Panel for HRG Development in Rehabilitation has proposed a casemix and costing methodology based on patient complexity and patient level costing.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is (a) to describe the rationale and methods that will be used for collection and collation of casemix data and costing information and (b) to present preliminary data of the type that will underpin the development of a multilevel weighted payment model, and ultimately tariff development in the context of rehabilitation in England. The model is presented in the context of neurological rehabilitation, where existing casemix models perform particularly poorly. However, it is expected to have application in other areas of rehabilitation and long-term care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269215511417467">
<title>Rationale for development of a new methodology</title>
<p>Diagnosis is a relatively poor indicator of costs for in-patient rehabilitation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511417467">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511417467">7</xref></sup> where nursing and therapy staff input (as opposed to medical treatments) are the major cost-indicators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511417467">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511417467">10</xref></sup> Many of the well-established international casemix systems use function-related casemix classifications, based on measures of physical independence in activities of daily living (e.g. the Functional Independence Measure (FIM)) as a surrogate for resource requirements. However, for reasons described in the companion paper,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511417467">2</xref></sup> these do not perform well as predictors of cost in patients with complex neurological conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511417467">11</xref></sup> which form the bulk of the caseload for the majority of specialist rehabilitation services in the UK. Therefore, although these international casemix systems provide a useful model to build on, they are not in themselves fit for purpose as a casemix and costing model for rehabilitation in the UK.</p>
<p>In addition, the UK has a very different health culture from that in the United States or Australia. The UK NHS provides the most comprehensive publicly funded healthcare system in the world. In the light of current plans to merge health and social services, rehabilitation services have an increasingly important role, because the State will at last be able to recoup the cost benefits of improved independence through long-term savings in the cost of ongoing care. Under these conditions, longer lengths of stay in rehabilitation may be supported to allow patients with more complex needs to reach their full potential, providing they can be justified on grounds of cost-efficiency (i.e. it can be demonstrated that the savings in ongoing care offset the initial investment in rehabilitation).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511417467">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511417467">13</xref></sup> However, this requires a different approach to payment. Patients with complex needs are expected to incur higher treatment costs, which will vary over time. Fair payment should be weighted in proportion to costs of providing treatment, and should also vary in relation to those costs, as the patient’s needs change over time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269215511417467">
<title>Brief overview of proposed casemix and payment model</title>
<p>The Department of Health for England has defined three levels of specialization for rehabilitation services<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511417467">14</xref></sup> which are detailed in the companion paper.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511417467">2</xref></sup> Level 1 (tertiary) and level 2 (district level) specialist services are those with the skills and resources to provide rehabilitation for more complex cases. They will be designated by the service commissioners in line with predefined criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511417467">14</xref></sup> The proposed multilevel payment model will be applied in these designated units.</p>
<p>To improve the sensitivity of the casemix classification, episodes of rehabilitation within each HRG category will be adjusted for case complexity. The weighted per diem payment model is based on serial complexity ratings, which will be measured using the Rehabilitation Complexity Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511417467">11</xref></sup> (see below).</p>
<list id="list1-0269215511417467" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The payment is weighted in proportion to the differential costs of treating patients in five bands of complexity, based on the total RCS score.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The daily payment rate is adjusted according the level of complexity, and so allows for change over time.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Payment for the overall episode is calculated at discharge, depending on the number of days the patient spent at any given complexity level.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The critical feature of this casemix and payment model is that it is fair to both payer and provider. The provider receives reimbursement to meet the additional costs of providing for patients with complex needs. However, the payer does not continue to pay high rates for a patient who had very complex needs on admission, but who progresses to lower levels of need in the course of their recovery. Complexity may go up or down, but is expected to fall for most patients over time as they regain independence, and the corresponding reduction in payment provides an incentive towards early discharge.</p>
<p>In order to claim the higher rate payments for patients with complex needs, specialist services must also be able to demonstrate that they provide the additional inputs to meet those needs. Similarly, payers who meet those extra costs are entitled to ask for evidence that their investment has led to meaningful outcomes in terms of improved independence, reduced ongoing care costs, or at least the attainment of individual goals for rehabilitation. Therefore a national data set has been established to record ‘needs’, ‘inputs’ and ‘outcomes’. Service designation will be contingent on data set reporting for all specialist inpatient neurorehabilitation episodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511417467">14</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section4-0269215511417467">
<title>How the data will be gathered</title>
<p>In 2008, the UK National Institute for Health Research awarded a five-year Programme Grant for the development of a nationally coordinated approach to casemix development and person-centred commissioning for the provision of neurorehabilitation services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511417467">15</xref></sup> The programme is registered as a Payment by Results Improvement Project and is being undertaken in collaboration with the British Society of Rehabilitation Medicine and the NHS Information Centre. The Australasian Rehabilitation Outcomes Centre (AROC) is a third collaborating organization, as our proposed methodology is modelled on systems which have been developed over the last 10 years in Australia.</p>
<p>An agreed national data set has been established and is currently being collated through the UK Rehabilitation Outcomes Collaborative (UKROC) database. The database will ultimately provide centralized collation and analysis of patient episode data from all level 1 and level 2 specialist inpatient neurorehabilitation services. Once the payment model is fully developed, the database will have the functionality to provide automated calculation of the weighted payment for each episode from serial RCS ratings and length of stay data. In addition to providing information on casemix and costing to inform development of national tariffs, the database will also have future application for benchmarking of services, and prospective cohort analysis to evaluate effectiveness and cost-efficiency in different service models. Although primarily designed for implementation of Payment by Results in England, the UKROC database is available to all UK countries.</p>
<sec id="section5-0269215511417467">
<title>Data collection systems – the UKROC data set and tools for data collection</title>
<p>The full UKROC data set (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215511417467">Appendix 1</xref>) includes information on patient demographics, response and waiting times, diagnosis/procedure codes, length of stay and discharge destination. It also includes a series of tools to capture: (a) complexity of rehabilitation needs, (b) the inputs provided to meet those needs and (c) outcomes. The system is hierarchical, more detailed tools being used to define higher levels of complexity in low volume/high cost services, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511417467">Figure 1</xref>. The payment model described here is designed for level 1 and 2 specialist services.</p>

<caption><p>Tools for measuring complexity of need, inputs and outcomes across the three levels of rehabilitation service provision. A hierarchical system of data collection has been developed, so that low-cost/high-volume services are not overburdened by data collection. The RCS and Barthel Index offer simple practical measurement of complexity and outcome in the level 3 and some level 2 services. For level 1 services, the Northwick Park Dependency Scales and the Functional Assessment Measure (with optional goal attainment scaling) provide more detailed definition of the needs and interventions as well as opportunities for evaluation of outcomes and cost-efficiency in patients with complex needs.</p></caption>

<title>Costing methodology</title>
<p>In 2009, the Department of Health for England published standards for patient-level costing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511417467">27</xref></sup> Few services in the UK have patient-level costing systems sophisticated enough to allocate the direct costs of treatment to individual patients prospectively. Instead, we have taken a pragmatic approach.</p>
<p>Service costing information is gathered from retrospective analysis of unit budget statements and accounting costs. Reported costs are then verified by site visits to ensure that there is a consistent approach to cost definition, attribution and allocation. A standard template has been devised for attributing individual lines within the budget statement to different cost types, based on the Department of Health for England’s Patient Level Costing Standards. This will allow more detailed future analysis to identify the source of any large cost variances between different services. As a starting point, costs are collated under three main cost types (‘direct costs’, ‘indirect costs’ and ‘overheads’) as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215511417467">Table 1</xref>. The majority of direct costs vary with patient throughput or complexity, and are either ‘variable’ (e.g. staff pay, consumables) or ‘semi-fixed’ (ward and administration) costs; while indirect costs and overheads costs are largely ‘fixed’.</p>

<title>Bed day costs and weighted costing model</title>
<p>At the simplest level, average bed day costs may be derived from the total annual cost divided by the annual occupied bed days as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269215511417467">Figure 2a</xref>. However, these do not take account of the differential costs of treating patients with complex needs. The weighted bed-day costing model has been developed allow for this variation in cost.</p>

<caption><p>Simple and weighted costing models. (a) Simple costing model. (b) Weighted costing model. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215511417467">Table 3</xref> for derivation of the banding factor. (a) Shows how the fixed and variable portions of the bed-day cost is derived from the patient level costing figures. (b) For the purpose of illustrating the model simply, a base rate of £400 per bed-day was taken, giving a variable portion (75%) of £300 and a fixed portion (25%) of £100. Multiplication of the variable portion only by the banding factor then provides the banded costs from which a set of costing multipliers is derived. *See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215511417467">Table 3</xref> for derivation of the banding factor.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>In this model, weighting is applied only to the variable proportion of the bed-day cost, which is expected to vary with patient complexity. The key determinants of rehabilitation complexity are the requirements for nursing, therapy and medical care, and staff time makes up the greatest component of the variable costs. In our weighted model, the total rehabilitation complexity score is used to band patients into five different levels of complexity: very low (RCS 0–3), low (4–6), medium (7–9), high (10–12) and very high (13–15). Information derived from parallel application of the Northwick Park Dependency Scales is then used to determine the relative proportions of staff time associated with each complexity band. This staff time ratio is then applied as a banding factor to the variable portion of the bed-day cost to derive a banded cost, from which a costing multiplier is developed, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269215511417467">Figure 2b</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section8-0269215511417467">
<title>Exemplar of the weighted costing model based on preliminary data collected in one service</title>
<p>Development of the weighted costing model is best understood through an illustrative example. Preliminary data have been collated from one service to demonstrate how this model will be applied.</p>
<p>The Regional Rehabilitation Unit at Northwick Park Hospital provides a tertiary (level 1) specialist inpatient neurorehabilitation service for younger adults (mainly aged 16–65 years) with complex neurological disabilities. The unit has a ring-fenced budget, and analysis of the budget statement and accounting figures from 2008/9 demonstrated that the variable costs made up approximately 75% of the total annual costs, with non-variable (fixed and semi-fixed) costs accounting for the remaining 25%.</p>
<p>Within this service, complexity (RCS) scores, and dependency scores (NPDS and NPTDA) scores are routinely collected at fortnightly intervals for all patients. The scores are recorded as part of routine care-planning, and collated in the main multidisciplinary ward round. Now that all staff are familiar with the tools and fully trained in their use, the dependency scores take 5–10 minutes to rate per patient, and it takes no more than 5–7 minutes to record RCS scores across the whole ward (24 beds). Staff use the information on a daily basis for clinical planning and decision-making, and so do not report excessive burden in gathering these data.</p>
<p>During the 30-month period between June 2006 and December 2008, 1200 parallel ratings were collated for the consecutive cohort of all admitted patients – a total of 179 cases. The mean age of this sample was 44 years (SD 14.8) and the male : female ratio was 110 : 69. A total of 139 (78%) had acquired brain injury (49% stroke, 14% traumatic and 14% other causes); 20 (11%) had spinal cord injury and 20 (11%) other neurological conditions). The mean length of stay was 78 days (SD 64, range 12–469). The relationship between the RCS, FIM, Barthel Index and dependency scores in this series is described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511417467">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first step in development of the weighted costing model was to determine the relative proportions of staff time associated with each of the five complexity bands. Each RCS score provides a snapshot of the case complexity of an individual for the week in which it was recorded, and the corresponding NPDS and NPTDA provide an estimate of the hours of therapy and nursing staff time that were utilized for that patient during that week. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511417467">Table 2</xref> shows a breakdown of the mean nursing and therapy hours per week for each of the five complexity bands from our 1200 parallel ratings. In this sample there were no RCS ratings in the 0–3 score range. The box plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269215511417467">Figure 3</xref> confirm that the data for total staff hours/week within the remaining bands are normally distributed and separate quite cleanly into the four bands. The midpoint (RCS score 7–9) is taken as the reference point for the purpose of banding, and the ratio of total staff time is expressed in relation to the mean value for this medium complexity group, giving two higher and two lower bands.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269215511417467">Figure 2b</xref>, this staff time ratio is applied as a ‘banding factor’ to the variable portion of the bed-day cost and added to the non-variable portion to develop banded costs, from which a set of costing multipliers is derived to develop the weighted bed-day costing model. This example is set on a notional mid-point rate of £400 per bed day to simplify the calculations, but the costing multipliers so derived are independent of the figure chosen for this mid-point rate and vary only with the staff time ratio and the proportion of variable and non-variable costs. The base rate for the costing multiplier was taken as RCS 4–6 (rather than 0–3) because a previous cross-sectional analysis of RCS scores from 45 specialist inpatient neurorehabilitation services (levels 1 and 2) across the UK showed that RCS scores below 4 are rarely recorded in these specialist services,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511417467">28</xref></sup> which is also in keeping with experience from our unit.</p>

<p>Before this weighted costing model could be used to inform tariff development at a national level, we need to examine the extent of variability between different service levels and types and to describe the reasons for that variation. The next step in development is therefore to obtain similar sets of costing and activity data from a range of different services. An accompanying paper in this issue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511417467">29</xref></sup> reports preliminary costing data from 17 specialist neurorehabilitation services across England.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269215511417467" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper we have proposed a novel casemix and costing methodology to underpin the development of healthcare tariffs for specialist neurorehabilitation in the UK, and presented data from one service to illustrate how the multilevel weighted payment model would be applied.</p>
<p>As noted in the companion paper,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511417467">2</xref></sup> many of the international casemix models use the FIM or Barthel Index as a proxy of needs for rehabilitation but, for the reasons already given, these do not perform well in complex neurorehabilitation settings. The Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-III) casemix classification offers a further alternative, which is similar to our approach in that it attempts to capture costs more directly through resource use across therapy, nursing and medical care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511417467">30</xref></sup> However, the RUG-III was found to have limited application in the context of specialist neurological rehabilitation because of ceiling effects in the rehabilitation intensity groupings (the highest category receives ‘450 minutes (7.5 hours) or more of rehabilitation per week’, which is just half of the therapy time received by the lowest RCS category in our series).</p>
<p>The Rehabilitation Complexity Scale takes a broader based approach to the categorization of complexity, capturing care, nursing therapy and medical needs in parallel. It was designed to be very simple and intuitive to apply, with minimal rating burden for clinical staff. It is shown to be psychometrically robust and to capture medical and therapy inputs not identified by the FIM or Barthel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511417467">11</xref></sup> Like the RUG-III, it has some ceiling effects and an extended version (the RCS-E) has recently been developed. Whether either of these instruments will provide adequate explanation of the variance in costs of treatment on their own, or whether further parameters will need to be included in the equation, will become clear over time and in the course of this programme. However there are advantages to all parties if the system can be kept as simple as possible.</p>
<p>The authors recognize some limitations to this approach:</p>
<list id="list4-0269215511417467" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The lack of fully developed patient level costing systems means that costing data can at best be an approximation. The exemplar service described here was fortunate in having a ring-fenced budget and accounting system. We acknowledge that it may prove harder for some services to separate out the costs of their services from more general departmental budgets. Nevertheless we believe that this method is significantly more robust than the standard reporting of reference costs, by which the Department of Health for England otherwise gathers information on service costs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The tools by which complexity of rehabilitation needs and the interventions provided to meet those needs are undergoing further development in parallel with the data collection. Ideally, the tools would be fully developed and evaluated prior to application. However the timescale for introduction of Payment by Results is such that these two stages must be undertaken in parallel. That said, the psychometric characteristics of the instruments have been well described and they are shown to be robust even in their current form.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The estimate of staff hours provided by the Northwick Park Dependency tools may not be as accurate as formal activity analysis, but they are used here because they are timely to apply in routine clinical practice. As the introduction of Payment by Results is intended to be cost neutral, it is the relative proportion of staff time across the different bands rather than the absolute values that are of primary interest. Therefore they are considered to be adequate for this purpose.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The RCS provides only a crude evaluation of requirements for rehabilitation, and we recognize that more detailed tools will be required to define the precise patient characteristics which determine needs for treatment and which patients will benefit. However, users report that it is easy to collect,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511417467">28</xref></sup> which is keeping with our experience, and the data presented here suggest that it provides reasonably robust separation for the purpose of banding into broad levels of resource use.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>As with any casemix system, there is the theoretical potential for gaming – for example if providers were to overscore the RCS scores to in order to maximize income. The parallel collection of dependency scores and staff profiles provides some protection against this, as inputs should be commensurate with complexity profiles, and units with low staffing levels simply could not provide the require intensity of rehabilitation. The requirement for submission of data to the national UKROC database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511417467">14</xref></sup> provides a critical opportunity for benchmarking and comparison. Experience from the Australian data set suggests that any consistent anomalies in the data are usually quite readily identified, through robust central data monitoring and comparative analysis (AROC team, personal communication, 2011).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Even with the proposed multilevel weighted payment model, the generation of national tariffs may prove challenging, as payment for patient treatment must cover all costs and services vary widely in the extent of services offered. For example, some provide bespoke equipment as part of treatment, others charge separately for this. In addition, not all clinical roles can be explicitly linked to individual patient care. Some act as specialist advice centres, providing very extensive support for local and community teams as part of their service, while others operate in relative isolation. Setting a national tariff on the average performance may therefore result in loss of valued activities, unless these can be identified and accounted for as part of the cost reporting.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To address this latter issue, the Department of Health for England has recently introduced ‘Best Practice Tariffs’ which set tariff prices normatively (i.e. what the cost should be if best practice is followed, rather than the national average of reference costs).<sup>31</sup> Normative pricing represents an alternative incentive model to change practice according to predetermined quality criteria, providing those criteria can be adequately defined and justified. This may be an option for future tariff development in the context of rehabilitation, and is currently being explored in the context of stroke rehabilitation in level 3 services only (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511417467">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Throughout the world, casemix for community-based care has lagged behind inpatient care. Ongoing developments in the England include the introduction of community and ‘pathway’ tariffs, which support vertical integration of payment for services across the hospital–community divide. As yet the methodology for pathway tariffs is poorly defined, but the multilevel payment model proposed here would lend itself very well to pathway tariffs, and so may have much wider application and policy relevance than just within the field of rehabilitation. It could, for example, be applied in many areas of longer term care including palliative care, mental health and ongoing support for patients with chronic conditions. We further believe that this model may also have relevance for other countries, especially those with well-developed state-supported care systems, which will allow the savings accrued from long-term reduction of care costs to be rechannelled to support adequate investment in rehabilitation.</p>

<title>Competing interests</title>
<p>Outcome measurement is a specific research interest of our centre. The RCS, NPDS and NPCNA were all developed through this department, but are disseminated free of charge. Professor Turner-Stokes is lead author on the papers which describe their initial development and validation, as well as that of the UK version of the FIM+FAM. However, none of the authors has any personal financial interests in the work undertaken or the findings reported. We are not aware of any other competing or conflicts of interest.</p>
