<title>Background:</title>
<p>The promotion of self-care in patients with heart failure (HF) is a promising strategy for maintaining health and preventing exacerbation of HF and a continuous need for healthcare services. To assess patient self-care, valid and reliable instruments are needed, but there is no psychometrically tested instrument for use in a German HF population.</p>

<title>Aim:</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to determine the validity and reliability of the German version of the 9-item European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour Scale (G9-EHFScBS).

</sec>
<sec id="section3-1474515112438639">
<title>Methods and results:</title>
<p>The G9-EHFScBS was translated into German, and its validity and reliability were tested with 109 patients. The item-total correlation ranged from 0.09 to 0.63. Internal consistency was fair, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.71 (95%CI: 0.63 to 0.77). Test–retest reliability using an intra-class correlation coefficient showed substantial agreement for the entire scale (ICC: 0.69; 95%CI: 0.56 to 0.79). The G9-EHFScBS was able to distinguish patients with and without extra HF education at a statistically significant level (t = 2.105; p = 0.04).

<title>Introduction</title>
<sec id="section6-1474515112438639">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Heart failure (HF) is one of the most prevalent diseases in Western industrialised countries. In Europe, approximately 2–3% of the population suffer from HF, with expected increases in incidence and prevalence in coming decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112438639">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112438639">2</xref></sup> Despite the advancements in medical treatment, overall hospital readmission rates of HF patients remain high. The treatment of HF patients accounts for up to 2% of total healthcare expenditure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112438639">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112438639">4</xref></sup> For example in Germany, HF was the leading reason for hospital admission in 2006, with an annual cost of €2.9 billion for all levels of treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112438639">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to optimising medical therapy, improving patient self-care is regarded as a strategy for reducing the economic burden of HF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112438639">6</xref></sup> Enhancing a patient’s ability to follow lifestyle and medical recommendations and to recognise the symptoms and signs of worsening HF and adequately react to these signs (e.g. contacting healthcare providers) can lead to decreased rehospitalisation rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112438639">6</xref></sup> However, delays in care-seeking in cases of HF symptoms remain common.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112438639">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112438639">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Self-care education by healthcare providers is an excellent strategy to improve patient self-care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112438639">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112438639">11</xref></sup> To evaluate the outcomes of self-care education, valid and reliable instruments measuring self-care in HF patients are needed. Only two instruments have undergone sufficient psychometric testing: the European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour Scale (EHFScBS) and the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112438639">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In preparation for a study about the effects of HF education on patient performance of self-care measures, we decided to use the EHFScBS. Although a German version of the EHFScBS already exists, it has not been tested psychometrically. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the German version of the 9-item European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour Scale (G9-EHFScBS).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1474515112438639">
<title>The European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour Scale</title>
<p>The first version of the EHFScBS was published by Jaarsma and colleagues in 2003.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112438639">13</xref></sup> It was a self-administered questionnaire that contained 20 items on different aspects of HF-related self-care. The responses were dichotomous (yes/no). The items could be conceptually divided into three dimensions, covering statements about compliance with the overall HF regime, actions to take in case of worsening HF and adapting activities to HF. The first psychometric testing, performed on 197 Dutch HF patients, showed only sufficient reliability, with Cronbach’s alpha &lt; 0.7. The theoretically assumed dimensions could not be fully confirmed by a factor analysis. Some of the items loaded on more than one factor, which led to the decision to use only a sumscore and to revise the scale.</p>
<p>After re-rating the importance of every item, the number of items was reduced from 20 to 12. The scoring format was revised, and items could now be answered on a 5-pointLikert scale, ranging from 1 (I completely agree) to 5 (I don’t agree at all). The scale was psychometrically tested in 442 patients in three countries (the Netherlands, Sweden and Italy).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112438639">13</xref></sup> Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.69 to 0.93, and a factor analysis confirmed only one of the assumed dimensions. The ability of the scale to discriminate between patients with and without extra HF education (discriminant validity) was tested and confirmed.</p>
<p>The EHFScBS was tested and revised again in 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112438639">14</xref></sup> A pooled convenience sample from six countries (the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK, Italy, Germany and Spain) was used to determine construct validity, convergent validity, discriminant validity and reliability. Content validity was confirmed by patients and researchers and through a review of existing HF guidelines. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the assumed three-dimensionality of the scale but was not able to demonstrate model fitting. A one-factor analysis showed insufficient results. Due to the results of the item-total correlation and the CFA, the number of items was reduced from 12 to 9.</p>
<p>The 9-item version of the EHFScBS was moderately correlated with the revised Heart Failure Compliance Questionnaire but poorly correlated with the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, a quality of life (QoL) questionnaire. The reliability of the 9-item scale was 0.77.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1474515112438639">
<title>Translation and modification of the 9-item EHFScBS</title>
<p>In preparation for this study, the 9-item EHFScBS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112438639">14</xref></sup> was translated into German again. This decision to re-translate the EHFScBS was made based on the author’s belief that some of the translated items did not match the original meaning. For example, ‘fatigue’ was translated into ‘Tagesmüdigkeit’, which means, if back-translated, ‘daytime sleepiness’. However, sleepiness is seen as a criterion for chronic fatigue syndrome or a disease in itself,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112438639">15</xref></sup> even though it is often used as a synonym for fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112438639">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>After receiving permission from the authors, we performed a translation according to the model of Brislin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112438639">17</xref></sup> The EHFScBS was translated into German by four German nurses with excellent knowledge of the English language. The four translated scales were compared, and differences were discussed by the translators and one of the authors (S.K.). A conjoint version was then developed. This version was back-translated into English by three healthcare providers who are native English speakers. The back-translated versions were checked for any differences in meaning with the original version by a professional translator. No differences in meaning were detected.</p>
<p>Every item was checked for consistency with the German HF guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112438639">18</xref></sup> to ensure content validity. One difference was detected. Consequently, the item ‘If I gain 2 kg in 1 week. . .’ was changed to ‘If I gain more than 2 kg in 3 days. . .’. Additionally, even though the German HF guidelines no longer recommend salt restriction, this item was retained. Our experience in caring for HF patients suggests that dietary salt restriction is an important aspect of HF self-care. For example, salty foods could lead to an excessive thirst, with a consequent fluid intake in excess of recommended amounts. This possibility must be taken into account by the patient and should therefore be discussed within an education session about HF self-care behaviours.</p>
<p>After this modification, we performed a pre-test with 20 patients for comprehensibility. Patients were asked if they had any trouble understanding the items or completing the questionnaire. None of the patients indicated any difficulties.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section10-1474515112438639">
<title>Design</title>
<p>To evaluate the validity and reliability of the German version of the 9-item EHFScBS (G9-EHFScBS), a cross-sectional survey was conducted between May 2010 and February 2011 at the Department of Cardiology of a university-affiliated hospital in southern Germany. Construct validity including factor analysis and discriminant validity, concurrent validity, test–retest reliability and internal consistency was analysed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1474515112438639">
<title>Study population</title>
<p>Patients who were diagnosed with chronic HF and admitted to the Department of Cardiology or attended the HF outpatient clinic were screened for eligibility to participate in this study. Exclusion criteria were as follows: age &lt; 18, could not sufficiently read/understand the German language, diagnosed with HF for the first time, life expectancy &lt; 3 months as judged by the attending physician, hospital stay within the last 14 days and disorientation towards one of the following perspectives: time, person, situation or location.</p>
<p>While recommendations about an optimal sample size for factor analysis don’t exist,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112438639">19</xref></sup> we used a 10:1 ratio approach (i.e. 10 patients per variable) which is seen as a rather broad sample size calculation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112438639">20</xref></sup> To ensure sufficient complete data sets, 165 patients were approached and 109 ultimately took part in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1474515112438639">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Eligible patients were asked to participate and received written information about the study aims and procedure. In-depth information was provided by the researcher. If the patient was willing to participate, a consent form was signed. The study protocol was approved by the local ethical committee, and the study conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112438639">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Data collection was performed using self-administered questionnaires that were handed out to the patients during their hospital stays or during their visitsto the outpatient clinic. Socio-demographic and disease-specific data were collected from the patients directly and by reviewing their medical records.</p>
<p>To determine test–retest reliability the G9-EHFScBS was sent out to the patients 2 weeks after discharge, with the request to fill out the questionnaire again and return it to the investigator by post. Participants who received an in-hospital education about self-care behaviours received the G9-EHFScBS twice after the education session (4 and 6 weeks after discharge). If the patients did not return the questionnaire after 2 weeks, an additional questionnaire with a reminder letter was sent out.</p>
<p>Although an optimal time interval to measure test–retest reliability is unknown, Streiner and Norman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112438639">22</xref>,p.182</sup> suggest that using a time interval of 2 to 14 days is acceptable. We used a 14-day time interval under the assumption that self-care will remain largely the same within this period. During these 14 days, patients received no extra education and were not receiving special support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1474515112438639">
<title>Measurements</title>
<p>To assess discriminant validity, each participant completed the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), which measures health-related quality of life (QoL). As shown in previous studies, QoL and self-care in terms of performing self-care measures are not related constructs, even though there is a statistically significant relationship between QoL and patients’ confidence in following self-care recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112438639">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112438639"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112438639"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474515112438639">26</xref></sup> Our hypothesis was that QoL as measured by the KCCQ and self-care as measured by the G9-EHFScBS are not correlated.</p>
<p>The KCCQ is a reliable and valid instrument that measures a patient’s QoL; it consists of six domains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474515112438639">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474515112438639">28</xref></sup> The KCCQ has 23 items, each rated by a Likert scale with different ranges. The standardised total score ranges from 0 to 100, with a lower score indicating a lower QoL.</p>
<p>Patients received the G9-EHFScBS to assess their self-care behaviours. It contains nine statements about HF-specific self-care which have to be rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Only the poles of the Likert scale are labelled (‘completely agree’ and ‘I don’t agree at all’).The sum score of the G9-EHFScBS ranged from 9 to 45, with lower scores indicating better self-care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1474515112438639">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The data were coded and entered into IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 19. The data that were missing from the G9-EHFScBS were substituted according to the rule of the scale’s developer. In detail, if fewer than three items of the total scale were missing, then every missing item was substituted with a 3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112438639">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The missing values within a domain of the KCCQ were also substituted according to the developer’s guidelines. They were assigned as the mean of the answered item within the specific domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474515112438639">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Descriptive statistics were used to describe the patient characteristics. Nominal scaled variables are displayed as numbers and percentages. Interval scaled variables are displayed as the mean values and standard deviations if normally distributed; otherwise, they are displayed as medians and interquartile ranges.</p>
<p>Data of all single items of the G9-EHFScBS were handled as interval scales. This was based on the argument that Likert scales could be considered as approximate interval-scaled if just the poles of the scale are labelled and these poles are the extremes of a continuum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1474515112438639">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Internal consistency reliability was determined using Cronbach’s alpha. The 95% confidence interval of Cronbach’s alpha was calculated using the formula provided by Streiner and Norman.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112438639">22</xref>,p.92–93</sup> According to Ponterotto and Ruckdeschel’s matrix for estimating the adequacy of internal consistency coefficients with research measures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1474515112438639">30</xref></sup> a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.70 is deemed fair, 0.75 is deemed moderate, 0.80 is deemed good, and 0.85 is deemed excellent for a scale of 7–11 items and a sample size between 100 and 300.</p>
<p>To describe the test–retest reliability of the G9-EHFScBS, an intra-classcorrelation coefficient (ICC) with a 95% confidence interval was used. To determine the test–retest reliability, the ICC was used due to its sensitive detection of systematic error within the measured variables over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1474515112438639">31</xref></sup> An ICC of 0.21–0.40 indicates fair agreement, 0.41–0.60 indicates moderate agreement, 0.61–0.80 indicates substantial agreement and ≥ 0.81 indicates perfect agreement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1474515112438639">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>To determine the construct validity of the G9-EHFScBS, discriminant validity was assessed, and an explorative factor analysis was conducted using a principal component analysis with a varimax rotation. To determine the discriminant validity, the correlation between the G9-EHFScBS and the sum score of the KCCQ was computed using Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, concurrent validity was calculated. Concurrent validity is approved when a scale is able to distinguish between different groups of people, of which one group shows the measured construct, and the other does not. In this case, patients with and without an in-hospital education about HF were compared using the G9-EHFScBS. To determine significant differences, a <italic>t</italic>-test for independent groups was used.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to determine the construct and concurrent validity, internal consistency and test–retest reliability of the G9-EHFScBS. Overall, the data analysis showed that the G9-EHFScBS is a valid and reliable instrument to measure HF-related self-care. However, validity could only be approved with regard to discriminant and concurrent validity, while the results of the factor analysis could not show the theoretical assumed dimensions of the scale.</p>
<p>The answers to the items were mostly biased toward scores of 1 or 2, leading to a positively skewed distribution and indicating the study population’s adherence to recommended self-care behaviours. This finding is in line with the results of previously conducted validity studies of the EHFScBS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112438639">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1474515112438639">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1474515112438639">34</xref></sup> Because of the skewed distribution, changes in self-care behaviours, such as those due to self-care education, might be difficult to measure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the biased item answers influenced some aspects of reliability. Cronbach’s alpha of the G9-EHFScB for this patient dataset was 0.71, indicating only fair internal consistency, which is lower than in the original version of the 9-item EHFScBS (0.8).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112438639">14</xref></sup> One possible explanation for the lower alpha value is that our sample is more homogeneous regarding self-care activities, which can be deduced from the skewed distribution of their answers. As outlined by Streiner, ‘the more heterogeneous the sample, then the larger the variance of the total scores and the higher the reliability’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1474515112438639">35</xref>,p.101</sup> Therefore, Cronbach’s alpha might be higher in a different HF population than in the patients included in this study.</p>
<p>It can be surmised that some items (e.g. items 8 and 9) not only reflect HF-specific self-care measures, but also reflect global aspects of self-care and, as a consequence, contribute to the lower internal consistency. This assumption is underlined by the fact that the item-total correlation for these items was low and partly below the required correlation of <italic>r</italic> &lt; 0.2 (item 8: 0.13; item 9: 0.09). Deleting these items might be appropriate to enhance the internal consistency reliability of the scale, but their deletion would debase the content validity. However, to cover all of the important aspects of HF self-care, the items with low item-total correlation were retained. These issues should be considered in further scale development.</p>
<p>The test–retest reliability using ICC showed substantial agreement for the entire scale. On an item level, the agreement ranged from fair to perfect. Items with only a fair to moderate agreement showed also reduced test–retest reliability in other studies. In a study by Shuldham and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1474515112438639">36</xref></sup> the responses to items 4, 5 and 6 at baseline and after 2 weeks differed the most, but the differences were not statistically significant. Kato et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1474515112438639">33</xref></sup> testing the Japanese version of the 12-item EHFScBS, found that in addition to items 2 and 3 of the 9-item version, item 6 also showed only moderate agreement, as seen in our study. They stated that this finding might be because these items reflect self-care behaviours in terms of contacting healthcare staff. In addition, most of the study participants had only mild HF, with little experience of HF exacerbation.</p>
<p>This argument could be partly applied to our results, in which most patients were graded as NYHA II. Unfortunately, this approach does not explain why the test–retest reliability of item 5 showed only fair agreement. An improvement in test–retest reliability might be possible if one takes into account the fact that patients don’t experience any sign or symptoms stated in the scale. For example, the SCHFI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1474515112438639">37</xref></sup> does not calculate a self-care management score if patients have not experienced shortness of breath or ankle swelling in the past months. This approach could also be applied to the G9-EHFScBS.</p>
<p>Thirteen patients (14.9%) did not return the questionnaire at the second measurement time within a 14-day period. Even though there is no evidence that a time interval of more than 14 days decreases the test–retest reliability of this scale, it is possible that self-care behaviour has changed within this time and that these changes have an influence on the test–retest reliability of the scale or of specific items of the G9-EHFScBS.</p>
<p>Further investigation is needed to evaluate the reasons for the fair and moderate test–retest reliability.</p>
<p>The G9-EHFScBS was able to distinguish between patients who received an education about HF-specific self-care measures and those who did not. However, it must be taken into account that those receiving an education about self-care behaviours showed a significantly lower LVEF than those who received no extra education. In one study, LVEF is described as a self-care behaviour-influencing factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474515112438639">26</xref></sup> Seto et al. found that the lower the LVEF, the better self-care is performed. They concluded that this finding might be due to a greater need for patients with reduced LVEF to take care of themselves or that healthcare providers pay more attention to those patients. Because the influence of LVEF on HF-specific self-care behaviours is not sufficiently clear, further studies should be performed to determine the relationship between reduced LVEF and self-care.</p>
<p>As expected, QoL as measured with the KCCQ was not correlated with the G9-EHFScBS, indicating that these two instruments measure different constructs, which is in line with previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112438639">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1474515112438639">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>A principal component analysis with a varimax rotation revealed that three factors lie within the scale, which did not confirm the underlying hypothesis of a two-factor model. Interestingly, factor one could be conceptualised as the subscale ‘Asking for help’, in line with the theoretical conception of the scale. However, the two other factors could not be distinguished conceptually. Theoretically, items 1, 5, 7, 8 and 9 should be summarised as ‘compliance with the regime’, but this summary was not confirmed by our analysis. The ambiguous results of our factor analysis are in line with other studies analysing the internal structure of the EHFScBS. Shuldham et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1474515112438639">36</xref></sup> identified a four-factor model for the 12-item EHFScBS, although only three factors can be distinguished by theory. Using a CFA approach, Kato et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1474515112438639">33</xref></sup> and Yu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1474515112438639">34</xref></sup> were not able to confirm the hypothetical underlying model. Additionally, Jaarsma and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112438639">14</xref></sup> were not able to demonstrate model fitting in the revised 9-item scale. As a consequence, the sum scores of the G9-EHFScBS and the score of the subscale ‘Asking for help’ should be used.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the G9-EHFScBS is deemed a reliable and valid instrument to assess self-care in HF patients. It might help to tailor HF education sessions and to determine the effects of such interventions on HF patients’ behaviours.</p>
