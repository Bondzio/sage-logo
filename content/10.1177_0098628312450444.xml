<abstract>
<p>In the past decade, the psychological study of creativity has accelerated greatly. To facilitate the teaching of creativity, I provide an overview of the recent literature. The overview begins by discussing recent empirical results and research trends. This discussion specifically treats creativity’s cognitive, differential, developmental, and social aspects. Then I outline central controversies in the study of creativity. These debates concern the nature of creative thought (domain-specific vs. generic processes), creative development (nature vs. nurture), and creative persons (psychopathology vs. mental health). The article closes by asking not just how to teach creativity but also how to teach creativity creatively.</p>

<p>On the surface, creativity should inspire abundant research. After all, creativity concerns the psychological phenomenon where someone comes up with an idea or product that is simultaneously novel and useful, two positive and important attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0098628312450444">Simonton, 2000a</xref>). Nonetheless, not so long ago, creativity was a relatively neglected topic in psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0098628312450444">Sternberg &amp; Lubart, 1996</xref>). That neglect is definitely not true today. Over the past decade, the topic has captured increased attention at an accelerating pace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0098628312450444">Hennessey &amp; Amabile, 2010</xref>). Besides an increase in the number of journals devoted to the topic—including the American Psychological Association’s own <italic>Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts</italic>, which was first published in 2006—the growth of interest is evident in the appearance of two recent annual review of psychology articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0098628312450444">Hennessey &amp; Amabile, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0098628312450444">Runco, 2004</xref>), several comprehensive handbooks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0098628312450444">Kaufman &amp; Sternberg, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0098628312450444">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0098628312450444">Richards, Runco, &amp; Moger, 2009</xref>), numerous introductory textbooks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0098628312450444">Kaufman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0098628312450444">Runco, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0098628312450444">Sawyer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0098628312450444">Weisberg, 2006</xref>), and even the second edition of a 2-volume encyclopedia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0098628312450444">Runco &amp; Pritzker, 2011</xref>). Indeed, the breadth and depth of contemporary research are almost overwhelming. Because research on creativity spans several of psychology’s subdisciplines, it is not easy for any one researcher to keep up on advances in the field. Even so, I will do my best to review current findings and trends and then turn to some contemporary controversies. I close by discussing the teaching of creativity.</p>
<sec id="section1-0098628312450444">
<title>Current Findings and Trends</title>
<p>Recent research efforts have focused on the variables associated with creativity. These variables fall into four different categories: cognitive, differential, developmental, and social psychological.</p>
<sec id="section2-0098628312450444">
<title>Cognitive Psychology of Creativity</title>
<p>Naturally, cognitive psychologists are most interested in the mental processes or mechanisms involved in creative thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0098628312450444">Simonton &amp; Damian, in press</xref>). An especially intriguing finding is that creativity is strongly associated with “defocused attention,” “cognitive disinhibition,” or what researchers technically refer to as reduced latent inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450444">Carson, Peterson, &amp; Higgins, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0098628312450444">Kéri, 2011</xref>). Highly creative people tend to notice stimuli that they know are irrelevant, which enables them to “think outside the box” and to take advantage of serendipitous events that they might otherwise ignore. A downside to this cognitive propensity is that reduced latent inhibition is also associated with psychopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0098628312450444">Carson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0098628312450444">Eysenck, 1995</xref>). The psychotic mind is incessantly bombarded by stimuli and associations that should be filtered out from the get go.</p>
<p>With the advent of the cognitive neurosciences, it comes as no surprise that researchers have studied creative problem solving and insight using the latest techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0098628312450444">Dietrich &amp; Kanso, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0098628312450444">Sawyer, 2011</xref>). Although this research has arrived at some potentially valuable findings, the results at present do not form a consistent package that one can easily summarize. The empirical inconsistencies probably indicate that creative processes are more complex and diversified than the more basic cognitive mechanisms most often studied in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0098628312450444">Simonton &amp; Damian, in press</xref>). To offer a basic example, creative problem solving sometimes requires visual imagery, whereas other times verbal thinking may prove more effective.</p>

<sec id="section3-0098628312450444">
<title>Differential Psychology of Creativity</title>
<p>Differential psychologists are fascinated with how people differ from each other. Those differences can be (a) cognitive, such as general intelligence and special mental abilities or (b) dispositional, such as personality, motivation, and values. Although cognitive psychologists often discount the impact of individual differences variables, it has become increasingly clear that these variables are essential to understanding creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0098628312450444">Simonton, 2003b</xref>). Consider reduced latent inhibition, which, as noted earlier, can lead to either creativity or psychopathology, depending on the presence of certain moderating variables, such as general intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0098628312450444">Carson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628312450444">Carson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0098628312450444">Eysenck, 1995</xref>). A person with exceptional intelligence has sufficient metacognitive skills and abilities to take advantage of the relatively unfiltered inflow of information, whereas those with lower intelligence become overwhelmed by that sensory and associative influx. Differences in intelligence make the difference between a creative insight and a crazy fantasy.</p>
<p>Although I just emphasized cognitive capacity, disposition is critical, too. We now know that creative persons have a distinctive profile of personality traits. For instance, creativity is highly correlated with openness to experience (as defined in the 5-factor model of personality; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0098628312450444">Carson, Peterson, &amp; Higgins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0098628312450444">Harris, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0098628312450444">McCrae, 1987</xref>), a personality dimension that also correlates with reduced latent inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0098628312450444">Peterson &amp; Carson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0098628312450444">Peterson, Smith, &amp; Carson, 2002</xref>). At the same time, creative individuals active in different domains often exhibit different personality profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0098628312450444">Feist, 1998</xref>). Specifically, creative artists do not have the same dispositional makeup as creative scientists. For example, artistic creators are more inclined toward psychopathology than scientific creators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0098628312450444">Simonton, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0098628312450444">
<title>Developmental Psychology of Creativity</title>
<p>Developmental psychologists seek to know how creativity changes across the life span. This quest has two parts. The first part is to discover the early environmental factors that contribute to the development of creative potential. Assuming that some of creativity’s cognitive and dispositional correlates have environmental causes, what are those causes? Although early work tended to concentrate on family background and educational experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0098628312450444">Simonton, 1987</xref>), the search now encompasses broader influences as well. Especially fascinating is new evidence indicating that prior multicultural exposure is conducive to creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0098628312450444">Leung, Maddux, Galinsky, &amp; Chiu, 2008</xref>). Living abroad probably contributes to increased openness and cognitive flexibility. This developmental effect may also relate to the empirical finding that functional bilingualism is also correlated with creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0098628312450444">Simonton, 2008a</xref>). A person who easily encodes any given thought or image in two distinct languages will likely display more cognitive flexibility.</p>
<p>The second part of developmental inquiry concerns the overt manifestation of creativity during maturity and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0098628312450444">Simonton, 2012</xref>). These studies have focused largely on creative productivity in the arts and sciences. Besides investigating how creative output changes across the course of an artistic or scientific career, researchers have studied the longitudinal appearance of key landmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0098628312450444">Simonton, 1997</xref>). At what age will artists or scientists produce their first and last creative works? When during their life cycles will people create their best work? Now that large numbers of baby boomers are pushing retirement, this research has policy implications, particularly in countries that still impose mandatory retirement. Recent findings suggest that the age decrement in creativity observed in earlier research has substantially diminished, at least in the sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0098628312450444">Stroebe, 2010</xref>). This reduced decline may partly reflect the increasing impact of collaborative creativity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0098628312450444">
<title>Social Psychology of Creativity</title>
<p>Social psychologists want to understand creativity in its social context. This focus serves as an important corrective to cognitive, differential, and development research that treats creativity as a purely individual phenomenon. Earlier social psychologists tended to focus on three levels: (a) the interpersonal, such as the impact of social evaluation and reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628312450444">Amabile, 1996</xref>); (b) the group, such as brainstorming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0098628312450444">Stroebe, Nijstad, &amp; Rietzschel, 2010</xref>); and (c) the sociocultural, such as the larger political “zeitgeist” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0098628312450444">Simonton, 2003a</xref>). Although these topics are still active, the group level has received considerable attention in recent work on collaborative creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0098628312450444">Paulus &amp; Nijstad, 2003</xref>). This research is especially worthwhile given how much creativity only takes place in groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0098628312450444">Sawyer, 2007</xref>). A particularly obvious example is filmmaking: A feature film requires the collaboration of dozens, even hundreds, of creators, experts, and talents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0098628312450444">Simonton, 2011b</xref>). One finding having practical implications is that group creativity increases when group membership is highly diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0098628312450444">Nemeth &amp; Nemeth-Brown, 2003</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0098628312450444">Page, 2007</xref>). Membership diversity can entail gender, ethnicity, training, age, and a host of other demographic and occupational factors. This positive result echoes the positive impact of multicultural influences at the level of individual development.</p>
<p>Probably the most striking modern development has been the emergence of creativity as a subject in social cognition. This work grew out of earlier research on the relation between positive affect and creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628312450444">Baas, De Dreu, &amp; Nijstad, 2008</xref>) but has since expanded to include regulatory focus (promotion vs. prevention; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0098628312450444">Friedman &amp; Förster, 2001</xref>), social power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0098628312450444">Galinsky, Gruenfeld, Magee, Whitson, &amp; Liljenquist, 2008</xref>), and unconscious thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0098628312450444">Dijksterhuis &amp; Meurs, 2006</xref>). Perhaps the most provocative result so far is the demonstration that moods and drives have far more complex relations with creativity than researchers originally believed (Simonton &amp; Damian, in press). It is not always true that “good effects” (creativity) have “good causes” (positive emotion or intrinsic motivation). In fact, depressive mood can even promote artistic creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628312450444">Akinola &amp; Mendes, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Controversies in Creativity Research</title>
<p>Like in any other field of scientific inquiry, creativity researchers have their fair share of debates—perhaps even more than their fair share! The main controversies concern creative thought, creative development, and creative persons.</p>
<sec id="section7-0098628312450444">
<title>Creative Thought: Domain-Specific Versus Generic Processes?</title>
<p>It seems all too natural to speak of the creative process, as if there was some generic, one-size-fits-all procedure or mechanism that could apply to any domain of creativity. For example, this assertion would imply that the mental operations involved in conducting scientific research are the same as those engaged in conceiving an artistic product. An illustration of this idea is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0098628312450444">Wallas’s (1926)</xref> classic theory that creativity can be broken down into the stages of preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification. Yet some contemporary researchers oppose this view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0098628312450444">Baer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0098628312450444">Kaufman &amp; Baer, 2002</xref>). Each major domain of creativity has its own distinctive methods or techniques that provide the basis for generating creative ideas. For instance, creativity in the sciences requires the so-called scientific method, a method that would have no utility whatsoever in writing a novel or choreographing a ballet. If domain specificity were true, then it would be difficult to comprehend why creativity happens to be associated with certain individual differences variables, regardless of the creative domain. Presumably, the latter correlations reflect the fact that the creative process depends on the creative person. Creative persons have what it takes to produce creative ideas.</p>
<p>This controversy may have arisen because the domain-specific advocates are not looking at the phenomenon of creativity at a sufficient level of abstraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0098628312450444">Simonton, 2007</xref>). No doubt, much of what an artistic creator does contrasts greatly with what a scientific creator does. Yet if investigators back away far enough to see the forest and not just the trees, the generic features of creative thought may emerge. A candidate for this “big picture” view is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628312450444">Campbell’s (1960)</xref> theory that creativity requires blind variation and selective retention (BVSR). In simple terms, BVSR maintains that creativity requires a creator to generate ideas without knowing which ideas will eventually prove useful. Creativity is thus inherently risky and wasteful. Although now over a half century old, recent research indicates that BVSR has the best prospects for describing the generic process underlying all forms of creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0098628312450444">Simonton, 2011a</xref>). Creators merely tailor BVSR to the distinct needs of their discipline. The accommodation is therefore domain specific.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0098628312450444">
<title>Creative Development: Nature Versus Nurture?</title>
<p>Although the nature–nurture issue now constitutes a general controversy in developmental psychology, it is important to remember that the debate first centered on understanding creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0098628312450444">Galton, 1874</xref>). Furthermore, the question has frequently appeared in discussions of creative genius—whether such high achievers are “born or made.” Because psychology in the United States has had a long history emphasizing environmental factors—an emphasis most conspicuous in the behaviorism of John B. Watson and B. F. Skinner—researchers have often stressed nurture over nature. This position changed after the “revolution” that replaced behaviorism with cognitive science. Now rather than focusing on learning and conditioning, cognitive psychologists speak of the need to acquire domain-specific expertise by means of deliberate practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0098628312450444">Ericsson, 1996</xref>). This concept led to the famous “10-year rule” that asserts that nobody, no matter how talented, can expect to make a high-impact contribution to any domain without first devoting a full decade to acquiring the requisite knowledge and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0098628312450444">Hayes, 1989</xref>). Moreover, anyone willing to put in this effort, no matter how untalented, will still be able to achieve at the highest levels. In short, inherited abilities or dispositions are irrelevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0098628312450444">Howe, 1999</xref>). Creators are just experts.</p>
<p>Although research indicates that psychologists often have a higher citation impact if they adopt such extreme positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0098628312450444">Simonton, 2000b</xref>), there is no evidence that such extremism contributes to the advancement of psychological science. Research in behavioral genetics has provided strong empirical and theoretical reasons for believing that nature does indeed play a role in the emergence of creative talent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0098628312450444">Simonton, 2008b</xref>). This is not to say that researchers have identified a single gene for creativity. On the contrary, creativity depends on the participation of numerous cognitive and dispositional variables that also feature sizable heritability coefficients—variables such as general intelligence and openness to experience. In addition, the genetic influences operate in complex (multiplicative) ways that unfold slowly over the course of childhood and adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0098628312450444">Simonton, 1999</xref>). Finally, genetic factors do not render irrelevant the acquisition of domain-specific expertise through deliberate practice. Instead, talent and training operate in tandem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0098628312450444">Simonton, 2008b</xref>). Innate talent speeds up expertise acquisition (becoming better faster) and allows superior performance for a given level of expertise acquisition (more bang for the buck). In brief, nature enhances nurture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0098628312450444">
<title>Creative Persons: Psychopathology Versus Mental Health?</title>
<p>The ancient question of whether genius is “born or made” is complemented by the even older question of the “mad genius”—an issue that goes back to Plato and Aristotle. Stated in more inclusive terms, is creativity associated with psychopathology in such a way that the higher the magnitude of creativity, the greater the frequency and intensity of adverse mental, emotional, or behavioral symptoms? The polarization on this controversy is every bit as fierce as the nature–nurture issue. On one hand, a long tradition going back to early psychiatry and psychoanalysis has defended a positive connection between psychopathology and creativity. On the other hand, a more recent tradition, starting with humanistic psychology and continuing with the positive psychology movement, argues that creativity is a sure sign of self-actualization and subjective well-being.</p>
<p>The resolution to this debate depends on addressing two fundamental questions. First, in what domain is the creativity going to take place? As noted earlier, psychopathology is more common in the arts than in the sciences. Even with a particular art or science, the rate and intensity of psychopathological symptoms can vary. Thus, mental illness is higher in poetry than in any other artistic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0098628312450444">Ludwig, 1992</xref>). Second, what degree of creativity are we talking about? Creativity researchers frequently make the distinction between “Big-C Creativity” and “little-c creativity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0098628312450444">Simonton, 2000a</xref>). The former appellation applies to creative genius, whereas the latter ascription applies to everyday creativity witnessed at home and in the workplace. This contrast is crucial because psychopathology is more prominent in Big-C Creativity and less conspicuous in little-c creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0098628312450444">Simonton, 2010</xref>). The two opposing sides of the debate are both right. One side is just talking about the elephant’s head, while the other side is talking about the elephant’s tail. Finally, the two opposing sides agree on one critical point: Even Big-C creators do not produce genius-level work when they are outright insane. Instead, the psychopathology observed stays at subclinical levels. For instance, highly creative novelists score between the mentally ill and the normal on the clinical scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0098628312450444">Barron, 1963</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0098628312450444">Nettle, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>One final note, behavior genetics can help resolve both the nature–nurture and creativity–psychopathology controversies. Researchers have long known that highly creative people are more likely to come from families that suffer higher than average psychopathology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0098628312450444">Karlsson, 1970</xref>). In fact, a recent study identified a unique gene that is found in both the highly creative and the mentally ill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0098628312450444">Kéri, 2009</xref>). As noted above, the gene simply has to be inherited along with other traits that turn a potential cognitive liability into a decided cognitive asset.</p>

<title>Teaching Creativity</title>
<p>In some respects, teaching creativity is no different than teaching any other subject in psychology. Hence, to a certain extent, I teach creativity the same way I teach other undergraduate courses, such as my history of psychology course. Thus, in all of my classes, I use various devices to keep my students interested even when I must engage in the traditional one-way communication of information. For example, I always wear a T-shirt with some picture or quotation that illustrates a point somewhere in the lecture. But students cannot anticipate when the T-shirt will prove relevant, or even why. They have to pay attention!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one might think that a course, lecture, or section on creativity would require something more. In other words, one should not just teach creativity but also teach creativity creatively! That implies that instructional techniques should be both novel and useful—a far more difficult goal to achieve. Even after teaching a creativity class for more than two decades, I remain far from reaching that goal. Still, I have found one method that seems to work very well—a “lecture” on creativity tests. Research on creativity tests has not reached a consensus on the single best test for assessing creativity. For instance, some tests gauge requisite cognitive skills, such as divergent thinking or remote association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0098628312450444">Guilford, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0098628312450444">Mednick, 1962</xref>); other instruments assess whether a person has a creative personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0098628312450444">Gough, 1979</xref>). Rather than describe each measure in detail and review the psychometric literature on each test’s reliability and validity, I project items from representative tests on a screen, and everybody, including me, takes the test together. Doing so requires us, for example, to come up with unusual uses for a brick or paper clip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0098628312450444">Guilford, 1967</xref>). I then introduce the measurement issues in the context of a direct experience that we all shared.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>I have provided an overview of what researchers know about creativity, with a focus on the most recent results, research trends, and ongoing debates. To a more limited extent, I also offered some tips on how to teach creativity, including how to teach creativity creatively. It is my hope that this article inspires some instructors, at whatever level, to connect their students to this significant topic. Creativity is not only an intellectually interesting subject, but also a phenomenon of immense practical importance. I personally believe that no student should receive a college degree without knowing something about creativity or without learning how to be creative. When teaching about creativity, teachers must try to accomplish both of these tasks.</p>
