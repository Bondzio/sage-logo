<abstract>
<p>This article is concerned with how the development of mixed methods research is influenced by the many aspects of human interplay occurring between researchers representing different disciplines. It examines findings from interviews, field notes, and written documentation from a case study involving a team of health science researchers doing mixed methods research on athletes with knee injuries. The researchers experienced that they did not succeed in integrating quantitative and qualitative data collected from this research. From the collected data, a multiplicity of forms of interplay is identified and discussed. The article suggests that more attention needs to be given to power relations as an important aspect of collaboration between researchers belonging to different epistemic cultures.</p>

<body>
<p>A central justification of the mixed methods approach is the aspiration to gain knowledge that will be unavailable to quantitative and qualitative studies undertaken separately. Various studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1558689812471087">Greene, Caracelli, &amp; Graham, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1558689812471087">O’Cathain, Murphy, &amp; Nicholl, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1558689812471087">Teddlie &amp; Tashakkori, 2003</xref>) indicate that the extent of integration of quantitative and qualitative data may be limited within mixed methods research. In a previous issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1558689812471087">Bryman (2007)</xref> identified a number of barriers to integrating quantitative and qualitative data within social research. These barriers range from various pragmatic and technical issues of how to integrate results obtained with different methodologies, to more general differences with regard to epistemological and ontological outlook.</p>
<p>In a seminal article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1558689812471087">Greene (2006)</xref> proposes to distinguish between four domains of issues and assumptions when discussing a methodology for social inquiry: (a) philosophical assumptions and stances, (b) inquiry logics, (c) guidelines for practice, and (d) sociopolitical commitments. We wish to include a fifth domain into the mixed methods debate, namely, that of human and sociocultural aspects of research practice. This article presents a case study of an attempt at mixed methods research, specifically focusing on the interplay between researchers from different research traditions. Notably, we put an emphasis on the complexity of events, developments, and relations that may emerge in such interplay. In an empirical study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1558689812471087">O’Cathain, Murphy, and Nicholl (2008)</xref> concluded with the importance of the quality of team work in terms of methodological respect between team members. Our conclusions support those of O’Cathain et al., and we try to unravel the finer texture of the interplay that in the end may appear as expressions of methodological disrespect.</p>
<p>Relationships between individuals doing research will always to some extent depend on individual personalities and idiosyncrasies. Such dimensions have been prominent in biographically oriented history of science. At the same time, other scholarly traditions, notably the field called <italic>science and technology studies</italic> (STS), have emphasized structural aspects of scientific practice. STS is a heterogeneous research field, but one may detect a common interest in the disunity of science, the complexity of scientific practice, and the inadequacies of conceiving scientific knowledge as something eternal and independent of the social, political, and cultural context in which it is produced. We share this interest; as we learned about the mixed methods project under study, the heterogeneous collection of concepts within and around STS became an important theoretical resource.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1558689812471087">Knorr Cetina (1999)</xref>, we may speak of and study “epistemic cultures” in which researchers shape and are shaped within the tribe to which they belong. Hence, the meeting between, say, a quantitative researcher and a qualitative researcher—imagined in their stereotype form—does not only give rise to pragmatic challenges of data integration or ontological divides in the form of different theoretical commitments. It can also be a meeting between individuals who live and work fundamentally differently, with different training and experience in reflecting and verbalizing methodological presuppositions different theoretical foundations, collegial relations, and so on.</p>
<p>One set of aspects of meetings across cultures are those of power. Indeed, there may be conspicuous power relations present in mixed methods collaboration and other interdisciplinary encounters, for instance, along hierarchies of academic prestige and/or material conditions. In a mixed methods design, there may also be a negotiated agreement on the dominance of one approach over the other. Such reified, conspicuous, and static forms of power are but one dimension in the study of the production of knowledge. With <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689812471087">Michel Foucault (1976)</xref>, we may speak of <italic>power/knowledge</italic> and argue that in producing knowledge one is always making a claim for power.</p>
<p>Within mixed methods research, ontological, epistemological, methodological, practical, political, collegial, and personal issues are to some extent entangled into each other. However, in the methodological literature it will often be wise to distinguish and separate them. Nevertheless, in this article we will take the opposite perspective and show how their connections may manifest themselves in a particular case. We will tell a story in which philosophical differences and collegial and personal dimensions came to codevelop in a way that was not desired while also entangled with different institutional and sociopolitical commitments and different views on inquiry logics. From a purely methodological perspective, our narrative of an apparently failed mixed methods project might be dismissed as simply “bad practice.” Post hoc, that may be true. However, we believe it to be instructive, to study such projects in the making, exploring how apparent failures develop and unfold.</p>
<p>Below, we will outline the case study. In the Results section, we present our main results in terms of elements and themes. Finally, we take these results as a point of departure for a reflection on current debates on mixed methods research.</p>

<title>Case Study, Background, and Method</title>
<sec id="section2-1558689812471087">
<title>The Knee Project: Interdisciplinary Research on Knee Injuries in Athletes</title>
<p>The empirical component of our work is a study of a mixed methods project that involved experienced health researchers in Norway doing empirical studies of athletes with knee injuries. In the following we will call this research project <italic>the knee project</italic>. The project was initiated by a university department that employs researchers from different academic disciplines, ranging from the “hard sciences” (physiology) to lifeworld research (phenomenology). The project ambition of mixing methods was motivated by the research questions (to be described below) but also by a desire to exploit the potential of having these different research competencies at hand in the same research environment. Clinical physiotherapists combining clinical practice and research work at their clinic also took part in the project.</p>
<p>To gain knowledge about the outcome of a rehabilitation process involving patients with knee injury, a mixed methods approach was developed. The rehabilitation took place at a medical sports clinic, which also housed a commercial fitness center. An important clinical motivation for the project was the need to explain why persons who sustain a knee injury show different abilities in stabilizing the knee. Within the project there was a group of quantitatively oriented researchers who did research on the physiological and biomechanical issues that possibly could explain differences in functioning. In addition, there was a group of qualitative oriented researchers who assumed that the functional ability could be better understood by including a patient perspective in the research. More precisely, they paid attention to how the patients experienced living with a knee injury and participating in the rehabilitation program. We shall call these two groups of researchers <italic>the quantitative researchers</italic> and <italic>the qualitative researchers</italic>, respectively. The overall project ambition was to predict the patients’ functional outcome after the rehabilitation process more precisely by a combination of biomechanical research and phenomenological research.</p>
<p>Consequently, the research ambitions were twofold. First, the researchers were concerned with why patients with knee injury have different functional abilities after a rehabilitation period (a physiological, quantitative approach). Second, they wanted to explore whether differences in function and abilities may be related to how patients interpret the rehabilitation program and how they practice the exercises in the rehabilitation program (a phenomenological, qualitative approach).</p>
<p>Furthermore, to obtain a broader understanding of the rehabilitation process, the intention was to integrate the quantitative and qualitative data sets. Also, to build long-term capacity for interdisciplinary collaboration,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1558689812471087">1</xref>
</sup> and perhaps what has been called <italic>methodological bilingualism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1558689812471087">Teddlie &amp; Tashakkori, 2003</xref>), there was an explicit intent of doing research on the research process itself within this project. Hence, the researchers were supposed to pose critical questions about the reasoning of “the others” and to reflect on their own research with the gaze of “the others.” To fulfill this task of meta-interpretation, a qualitatively oriented researcher outside the original team carried out participant observations at project seminars (Kristin Heggen, a coauthor of this article).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1558689812471087">Burke Johnson, Onwuegbuzie, and Turner (2007)</xref> distinguishes between subtypes of mixed methods research along a continuum between “pure qualitative” and “pure quantitative.” It is difficult to locate the knee project at a definite point on this continuum. On one hand, there were many expressions among the researchers of an intent and desire to achieve a symmetry of the “pure mixed” type. On the other hand, in terms of genesis, the initiative to the project originated at the sports clinic, with the qualitative part included somewhat later. Accordingly, the research objects (the athletes and their training program) were defined and constituted by the practices of the quantitative researchers. In this sense, we may talk of a quantitative dominant subtype. Because this is related to our empirical findings of interplay in the sense that it became part of the contested issues, we shall later return to this question.</p>

<sec id="section3-1558689812471087">
<title>Background and Method of Our Study</title>
<p>The study presented in this article was commissioned by the leader of the knee project. During the course of that project, the researchers experienced increased difficulties in bridging the gap between the quantitative approach and the qualitative approach. They realized that they had significant problems with integrating the different data sets and also experienced certain collaborative problems. Facing these challenges, and perhaps accepting that they could not be solved within the original project, it was decided to commission an additional phase of meta-interpretation performed by external researchers. The decision appears to have been based on the assumption that this altered perspective could provide instructive insights for future mixed methods efforts, either for the knee project researchers or for a larger academic audience. Remaining sympathetic to this assumption, we framed our research question as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1558689812471087" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>How did the knee project develop, and how did the researchers experience the development of the project and their involvement in it?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In particular, we focused on the aspects of contact and collaboration across research traditions and the efforts at data integration. In other words, our initial research questions were broad, though anchored in a research interest in the <italic>experience</italic> of the knee project researchers. This was reflected in our research design, which consisted of a set of semistructured interviews with the six key researchers, revolving around the topics of the informants’ role, contribution, and involvement in the project, as well as their perception of the project dynamics, communication, and work modes. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed <italic>verbatim</italic>. In addition, the empirical material consisted of all written documentation of the project, including research proposals, research papers, intraproject e-mail correspondence, and field notes and memos by the participant observer. The entire data set was subjected to repeated cycles of open reading and discussion by all three coauthors for the identification of themes. Our initial attempt was to analyze the material in terms of technical and methodological “barriers for data integration.” However, the data set provided resistance in the sense that we could not perform this analysis without being unfaithful toward our findings, and the attempt was rejected. Instead, the multiplicity of relations, including multiple aspects of power, emerged as the topic that would not “go away” in our efforts to interpret the data set. Accordingly, this was chosen as the main analytical frame for the selection of results and the framing of the discussion in this article. Still, we attempt to present results quite close to the level of reported experience of the subjects under study.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section5-1558689812471087">
<title>Not Having Been Able to Combine the Data</title>
<p>The knee project produced research results that were reported in various oral and written communications. Still, in spite of the ambitions laid down in the project proposal and the efforts during the project, none of these communications have so far shown mixed methods results. They are all either quantitative physiological studies or qualitative lifeworld research. Although it still may be too early to conclude that no mixed methods results will appear from the project, all our informants reported the experience of not having been able to combine and integrate the qualitative and quantitative approaches. In this sense, they all expressed an experience of failure. For some, this was surprising: the team included what they deemed high-quality researchers, they were strongly motivated, and several had previous experience with interdisciplinary collaboration. An informant outside of the main project team noted, however, that the project appeared to be motivated more by a will to interdisciplinary integration than by a clearly and mutually defined research problem. All informants expressed disappointment that they “did not get further” with data integration and most attributed this to greater problems of cross-disciplinary communication and understanding than expected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1558689812471087">
<title>Disempowerment</title>
<p>In the interviews, the informants expressed different forms of disempowerment. This sometimes amounted to a partial explanation of the perceived project failure. For instance, there were stories of expectations of a certain effort from a colleague, but where one had no formal or real power to instruct or influence him or her to do that effort. Also, there were stories of seeing no way forward, in the sense that one did not know how to achieve the desired data integration. In various ways, power issues and relations along a number of axes were articulated by the informants, often accompanied with an expression of one’s own disempowerment or inferiority in a hierarchy, the “other” having more prestige, receiving more acclaim, being more articulate, indeed more rigorous in their articulation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the relatively flat structure of the project appeared to imply that nobody felt empowered to instruct or exert strong leadership. As a result, they all shared a perception of disempowerment. However, the historical genesis of the project led to an asymmetry in ownership. The qualitative researchers did not feel entirely included into the overall project design, nor in the overall presentation of the project in various arenas. With <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1558689812471087">Burke Johnson et al. (2007)</xref>, we may interpret their experience as being part of a project that was covertly or perhaps subconsciously quantitative dominant, and perhaps more positivist than postpositivist in the sense of granting a higher scientific value to quantitative experiments than to qualitative observations. Implicitly they therefore suffered under methodological disrespect in spite of the plans and intents of symmetry. In the perceived discrepancy between plans and good intentions and real dominance, we can see one of the connections between the philosophical, collegial, and personal: The philosophical differences are connected to the experiences of methodological disrespect and personal disappointment. However, as will be clear below, the experience of disrespect and disappointment was not unique to the qualitative researchers.</p>

<title>To Be a Good Scientist: Philosophical and Moral Differences</title>
<p>The work approach of the knee project can briefly be described as follows: Data were gathered in a disciplinary fashion. Then, preliminary data and analyses from each discipline were presented and discussed in project team meetings. These meetings typically lasted one working day. The objective of these meetings was that the researchers should get acquainted with and understand the data and the approach of the other discipline. From spending time on reaching a common understanding, creative ways of combining and integrating the data and/or the approaches were expected to emerge.</p>
<p>Sometimes structured around data presentations, the discussions in the meetings were allowed to develop quite freely, from questions and criticism of data, into attempts at describing the patients combining qualitative and quantitative data and also into reflections on methodological and foundational issues and reflections on the project and the discussion itself. No results emerged in these meetings that were later converted into research results. Sometimes, but not always, these meetings became quite conflictive. From our data, we can say that this happened in spite of many expressions of good will, cordiality, and constructive attitude. We did not observe the “banter and jokes” reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1558689812471087">O’Cathain et al. (2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>Underlying part of the conflict we identify the theme <italic>knowing what good science is.</italic> In all our interviews, the informants expressed views on the methodological qualities and virtues that they think should apply to all good science/good research, irrespective of discipline. At least two axes can be identified. First, there is the “academic-clinical” axis, where the “academics” emphasize the value of a critical attitude toward methods and assumptions, whereas the “clinicians” emphasize usefulness of the knowledge as a value. As an example related to this tension, one of the “quantitative academics” stresses that the logic of inquiry used by the “quantitative clinicians” transforms natural science into a kind of pseudoscience:
<disp-quote>
<p>I value the use of these self-reported data as bad natural science. In a sense they express how the patients experience themselves. . . . Nevertheless, these subjective data are treated quantitatively, so that the outcome is something quantitative. But actually it is a mixture of types of data. (Respondent 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, several of the “academics,” including both quantitative and qualitative researchers, raise a critical voice by claiming that prior to project meeting the quantitative clinicians circulated their results as plotted raw data rather than analyzed data. As stressed by one of them, “It was only numbers, no analysis, and impossible for us to get any meaning out of it.”</p>
<p>Second, and only partially overlapping, there is the “natural science-humanities” axis where the researchers closer to natural science emphasize the methodological virtues of tidiness, having a clear hypothesis and a clear relationship between hypothesis and method, whereas the researchers closer to the humanities emphasize methodological virtues of verbal clarity, openness, and level of verbal reflection. For all parties, this appeared not only to be a question of defining own qualities but also a matter of judging the others’ quality and the validity of their claims. When researchers from other disciplines passed judgments about issues outside their own domain of expertise, these judgments were sometimes met and responded on by counterjudgments: Criticism was seen as evidence of “lack of humility because one should not criticize expert work unless one is an expert on that same type of research (see below).</p>
<p>The researchers closest to the humanities emphasized how philosophical and other theoretical reflections on the fundamental assumptions of one’s research practice, one’s role as a researcher, and the status of one’s theoretical concepts was seen by them as an important and indeed essential part of the research practice:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . to me, research is to be able to discuss what one is doing. If one cannot do that, then I actually would not call it research. That is my definition. (Respondent 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The statement illustrates how this philosophical difference at the same time is a matter of collegial esteem and professional identity: “I actually would not call it research.” Consequently, the other team member cannot be called a real researcher.</p>
<p>In the project team meetings, this motif often drove the discourse toward an abstract level, as shown in the following excerpt, where a qualitative researcher comments on the challenges of interpretation of their interview data, having explained the complexities between what the informants <italic>say</italic>, what they <italic>do</italic>, and how their situation might be:
<disp-quote>
<p>That is why we have problems with classifying, we are actually working on interpreting the language in which the patients are expressing themselves. And then we get into what kind of understanding we should have of language with respect to bodily experience. And there we worked with a paper where we tried to develop our foundational understanding of seeing them as subjects, that is, who both can say something about what they experience but who also, in our theoretical understanding, there will definitely be aspects of what they go through that they not necessarily can articulate. (Utterance during project meeting)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In comparison, the quantitative researchers did not speak in this way. They did not articulate reflections on their methods and their role as researcher in this type of theoretical language. Hence, in project meetings heated discussions could emerge when quantitative researchers presented data and were met with foundational questions that they did not know how to answer. The following quote from one of the qualitatively researchers illustrates how methodological and personal issues got entangled:
<disp-quote>
<p>[I was very clear to [colleague X] that [colleague Y] gets away too easily. When they said in meetings “we need more time on this” I replied that we have this time now, say it now, I want to hear it now! I want to discuss now, and I want to hear you say what you disagree with. So sometimes I became a bit . . . clear and a little angry. They may have perceived me as a bit aggressive. But I felt that my anger was justified. (Respondent 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Along the same line, several of the researchers occasionally experienced that they did not succeed in getting another colleague to listen to them. However, one of the quantitative researchers turned this the other way around:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think that it’s not just about listening, it’s also about being heard and seen, and hear and understand. There are many things in this, not just willingness to listen, but also on both sides. It’s not just the one who should listen. So I think this has been challenging on the human level. (Respondent 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This informant also comments on the conflictivity of the discussions on foundational issues in the project team and sees it in part as a question of training:
<disp-quote>
<p>We, the quantitative researchers, felt that we were not understood. But neither were we able to explain our results adequately to the qualitatively researchers. . . . I think that Garfield says it well, he says: “It’s hard to be serious when you are naked.” You get a bit stripped. If [the leading quantitative researcher] had been more trained [in philosophical reflection], then I think it would have been possible to strip the others as well . . . then there would be some weaknesses there as well. It would be strange if there weren’t. (Respondent 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, the qualitative researchers expressed a desire to receive such criticism and interpreted the lack of it as a sign of low scientific quality:
<disp-quote>
<p>I really missed the criticism. [The only resistance we got was sayings like “I can’t get anything out of this data.” . . . I think it is a weakness not to get qualified resistance. (Respondent 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We were reminded of some of the classical formulations of the scientific ethos, stressing that nothing is more satisfying than being submitted to hard and fair criticism. As stressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1558689812471087">Popper (1963/1992)</xref>, scientific progress depends on hypotheses being refuted. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1558689812471087">Merton’s (1973)</xref> ideal scientists are searching for truth in efforts of organized skepticism. Although both of the “academics” groups within the knee project stressed the value of a critical attitude, the researchers close to the humanities to a much greater extent put emphasis on the role of verbal clarity, openness, and level of reflection as virtues of good scientific practice. Implicitly, there seemed to be an underlying understanding of theoretical inferiority of natural scientists: that they have a meager language but also lacking proper reflection, being “naïve realists,”“reductionists,” and showing a “defect” understanding of science as value neutral. Indeed, several of the interviews reveal awareness about such prejudices toward quantitative researchers. As an example of relevance, one of the quantitative researchers counteracts to the critique in the following way:
<disp-quote>
<p>I use to say that the good thing about being a reductionist, that is, if you are a good reductionist, then you are explicit about what you are reducing something into. I guess it might be worse to be a holistic and not knowing what the holism actually is. (Respondent 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In our material, our informants speak about criticism and responses to criticism in morally and aesthetically laden terms. Specifically, they invoke in our analysis the concepts of <italic>Bildung</italic> and <italic>humility</italic>. Among the qualitative researchers, a critical attitude was described not only as good quality science but also in the moral terms of honesty, courage, and respect: Courageously, one should expose oneself and others to unrestricted criticism, and through processes of <italic>Bildung</italic>, then, one might mature as an academic and a person. On the other side, the quantitative researchers valued this not as courage but as unconstructive and misguided and due to <italic>lack of humility</italic>, the failure to restrict one’s criticism to issues within one’s range of understanding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1558689812471087">
<title>Difference in Phenomena Under Study Destabilized the Relationship Between the Researchers</title>
<p>The asymmetry described in the preceding paragraph was deepened further by a difference in the definition of the objects of research. Although the quantitative physiological research studied knee function within a defined technical and clinical context, the qualitative research included this context as part of the phenomenon to be investigated. In other words, the medical sports clinic and its practices, as perceived by the patients, became part of the research object. As often may be the case in clinical research, however, the same people may be combined clinicians and research staff, or at least they may share workplace and collegial identity. This was also the case in the knee project. In addition, the qualitative researchers were trained clinicians themselves, and as such they took an interest in questioning whether the treatment was indeed good for the patients. For the quantitative researchers, this question was not foreseen as part of the research problem, and they also did not agree that the qualitative methods were adequate for answering it. Importantly, this difference is a “scientific” issue—a matter of disagreement on inquiry logics and standards of practice. In a perhaps surprising fashion, the project developed into a critical scrutiny of the clinician researchers own role as clinicians. Accordingly, the content matter of the ongoing research contributed to the escalation of differences in institutional and sociopolitical commitments.</p>
<p>Because the qualitative approach implied an evaluation of the professional practice of some of the quantitative researchers within the project team, the research opened for interest perspectives: The quantitative researchers had to be seen—at least in part—as interest parties. On the contrary, the qualitative researchers could continue to enjoy a neutral position in the sense that they were not clinical actors in the clinical setting. Furthermore, the expansion of the phenomena under study put forward by the qualitative researchers generated qualitative data that questioned the success of the rehabilitation process that had been indicated by the quantitative findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1558689812471087">
<title>When the Contradictions Occur</title>
<p>A final feature to highlight is the fact that the overall impression from the qualitative data contradicted the quantitative data. This was not only true from the bird-eye’s view perspective, where the qualitative research problematized the entire context for the quantitative research. It was also true on the level of detail. Narratives emerged from patient interviews that simply did not match the overall impression from the physiological tests, and this was clear to everybody during the project team meetings. Within the quantitative frame work, the patients were categorized as copers or noncopers because of the outcome of their test results. Qualitative data from the interviews, however, indicated that patients who were categorized as copers from the test results could be characterized as noncopers. Although the project leader (a quantitative researcher) made an attempt to initiate new categorizations based on these findings, the project as a whole did not succeed in using these contradictions as a resource—rather they were mainly seen as a problem and an obstacle. The contradictions appeared to spark off several types of responses. First, there were scattered attempts at discussing the contradiction on the level of single-patient narratives, without this appearing to lead to significant insights. Second, one quantitative researcher suspected that the contradictions were suspected to be due to punching errors or have other technical explanations, whereas the qualitative researchers held the opinion that it was rather the use of the key categories (coper–noncoper) that should be reexamined and discussed. Furthermore, one of the quantitative researchers did also reveal skepticism toward the categorization by saying:
<disp-quote>
<p>I wonder whether it is the classification that in some way ought to be different. (Utterance at project meeting)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These meta-level reflections never crystallized into any conclusions.</p>

<title>Collaborative Modes: Multidisciplinary, Interdisciplinary, or Dysfunctional?</title>
<p>Out of the process of open reading and discussion of the empirical material, the story emerged that the researchers within the knee project experienced that they did not succeed in their efforts of doing mixed methods research. The researchers themselves relate this lack of success to issues concerning conflicts, asymmetries in power, contradictions in data, and little/no data integration.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, our findings support those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1558689812471087">Bryman (2007)</xref> in several aspects regarding barriers to data integration. We will not go along with all of them, but mention but a few. First, the qualitative researchers expressed the experience of being a handmaiden within the project, and second it was undoubtedly the task of linking the different analysis sets that was experienced as most challenging and demanding.</p>
<p>With respect to data integration, we agree with the respondents’ conclusion about limited integration—in retrospect we can hardly find any evidence that integrated data from this project have been presented or published. On the contrary, we think the outcome from the knee project illustrates the scenario that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1558689812471087">MacMynowski (2007)</xref> calls <italic>tolerant ambivalence</italic>: The transformation of knowledge has been almost absent, and the knowledge that did evolve typically returned back into the different research communities, staying uncontaminated by the other part. Indeed, the knee project developed within methodological discourses that were rather closed, and we find little evidence that suggests that any disciplinary norms for dealing with validity were departed. Consequently, to speak with the language of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1558689812471087">Gibbons et al. (1994)</xref>, we will claim that the knee project was performed within a multidisciplinary collaborative mode rather than in an inter- or transdisciplinary mode. Along this line, we find it tempting to frame the hypothetical question whether it was actually much effort for <italic>less</italic>. Might the purpose of this particular study have been better fulfilled if the quantitative and qualitative approaches were undertaken separately, and the intention of data integration was skipped? Consequently, the outcome might contribute to better research about the rehabilitation of knee injuries. This, of course, remains a post hoc explanation. If they had succeeded, other explanations would have been put to the foreground.</p>
<p>At the same time, it seems too hard a verdict to claim that the research team was dysfunctional <italic>sensu</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1558689812471087">O’Cathain et al., 2008</xref>). A lot was done to facilitate communication, collaboration, and data integration, and the project does not fit the typical narrative of expressed prejudice and hostility between quantitative and qualitative researchers who possibly can overcome the barriers by working together. On the contrary, the experience of lack of respect, disempowerment, and problematic power relationships <italic>progressed</italic> with the collaborative efforts made. We may partially explain this in terms of a learning process: an increasing clarity and awareness of differences in philosophical stances and sociopolitical commitments. The differences in terms of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1558689812471087">Greene’s (2006)</xref> four domains showed themselves as so important as to threaten the collaborative relationships. Too much was at stake. At the same time, this is only a partial explanation, because one has to ask why the researchers did fail to resolve these differences. This is close to a counterfactual question and the role of contingent factors, such as individual personalities and idiosyncrasies, is difficult to assess. However, we believe that the concept of epistemic cultures casts some light on the issue, as follows.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1558689812471087">
<title>Mixing of Methods Across Epistemic Cultures</title>
<p>One way of answering the question why the researchers failed to resolve their philosophical and sociopolitical differences is to argue that the difference between their epistemic cultures was too large. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1558689812471087">Burke Johnson et al. (2007)</xref> comment on this issue along two dimensions. First, they do implicitly recommend a shared philosophical stance by defining the “quantitative dominant” subtype of mixed methods research as one that relies on “a quantitative, post-positivist view” (p. 124). On the next page, however, they state that “variations in particular philosophical commitments should be welcome in mixed methods research, and we should embrace these differences.” Can one successfully embrace so much variation as to make up a research team of constructivist/poststructuralist thinkers on one hand and positivist rather than postpositivist thinkers on the other?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1558689812471087">2</xref></sup> The knee project is an interesting case in this respect because there were notable differences.</p>
<p>Importantly, our findings reveal different ways of thinking about health, knowledge, and research and indicate that different epistemic cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1558689812471087">Knorr Cetina, 1999</xref>) were represented within the project. For Knorr Cetina, science is not only disunified—indeed, she claims that science and expert systems in particular are “good” candidates for cultural division because they represent “domains in which participants orient themselves more toward one another and previous system-states than toward the outside” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1558689812471087">Knorr Cetina, 1999</xref>, p. 2). Epistemic objects (objects of science), as well as the scientists, have been shaped and transformed within these epistemic cultures. Within the knee project the different analytical focus on the patients that were included in the study revealed two discourses regarding how to look on, and think about, persons who are recovering from a knee injury. On the one hand, the quantitative and biomedical researchers were engaged with this by classifying the patients as copers and noncopers. Thus, by highlighting the scientific ideals of observation and classification of symptoms and signs, the patients were not encouraged to give their own voice about the rehabilitation process. This position was, however, opposed by the qualitative and lifeworld researchers, who, to understand the rehabilitation context, highlighted the voice and the experience of each patient.</p>
<p>Hence, there was not only philosophical and methodological difference and variation. Rather, the particular difference has at least a one-century old history of contradiction and conflict, one object domain being defined as a contrast and in opposition to the other. One might imagine a strong principal investigator trying to resolve the differences by enforcing a pragmatist middle ground from which to integrate data. The risk would be that the researchers’ identity and quality as members of an epistemic culture and community would be compromised by that middle ground. One way such a risk could manifest itself is in the deterioration of the collaborative relationships in the research team. We shall end the article with a reflection in that direction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1558689812471087">
<title>Power/Knowledge and the Need for Rupture</title>
<p>By exploring the development of the knee project, different kinds of power at play became visible. We take the opinion that the difference between the research traditions and their preferred methodologies is deeply associated with different aspects of power, and as also claimed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1558689812471087">MacMynowski (2007)</xref>, we believe that these will be important determinant of success—or failure—of collaborative research endeavors. Indeed, Foucault profoundly stressed how power is closely linked to the distribution of knowledge and truth effects—a symbiotic relationship he illustrated by the term <italic>power/knowledge</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689812471087">Foucault, 1976</xref>). It follows from this perspective that power should not be viewed as a one-way transmission being spread from one single source or position and that individuals ought not to be regarded as passive recipients of power. Rather than seen as the recipients of power, individuals should be seen as the “place” where power is enacted and the place where it is resisted: Individuals are active and aspiring, and power brings into play relations between these, or between groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1558689812471087">Foucault, 1982</xref>). Thus, rather than to show off power with a capital letter, <italic>power relations</italic> describe the ways power is exercised.</p>
<p>Although power relations will be in play at every level in society, it is in the relationship between the individual and the institution that power operates most clearly. One obvious visible axis is that of institutional and organizational power, which also was of some importance in the knee project. This partial exclusion correlated with the perception of the “usual” hierarchy of acclaim and prestige in academia and biomedicine: The exact sciences on top, followed by the quantitative sciences, and finally the “soft,” qualitative research traditions.</p>
<p>But already when discussing this “usual” formal, power hierarchy, it became obvious that power was exerted, expressed, and shaped in ways that reversed this hierarchical relation between the quantitative and qualitative sciences, or between the academic and clinical. The qualitative researcher could mobilize moral power by displaying an unjustified institutional hierarchy.</p>
<p>Likewise, the resistance within the knee project to recognize the contradicting data sets as a resource to explore further can be seen in light of the interest agendas within the project. We do believe that in some sense it was in the best interest for the quantitative researchers to keep to their own results and their success story of the rehabilitation. Working within a prestigious institution that treats sportsmen, including world champions, this research group is celebrated for their achievements in science. The group had little to gain and a lot to lose if they began to explore fundamental doubts about their own methodology and findings. Indeed, when considering the situation of the quantitative researchers, one could even think that the inclusion of the reflections of the patients might become a threat to the treatment of them.</p>
<p>However, to limit ourselves to descriptions of strong directionalities of the power relation, from the oppressor to the oppressed, or from interests to acts, as it were, would amount to an oversimplification of our material. The knee project organized in a relatively flat formal organizational structure and with relations dominated by discursive practices—talking, listening, writing, and reading—we found power to be ambiguous. In such a context, the enactment or display of power could be met by the counterpower of pointing at, articulating and criticizing that enactment or display. As we have shown, even the act of criticizing could be countered by criticizing the act or style of criticism. This is why we have found it more promising to identify discursive fields and figures rather than binary and directional power relations.</p>
<p>Although the mixed methods ambition of the knee project hardly can be described as successful, we believe that this research project had the potential of being productive. That is, if it had developed differently it might have come up with genuine, valuable knowledge that was more than the sum of the quantitative and qualitative findings. A clue as to how may be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689812471087">Foucault (1976)</xref>, who stresses that power is ambiguous and can be productive as well as repressive. While power/knowledge can take many expressions and be exerted in many ways, Foucault also points out how power may require resistance for its stable exertion:
<disp-quote>
<p>Every power relationship implies, at least in potential, a strategy of struggle, in which the two forces are not superimposed, do not lose their specific nature, or do not finally become confused. . . . Through such mechanisms one can direct, in a fairly constant manner and with reasonable certainty the conduct of others. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1558689812471087">Foucault, 1982</xref>, pp. 142-143)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We may recognize one such strategy of struggle in the knee project, in which the two “forces” can play out their strong cards against each other. In such meetings, each party may actually confirm and consolidate one’s specific identity, also in the observation of the epistemic and moral shortcomings of the other. When aspiring for a transcendence of disciplinary boundaries in the production of truly mixed methods knowledge, however, this strategy of struggle is easily seen as a stalemate. What is then needed?</p>
<p>Following the Foucauldian cue, we believe that some kind of rupture and destabilization is needed. Occasionally, this could happen, as when the interdisciplinary meetings ignite self-doubt, create new goals, or perhaps create new norms or values. One could easily imagine a counterfactual knee project in which the researchers began to doubt that they really “knew what good science is.” Perhaps all it would take was to change the belief that contradictions between quantitative and qualitative data were an obstacle for data integration. They <italic>could have</italic> agreed with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689812471087">Greene (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689812471087">Tashakkori and Teddlie (1998)</xref> in that integration does not necessarily require consistency, and regarded inconsistency as a resource. They could have created—as we do in hindsight—a new belief that contradictions were important empirical findings that could lead to novel descriptions of the complexity of the phenomena under study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1558689812471087">Slonim-Nevo &amp; Nevo, 2009</xref>). In that case, several of the observed patterns of exerted power—above all the accusations of low scientific quality and of lack of humility—might have vanished as they were no longer relevant.</p>
<p>Such a step is clearly easier said than done, as indeed it entails a rupture with epistemic beliefs, and we are aware that there are arguments against the managerial ambition of facilitating successful data integration and successful mixed methods research. Where Foucault might have insisted in the essential indeterminism of power struggles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1558689812471087">Gibbons et al. (1994)</xref>, in their distinction between Mode 1 (disciplinary) and Mode 2 (transdisciplinary, in their wording) research, point at some common features in their case studies of Mode 2. First, the point of departure of the research project is a practical problem, externally defined and unlikely to be negotiable. Second, the researchers are located outside their disciplinary “homes” and in teams where the disciplinary norms and values cannot act so strongly. The major epistemic value is to solve the problem as evaluated in the context of application and not to win praise from one’s peers.</p>
<p>Such organizational measures come at a cost. This is true in the very literal sense if productive disciplinary research units are to slow down their output in order to engage in unconventional research that may not even be welcomed by the highest ranked journals. It often struck us that the knee project failed because there was too little at stake—the hegemonic strategy of struggle could prevail in the absence of a strong external force or a sufficient internal drive to solve a common problem. The researchers could return safely to their disciplinary homes.</p>
<p>We call for more clarity in research planning and funding. If productive interplay across methods and disciplines comes at a cost, this cost should be reflected on and compared with the importance of the research problem. As one of the researchers of the knee project states,
<disp-quote>
<p>Doing mixed methods research requires a common understanding, and it has not been like that. We thought that it should work out by itself. We have thought that we knew what research is. And it is first in retrospect that we became aware of all the differences that we have not been explicit about. It is not just about what kind of questions you ask—it is about a completely different understanding. (Respondent 1)</p>
