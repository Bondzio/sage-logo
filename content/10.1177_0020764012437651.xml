<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mental health problems are a major public health concern worldwide. Evidence shows that African communities, including Sudan, use both modern and traditional healing systems. Sudan is a country with different modalities of health facilities; one of the most famous and popular is traditional healing. Traditional healing in Sudan is famous and popular. However, there is limited literature about the magnitude of the mental distress and associated factors among attendees of traditional healing practices in Sudan. This study aimed to determine the outcome of treatment of psychotic disorders by traditional healers in Sudan and the associated factors that influence traditional healing practices. As most persons with mental disorders are treated by traditional healers in most developing countries, it is important to do more comprehensive studies on traditional treatment and to find ways of collaboration between traditional practice and modern medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764012437651">Shibre, Spångéus, Henriksson, Negash, &amp; Jacobsson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Psychiatry in Sudan began in the 1950s under the guidance of the late Professor Tigani El Mahi, the father of African psychiatry. He pioneered, among other things, rural services and the open-door policy. His successor, Dr Taha A. Baasher, shouldered the responsibility and further extended the services to the periphery. He established the Mental Health Association of Sudan and the Sudanese Association of Psychiatrists. In 1950, the Clinic for Nervous Disorders, Khartoum North, was established. The Kober Institution was built later to cater for 120 forensic psychiatric patients. In 1971, El Tigani El Mahi Hospital was established as the national mental hospital. This was followed by the establishment of four psychiatric units in provincial capitals. However, since then mental health services have failed to extend beyond those few specialized units attached to state hospitals. This has mainly been due to a shortage of qualified staff, such as psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and psychiatric nurses. Regarding facilities, mental health is not yet part of the primary health care system. Traditional healers are often used for the provision of mental health services in Sudan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020764012437651">Sorketti, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020764012437651">Wig et al. (1980)</xref> studied attitudes towards mental disorders in rural areas of Sudan and northern India and an urban area of the Philippines using standardized interviews with key informants. The majority of informants indicated traditional healers as the primary source of help for psychological symptoms. In all areas people were more likely to seek help from traditional healers for psychological rather than for physical symptoms.</p>
<p>In Ethiopia, a country that borders Sudan in the east, the traditional Oromo society’s religious leader is the Kallu who, through an ecstatic ritual technique, can investigate the causes of a disorder and advise what to do. Mental disorders are generally explained as resulting from disturbances in the relationship between people and divinity. The orthodox Coptic Church in western Ethiopia usually looks upon mental disorders as possession by evil spirits, which are thus treated by specially gifted priests and monks by praying and giving holy water – or eventually exorcism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764012437651">Jacobsson &amp; Merdasa, 1991</xref>). Traditional treatment methods were more often preferred for treating symptoms of mental disorders and modern medicine was more often preferred for treating physical diseases or symptoms. Working in close connection with traditional healers would give the primary health care worker a better opportunity to gain acceptance from the community and modify certain harmful practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764012437651">Alem, Jacobsson, Araya, Kebede, &amp; Kullgren, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764012437651">Giel et al.’s (1981)</xref> study in four developing countries have been used to design appropriate brief training courses in childhood mental disorders for primary health workers. Subjects in Botswana were asked to state their preference between modern (doctor or nurse) or indigenous (traditional or religious healer) care for three case vignettes of epilepsy, psychosis and tuberculosis. Nurses, medical patients and a general village population were studied. Many subjects preferred modern care for all disorders, while a small number favoured indigenous treatment. Psychosis took an intermediate position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764012437651">Dale &amp; Ben-Tovim, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764012437651">Jones, Baker and Day (2010)</xref> studied healing rituals in young Sudanese refugees, 41.6% of whom originated from Sudan in northern Africa. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764012437651">Awadalla, Ohaeri, Salih and Tawfiq (2005)</xref>, using the World Health Organization 26-item Quality of Life Instrument, stated that caregivers of Sudanese outpatients with schizophrenia, major affective disorders and neuroses were satisfied with the items related to the strengths of the traditional society and dissatisfied with the items related to national economic indices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020764012437651">Saravanan et al. (2007)</xref> reported that existing evidence indicates that dissonance between patients’ and professionals’ explanatory models affects engagement of patients with psychiatric services in western and non-western countries. They qualitatively assessed the explanatory models of psychosis and their association with clinical variables in a representative sample of first-episode patients with schizophrenia in southern India. The majority of patients (70%) in their study considered spiritual and mystical factors as the cause of their predicament; 22% held multiple models of illness. Patients who held a biomedical concept of disease had significantly higher scores on the insight scale compared to those who held non-medical beliefs. Multivariate analyses identified three factors associated with holding of spiritual/mystical models (female gender, low education and visits to traditional healers), and a single factor (high level of insight) for the endorsement of a biological model. Patients with schizophrenia in this region of India hold a variety of non-medical belief models, which influence patterns of health seeking. Those holding non-medical explanatory models are likely to be rated as having less insight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020764012437651">Saravanan et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764012437651">Kurihara, Kato, Reverger and Tirta (2006)</xref> carried out a study to trace the help-seeking pathway of mental patients and to elucidate the role of traditional healing in Bali. They concluded that traditional healers are an effective provider of care for some mentally ill patients in Bali. The knowledge and recognition of psychological disorders by the traditional healers were crucial for early treatment intervention for psychiatric patients. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764012437651">Ngoma, Prince and Mann (2003)</xref> estimated that the prevalence of common mental disorders among traditional healer centre patients (48%) was double that of primary health care patients (24%).</p>
<p>A survey in southern India was carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764012437651">Campion and Bhugra (1997)</xref> over a three-month period to determine experiences of religious healing in a group of 198 consecutive psychiatric patients attending a hospital in Tamil Nadu. Of these, 89 (45%) had sought between one and 15 sessions from either Hindu, Muslim or Christian healers. The number of patients visiting healers was linked significantly with their income, while a significantly higher number under the age of 17 years had received such help compared with older age groups. A significantly higher consultation rate was observed in those patients with schizophrenia and delusional disorders when compared with other mental illnesses.</p>
<p>Patients with mental disorders in Sudan are usually brought by their families for treatment in traditional healer centres. They are usually chained to their beds or to the room wall. They have no access to toilet facilities. They are prohibited to leave their rooms until at least 40 days have passed. Sometimes patients succeed in casting off their chains and escaping from the centre. Usually the rooms in which mentally ill patients are kept are in the far corners of the traditional healer centres. The patients are deprived of all types of food apart from a special porridge made in the centre. All medications are stopped except those provided by the traditional healers and their assisting therapists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020764012437651">Sorketti &amp; Habil, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764012437651">Ahmed, Bremer, Magzoub and Nouri (1999)</xref> investigated the characteristics of visitors to traditional healers in Sudan in a sample of 134 visitors at four centres. They found that 60% came for treatment, 26% came for blessing and 4% came for consultation or education. In addition, about 45% of visitors saw traditional healers as problem solvers, 60% were aged between 21 and 40 years, 62% were female, 61% from rural areas, and 47% were illiterate. Not many previous studies in Sudan have investigated people with mental disorders in the traditional healer centre setting, and no previous studies that have addressed or investigated their conditions. Therefore, this will be the main scope of our current report. The general aims of this research were to know the treatment outcome of traditional healing approaches in treating people with mental disorders in central Sudan; and to produce recommendations to help improve the quality of services in traditional healer centres, and possibly for collaboration between traditional healers and mental health professionals.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section8-0020764012437651">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>This study was a prospective follow-up of a cohort of inpatients with psychotic disorders receiving treatment in traditional healer centres in central Sudan. Patients were interviewed on admission and at discharge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0020764012437651">
<title>Study area</title>
<p>Thirty traditional healer centres in and around the capital Khartoum and the nearby states were each assigned a number from 1 to 30 and the researchers asked a third party to randomly choose 10 of these numbers. This resulted in 10 randomly selected traditional healer centres in central Sudan in and around Khartoum State, Geziera State, White Nile State and Blue Nile State. The director of each traditional centre was approached personally by the principal investigator and the research team. An official letter was delivered to each centre explaining the purpose of the study and consent for joining the study was obtained from each centre before the start of data collections from patients. It is worth mentioning that different healers inhabiting the below-mentioned centres seem to be homogenous, belong to closely interrelated cultures, share similar socio-economic characteristics and exhibit similar methods of healing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0020764012437651">
<title>Study population</title>
<p>The main study population comprised inpatients with psychotic disorders receiving treatment in traditional healer centres in central Sudan. All inpatients receiving treatment in the selected traditional healer centre during the period of the study were recruited. The patients and their family members or relatives were interviewed on admission and at the time of their discharge from the centre.</p>

<title>Sampling</title>
<p>Sample size was calculated using the Kish and Leslie formula for single proportions for descriptive study. The calculation assumed a frequency of 9% for psychotic disorders at the traditional healer centres (based on the prevalence of mental disorders among users of traditional healer centres in Sudan); for a 95% confidence interval and a precision of <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, a total of 129 inpatients with psychotic disorders were included in the follow-up study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764012437651">Kish &amp; Frankel, 1974</xref>). We included only patients who were diagnosed as having current psychotic disorders on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) (Arabic translation version 5).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0020764012437651">
<title>Data collection technique</title>
<p>The patient’s initial questionnaire covered all the basic information including socio-economic and demographic characteristics and a profile of each of the selected traditional healer centres. The main scope of the research was to study the outcome of treatment of psychotic disorders by the traditional healers and to assess the improvement in the symptoms of the mentally ill patient’s condition within the traditional healer system. After selection, the patient was interviewed on admission and discharge using a structured questionnaire. Basic information regarding the socio-demographic profile of the patient was obtained first, which included name, age, education level and occupation or working status, area of original residence in Sudan, religion and marital status. This was followed by the symptoms of the current complaint and the duration of untreated illness, how many times the patient had been brought to the traditional healer centre, history of medical illness, family history of mental illness, and any history of drug or alcohol abuse. Then the patient was asked why he/she had come to the traditional healer centre and if he/she had been to any psychiatric services before. If not, why: did they not know about these services; were they too expensive; were they too far away from home; or was it for other reasons? If yes, had any medication been given? The patient was then asked about any precipitating factors for the current illness. Type of intervention and all types of traditional healing services provided to the patients were recorded. Finally, we asked about the cause of the mental illness from the patient’s and their family’s perception.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0020764012437651">
<title>Tools and instruments</title>
<p>Diagnosis was determined using a structured questionnaire, the MINI (Arabic translation version 5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764012437651">Amorim, Lecrubier, Weiller, Hergueta, &amp; Sheehan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764012437651">Lecrubier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020764012437651">Sheehan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020764012437651">Sheehan et al., 1998</xref>). The interviews were conducted in the Arabic language. We also used the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) to determine the severity and progress of the patients’ signs and symptoms on admission and discharge. The principal investigator and five clinical psychologists were trained to use the study instruments to carry out the interviews in Arabic and to apply the clinical scales.</p>
<p>The MINI was used to study the characteristics of people with mental disorders who were undergoing treatment in traditional healer centres in Sudan where we interviewed 405 inpatients with mental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020764012437651">Sorketti, Zainal, &amp; Habil, 2011</xref>). We then selected the psychotic group of patients (only schizophrenics) (we did not include individuals with ‘brief reactive psychosis’, ‘schizo-affective disorder’, ‘major depressive/bipolar mood disorder with psychotic features’ or ‘dementia or delirium’ (with psychotic features). We were able to enrol 129 patients in the study and we followed them up from admission until they were discharged.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0020764012437651">
<title>Ethical approval</title>
<p>Ethical approval was obtained before the start of data collection from the Directorate of Health Research in the Federal Ministry of Health in Sudan. Because our study population comprised psychotic patients who lacked insight and judgement and were brought involuntarily by their families, informed consent was obtained from each participant’s family or close relatives accompanying them for treatment at the traditional healer centre before they joined the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0020764012437651">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data were analysed using statistical package (SPSS) version 16. Descriptive statistics were undertaken through constructing frequency tables and graphs, and finding means and standard deviations for the quantitative variables. Cross-tabulation using <italic>χ</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> tests and one-way ANOVAs was also used to examine the association between variables and to test the significance of relationships.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study was a follow-up of a cohort of inpatients with psychotic disorders receiving treatment in traditional healer centres in central Sudan. There was a general trend for the symptoms scale (PANSS) to show an obvious reduction from the day of arrival and admission to the centre to the time of discharge. Traditional healers make a unique contribution that is complementary to other approaches. They also tend to be the entry point for care in many low-income communities including Sudan and other African countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020764012437651">Richter, 2003</xref>). The help that patients received at this traditional healer centre served as an alternative to clinical psychiatric treatment for these people with mental disorders. This therefore raises a lot of questions about the effectiveness of the help they received.</p>
<p>The observed reduction of 49% in the mean PANSS scores in our study in Sudan is similar to one of the studies conduct by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764012437651">Abbo (2011)</xref> about the outcome of traditional healing in Uganda, where they observed a 30%–40% reduction in the PANSS score. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020764012437651">Raguram, Venkateswaran, Ramakrishna and Weiss (2002)</xref>, in a study in a temple environment in India, observed a 20% reduction in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores. It is quite interesting to note that these results represent a level of clinical improvement that matches that achieved by many psychotropic agents, including the newer atypical agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020764012437651">Raguram et al., 2002</xref>). In clinical studies a reduction of at least 20%, 30%, 40% or 50% of the initial PANSS score has been used as a cut-off to define ‘response’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764012437651">Leucht et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although traditional healing approaches produce significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of psychotic disorders measured on the PANSS, still we cannot recommend traditional healing as an alternative to modern ways of management for people with mental disorders because a lot of issues need to be raised about the approaches practised by the healers in these centres, such as isolating patients in an unhealthy, non-hygienic environment, depriving them of nutritional food, beating them, chaining them to the wall and stopping their antipsychotic medication. Furthermore, administering traditional treatment without the patient’s consent raises a lot of concern about human rights and ethical issues; in some cases patients are treated this way for up to 18 months. It is important to mention at this point the effect of war and conflicts and instability in a country like Sudan that make a broad segment of the population prone to poverty and lacking access to health services; high numbers of patients with mental disorders have no other choice but to approach traditional healers for help.</p>
<sec id="section20-0020764012437651">
<title>Reasons for PANSS improvement</title>
<p>There has been a lot of discussion about the reasons and factors behind the improvement in PANSS scores witnessed after traditional treatment, particularly concerning the cultural power of staying in the traditional healer centre that has the effect of reducing severe agitation, aggression, talkativeness and most of the severe psychotic symptoms. There has been a long-standing debate about this issue between sociologists and psychologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764012437651">Buhrmann, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764012437651">Cheetham &amp; Griffiths, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764012437651">Gumede, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020764012437651">Straker, 1994</xref>), which mentions differences between African and western healing, some of which are listed below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764012437651">Cheetham &amp; Griffiths, 1982</xref>):</p>

<p>We can view the advantages of traditional healing approaches in comparison to the medical health care system from many different aspects, including:</p>
<list id="list4-0020764012437651" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Culture</italic>. Traditional healers and ritualists share the sociocultural value system of their client.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Personality of the healer</italic>. Traditional healing recognizes the importance of the personality of the therapist who achieves and maintains confidence-inspiring charisma. In modern medicine the therapeutic technique rather than the personality of the therapist is assumed to be the most important factor.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Holistic approach</italic>. Traditional healing practices usually integrate physical, psychological, spiritual and social methods, as opposed to modern medicine, which is becoming increasingly fragmented through over-specializing and technologizing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Accessibility and availability</italic>. Traditional healers are the first resort in most developing areas due more to their geographical permanence and accessibility than their therapeutic merits. Modern health staff tends to be urban located, highly mobile and changing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Affectivity therapy and altered state of consciousness</italic>. Traditional healing utilizes suggestive methods and manipulation of culturally validated images and symbols, working on the patient’s affectivity to achieve the therapeutic goals rather than relying on rational understanding and insight in order to correct faulty behaviour. The effective utilization of altered state of consciousness, induced by physiological and psychological means in the ritual therapy of substance dependence, is of special interest in view of the assumed interrelationship of such states with opiate receptors and the neuroendocrine opioid system.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Collective therapy management</italic>. Traditional healing in most cases also involves the patient’s family and other community members who may join forces with the healer and patient to define the underlying problem and remedial action. Traditional healing therefore tends to be relational. It also tends to foster kinship and community cohesion to facilitate the patient’s re-integration.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Social engineering</italic>. The traditional healer’s advice carries weight through his prestige and charisma and may in some cases also be sanctioned by supernatural authority. The healer is therefore in a position to manipulate directly or indirectly the patient’s immediate human environment to favour the achievement of the therapeutic goals.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Cost-effectiveness</italic>. There is no doubt that utilization of the traditional healer resources is considerably more cost-effective for the public than utilization of the official health services. Consumer cost for utilization of traditional healer services varies and is usually individualized; often there are no obligatory fees but instead there is the expectation of donation.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Some researchers believe that the improvement seen in mental illness is due to residence in the traditional healer centre and to the intervention techniques and the therapy methods practised by the healer. Another factor or reason could be the supportive care regardless of the duration of stay in the traditional healer centre. In this study, the mean duration of stay in the traditional healer centre was 4.5 months; some researchers have argued that a few weeks of stay in a supportive traditional healing environment is better than a long stay in a modern psychiatric setting. This may explain the better outcomes for schizophrenia reported in low-income traditional communities.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020764012437651">Peltzer and Machleidt (1992)</xref> studied the bio-psycho-social therapeutic models for schizophrenia in three traditional African settings in terms of organization, environment, culture, family and follow-up and compared them to the current western model of psychiatric practices. They concluded that the traditional healer centre setting is in a number of ways superior to the western model. On the other hand, things have changed in modern psychiatry today, in the era of the atypical antipsychotics and the huge shift from long-stay institutional care towards community psychiatric mental health care. Furthermore, the availability of psychiatry departments in general hospitals and the availability of mental health services at primary health care level in many countries may contribute to the shifting of this balance. The management of psychiatric disorders becomes more easy and comprehensive in modern psychiatric settings. The popularity of alternative medicine in the community should alert decision-makers to look at the difficulty of access to the health system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764012437651">Al-Faris et al., 2008</xref>). The common reasons given for visiting traditional healers were belief of treatment success, preference of natural materials and non-response to medical treatment. Complementary and alternative medicine is a reality and it deserves more investigation and appropriate legislation and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764012437651">Al-Rowais, Al-Faris, Mohammad, Al-Rukban, &amp; Abdulghani, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In our study more than 50% of the patients spent one to two months only in the traditional healer centres for treatment; only 10 patients stayed for more than one year. Those who stayed for more than two months were involved in rehabilitation activities rather than therapy and treatment. These rehabilitation activities included participation in religious rituals and ceremonies, welcoming guests to the centre, cooking food and cleaning the centre, participating in the traditional healer school by teaching small kids, and so on. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764012437651">Ae-Ngibise et al. (2010)</xref> in their study in Ghana has mentioned that limited research has been conducted to explore the factors that support or obstruct collaboration between traditional healers and public sector mental health services. They indicated many reasons for the appeal of traditional and faith healers, including cultural perceptions of mental disorders, the psychosocial support afforded by such healers, as well as their availability, accessibility and affordability. A number of barriers hindering collaboration, including human rights and safety concerns, scepticism around the effectiveness of ‘conventional’ treatments, and traditional healer solidarity, were identified. Mutual respect and bi-directional conversations surfaced as the key ingredients for successful partnerships. They concluded that collaboration is not as easy as commonly assumed, given paradigmatic disjuncture and widespread scepticism between different treatment modalities. Promoting greater understanding, rather than maintaining indifferent distances, may lead to more successful cooperation in future. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020764012437651">Sorketti, Zuraida and Habil (2010)</xref> stated that collaboration between psychiatrists and traditional healers could help to end harmful methods of practice by the traditional healers, such as: isolating patients in an unhealthy, non-hygienic environment; depriving patients of nutritional food; beating patients; misdiagnosis; and mismanagement.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020764012437651">Sorsdahl, <italic>Flisher, Wilson and Stein</italic> (2010)</xref> stated that, in many traditional belief systems in Africa, including South Africa, mental health problems may be attributed to the influence of ancestors or to bewitchment. Traditional healers are viewed as having the expertise to address these causes. They found that traditional healers held multiple explanatory models for psychotic and non-psychotic disorders. Psychotic illnesses appear to be the main exemplar of mental illness and were treated with traditional medicine, while non-psychotic illnesses were not viewed as a mental illness at all. They concluded that investigations of the effectiveness of traditional healer treatment for psychiatric disorders should be conducted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764012437651">Karim, Saeed, Rana, Mubbashar and Jenkins (2004)</xref> from Pakistan stated that mental illnesses are stigmatized and widely perceived to have supernatural causes. The extent of stigma on mental illness varies according to the cultural and sociological backgrounds of each society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764012437651">Al-Adawi et al., 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764012437651">Jacobsson and Merdasa (1991)</xref>, in their study in Ethiopia, stated that according to Islamic teaching in that area, mental disorders are caused by evil spirits sent by God to punish the unfaithful people. Some Muslim sheiks treat mental cases with prayers but herbal remedies are also used. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764012437651">Jolly (1999)</xref> looked at the concept of the indigenous healers and drew on experiences of those closely involved with the progress of one soldier who, after feeling unwell, believed he was destined to become a shaman. Initially treated by western methods, which failed to resolve his situation, he returned to Nepal to consult with the local traditional healers. The soldier spent six weeks in Nepal and was seen by three different types of local shamans. Upon his return to Britain, the soldier claimed to be free of symptoms and returned to his normal military duties.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764012437651">Borras et al. (2007)</xref> examined how religious beliefs and practices impact upon medication and illness representations in chronic schizophrenia. One hundred and three stabilized patients were included from Geneva’s outpatient public psychiatric facility in Switzerland. Interviews were conducted to investigate spiritual and religious beliefs and religious practices and religious coping. Medication adherence was assessed through questions to patients and to their psychiatrists and by a systematic blood-drug monitoring. Thirty-two per cent of patients were partially or totally non-adherent to oral medication. Fifty-eight per cent of patients were Christian, 4% Buddhist, 3% Muslim, 2% Jewish, 14% belonged to various minority or syncretic religious movements, and 19% had no religious affiliation. Two-thirds of the total sample considered spirituality as very important or even essential in everyday life. Fifty-seven per cent of patients had a representation of their illness directly influenced by their spiritual beliefs (positively in 31% and negatively in 26%). Religious representations of illness were prominent in non-adherent patients. Thirty-one per cent of non-adherent patients and 27% of partially adherent patients underlined an incompatibility or contradiction between their religion and taking medication, versus 8% of adherent patients. Religion and spirituality contribute to shaping representations of disease and attitudes toward medical treatment in patients with schizophrenia. This dimension should be on the agenda of psychiatrists working with patients with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764012437651">Borras et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764012437651">Mona and Rakhawy (2010)</xref> in Eygpt stated that mentally disordered people have a considerable tendency towards the use of faith healing and believe in its abilities to improve their conditions. Behaviour-seeking tendency is generally directed towards primary health care services, relatives and faith healers. Such results can be the foundation for mental health reforms and for future research in the Arab world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020764012437651">Odejide, Oyewunmi and Ohaeri (1989)</xref>, in their overview about psychiatry in Africa, mentioned that to achieve the goal of mental health care for all Africans, psychiatry should be included in the primary health care programme, regional postgraduate medical centres are needed, and a means of gathering statistics and funding research should be fostered. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020764012437651">Patel, Simunyu and Gwanzura (1997)</xref> reported that pathways to care for mental illness are diverse and are dependent on sociocultural and economic factors.</p>
<p>The important role that religious beliefs may have on perceptions of mental illness cannot be ignored. Many religions, including Islam, advocate witchcraft and spirit possession, all of which are thought to influence the behaviour of a person so as to resemble that of a mentally ill individual. Thus this research explored Muslim faith healers’ perceptions of mental and spiritual illness in terms of their understanding of the distinctions between the two, the aetiologies and the treatments thereof. Six Muslim healers in the Johannesburg community in South Africa were interviewed and thematic content analysis was used to analyse the data. From the results it is clear that the faith healers were aware of the distinction between mental and spiritual illnesses. It was also apparent that Islam has a clear taxonomy that distinguishes illness and the causes thereof. Treatments are then advised accordingly. The conclusion was that understanding of mental illness needs to acknowledge its various culturally inclined taxonomies to better understand and aid clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764012437651">Ally &amp; Laher, 2008</xref>). Professor Tigani El Mahi stressed that our attitudes towards religious healers should aim to encourage good quality of practice while trying to end harmful or faulty methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764012437651">Elsafi &amp; Baasher, 1981</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764012437651">El-Gaili, Magzoub and Schmidt (2002)</xref> reported, in their study in Sudan, that until recently, interest and concern about mental health was mainly left to religious healers and such healers continue to see the majority of mental patients. Traditional healers in Sudan perform many valuable services and social benefits to the community; nevertheless, traditional healing is not formally institutionalized, as there is no responsible government entity to guide and supervise the delivery of traditional healing services. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764012437651">Adewuya and Makanjuola (2009)</xref> stressed that any effort to improve professional mental health services must consider and address beliefs and preferences of the public in regard to mental health treatment.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of this study suggest that traditional healing approaches produce significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of psychotic disorders. We cannot underestimate the role of traditional healers in providing culturally and sociably accepted care to their community. An atmosphere of understanding, trust and respect should be created between modern health workers, traditional healers and the communities they serve. It is very important for psychiatrists to collaborate with traditional healers because most people with mental illness consult traditional healers first, or they alternate between healers and doctors, thereby wasting a lot of resources. We can at least make use of the traditional healer centres to be like community psychiatric practice in the western health care model.</p>
