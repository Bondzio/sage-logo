<p>This is a passionate book. It is an optimistic book. Above all, as its author admits, it is a celebratory book that draws our attention to the efforts of media activists in local communities who strive to use media to support people who live with the ever-present threat of violence, terrorism, and armed conflict. As a Colombian herself, Clemencia Rodríguez has an interest in the situations she describes and analyzes: the book is not only a set of case studies, it is also a personal account of her travels within her country where, despite Rodríguez’s substantial earlier work on Colombian media, she is still able to be surprised and thrilled by what she finds. What she does find are numerous examples of the creative deployment of community media in the service of local communities threatened by guerrilla warfare, paramilitary raids, and drug traffickers. These are “citizens’ media,” a term that has a particular theoretical power for Rodríguez. First proposed in her 2001 book, <italic>Fissures in the Mediascape</italic>, citizens’ media work to engage social groups (usually local neighborhood communities or villages, but also groups of young people or women) in becoming “active citizens” of their own locale. Building on Chantal Mouffe’s notion of radical democracy, Rodríguez argues that by using media technologies to make films as well as radio and television programs that embody their own situations, fears, and dreams, local people trapped in cultures of violence can begin to realize their own methods of coping with that violence. As Rodríguez puts it, citizens’ media can be thought of as the “lived experience of nonviolent ways to manage conflict, deal with difference, and interact with one another” (p. 254). In short, local communities become engaged in everyday political action.</p>
<p>In a country where access to technology is often highly limited, the innovations Rodríguez discovers are by turns charming, ingenious, and significant. It is no surprise that the dominant media form in Colombia appears to be radio, a relatively cheap and accessible form. Radio Andaqui makes it even more accessible through its “radiocycle,” a bicycle-mounted outside-broadcast unit with its own transmitter, that can be used by individuals and groups across the region. Lacking professional film-making equipment, Magdalena Medio’s <italic>fotovideo</italic> project gives digital cameras and minidiscs to local children to produce <italic>son et lumière</italic> presentations that are projected outside their homes. Magdalena Medio also hosts a radio program that is entirely produced by children without any adult supervision. As one (adult) radio producer acknowledges: “sometimes they do crazy stuff, but that’s the idea, that they express themselves” (p. 214). A series of such vignettes are contextualized in four central chapters, each of which deals with a particular region of the country, and where specific historical, geographic and economic contexts are presented as they materially affect local communities and their uses of media. It is here that Rodriguez is careful to point out the limits of her celebration, as well as what citizens’ media under these conditions are not able to achieve. The perennial problems of finance and labor are rehearsed: too many community media projects rely on donations of money and second-hand equipment; and staffed by volunteers, they often suffer from high turnover and “burn out” through overwork. Specific to cultures of violence, though, are further limits on what it is possible to achieve. With one exception, all the media projects acknowledge that it is impossible for them to direct combat violence, or even confront its perpetrators, for fear of reprisals.</p>
<p>There are three key possibilities for citizens’ media, Rodríguez argues. First, there is evidence that community media are being used to re-appropriate public spaces, to re-integrate communities and combat the isolation felt by communities in war zones (or war-like zones). Second, and consequently, such activities enable local participation in decision-making to be enhanced. Finally, at the heart of citizen’s media is not the use of communication technologies to provide information or to represent experience, but media practice understood in a performative sense, where individuals and groups use media to experience the world as they construct it for themselves. These claims are problematic, not least because considerations of structure and agency are often obscure in the case studies. Rodríguez places great store by those she terms “wise local community media leaders” and “media pioneers,” but we are not told how they come by that status and how it is accepted by the communities in which they work. We know little about how participants are educated in media production or how techniques and approaches are developed and sustained. (There is a brief, fascinating comment made by one of Rodriguez’s colleagues about “citizens’ media d’auteur” that, if developed, might have been useful here.) Otherwise, despite the often extremely egalitarian nature of some projects (such as the children’s radio program mentioned earlier), there is a sense of many projects being led by “great men” and that is in need of some unravelling. It may be that the social structures of the communities studied are variously influenced by different forms of authority, but this is not clear in the accounts presented. A richer autoethnographic account of Rodríguez’s own dealings with communities and “media pioneers” might have shed light on these relationships.</p>
<p>Most crucial is the question of audiences—who are they and how do they benefit? Despite the emphasis on media production as lived experience, all the projects presented here entail some kind of broadcasting to wider communities, but we are told relatively little about the impact the media have beyond the people directly involved in the project. One community media leader is described as someone who “cultivates media audiences as much as he cultivates media producers” (p. 55), but we are not told how. This is especially important respecting the claim Rodríguez makes about the ability of citizens’ media in Colombia to reconstruct lifeworlds and to shape local cultural and collective imaginaries—the social mechanisms through which these processes might be achieved (and indeed, what they are meant to mean in different locales) remain unexamined. It seems at times that the possibilities of citizens’ media exceed the examples presented in the book itself. The final chapter, promising the elements of a “theory of citizens’ media in contexts of war” (p. 231), does not offer more than a typology of what might be achieved. While these concerns might limit its contribution to media theory, the book nevertheless remains a remarkable study of everyday life in extraordinary situations, where media production—however modestly— brings some kind of peace to the lives of ordinary people.</p>
