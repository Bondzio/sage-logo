<abstract>
<p>This study explored the mechanisms at play as new family counselors are learning to apply a systems approach. A qualitative case study was used to investigate the experiences of nine family counseling interns over two semesters of internship through the lens of constructive developmental theory. The findings extend our understanding by providing students' accounts of the ways by which disequilibrium preceded development when accommodation was stimulated, and the outcomes when assimilation occurred. It also generated data about positive emotional response to clients that is new and intriguing and which may impact developmental growth. Implications for counselor education that incorporate developmental considerations are presented.</p>

<body>
<p>Since the development of systems theory and family therapy in the 1950s, little attention has been given to the conceptualization of family therapy education and curricula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480712448787">Eisler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1066480712448787">Touliatos, Lindholm, &amp; Nichols, 1997</xref>). No consensus yet exists on best practices for the effective training of family therapists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712448787">Goldenberg &amp; Goldenberg, 2007</xref>). At the same time, there is an emphasis in the literature on the difficulties students encounter when challenged to make a conceptual shift to a systems framework. This shift must occur while students are learning new theories, incorporating new theory into practice, and developing new skills. Thus, the goal of this inquiry was to study the learning challenges encountered by new family counselors through the lens of constructive developmental theory (CDT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480712448787">Kegan, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480712448787">1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The literature on family therapy has emphasized the need for a conceptual shift to systemic thinking for successful practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712448787">Goldenberg &amp; Goldenberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066480712448787">Nichols &amp; Schwartz, 2005</xref>). Contemporary family therapy practice requires proficiency in family counseling, consultation, instructional modifications, behavioral interventions, and problem-solving strategies used integratively to reconstruct the relationships between family members and the systems in which they operate—home, school, and community. New family counselors must move beyond culturally embedded meanings of the “normal” or “functional” family in order to develop interventions based on accurate and comprehensive views of family problems. Because students are challenged to conceptualize in this new, more complex way, they are tasked with integrating theory, knowledge, and skills that differ from those previously learned in individual counseling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480712448787">Avis &amp; Sprenkle, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712448787">Goldenberg &amp; Goldenberg, 2007</xref>). This conceptual shift is compounded by feelings of anxiety related to uncertainity, performance evaluation, and feelings of incompetence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480712448787">Horne, Dagley, &amp; Webster, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480712448787">Laszloffy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066480712448787">Nel, 2006</xref>). Added to this is the intensity of affective responses students experience when facing the array of difficulties and issues client families present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480712448787">Hodgson, Lamson, &amp; Feldhousen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480712448787">Stolk &amp; Perlesz, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480712448787">Kegan (1994)</xref>, adult learning involves more than the acquisition of skills, mastery of a field’s body of knowledge, and behavior that meets professional standards. It also involves the evolution of new and more complex forms of awareness for organizing experiences; that is, an advancement in a person’s level of cognitive development. This echoes what several authors have asserted about family therapy requiring more than just conceptual and skill-based proficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480712448787">Minuchin &amp; Fishman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066480712448787">Nelson &amp; Smock, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Arguments for using an adult development approach to family therapy training have emphasized the importance of the student’s perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066480712448787">Nelson &amp; Smock, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066480712448787">Street, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066480712448787">Street (1997)</xref>, in a review of the research on family therapy training, criticized it as overly program-oriented, “lacking a multi-perspective approach (particularly that of the trainee), and not making use of qualitative research methods” (p. 89). He stated:<disp-quote>
<p>Any discussion of family therapy training should as a first step consider the general context of adult learning and professional education, for it is within this context that important issues and parameters will be found that have a direct bearing on the evaluation of training. (p. 89)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<sec id="section1-1066480712448787">
<title>CDT</title>
<p>Cognitive developmental theories, of which CDT is a contemporary version, have been useful frameworks for creating and enhancing professional preparation programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066480712448787">Sprinthall, 1994</xref>), and have been particularly conspicuous in the counselor education literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480712448787">Kaiser &amp; Ancellotti, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066480712448787">Sprinthall, 1994</xref>). Research has shown that higher levels of psychological maturity in adults predict desirable counseling behaviors, such as greater levels of empathy and a capacity to comprehend and match needs of clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480712448787">Holloway &amp; Wampold, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712448787">Peace, 1995</xref>). And, higher empathy scores are consistently linked to higher stages of development across a number of domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480712448787">Carlozzi, Gaa, &amp; Liberman, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480712448787">McAullife &amp; Lovell, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>CDT emphasizes both the <italic>construction </italic>of a person’s understanding and the <italic>development </italic>of that construction to more complex levels over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480712448787">Kegan, 1994</xref>). Kegan highlighted that a person actively constructs meaning of new experiences and emphasized the learner’s subjective experiences as this process unfolds, thus the importance is placed on the person’s active meaning making process and how that is experienced—this emphasis distinguishes CDT from other models of developmental supervision that focus on supervisee characteristics at early versus later stages of functioning as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480712448787">Borders and Brown (2005)</xref>.</p>
<p>In CDT, six stages of meaning construction detail how one organizes self-other relationships, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480712448787">Kegan (1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480712448787">1994</xref>) termed subject–object balances. Each stage is organized by how one conceives what is self (subject) and what is other (object). What is <italic>subject</italic> refers to that which a person is unable to articulate, reflect on, or organize—he or she cannot yet take a perspective on it. <italic>Object</italic> refers to that which is consciously understood, reflected on, and organized. The subject of a stage becomes the object of the next stage—with stage growth a perspective can be taken on the previous stage upon which the developmental movement is built.</p>
<p>Three stages typically occur in childhood and adolescence (incorporative, impulsive, and instrumental), and three higher stages are most often seen in adulthood (the socializing, self-authoring, and interindividual; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480712448787">Kegan et al., 2001</xref>). Briefly, at the three lower stages individuals organize experience mostly from an egocentric perspective, whereas at the three higher stages they incorporate more varied perspectives of situations and problems. At the socializing stage—the most common in adulthood—a person organizes experience from a relational perspective. There is not yet an ability to view relationships as an object of reflection and mental organization. Next at the self-authoring stage, one develops a new capacity to reflect on and organize relationships, allowing movement from relationships as subject to relationships as objects of thinking. The person is now able to actively organize and direct relationships. At the highest interindividual Stage, one few attain, a person has the capacity to take a “dialectical” perspective on previous stages in an integrative way.</p>
<p>With a focus on self-other organization, CDT addresses the intrapersonal and interpersonal realms of experience, making it salient for studying students’ experiences as they are challenged to comprehend the complexity involved in working with families. Because family therapy involves coordinating the intricate, multifaceted systemic relationships among the therapist and family, the subsystems, and the individual members, it is an endeavor that demands a complex construction of the self in relation to clients. As well, CDT characterizes psychological growth as distressing in nature, entailing a sense of disequilibrium—a description that is consistent with the emphasis on student anxiety found in the family therapy literature.</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480712448787">Kegan (1994)</xref>, growth is conceived as transformative in that when someone changes not only behavior and feelings change but the fundamental way someone knows changes. Growth is stimulated when one’s current mode of constructing meaning is no longer adaptive. Then a person feels disequilibrium, the state of unbalance felt when new experiences cannot be assimilated or accommodated easily into current modes of understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480712448787">Berger, 2005</xref>). These experiences on their own are not sufficient, as development also requires a supportive environment and opportunities for guided reflection (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480712448787">Kaiser &amp; Ancellotti, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480712448787">Morgan, Morgan, Foster, &amp; Kolbert, 2000</xref>). Psychological growth “does not occur automatically, but must be stimulated given an adequate learning environment that includes opportunities for role-taking, support, challenge and guided reflection” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480712448787">Morgan et al., 2000</xref>, p. 206). Development must be carefully and deliberately facilitated (Sprinthall, 1984).</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of the learning experiences of beginning family counselors from their point of view. We posed these research questions: (a) How do new family counselors describe their affective experiences with families? (b) How do they conceptualize the therapeutic relationship with families? (c) How can these experiences be interpreted through the lens of Kegan’s theory?</p>
</sec>

<title>Method</title>
<p>A qualitative multiple case study design was used to describe, analyze, and interpret the experiences of beginning family counselors. A multiple case study investigates the phenomena of interest across several cases, contributing to the thematic knowledge about both the process and outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712448787">Baxter &amp; Jack, 2008</xref>), and is suited for addressing problems that require more in-depth understanding for improving professional practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480712448787">Merriam, 1998</xref>). It takes into account the contexts and conditions of individual cases while also comparing them to form more general categories of how the cases may be related.</p>
<sec id="section3-1066480712448787">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants included a purposefully selected sample of nine full-time graduate students at a small university in the southeastern United States. They were enrolled in a 9-month family counseling internship at a university-based family counseling center accredited by the Council on Accreditation for Counseling and Related Educational Programs. Purposeful sampling aims to recruit participants who are experiencing the specific phenomena of interest to the researcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1066480712448787">Stake, 1995</xref>). Four female and five male participants were recruited from internship classes; they ranged in age from 23 to 43 years, were Caucasian, and included both masters and doctoral-level students. All were new to family counseling with only an 8-week family counseling practicum (or equivalent) as previous experience. The university’s institutional review board determined that the study fell into the exempt category, as data collection was not substantively different from that already being used for ongoing program evaluation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1066480712448787">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Each participant completed seven individual interviews with the first author, who had no personal or professional relationship with the students. The 35- to 55-min interviews occurred over the 9-month internship year, and were aligned with times at which participants would be actively engaged in family therapy work—prior to initial family sessions, shortly after conducting initial family sessions, and about monthly thereafter. Four of the interviews sought to identify participants’ perceptions of the family counseling process and themselves as family counselors. Specifically they examined the kinds of experiences that had been most challenging or surprising to the participants in their work with families as well as their emotional responses to those experiences (e.g., How do the emotional responses you experience while working with a family impact the work you do with them?). Alternating with these were three interviews that focused on segments of videotaped family sessions participants selected as particularly important to their development. Questions were aimed at eliciting participants’ perceptions of their work with client families (e.g., How do you decide if your work with this family has been successful?) Interviews were semistructured so that participants were afforded considerable latitude to go beyond parameters of the questions.</p>
<p>To minimize bias arising from the methods used, sources of data were triangulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480712448787">Creswell, 1994</xref>) with additional data sources from essays, biweekly journals, and end-of-semester portfolios. The essays were specific to the study—to begin to build each case study in detail participants were asked to write about their initial expectations of the internship. The journals involved biweekly participant reflections on their work with families and provided an ongoing written account of students’ learning experiences over the year. Portfolios were an internship course requirement that comprised a summary of the internship experiences at the end of a semester including the perceived challenges encountered, and perceived successes at overcoming them. Portfolios provided summative insight into a participant’s developing sense of adequacy as a family counselor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1066480712448787">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Inductive analysis of the individual interviews involved a five-step process. First, codes were developed by reading and rereading interview transcripts, memoing, and using word count checks on each of the 63 interviews. Codes were then applied to each interview that were extracted and grouped together thematically; this resulted in three to six themes for each participant at 7 points in time.</p>
<p>Second, the primary themes that emerged for each individual were entered into a matrix of themes that emerged at each interview—this served to track themes that recurred as well as new ones that emerged for each student over time. Third, participants’ essays, journals, and portfolios were analyzed by comparing the interview themes with content in each data source. In many instances, these data reflected the interview themes and expanded on the participants’ meaning constructions. Fourth, the themes for participants were compared to determine common themes across cases. Finally, an interpretation of each participant’s level of psychological development was done using Kegan’s stage assessment methodology which was separate from the qualitative analysis of the interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480712448787">Lahey, Souvaine, Kegan, Goodman, &amp; Felix, 1988</xref>) applied to each participant’s interviews. Seven interviews for each participant were examined for modes of meaning construction based on both emotional and cognitive content.</p>
<p>To ensure credibility and trustworthiness during data analysis, other strategies were used in addition to triangulation of multiple data sources. Clarification of researcher bias was done prior to the study, participants reviewed interview transcripts for accuracy, and periodic peer reviews and audits were conducted during data collection and analysis. Prolonged engagement was accomplished through extended interviews with participants over the 9 months.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1066480712448787">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The goal of a multiple case study is to determine collective themes by comparing the individual cases to better understand the topic of interest. Six themes emerged from the data analysis: disequilibrium, assimilation or accommodation, therapeutic relationship, systems theory, identity, and emotional response.</p>
<sec id="section7-1066480712448787">
<title>Disequilibrium</title>
<p>Disequilibrium, the unbalance that occurs in unfamiliar situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480712448787">Berger, 2005</xref>), emerged for all students and was expressed consistently over the year. It was seen with varying levels of intensity and in diverse ways, often in response to questions about feelings that arose in sessions. Uncertainty about competencies or the value of family counseling itself was voiced by nearly all participants at some point. They were most likely to convey this when anticipating immediately challenging situations or when encountering unfamiliar situations with families. Intensities ranged from mild (<italic>I’m feeling frustrated</italic>), to moderate (<italic>I’m really struggling</italic>), to high (<italic>I’m not getting it</italic>).</p>
<p>One intern felt disequilibrium when families rejected her interventions later in the year. She discussed their “resistance” and struggled to make sense of the reasons she had success earlier on but not with these “resistant families.” Another student related that even though he had counseling experience, he felt really unsure of himself working with families and felt: “confusion, I think would be the closest emotional word I could come up with because I wasn’t anxious, I wasn’t scared, it was more confusing, just trying to figure out. . .[what to do].”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1066480712448787">
<title>Assimilation or Accommodation</title>
<p>All participants had themes for assimilation or accommodation, the complimentary mechanisms operating during developmental change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480712448787">Berger, 2005</xref>). Accommodation—the formulation of new ways of understanding when experiences do not fit old schemas—emerged as a theme for the majority of participants, while assimilation—the attempt to apply currently-held knowledge and understanding to new and unfamiliar problems or situations—arose for two students. The accommodative themes most often pertained to changing views about how the process of family therapy worked. This was observed when one intern voiced his emerging perception of therapeutic change as a process that has an “ebb and flow” with progress evident at some times but not necessarily every session. As noted above one student struggled with engaging with “resistant clients” and ultimately recognized in her final journal: “Part of me wonders what I could be doing differently. Perhaps, I need to find a different, more effective approach.” These examples illustrate a dawning awareness that previous modes of understanding were not adequate for current challenges and interns were accommodating to the new learning situations.</p>
<p>Two students had themes for assimilation indicating they were applying prior schemas to their new experiences. One often expressed that he wanted to “highlight the positive” in family therapy because it was the approach adopted in his previous work. In a similar attempt to fit the family counseling experiences into a previous ways of working another student explained: “I rely on my gut instinct.” Both students showed little evidence of accommodation over the year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1066480712448787">
<title>Therapeutic Relationship</title>
<p>Several students relied on ideas about the therapeutic relationship to guide their therapeutic actions. Three students in particular viewed client comfort as the key marker of success and stressed the importance of supporting family members, making them comfortable, and encouraging feeling expression. One indicated a focus on comfort when she said: “I need to join with them enough that they are comfortable talking about their personal problems and family problems that they probably wouldn’t talk to anybody else about.” A student who began to recognize the need to focus on family interactions noted later in the year: “I need to be a little demanding in terms of ‘I don’t want you to talk to me, I want you to talk to him.’” Another said, “Theory is important but it’s really not what theory you use, it about the client-therapist relationship.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1066480712448787">
<title>Systems Theory</title>
<p>In contrast, other participants had themes for systems theory as well as the therapeutic relationship; they articulated the importance of relationship building and the specific need for a systems perspective for understanding and solving family problems. One student spoke of the importance of “working with the whole system,” and another consistently highlighted the use of “a family framework” and added, “The relationship encourages depth.” There was evidence for emerging ideas about systems theory for some students who did not have a theme for it. At the end of the year, one student stated his goal was to “become more proficient applying structural family therapy techniques. . . and make further progress in moving away from individual therapy techniques.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1066480712448787">
<title>Identity</title>
<p>Identity, a theme reflecting participants’ self-perceptions in relation to their new roles, relates to the degree to which a student articulated a family counselor identity, and for some, having a clear identity was an essential. One student represented himself as “being who I am” as a family therapist and another emphasized that he was “an introspective person” when describing how he approached work with families. Less clear about an identity and struggling with seeing herself as a family counselor, another revealed this view of herself when encouraged to be more directive with families: “I am not confrontational. . . I’ve never really been like that.” An emergent identity could be seen most clearly with the student who described having “an inner feeling and a sort of inner voice that tells you what you are supposed to be doing and then when you do it, it just feels right.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1066480712448787">
<title>Emotional Response</title>
<p>This theme reflected the positive affective responses participants expressed about their client families. It emerged most powerfully during reviews of videotaped family sessions as they discussed aspects of sessions they believed were most important to their own development. The positive emotions were expressed in terms such as “they’re really neat” or “they’re an amazing family,” and others identified unanticipated feelings of care they felt. An intern who was typically reticent about expressing feelings, identified a highlight of his internship as seeing families “break patterns that weren’t working for them,” and stated, “I think it’s really amazing to get to know people and see who they actually are.”</p>
<p>The themes were also examined for possible patterns by developmental stage. Then themes for each participant were explored to determine any changes over the 9 months.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1066480712448787">
<title>Patterns of Themes by Developmental Stage and Over Time</title>
<sec id="section14-1066480712448787">
<title>Themes and Developmental Stage</title>
<p>At the end of the internship students fell generally into the transitional positions between the socializing and self-authoring stages of Kegan’s scheme. Those at slightly higher stages had these themes in common: they articulated integrating the importance of the therapeutic relationship and systems theory in their conceptualization and they expressed a more distinct identity. These patterns in conceptualization and identity suggest that both the ability to formulate and articulate a conceptualization of family therapy and an identity varied in accordance with developmental position. Related to identity it is interesting that the student closest to transitioning to a self-authoring position expressed a strong belief in her sense of purpose; this can be interpreted as movement toward identity, further endorsing the notion of identity formation at higher developmental stages.</p>

<title>Developmental Growth</title>
<p>As interpreted using Kegan’s scheme, four students exhibited within-stage transition, three showed no movement, one appeared to be moving toward within-stage change, and one rather dramatically exhibited movement from a primarily socializing to a primarily self-authoring position. Of the four who demonstrated within-stage movement, changes involved their developing a more integrated conceptualization of family counseling, their identities, and often changed perspectives of various situations. For example, one student demonstrated how conceptual change can evolve from a primarily individual point of view to a more distinct focus on family relationships as the focus for change. He began the year at a primarily socializing position with an emergent self-authoring influence. Initially, he focused on making families comfortable and learning concrete techniques. He later began to stress facilitating healthier family interactions, and importantly, for understanding a cultural group he was unfamiliar with. With a dawning awareness of the family’s perspective and the need to facilitate interactions, he gradually moved to include self-authoring influences into a still primarily socializing position.</p>
<p>Again, using Kegan’s scheme as noted in data analysis, three students showed no developmental change and ended the year with themes of disequilibrium dominant and a theme of assimilation instead of accommodation. The student who conducted the least number of sessions was confronted with challenges in the areas of theory and identity. He was conflicted about how to follow his supervisor’s systemic instructions while being true to his identity as a counselor committed to creating “trusting, safe, respectful” therapeutic relationships. In the end, he decided that family counseling did not fit his identity. The other two who ended the year in disequilibrium and with themes of assimilation had different response to their learning experiences. One construed that “giving skills” constituted the work of family counseling, consistent with her previous work with individuals. She became frustrated when her long-term client family made little progress and explained, “They haven’t been able to make that leap into the work stage.” Her response to this challenge is similar to the student’s response to “resistant clients” and it may be that with more experience her conceptualization of family counseling would have shifted.</p>
<p>One student began the year at a predominantly socializing position and ended at a predominately self-authoring stage, the one example of between-stage growth. He expressed an increasingly firmer commitment to systems theory, while expanding on his ability to reflect on his identity and his practice—he carefully reviewed all his sessions and made a determined effort to understand a difficult situation with a family of a cultural background and parenting style foreign to him. By the end of the year, he confidently expressed his opinions and beliefs about systems theory, cultural diversity, and his own identity. He also took responsibility for his professional growth and actively engaged in processing ideas he was exposed to in his interactions with more advanced students, showing clearly he was now primarily self-authoring.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1066480712448787">
<title>Themes Over Time</title>
<p>The expression of some themes changed with time and this was particularly noticeable for those at the socializing stage. They moved from viewing family counseling as primarily relationship development to incorporating systems constructs in their thinking, and along with this appeared to become more convinced of the utility of family therapy and their ability to provide it effectively. One initially stressed supporting each family member when describing family counseling, and began after midyear to focus on observing family interactions—this led to her gaining an increased understanding of the parent’s perspective of family problems. She began to enact systemic ideas by joining more with the parent in service of establishing an effective therapeutic relationship with the entire family, thus establishing differential relationships according to the hierarchy of the family to promote progress. Although the therapeutic relationship remained dominant, she moved toward using systemic ideas to guide the development of those relationships. Similarly another student’s initial idea of family counseling was “saying nice things and making people feel good,”—this evolved to a more systems-oriented view when he noted it was better to facilitate “healthier interactions.” These are interesting examples of movement toward incorporating systemic ideas into a primary focus on the therapeutic relationship.</p>
<p>Participants who did not begin to use systemic concepts over the year continued to express disequilibrium and ended their training with various outcomes. One student decided family therapy was not congruent with his values about relational approaches in counseling. After midyear he said: “I have thought about [family counseling]. . . and I have gotten excited at many points. . . but family counseling full-time would not be something I’d want to do.” Another intern ended the year in disequilibrium and expressed feeling, “a little discouraged about, how do we actually apply our technique in session?” He also said, “I think I have lost confidence in myself,” indicating both a sense of confusion and doubts about his competency.</p>
<p>For the theme of emotional response, interns expressed increasingly positive feelings toward client families as they came to know family members and understand their circumstances more fully—this was particularly evident as they observed families improving. Five of the nine interns conveyed growing excitement and increased positive emotional responses as the year progressed and some reported being surprised about this. One student identified these affective experiences as the most meaningful aspect of the internship and recalled a session in which a mother cried as she shared her feelings with her son: “I hadn’t experienced that before and it was really heartfelt to me . . . just kind of humbling I guess, I don’t know any other way to put it. It was very different and she really touched me.” Thereafter she affirmed that, “the family kind of responds better when you have real emotions.”</p>
<p>Emotional response was noticeably absent for the two participants who had the least amount of client contact (fewer than five families). Although one decided that family counseling was not something he wanted to do, the second, while he experienced great frustration and challenge with his two families, did develop an identity related to his new role, saying, “I now consider myself a family counselor.” Given that neither student had themes for emotional response it could be there was lack of enough consistent challenge to evoke this kind of engagement.</p>
<p>Some themes varied in relation to assessed stage whereas others occurred across all stages. Emotional response arose for all but the two students who saw the fewest client families and who ended the year with a theme for assimilation. Having enough challenge vis-à-vis adequate client contact may be related to accommodating to the learning experiences of family counseling and for emotionally engaging with the challenges. Further, it raises an interesting question about whether emotional engagement may be connected to developmental growth.</p>

<sec id="section17-1066480712448787">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This multiple case study investigated the perspectives of beginning family counselors to better understand their learning experiences. Prolonged engagement with participants over 9 months permitted a firsthand account of their learning process. To summarize, the findings revealed: all participants experienced disequilibrium, most students accommodated to their learning challenges, accommodation was accompanied by within-stage developmental change for five participants and between-stage change for one, those at higher developmental stages articulated an integration of systems theory and the therapeutic relationship, identity was expressed in diverse ways depending on stage, and most interns expressed a theme of emotional response to client families.</p>
<p>These findings align with both the family therapy literature and Kegan’s theory except for the theme of emotional response. Students encountered disequilibrium and then, if there was sufficient contact with families that evoked them to move past assimilation to accommodation, developmental change occurred. Change was reflected in integration of systems ideas with those about the therapeutic relationship, and in developmental growth. The theme of emotional response also arose for those who experienced accommodation and this may be related to developmental change.</p>
<p>The inherent limitations of qualitative inquiry suggest that the findings are useful to the extent that the reader can apply them to similar situations. Because the sample was comprised of a small group of students at one educational program that had little racial or cultural diversity, applying the findings should be undertaken with caution. However, since qualitative research seeks to refine understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1066480712448787">Stake, 1995</xref>), describing and interpreting the firsthand student perceptions of their learning experiences provides deeper insights into their learning challenges and processes, and increases our knowledge of the mechanisms at play that may promote a shift to systemic thinking.</p>

<sec id="section18-1066480712448787">
<title>Implications for Counselor Education and Supervision</title>
<p>Regardless of initial developmental position or previous experience, all participants experienced disequilibrium. This involved varying levels of discomfort and anxiety consistent with the literature on student challenges when learning family therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480712448787">Horne et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480712448787">Laszloffy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066480712448787">Nel, 2006</xref>). Disequilibrium and the accompanying anxiety can be destabilizing and students should be monitored closely so that appropriate supports are provided to meet the complexity and intensity of their challenges. Further, disequilibrium is necessary for growth, thus supervisors should encourage students to tolerate uncomfortable feelings because they are part of a developmental process that can lead to more adequate functioning. Yet, too much intensity may lead to undesirable outcomes and prevent successful negotiation of learning challenges. Supervisors must pay close attention to these states of disequilibrium, teach students to expect and tolerate them, and recognize when to offer additional supervision time when needed.</p>
<p>At the higher developmental stages, students were better able to integrate their ideas about the therapeutic relationship with systems theory. They also articulated an identity more clearly. To promote growth counselor educations could employ specific strategies in addition to offering additional supervisory support: reflective journaling, skills training, and tasking students to present parts of client videotapes they see as important to their development. In this study, journal writing was observed to be helpful to students in that it provided a format for them to consider their destabilizing experiences and negative emotions. In the journals, they described and reflected on their thoughts and feelings, and this facilitated their ability to self-evaluate and, eventually, to develop new, more complex perspectives. This clearly occurred for the intern who wrote about “resistant” clients and eventually concluded that perhaps she should be thinking about what she could be doing differently in situations in which clients were not accepting of her view of their situation. Indeed, benefits of journal reflections in promoting development are consistent with the literature on professional preparation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480712448787">Kaiser &amp; Ancellotti, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066480712448787">Sprinthall, 1994</xref>). Journaling would also provide a format for directed reflections on identity development to challenge students in this area.</p>
<p>A second strategy would be to teach skills that match a student’s developmental stage. It was observed that students at the socializing stage sought to learn specific techniques they thought would help them function more effectively. Because they were able to use their focus on relational processes to gradually advance to a more systemic perspective they would likely benefit from learning skills that bridge their focus on relationships with systems theory. This would match student readiness while providing a bridge for the paradigm shift required for systemic conceptualization. Students at higher levels would benefit from teaching the skills or mentoring other students in their practicing of these skills.</p>
<p>The final strategy that might prove helpful in promoting growth is derived from the use of videotape interviews in this study. Participants were asked to choose segments of videotaped family sessions they felt were important to their development and then discussed their feelings, thoughts, and perceptions about them. This proved most enlightening in terms of eliciting feelings about the families with which they worked and the feelings and thoughts associated with disequilibrium. Using this as a presentation format in individual and group supervision might be constructive for reflecting on the emotional states that appear to have an important impact on development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1066480712448787">
<title>Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>It is critical to study further those students who may be experiencing extreme disequilibrium, who seem stalled in their growth, or who withdraw from learning challenges. More evidence is needed to guide counselor educators to identify and overcome such barriers to learning when they arise. Understanding the struggles of students in transition, whether they are more socializing or self-authoring, would inform educators that they have differing abilities to conceptualize family counseling work, and thus, have dissimilar needs for support. This serves as a starting point for devising educational interventions that match the student. It was telling that the student seen as poised to transition to a self-authoring position appeared to have the most need for supervisory support, and that others operating from a socializing stage also relied heavily on their individual supervisor. Those at higher levels used multiple sources of support, indicating that a more differentiated understanding of the needs of students at various developmental stages is required for supervisors.</p>
<p>The extent to which students reported positive responses to their client families was surprising. This high degree of positive affective response, despite feelings of anxiety and frustration, has not been previously described in the family therapy literature. According to some in the field of cognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480712448787">Commons &amp; Richards, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480712448787">Kegan, 1994</xref>) emotional experiences during learning appear to motivate individuals to accommodate new and challenging experiences. It is intriguing to consider that a positive emotional response to client families may provide an impetus for growth and movement toward making the paradigm shift needed in family counseling. This is a compelling topic for future study.</p>
<p>The data from this study illuminate the mechanisms at play when new family counselors are learning to apply a systems approach. It extends what we know by providing students’ accounts of how disequilibrium preceded development when accommodation was stimulated, and what occurred when assimilation stood alone. It also provides data about positive emotional response to clients that is new and intriguing. In order to ensure the optimal degree of disequilibrium, and create the conditions for engagement with clients, further study of the educational practices that support transition to the self-authoring position may provide useful data enabling family counselor educators to assist students as they negotiate the difficult paradigm shift to systems thinking. This could help identify practices or circumstances that impede learning while guiding development of more effective approaches and interventions that promote the transition to a self-authoring position and a systems view. A closer examination of the transition process and both the barriers and supports that most adequately scaffold learning and cognitive development are needed. Adult developmental theory and Kegan’s theory in particular, appear to provide a productive framework for conceptualizing and examining further avenues for improving family counselor education.</p>
