<p>Minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) is one of the most important histopathological characteristics in patients suffering from idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, and the long-term outcome of most of the MCNS patients is favorable. Some studies reported that the susceptibility of MCNS might be associated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) gene polymorphism. We performed a meta-analysis to explore the association between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and MCNS risk, and conducted the search on 1 September 2010<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320312440902">1</xref></sup>. We found that D allele and DD genotype were associated with the risk of MCNS in Asians. However, the number of the recruited studies for meta-analysis was small and the result was not robust, and we stated that more genetic epidemiological investigations were required to further explore this association. Alasehirli et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320312440902">2</xref></sup> reported an investigation on the association of ACE I/D gene polymorphism with MCNS risk in 2011 Oct 21 (online) and found that there were no relevant differences in the allele frequencies and genotypes of ACE I/D polymorphism between patients and controls, and we hadn’t included this study for our meta-analysis. They reported that the D allele and DD homozygous were not associated with MCNS risk in Turkish children.</p>
<p>As those mentioned above, we included the study of Alasehirli et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320312440902">2</xref></sup>, and re-ran the meta-analysis on Asians. We found that D allele/DD homozygous was not associated with MCNS risk [D: odds ratios (OR) = 1.19, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.96–1.47, <italic>p</italic> = 0.11; DD: OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.93–1.75, <italic>p</italic> = 0.16]. This result was not consistent with our previous result (D: OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.07–1.79; <italic>p</italic> = 0.01; DD: OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.07–2.38, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02). We also performed a sensitive analysis by excluding the study that the genotype distributions in the controls were significantly deviated from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and also found that D allele/DD homozygous was not associated with MCNS susceptibility (D: OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.79–1.32; <italic>p</italic> = 0.87; DD: OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.68–1.53, <italic>p</italic> = 0.92). In conclusion, D allele/DD homozygous was not associated with MCNS risk in Asians, and this result might be robust to some extent. Accordingly, we also recommend that more studies on the association between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and MCNS susceptibility should be performed in the future.</p>
<p>In our previous meta-analysis, we found that the D allele or DD genotype was markedly associated with the focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) susceptibility in Asians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320312440902">3</xref></sup> We speculated that the D allele or DD genotype might be a significant genetic molecular marker to distinguish the FSGS from the MCNS in Asians. However, more case-control association investigations to further clarify the role of the ACE I/D gene polymorphism in MCNS susceptibility were much necessary.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Alasehirli et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320312440902">2</xref></sup> first explored the association between gender and ACE gene polymorphism in the onset of MCNS and found that DD homozygous was higher in boys in children with MCNS (78.4%. vs. 50.0%), and the frequencies of DD homozygous and D allele in boys were 7.25-fold and 2.56-fold higher than II genotype and I allele in the patient group, respectively. They speculated that DD homozygous in boys may be one of the risk factors for MCNS. It gives us a message that the ingredient of gender might be very important in MCNS, and some studies should be conducted to explore the relationship of gender and ACE I/D gene polymorphism in the future.</p>
