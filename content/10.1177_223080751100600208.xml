<p>In <italic>Low and Licentious Europeans</italic>, Harald Fischer-Tiné sets out to examine what whiteness meant in colonial India. He argues that whiteness was determined not by colour or ancestry alone, but primarily by culture, through complex interplays of class, gender and political anxiety. Moreover, he asserts, whiteness was a highly contested and unstable asset, contingent upon shifting historical circumstances and subject to crises brought on by mutually incompatible moral meanings attached to race, class and gender. Fischer-Tiné draws attention to the precariousness of concepts like ‘European’ and ‘native’ at the level of marginal populations, where racial lines were especially vulnerable to crossing and blurring. Given the centrality of race to the organisation of power, prestige and rewards in colonial society, he argues, it was at the subaltern level that whiteness became a major site of state-directed and state-backed intervention and policing.</p>
<p>Colonial whiteness is, of course, not an especially new field of inquiry, having been explored previously and most conspicuously by Ann Stoler. In the Indian case, pioneering work was done by Kenneth Ballhatchet many years ago. Fischer-Tiné is faced, right away, with the task of separating himself from these other studies. In this he is moderately successful. His conclusions are not radically different from those of Stoler or Ballhatchet. All emphasise the resilience of the cultural and political bases of whiteness even as nineteenth-century science sought to locate race in the bodies of specimens and populations. Fischer-Tiné, however, goes well beyond his predecessors in the breadth of his analytical agenda. Stoler, for instance, is quite narrowly concerned with the intersections of European identity with conjugality, domesticity and the family. Fischer-Tiné, on the other hand, looks at a wide variety of stages: not only familiality and schooling but also carceral institutions, prostitution, vagrancy, racial violence, the Eurasian ‘problem’ and the functioning of non-state agencies like the Salvation Army. He is engaged, accordingly, in describing the policing of subaltern whiteness as a generalised function of colonial governance. Also, while he shares Stoler’s determination to highlight the European in the history of European colonialism (and exhibits a certain impatience with recent Indian historiography for having neglected to do this), he does not ignore the wider Indian political context. His work, thus, escapes the runaway Eurocentrism that marks Stoler’s vision of colonial societies.</p>
<p>Fischer-Tiné’s work shows a keen interest in questions of savagery, civility and civilising missions. The analysis is not flawless—the discourse of colonial trusteeship is taken at face value and remains somewhat unhistoricised—but he nevertheless makes a fine connection between an ‘external’ civilising mission directed at natives and an ‘internal’ project aimed at the dubiously white. His construction of the latter project is reinforced by a model of intersecting colonial frontiers: geographical, biological, cultural and socio-economic, which individually and cumulatively represent the margins of order and authority. This model undergirds an excellent analysis of the role of the Salvation Army as an early non-governmental organization (NGO) that could (initially) be a headache for imperial administrators, but that also (eventually) worked with the empire. Fischer-Tiné also offers the elegant insight that while a vigorous civilising mission directed at natives required large numbers of Europeans, inter-racial contact was inherently hard to manage and politically dangerous: the very presence in the colony of a multidimensional society of Europeans undermined the appearance of white moral superiority and prestige. The civilising project thus became self-defeating.</p>
<p>Even when the analysis is not in the historiographical vanguard, Fischer-Tiné brings to it a valuable depth, richness of detail and thoroughness of research. There is, for instance, a fine discussion of climatological debates on race and the corresponding interventions in the lives of colonial children. The discussion of gender, prostitution and whiteness reinforces and further fleshes out Philippa Levine’s work, suggesting that ‘degraded’ white women and their male associates constituted a shadowy parallel empire stretched across Calcutta, Rangoon, Singapore, Penang, Hong Kong and Harbin. (The related phenomena of ‘white slavery’ and the ‘yellow-peril’ could, however, have been located more rigorously within a global-political context that includes the Russo-Japanese War, Asian immigration to the West Coast of North America, and new concerns about opium as a problem of international ‘trafficking’ and moral anxiety.) The ‘problem’ of transient white rabble in the colony, especially sailors, soldiers, and the wives of the latter, is contextualised within discontinuous—that is, historical—class divides within white-colonial society. In the process, Fischer-Tiné illuminates specific elite-white preoccupations, such as the emergence of a new emphasis on privacy in elite conduct, and the displacement of racially ‘embarrassing’ habits on to subalterns. In the latter case, there is an echo of Homi Bhabha and colonial mimicry that might have been explored more directly: when native ‘mimics’ held up the mirror of race, elite whites preferred to see not themselves but their own riff-raff.</p>
<p>There are some other missed opportunities. Fischer-Tiné observes, not incorrectly, that the elite-white obsession with racial prestige meant that for individual officials, individuality tended to evaporate in the tropical heat. The observation needs, however, to be unpacked with reference to Ashis Nandy and George Orwell, who have both written eloquently about the phenomenon, and to Purnima Bose, who has posited that colonialism generated its own peculiar (and delinquent) forms of white individuality. Bose’s work, and that of Gautam Chakravarty, might productively complicate Fischer-Tiné’s overall picture of the attitude of respectable and official Anglo-Indians towards white ‘low life’ and Eurasians, who constituted an irregular whiteness that was <italic>desirable</italic> for irregular purposes, such as colonial counter-insurgency. These lapses on Fischer-Tiné’s part are individually minor, but taken together, they produce a tendency to understate the institutionalised solidarities within whiteness that is inconsistent with the author’s own determination to be attentive to the ‘racial dividend’ in colonial society. In the legal-juridical domain, these solidarities produced in natives a fearful consciousness of white privilege <italic>across</italic> class. In a less readily confessed domain, they underlay an eroticism—including the erotics of violence—that is essential to a shared white experience of colonialism.</p>
<p>Finally, although the subaltern context is obviously important to Fischer-Tiné, there is a noticeable reluctance to engage theoretically with subalternity. Indeed, an unfortunate trend in recent South Asian historiography is the gratuitous use of the word ‘subaltern’ (especially in the titles of books and articles) with total disregard for its theoretical complexities and scholarly foundations. While there is nothing wrong with riding on the coat-tails of Subaltern Studies, such rides have too often come cheaply and casually. Fischer-Tiné is hardly the most egregious offender in this regard, but adopting some of the analytical priorities and techniques of Subaltern Studies would have been useful in teasing out the silences within the population of poor whites who are otherwise accessible largely through the lenses of respectable anxiety. It would also illuminate the jarring traces of unreason within elite behaviour. Fischer-Tiné raises, tantalisingly, the subject of colonial Europeans ‘changing for dinner’ as a way of retaining their whiteness. There is here an unexplored parallel with colonial Indians changing their clothes when they would come home from the office. Surely this is relevant to a study of negotiating between impurities of identity and environment in a racialised colonial world. In his very good discussion of race, criminality and punishment, Fischer-Tiné suggests (validly enough) that race became a habit with potential beyond biology. But habit (not only the moral/physiological habits that must be punished and compensated for but also the habits of redemption) is itself a historical concept, and any analysis of it as a factor of subalternity would benefit from a consideration of the work of Dipesh Chakrabarty, not to mention Hegel. Likewise, a theoretical discussion of public space would have better situated Fischer-Tiné’s insights into colonial prostitution.</p>
