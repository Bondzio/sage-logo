<abstract>
<p>A previous ultrasound study showed inflammation around the extensor pollicis longus tendon and surrounding structures at 6 weeks after manipulation, with or without pin fixation, and immobilization for distal radius fracture. Ultrasound examination after plating of distal radius fracture followed by early active mobilization of the wrist showed a short-lived inflammatory response, evident at 2 weeks but not at 6 weeks, around the extensor pollicis longus tendon (26 wrists examined) and flexor pollicis longus tendon (18 wrists examined). Early active mobilization of the wrist appears to limit the duration of inflammation around these tendons.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of distal radius fractures is being performed more frequently since the development of low profile, fragment-specific locking plates, as it allows stable anatomical reduction and, hence, early active mobilization of the wrist joint. It has been associated with rupture of the extensor pollicis longus (EPL), extensor digitorum communis (EDC), and flexor pollicis longus (FPL) tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412452080">Ateschrang et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In a previous study using high-resolution ultrasound scanning after manipulation under anaesthetic (MUA) with or without K-wire fixation or external fixation of distal radius fractures with 6 weeks immobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412452080">Owers et al., 2007</xref>), we showed a persistent inflammatory response of the EPL tendon and surrounding structures at 6 weeks. The aim of the present study was to determine the extent and duration of the inflammatory response around both the EPL and FPL tendons after ORIF and early active mobilization of the wrist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1753193412452080" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Ethics committee approval for this prospective study was obtained. Thirty-one patients with complex intra-articular distal radius fractures treated with ORIF during the period of October 2007 to May 2009 were recruited. The age and gender of each patient were recorded and radiographs were classified according to the AO group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412452080">Muller et al., 1990</xref>). Displacement was defined as dorsal angulation of greater than 10° on the lateral radiographs. The approach, method of fixation, and any complications were also recorded.</p>
<p>All fractures were fixed using a low-profile titanium, fragment-specific distal radial locking plate system (2.4 mm distal radius set and volar column set, Synthes GmbH, Solothurn, Switzerland), through a palmar (Henry) and/or standard dorsal approach with subperiosteal elevation of the second and fourth dorsal compartments. EPL was left superficial to the extensor retinaculum (ER) during wound closure in the eight patients who had a dorsal plate applied. The approach chosen depended on both the fracture configuration as assessed by CT scan and the surgeon’s preference based on the three-column theory of distal radius fracture fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412452080">Rikli and Regazzoni, 2000</xref>). Surgery was performed by or under the direct supervision of one of three senior orthopaedic hand surgeons. An early active wrist mobilization protocol was commenced under the care of a senior hand therapist from a thermoplastic splint within 5 days.</p>
<p>Ultrasound is a well-recognized modality for accurate measurement of anatomical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412452080">Pignoli et al., 1986</xref>) and has been previously used to assess the EPL tendon cross-sectional area, haematoma depth, thickness of the ER and of the tendon sheath along with Doppler analysis to assess peak velocity of tendon movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412452080">Owers et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, ultrasound assessment was carried out at both 2 and 6 weeks after ORIF using a 5–13 MHz high-resolution small parts transducer (GE LOGIQ 9, Milwaukee, Wisconsin USA) optimized for superficial musculoskeletal structures. This device has a resolution of 0.1 mm, and the protocol was based on our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412452080">Owers et al., 2007</xref>). The maximum thickness of the ER (usually located overlying the EDC tendons of the fourth compartment) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412452080">Figure 1</xref>) and maximum thickness of the EPL tendon tenosynovium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412452080">Figure 2</xref>) were measured with on-screen callipers at the level of Lister’s tubercle. Doppler analysis of EPL tendon peak velocity was performed with the tendon in the longitudinal plane and the angle of insonation between 55° and 65°, which is the optimal angle for Doppler velocity analysis. The maximum velocity was assessed by asking the patient to retropulse the thumb repeatedly as rapidly as possible. The FPL tendon was also assessed for tendinopathy and synovitis in 18 patients. All assessments were carried out by one of four radiologists involved in the study and repeated by a second radiologist. The normal wrist served as the control, although the radiologists could not be blinded to the surgical site. Any discrepancies in findings between the two observers were re-assessed and a consensus achieved.</p>

<p>The ultrasound measurements for both wrists in each patient were compared using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test to ascertain whether there was any significant difference in the EPL tendon characteristics between the injured and normal sides at 2 and 6 weeks. Cases with no matched pairs at 2 or 6 weeks, respectively, were not included in our statistical analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Thirty-one patients (12 female, 19 male), with a mean age of 46 (range 25–74) years, were recruited. All patients underwent ORIF, and 19 patients required a distal radial or volar column plate alone, three required dorsal plating alone, two required dorsal and radial column plates, four required volar plates augmented with a radial column plate, and three patients required both volar and dorsal plating.</p>
<p>All 31 patients had radiographs and CT scans available for assessment. All fractures were partial-articular or intra-articular with three classified as AO 2:3:B3; 13 as 2:3:C1; four as 2:3:C2, and 11 as 2:3:C3 according to the AO classification system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412452080">Muller et al., 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Twenty-nine of 31 patients underwent ultrasound scans at 2 weeks, and 25 of these 29 patients also had scans at 6 weeks. One patient had a scan at 6 weeks only. Eighteen patients underwent assessment of both the EPL and FPL tendons. One patient did not have control-side scanning.</p>
<p>Ultrasound data for the relevant number of patients who had scans at 2 and/or 6 weeks are given as mean (range). The ER maximal thickness was 1.1 (0.6–2.0) mm on the control side (30 patients) compared with 1.3 (0.8–1.8) mm at 2 weeks (29 patients) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.008) and 1.2 (0.7–1.5) mm (26 patients) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.254) at 6 weeks on the injured side. EPL tenosynovium maximal thickness was 0.7 (0.1–1.5) mm on the control side (30 patients) compared with 0.9 (0.3–3.0) mm at 2 weeks (29 patients) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.009) and 0.8 (0.4–1.9) mm at 6 weeks (26 patients) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.164) on the injured side. The EPL maximum velocity was 26.0 (8.9–57.1) cm/s on the control side (30 patients) compared with 15.9 (4.3–46.6) cm/s at 2 weeks on the injured side (29 patients) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.007) and 20.0 (5.2–40.1) cm/s at 6 weeks (26 patients) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.269). In summary, the thickness of the EPL tenosynovium and ER and the recovery of active tendon function were significantly greater than the control side at 2 weeks, but returned towards the uninjured state by 6 weeks.</p>
<p>There were two cases of EPL tendinopathy (i.e., focal or diffuse loss of the normal fibrillar pattern of the tendon with areas of reduced reflectivity and associated with tendon expansion) at 2 weeks, but these had resolved by 6 weeks. There was one case of FPL synovitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412452080">Figure 3</xref>) at 2 weeks and one case of tendinopathy of extensor compartments 2 and 4, but these had both resolved by 6 weeks. No cause of tendinopathy was found in these cases, and in particular, there was no evidence of tendon irritation by prominent or protruding screws or plates in any patient.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Rupture of the EPL tendon after nonoperative treatment of distal radius fracture has an incidence of 0.2–3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412452080">Skoff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412452080">Witter, 1960</xref>). In most cases, the rupture is associated with undisplaced or minimally displaced fractures in which the ER is not torn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412452080">Helal et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412452080">Hirasawa et al., 1990</xref>) and occurs between 4 and 10 weeks after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412452080">Strandell, 1955</xref>). The lack of premonitory symptoms makes it difficult to predict cases of rupture.</p>
<p>For both the EPL and FPL tendons there is concern that ORIF of distal radial fractures may increase the risk of rupture due to tendon attrition over a prominent edge of a plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412452080">Cross and Schmidt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412452080">Jupiter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412452080">Keller and Steiger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412452080">Klug et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412452080">Lowry et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412452080">Schnur and Chang, 2000</xref>), by screw penetration of the opposite cortex or by a prominent screw head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412452080">Adham et al., 2009</xref>). There were no cases of tendon irritation over metalwork in this study. Our results therefore relate purely to the effect of the inflammatory response to the initial trauma and to the surgery.</p>
<p>In a previous study of ultrasound changes in the EPL tendon after fractures of the distal radius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412452080">Owers et al., 2007</xref>) we recruited 62 patients who were treated with MUA and plaster of Paris cast alone (53), MUA augmented with K-wires and plaster cast (7), or MUA and external fixation (2). The EPL was scanned at 6 weeks after injury, and the uninjured wrist served as a control. At 6 weeks after injury, there was highly significant thickening of the ER and EPL tendon synovial sheath, as well as reduction in tendon velocity. We postulated that this increased synovial thickness could affect the diffusion of nutrients to the tendon within the third extensor compartment and contribute to the risk of rupture in susceptible patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412452080">Owers et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, the thickness of the EPL tenosynovium and ER were significantly greater than the control side at 2 weeks and the recovery of active tendon function was significantly slower than the control side at 2 weeks, but all returned towards the uninjured state by 6 weeks. It is important to highlight that the EPL tendon peak velocity may be affected by the inflammation demonstrated by ultrasound, but also potentially by pain and thumb joint stiffness, so this measurement is less specific to tendon pathology and should be interpreted with caution. In no case were prominent screws or impingement over the metalwork a factor.</p>
<p>We attempted to minimize observer bias and inter/intra-observer error by having the ultrasound examinations performed independently by two of a total of four radiologists involved in the study. Agreement between the observers was good.</p>
<p>Wrists requiring ORIF are characterized by a greater degree of tissue trauma than fractures requiring only MUA +/− pin fixation, not only because the fractures are generally more severe, but also because of the trauma of the fixation procedure itself. It is likely, therefore, that the more rapid resolution of the inflammatory response affecting the EPL tenosynovium and ER after ORIF than after MUA with pin fixation is related to early active mobilization of the wrist in the ORIF cases, although it may also be related to the release of the EPL tendon in the dorsal plating cases.</p>
<p>We postulate that early active movement may protect the tendons from rupture in ORIF cases by minimizing the inflammatory response. This short-lived inflammatory response may be one of the benefits of early mobilization of the wrist joint.</p>
<p>Early active mobilization of the wrist after stable ORIF of complex intra-articular distal radial fractures appears to minimize the duration of the inflammatory response around the wrist and may contribute to early restoration of function. Our results strengthen the case for early mobilization after fixation of these injuries.</p>
