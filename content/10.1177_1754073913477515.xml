<abstract>
<p>The primal motivational systems of all mammals are constituted of the evolved affective brain networks that gauge key survival issues. However, since progress in functional neuroscience has historically lagged behind conceptual developments in psychological science, motivational processes have traditionally been anchored to behavioral rather than neural and affective issues. Attempts to retrofit neuroaffective issues onto established psychological-conceptual structures are problematic, especially when fundamental evidence for primal affective circuits, and their neural nature, comes largely from animal research. This article provides a synopsis of our growing understanding of primary-process emotional systems of mammalian brains and minds, which provides a new empirically based infrastructure for higher levels of human theorizing.</p>

<body>
<p>Our understanding of approach and avoidance motivations, and associated positive and negative affects, has advanced enormously in the past few decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1754073913477515">Elliot, 2008</xref>). However, largely missing from human psychological analyses have been (a) empirically based evolutionary-hierarchical views of the relevant neural substrates, (b) empirical parsing of primal brain networks that exist for diverse motivational BrainMind functions, and hence (c) linkages of such knowledge to discussions of higher motivational processes in humans. Affective neuroscience helps fill this vacuum with evidence for diverse <italic>primary-process</italic> emotional systems that generate seven affectively motivated approach and avoidance patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754073913477515">Panksepp, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1754073913477515">Panksepp &amp; Biven, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Still, scientific approaches that acknowledge experienced emotions and motivations in other animals are still deemed problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754073913477515">Dawkins, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1754073913477515">LeDoux, 2012</xref>). For a classic overview that led comparative psychologists away from the mind, see Chapter 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1754073913477515">Warden, Jenkins, and Warner (1935</xref>, p. 136); as noted there: “Mentalistic theories may be discarded at once on the ground that it is impossible to obtain valid data concerning the conscious life of infra-human organisms.” Accordingly, it is understandable that evidence from other animals has been neglected in psychology. Neuroscience can change that bias since rewarding and punishing properties of subcortical circuits can be empirically evaluated and can illuminate human emotions and motivations.</p>
<p>Here I focus on empirically illuminated primary-process emotional and motivational systems of mammalian brains—namely the unconditional (instinctual) emotional response systems that help control higher BrainMind functions—for example, secondary processes that mediate learning and memory, and tertiary processes that control higher mental processes, best studied in humans. There is insufficient space here to highlight all views (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1754073913477515">Lewis, Haviland, &amp; Barrett, 2008</xref>; and for controversies with constructivist approaches, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1754073913477515">Zachar and Ellis, (2012)</xref>. Suffice it to say, brain and mind contain interlinked (“nested”) evolutionary layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1754073913477515">Figure 1</xref>), and few have focused on primal neuro-emotional issues best illuminated by animal brain research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754073913477515">Panksepp, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1754073913477515">2011</xref>). Higher emotional and motivational structures, best elucidated by human research (not addressed here), remain functionally linked to primal affective functions that emerged earlier in brain evolution.</p>

<p>A conceptual summary of evolutionary hierarchical bottom–up (nested) and top–down (circular) causation that presumably operates in every primal emotional system of the brain. This schematic summarizes the hypothesis that in order for higher MindBrain functions to operate, they have to be integrated with the lower BrainMind functions, with primary processes being depicted as squares, secondary processing (learning and memory) as circles, and tertiary processing (higher cognitive functions), at the top, as rectangles. Please imagine each symbol being color-coded, to better envision the nested hierarchies that integrate the various levels of the BrainMind (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1754073913477515">Panksepp, 2011</xref>, which contains a color rendition of this conceptualization). Bottom–up control prevails in early infancy and early childhood development. Top–down control is optimized in adulthood.</p>

<p>So how can we scientifically evaluate the primal emotional experiences of nonspeaking animals? A key advance has been localization of instinctual emotional systems using deep brain stimulations (DBS), and evaluation of raw affective experiences (primal consciousness) empirically by determining whether such evoked brain states serve as “rewards” and “punishments” using traditional learning tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754073913477515">Delgado, Roberts, &amp; Miller, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1754073913477515">Olds &amp; Milner, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1754073913477515">Panksepp, 1971</xref>). They do, quite uniformly! There are no “rewards” or “punishments” for humans that are not affectively experienced. This correspondence allows access to positively and negatively valenced emotional arousals in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1754073913477515">Panksepp, 2011</xref>), and evaluation of discriminability of those affective states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1754073913477515">Stutz, Rossi, Hastings, &amp; Brunner, 1974</xref>). Abundant evidence indicates that subcortical emotional brain state-shifts are affectively experienced by humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073913477515">Coenen, Schlaepfer, Maedler, &amp; Panksepp, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1754073913477515">Panksepp, 1985</xref>). With accruing understanding of neurochemical codes of these systems, additional predictions are made about affective arousals in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754073913477515">Panksepp, 1998</xref>). Such epistemological possibilities, hardly recognized in academic psychology, facilitate neuroempirical understanding of emotional states and associated motivational processes in humans.</p>

<title>How Neuroscience Illuminates Emotional Approach and Avoidance Feelings</title>
<p>This article will contextualize discussions of approach and avoidance motivations within the emerging affective neuroscience strategies that seek to understand the fundamental valuative (i.e., affective) emotional foundations of mind (for detailed coverage, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754073913477515">Panksepp, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1754073913477515">Panksepp &amp; Biven, 2012</xref>). In this view, the broad generic concept of “motivation” circumscribes many types of fundamental BrainMind functions (<italic>primary processes</italic>) that contribute to organisms maximizing positive affective states and minimizing negative ones. Such foundations of human mind, deeply subcortical, promote the construction of higher cognitive processes (<italic>tertiary brain states</italic>) through learning and memory (here called <italic>secondary processes</italic>). Clearly, the BrainMind has evolutionary progressions (“layerings”) still evident in brain organization—older brain functions being more caudal and medial in the brain, with more recent ones being more rostral and lateral. These levels of organization, interpenetrant in “nested hierarchical” ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1754073913477515">Figure 1</xref>), are described next.</p>
<sec id="section2-1754073913477515">
<title>Primary Processes</title>
<p>At the foundation of the mind, various unconditioned stimulus (UCS) and unconditioned response (UCR) affect systems undergird mental life. Such fundamental “tools for living,” like SEEKING (capitalized to highlight a new neurofunctional nomenclature), remain poorly studied in psychology, partly because deep understanding requires brain research best pursued through affectively sensitive work on other animals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1754073913477515">
<title>Secondary Processes</title>
<p>At the intermediate level of neural organization are a variety of learning systems that interface UCSs and UCRs into learned subroutines. These intermediate functions arise from brain areas called the basal ganglia, which include brain regions such as amygdala, bed-nuclei of the stria terminalis, dorsal and ventral striatal regions, and hippocampus. They allow basic needs of body and brain to be interfaced effectively with environments in which organisms find themselves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1754073913477515">
<title>Tertiary Processes</title>
<p>On top of these are species-typical neocortical expansions, tissues called general computational space which allow for the emergence of higher cognitive strategies that are commonly discussed in terms of thoughts and decision-making strategies, and “ruminations” when more intensely affective.</p>
<p>We have optimal access to primary processes in animal research, and thereby affective qualia that are foundational for mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754073913477515">Panksepp, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1754073913477515">Panksepp &amp; Biven, 2012</xref>). Most tertiary-process issues are best studied in humans. Secondary processes are well studied in both. With primary-process brain research, we can move beyond the “law of effect,” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1754073913477515">Thorndike, 1911</xref>) toward neuromechanistic “laws of affect” whereby silent synapses are converted to active ones through environmentally precipitated brain affective shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1754073913477515">Panksepp &amp; Biven, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Distinct types of primal affects are promoted by homologous neural circuits concentrated in subcortical regions in all mammals, ready to guide behavior and learning soon after birth. These motivation-generating systems come in distinct “flavors,” with <italic>homeostatic, sensory</italic>, and <italic>emotional</italic> affects being meaningful global categories, each with many exemplars. Primal affects get connected to environments through learning—<italic>secondary processing</italic> which, stated simply, coax animals to promote good feelings and diminish bad ones—thereby allowing internal survival issues to be related to world events. I ignore <italic>tertiary processes</italic> here—higher psychological processes, much harder to study in animals than humans—but simply note how intimately they are intermeshed with primal affective values.</p>
<p>Although human cognitive approaches have little empirical access to subcortical neural mechanisms of primal affects, we can analyze evolutionarily related animal feelings by studying the rewarding and punishing properties of subcortical emotional UCRs—action networks that feel like something when aroused. The sensory and homeostatic affects are harder to study neuroscientifically because they are not as intimately linked to discrete action systems. Those affects are more linked to UCSs in traditional behavioral parlance.</p>
<p>The DBS-validated primal emotional affective systems deserve a special scientific nomenclature—for example, SEEKING, RAGE, FEAR, LUST, PANIC/GRIEF, and PLAY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1754073913477515">Panksepp 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754073913477515">1998</xref>). In labeling primal emotional processes, semantic ambiguities were avoided, while not losing the needed communicative clarity, through the convention of capitalizing common vernacular terms. The neuroanatomical referents for these emotional labels are well identified with DBS, and the underlying networks and neurochemistries, albeit presently only partly characterized, can be further clarified with new neuroscientific tools (e.g., neurochemically specific optogentics).</p>
<p>Before proceeding to the emotional primes, a few additional reflections on the other major categories of affects—the sensorially based ones. The primal UCS-linked affective systems come in two general categories: <italic>homeostatic</italic> and <italic>sensory</italic>. The homeostatic affects operate via various interoceptive systems that monitor bodily states such as energy and water balances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754073913477515">Denton, 2006</xref>); in the vernacular these are called hunger and thirst. Many other general bodily states (feelings such as nausea/disgust, fatigue, and thermoregulatory coldness and warmth). When discussing such issues as primary homeostatic feelings, we may again wish to use the same capitalized terminological convention as employed for emotional primes.</p>
<p>The molecular underpinnings of <italic>sensory</italic> affective processes are being deciphered more rapidly (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1754073913477515">Kringelbach &amp; Berridge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1754073913477515">Rolls, 2005</xref>). Taste responsivity has been well analyzed by studying instinctual orofacial action patterns when different taste qualities are infused into mouths of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754073913477515">Berridge, 1996</xref>), leading to clarification of brain regions and neurochemistries controlling behavioral “liking” reactions. The affective implications remain to be clarified by direct evaluations of whether identified subcortical taste regions mediate rewarding and punishing effects with DBS.</p>
<p>I will now focus on the within-brain emotional action systems that currently provide the most well-developed approach to understanding the neural nature of affective qualia so important for understanding motivational states. DBS evidence indicates that the dynamics of emotional-instinctual action schema are the fundamental substrates for the corresponding raw emotional qualia. As noted, wherever in the brain we can evoke coherent emotional action patterns, there exist corresponding affective states as monitored with DBS evoked rewarding and punishing within-brain phenomenal experiences. So far the aroused valenced states appear to be homologous in all mammals, allowing falsifiable neuroscientific predictions across species. Thus, the study of these systems in animals currently provides the optimal scientific strategy for decoding the constitution of affective consciousness, even for humans. Such cross-species knowledge may also help us fathom the motivational changes that accompany psychiatrically significant affective imbalances, providing strategies for development of new mind medicines such as antidepressants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754073913477515">Burgdorf, Panksepp, &amp; Moskal, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>The Basic Emotional-Affective Circuits of Mammalian Brains</title>
<p>Extensive descriptions of primary-process emotional-motivational networks are in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754073913477515">Panksepp (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1754073913477515">Panksepp and Biven (2012)</xref>, so only thumbnail sketches will be shared here.</p>
<sec id="section6-1754073913477515">
<title>The SEEKING/Desire System</title>
<p>SEEKING is a general-purpose appetitive motivational system that allows many other emotional systems to operate effectively (e.g., LUST, CARE, and PLAY). It seems to be a major source of appetitive coherence that has at times been called “libido” or “euphoria.” It provokes animals to become intensely interested in exploring their world, allowing them to find and eagerly anticipate all kinds of resources they need for survival, from water, food, sex, and warmth to addictive drugs and social relationships, via shared neurochemistries. Thus, even though sensory affects probably have hedonic qualia of their own, these systems also impact emotional responses, adding motivational intensity, at a distance, to resource acquisition. For instance, all affectively positive sensory stimuli impact functions of the general-purpose SEEKING system that promotes unconditional appetitive emotional actions (e.g., increased exploration) and learning (anticipatory “wanting” of specific resources).</p>
<p>When fully aroused, the SEEKING urge fills the mind with eagerness and interest, and motivates organisms to move their bodies seemingly effortlessly in search of resources they need, crave, and desire. It sustains both mundane curiosity and sublime intellectual pursuits. When underactive for various reasons—from social defeat, promoting chronic helplessness/stress, or neural deficits of old age—depression can ensue. When overactive, which can arise from drug abuse, behavior can become excessive, guided often by psychotic delusions and manic thoughts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073913477515">Coenen et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Neuroanatomically, SEEKING arises from the major self-stimulation system (the medial forebrain bundle) that runs from the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) up to the medial prefrontal cortex. Animals self-stimulate this system readily, whether via abuse of drugs or direct electrical or chemical stimulation of the brain (depending on availability, of course). Although still poorly conceptualized as a “reward, pleasure, or reinforcement system,” it actually coaxes animals and humans to move energetically from where they are presently situated to the places where they can find and consume resources needed for survival. In rats, simplified objective measures of this system in action are positive affect indicating 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations and invigorated sniffing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754073913477515">Burgdorf, Wood, Kroes, Moskal, &amp; Panksepp, 2007</xref>). SEEKING promotes appetitive learning by computing reward relationships in the world, called “reward prediction errors” in one scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1754073913477515">Schultz &amp; Dickinson, 2000</xref>). A key neurochemical that promotes SEEKING is dopamine, which innervates higher brain frontal neocortices that mediate planning and foresight, while concurrently engendering anticipatory eagerness, both at behavioral and affective psychological levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1754073913477515">
<title>The RAGE/Anger System</title>
<p>When SEEKING is thwarted, RAGE is aroused. Ideal stimuli are frustrations and attempts to curtail animals’ freedom of action. RAGE can be provoked by DBS along a longitudinal trans-hypothalamic pathway coursing from the periaqueductal gray (PAG) to amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1754073913477515">Panksepp, 1971</xref>), near circuits that promote FEAR (leading to the misleading “fight or flight system” moniker). RAGE invigorates affective attack and helps animals defend themselves and their possessions, and is commonly effective in arousing FEAR in their opponents. Human anger may derive much of its psychic “energy” from this brain system, since intense, unprovoked anger attack can be instigated by DBS along the RAGE system which runs from medial regions of amygdala, through ventral hypothalamus and dorsal PAG. Key neurochemical activators of this system are Substance P and glutamate, while endogenous opioids quell RAGE.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1754073913477515">
<title>The FEAR/Anxiety System</title>
<p>FEAR circuitry, paralleling RAGE, helps animals avoid pain and destruction. Mild arousal of FEAR promotes freezing and hiding; intense arousal precipitates flight. Humans stimulated in these same brain regions report being engulfed by an intense free-floating anxiety with no environmental cause. Key chemistries that regulate this system are glutamate and corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), and specific antianxiety agents—for example, benzodiazepines—inhibit this system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1754073913477515">
<title>The LUST/Sexual Systems</title>
<p>Male and female sexual urges are mediated by LUST brain circuits, both overlapping and distinct. LUSTs are aroused by male and female sex hormones, which regulate brain neuropeptides such as vasopressin and oxytocin, respectively. Such brain chemistries promote gender-specific sexual tendencies, including gentle prosocial acceptance by oxytocin, and assertiveness, perhaps even jealous behaviors, by vasopressin. Distinct male and female LUST circuits, differentiated in the hypothalamus during infancy, become differentially aroused by gonadal hormonal tides at sexual maturity. Because brain and bodily sexuality are independently organized, mammals that are externally male can have female-specific sexual urges. Individuals with female-type appearances can have male-typical sexual urges.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1754073913477515">
<title>The CARE/Maternal Nurturance System</title>
<p>Brain evolution has provided safeguards to assure that parents (usually mothers) devote CARE to offspring. The massive hormonal changes at the end of pregnancy (declining progesterone, and increasing estrogen, prolactin, and oxytocin) set the stage for the activation of maternal urges a few days before parturition. This symphony of hormonal and neurochemical changes, especially the heightened secretions of oxytocin and prolactin, facilitate maternal moods which assure strong social bonding with the offspring. Similar neurochemicals, especially oxytocin and endogenous opioids, promote infant bonding to mothers. These changes are foundational for one variant of love. The fact that chemistries for female sexuality (e.g., oxytocin) have been redeployed in nearby circuits to promote maternal care (nurturance and social bonding), suggests an intimate relationship between female sexual rewards and maternal motivations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1754073913477515">Panksepp &amp; Biven, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1754073913477515">
<title>The PANIC/GRIEF Separation–Distress System</title>
<p>Young mammals are all dependent on maternal CARE for survival. In turn, they have powerful emotional voices to solicit care—intense crying when left alone in strange places. Such separation cries alert caretakers, especially mothers, to SEEK troubled infants and attend to their needs. The underlying neural system has been mapped with DBS in several species (including dorsal PAG, dorsomedial thalamus, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis), and the resulting PANIC response, engendering the “psychic pain” of aloneness/sadness/grief, is robustly inhibited by endogenous opioids, oxytocin, and prolactin—the major social-attachment/social-bonding chemistries of the mammalian brain. This PANIC network is also aroused during human sadness and depression states accompanied by low brain opioid activity. Sudden arousal of this system may contribute to “panic attacks” in humans.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1754073913477515">
<title>The PLAY/Rough-and-Tumble, Physical Social-Engagement System</title>
<p>Young animals have strong urges for physical play, arising from specific subcortical brain regions (e.g., the SEEKING system along with parafascicular thalamus) and consisting of pouncing on each other, chasing, and wrestling. Although outwardly aggressive, PLAY arouses positive affect—social joy accompanied, in rats, by abundant high frequency (~50 kHz) chirping sounds that resemble human laughter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1754073913477515">Panksepp, 2007b</xref>). Tickling young rats and human children maximizes their happy chirping/laughter, promoting social bonds and friendships. While social play can promote social dominance, PLAY presumably helps young animals learn about their social potentials, all those complex social processes that need to be learned. PLAY urge may promote the epigenetic construction of higher social brains. There are many reasons to believe that children deprived of social play are more likely to have impulse-control problems, namely attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which can be effectively treated with psychostimulants, all of which reduce playfulness in young rats. Abundant juvenile play may help reduce the incidence of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1754073913477515">Panksepp, 2007a</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1754073913477515">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Abundant work supports the existence of at least seven distinct rewarding or punishing emotional systems identified in diverse species with subcortical DBS. These systems consist of large transverse networks, able to engender affective consciousness, concentrated in the extended reticular activating systems (ERAS) of mammalian brainstem, brain regions long known to be essential for consciousness. ERAS circuits interdigitate with emotion-generating regions such as the PAG and VTA and various learning regions such as basal ganglia, including amygdala and nucleus accumbens as well as tertiary-processing regions such as cingulate and medial frontal cortices. All emotional systems are well represented in the PAG and connected to higher “limbic regions” through the hypothalamic and medial thalamic corridors.</p>
<p>Each system has abundant descending and ascending components that work together in a coordinated fashion to generate various instinctual emotional behaviors as well as the raw feelings normally associated with those emotional behaviors. These systems most likely interact with higher brain mechanisms, to create higher motivational structures. More work is needed to understand the interactions of these systems in detail, and how they interact with homeostatic and sensory affects, all relating, in part, to the general-purpose SEEKING urge, which is the most prolific emotional-motivational system of them all. This may allow us to understand apparent paradoxes, such as how anger can be an approach motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754073913477515">Harmon-Jones, 2004</xref>) while also generating an aversive (withdrawal) state. It is becoming ever clearer that the SEEKING system also helps deal with negative affective states, and that FEAR promotes the seeking of safety. Perhaps many past conceptual conundrums—the rejection of emotional feelings in animals—arose from the need to explore behavior from the outside, as opposed to the internal neurodynamics of the brain.</p>
<p>In sum, the existence of emotional feeling states is affirmed by animals never being neutral about DBS-evoked emotional arousals. They find arousals of SEEKING, LUST, CARE and PLAY systems to be “rewarding”; they escape arousals of RAGE, FEAR, and PANIC systems, indicating those diverse states are punishing. How different they are from each other can be evaluated, even in animals, with DBS discrimination procedures, and in humans with verbal self-reports of shifting experiences. These brain motivational systems may provide endophenotypes for psychiatry, and affective psychoassays for psychiatric medicinal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1754073913477515">Panksepp, 2012</xref>). By taking emotional feelings of other animals seriously, we have already identified new prohedonic neurochemicals and thereby potential new antidepressant medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754073913477515">Burgdorf et al., 2011</xref>), including new treatments for autism and ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1754073913477515">Panksepp &amp; Biven, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The affective internal motivational experiences of animals, long debated and still often denied by behaviorists and behavioral neuroscientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1754073913477515">LeDoux, 2012</xref>) and ethologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754073913477515">Dawkins, 2012</xref>), can finally be addressed empirically through affective neuroscience strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754073913477515">Panksepp, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1754073913477515">2011</xref>). Of course, one must also specify reasonable evolutionary scenarios for their emergence by considering the adaptive function of such experiential capacities. That is conceptually simple: Primal affects—intrinsic neural values—inform animals about bodily survival issues that promote and guide learning. Positive affects indicate trajectories of well-being, and negative ones, paths of destruction. Affective feelings intrinsically anticipate survival, with a wider event horizon than behavior alone, which can refine learning. Affects are the immediate psychological currency of our motivations.</p>
<p>Primal affects may have been the first experiences (qualia) that existed on earth. Without them, capacities for conscious “awareness” may not have emerged in higher brain evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1754073913477515">Solms &amp; Panksepp, 2012</xref>). Whether other animals also have more subtle higher order feelings, so abundant in humans who have diverse cognitive experiences, remains currently scientifically unknown. As we solve foundational affective problems, we may be better positioned to empirically address the more difficult higher issues that can only be well studied in human beings.</p>
