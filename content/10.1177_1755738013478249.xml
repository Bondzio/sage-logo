Did anyone actually strike on 21 June 2012? Where I work, we were technically supporting the industrial action so, in practice, everyone came in to catch up with their paper work and by the afternoon most people were seeing urgent cases. The whole thing was a fairly half-hearted effort and I wonder if it would have happened at all if we (doctors in general) hadn’t been a bit annoyed by the Health and Social Care Act. I remain faintly embarrassed that we suddenly protested against changes to our pensions when we have not taken firm action over many of the injustices that have occurred in our society in recent times.</p>
<p>Before qualifying I might not have pondered the effects of the BMA’s actions so deeply but I have now developed an interest in medical politics. I now enjoy reading about health policy and am actually depressed by updates on contract negotiations. Perhaps this is because I feel truly a part of the profession. Negative publicity feels horribly personal and, I feel responsible for actions taken by our profession as a whole.</p>
<p>A recent article in the BMJ urged doctors to become more politically active, suggesting that we should be seen to object to social inequality, not just galvanise ourselves when our finances are threatened. There are certainly clear cut issues that doctors must take a stand on; but I do not understand how increased political activity as a professional body might work. First, we are a heterogeneous group. While many of us share common ground on non-contentious issues such as tobacco legislation, we are by no means a profession that easily falls behind one political viewpoint or another.</p>
<p>Second, I’m not certain that we have more insight into social solutions than any other group. History seems to bare me out on this one. As part of my political metamorphosis, I am trying to understand more fully the professional structures that I am part of by habit and necessity. (This is possibly prompted by the exponential increase in the fees I pay since becoming a salaried GP. Where does my money go?) It seems to me that our institutions have usually responded to views held at the time and have rarely led the way in bringing about radical social change. The NHS itself came in to being despite the BMA and not because of it.</p>
<p>One answer to this call for political action is the new National Health Action Party; a political party started by health professionals with clear goals to protect the NHS. The aims of the party are laudable and I may even vote for them. My third qualm with the call to political action, however, is that doctors putting themselves forward for elected positions might, unintentionally, misuse the trust that has been built-up between individuals over years in a therapeutic relationship. I do not mean that patients might feel compelled to vote for a doctor who has treated them in the past but that politically minded doctors could take advantage of the general trust the public has in the profession.</p>
<p>So where does this leave my nascent political journey? My own odyssey will continue with a reinvigorated interest in local structures, in the issues that I actually know something about and have some influence to change. I will watch with interest the attempts of doctors with better-developed political instincts than my own to turn their medical expertise into a force for social change. I will continue to immerse myself in this incredible career and gaze at life in all its wondrous variety whilst trying to figure out the answer to social injustice. I’ll let you know when I do.</p></sec>
