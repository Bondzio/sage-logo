<p>Suzanne Piotrowski presents a thoroughly researched work that analyzes how reforms in the mid-1990s influenced implementation of the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Based on extensive revision of her doctoral work, this scholarly case study explores whether selected public management reforms have advanced or slowed access to documents via FOIA and thus made the national government more transparent or more opaque.</p>
<p>A core value of the FOIA is governmental transparency and the promotion of democratic accountability through a visible, fluid process. According to Piotrowski, “. . . transparency allows the public to develop a more accurate picture of what is happening inside a government (p. 5).” Avenues of transparency include prompt and affordable access to government records and documents, open meetings, and disclosures by whistle-blowers. A very helpful introduction introduces key legislation, concepts, and definitions for the study.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 provides an overview of the FOIA within the context of the democratic accountability literature and two key reforms: (a) National Performance Review (NPR) and (b) New Public Management (NPM). NPR was initiated by the Clinton Administration in 1993 and continued in varying forms through the George W. Bush Administration (2001-2009). NPR emphasizes employee empowerment and results-oriented performance along with privatization and customer satisfaction. National Public Management is a background, more general approach to transforming traditional administration of government. It redefines government as empowering, not serving; mission-driven, not rule-driven; and, among many other features, customer-driven, not bureaucratic.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 is organized in two sections. Section 1 is an overview of the history of the FOIA from its origin in 1966 along with major amendments in 1974, 1976, and 1986; the 1996 amendments promoting electronic government (EFOIA); and the 2002 exemptions in the Homeland Security Act. The section also introduces a study of the groups of people who were working with the FOIA around the year 2002. This access community includes federal employees who process FOIA requests, federal officers and attorneys who review what may be released, contractors looking for security clearances, as well as academicians who study the FOIA process and journalists who write about it. The findings in this book are based on a survey questionnaire sent in two waves to almost four hundred persons in the access community. The total response rate was 46.9%, a feature that lends significant support to the study findings.</p>
<p>In the second section of Chapter 2, the Office of Personnel Management and the Department of Justice are studied in depth. Piotrowski finds a mixed, inconsistent relationship between NPR and FOIA within the two agencies. Both experienced an increase in requests after the electronic FOIA amendments in 1996. Fee collection went up, but the backlog of requests, especially at Justice, also increased. National Performance Review did not consider FOIA a priority, but each agency’s policy statements included references to customer service and performance management. Employee empowerment and outsourcing to harness the efficiencies of privatization received less emphasis.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 is a more intensive study of performance management and FOIA policies among 24 agencies. Four of the 24 agencies included FOIA performance measures: Department of State; Office of Personnel Management; Department of Energy; and National Archives and Records Administration. Seventeen had no reference to FOIA. One third of the agencies noted there were performance measures within the frontline FOIA office. Scarce resources seem to play a major role in the tangential impact of NPR on strategic planning of FOIA activities.</p>
<p>The issues of customer service and employee empowerment are considered in Chapter 4. Despite supportive memoranda from President Clinton and Vice President Gore, only 3 of the 24 agencies (Defense, Justice, and State) developed formal customer service standards. Customer-driven values promise positive responses to demands for documents; employee empowerment suggests that responses may vary by agency, especially when compliance costs are considered. Piotrowski concludes, “The promise of these initiatives is still largely unfilled with regard to FOIA (p. 73).”</p>
<p>Chapter 5 deals with contracting out government services—a key NPR reform. Two dimensions are considered: (a) access to contractor documents and (b) use of contractors in the processes for releasing FOIA documents. Contracting out is the most complex reform regarding FOIA. Contractual relations often include a layer of confidential proprietary information that clouds democratic accountability. Policies defining access to contractor documents have been more successfully developed by states. As many as 10 states have allowed access when the private contractor is performing a public function. Some states have emphasized public funds or prior legal determination as means to improve public access of contractor records. The study recommends that federal officials consider adopting state innovations as a way to increase accountability of contractors.</p>
<p>Use of contractors is required by the 1996 EFOIA amendment. Their use has been sporadic and concentrated on assisting federal officials in reducing backlogs. Ultimately, the approval of any FOIA information release requires the authorization of a federal employee. Contractors have been more widely used to improve the technology required for electronic management of FOIA requests.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 presents an extensive analysis of emerging themes from the research along with an evaluation of the carryover of NPR into the George W. Bush Administration. Among major themes are (a) the cohesion of the access community and its passionate support for FOIA; (b) the variety of ways federal agencies release information; (c) the ongoing tension between personal privacy and the release of information; and (d) the implication of e-government. The Bush Administration is criticized for decisions limiting the information flow from the executive branch. Specific examples are the Ashcroft memo in October, 2001, that advocated delay in fulfilling FOIA requests; Executive Order 13233 that emphasizes executive privilege as the principle for managing presidential records; the battle between Vice President Cheney and the comptroller general over access to materials used to develop a national energy policy; and the Homeland Security Act exemption. Another executive order by President George W. Bush, E.O. 13392, December 14, 2005, attempts to balance earlier limitations by directly supporting FOIA and outlining a renewed emphasis on customer service and results orientation in FOIA implementation.</p>
<p>This disciplined and well-researched study concludes that major reforms such as performance management and outsourcing detract from democratic accountability. The Freedom of Information Act was simply not central to agency performance plans during the administrations of Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush. Future management reforms will be needed to promote an increased connection between accountability and available information.</p>
<p>In March, 2011, the Obama Administration announced performance-oriented reforms that were different from previous administrations. These reforms were touted as making the Obama Administration the most transparent in American history. Among them were high performance goals to be tracked by Office of Management and Budget (OMB), public dashboards to note the progress of agency information technology projects, and problem-solving networks. Recently, plans for Fedspace, a problem-solving network, have been scrapped. Although USAspending.gov and the IT Dashboard have been continued, overall funding for electronic government transparency initiatives in the Obama Administration have been reduced to about one fifth of the original proposals. Detours in the fresh start by President Obama suggest an important need to continue study of management reforms and the fate of the FOIA. The methods and discussion in <italic>Governmental Transparency in the Path of Administrative Reform</italic> constitute an ideal departure point and insightful approach for future studies.</p>
