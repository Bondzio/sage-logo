<p>Good morning, Mr. Chairman. I am George Grob, Deputy Inspector General for Evaluation and Inspections, Department of Health and Human Services. I am here today to talk about Medicare’s home health benefit. This is an extremely valuable program, one that provides much needed medical care for elderly and disabled individuals in the place that most of them want to be—their homes. Sadly, I must tell you—in fact I must emphasize—that <italic>this program is out of control</italic>. </p>

</disp-quote>
<p>With that, American Evaluation Association member George Grob, now retired from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and currently President of the Center for Public Program Evaluation, began his testimony of July 28, 1997, on Medicare home health care fraud and abuse before the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging. The occasion was to announce the HHS Office of Inspector General’s (OIG) release of two reports, its latest in a series on the topic. One of the reports, examining practices in the four most populated states, reported that<disp-quote>
<p>4 out every 10 home health visits paid for by Medicare should not have been paid. The second, conducted in the five largest States, found that one of every four home health agencies certified to participate in the program had abused or defrauded Medicare or misappropriated Medicare funds. (<italic>Medicare: Home Health Care</italic>, 1997)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The two reports that OIG profiled in the congressional testimony were part of a “large body of work including audits, investigations, inspections, and congressional testimony” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098214012439930">
<italic>Medicare: Home Health Care, 1997</italic>
</xref>). Over a period of 5<bold> </bold>years in the 1990s, OIG evaluation staff had produced 14 reports on home health care issues, supplemented by audits, investigations, and another body of work by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO; now known as the General Accountability Office).</p>
<p>In this Exemplars case, we profile the HHS home health care evaluations, the political and organizational contexts in which they occurred, their short- and long-term effects, and their implications for evaluators’ understanding of evaluation practice and the use of evaluation findings. We hold that the case is an exemplar of unusual evaluation work due to its scope and duration; coordination among auditors, legal investigators, and evaluators; effects on U.S. federal decision making and congressional legislation; and the activist role played by evaluators in the instigation and planning of evaluations, as well as in the subsequent use of evaluation findings to orchestrate policy change. The context and progression of events in the case are atypical for most evaluators, but they provide a rare insight, we believe, into the possibilities of evaluation work at the U.S. federal level and lessons about the extent that evaluation findings can be used in some circumstances. Our presentation follows the format of the previous three Exemplars cases produced by the current section editors: We present a narrative description of the evaluations and their background, follow it with an amalgamation of extensive evaluator–editor dialogue in the format of a single interview, and conclude with reflections on the case. We provide a reference list of the OIG’s reports in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1098214012439930">Appendix A</xref>.</p>
<sec id="section1-1098214012439930">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The HHS OIG is the largest inspector general’s office in the U.S. government, with more than 1,700 employees with responsibilities for combating fraud, waste, and abuse and for improving the efficiency of HHS programs. A majority of OIG’s resources goes toward the oversight of Medicare and Medicaid—programs that represent a significant part of the federal budget and that affect the country’s most vulnerable citizens. OIG’s oversight extends to programs under other HHS institutions, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration. It conducts audits, evaluations, investigations, and other activities intended to promote program integrity. Medicare is the federal American program that funds health care for the elderly. Among other services, it provides funding for home health care services such as nursing care, health aides, various therapies, and medical social services.</p>
<p>During about the first 6 years of the 1990s, Medicare expenditures for home health services grew fivefold, from $3.5 billion to $16.9 billion. As Grob said to the Exemplars section editors, “That’s just way, way too fast for trends in Medicare spending.” Some of this growth was due to changes in demographics, liberalization of benefits due to legal decisions, and increases in medical costs. However, the OIG reported other problems in the first of the two reports that were profiled in the 1997 testimony: (a) improper payments in which 40% of the home health services did not meet the requirements of the program; (b) unjustifiable variation in payments, ranging from 30 to 85 visits; (c) unnecessary services, with 21% deemed unreasonable and unnecessary; (d) services provided to patients who were not homebound (13%); (e) services provided without orders by physicians (6%); and (f) a few services provided without documentation. These findings mirrored the results of earlier reports by OIG auditors.</p>
<p>The findings of the second of the two reports that were summarized in the testimony showed that one quarter of home health care agencies were designated as “problem providers,” due, among other infractions, to filing for coverage for unallowed costs, filing claims that were deemed unauditable, not filing in a timely manner, submitting claims for medically unnecessary services or for services not rendered, or showing deficiencies in Medicare certification. Digging deeper, the OIG found some characteristics that the problem agencies had in common. First, their costs were higher; they tended to “be newer to the Medicare program, for-profit, provide more visits per patient, receive higher average reimbursement per patient and serve more chronic patients than other agencies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098214012439930">
<italic>Medicare: Home Health Care, 1997</italic>
</xref>). The second characteristic was agency “owners with questionable backgrounds”—that is, with little or no health care experience or with financial issues such as previous bankruptcies, loan defaults, failure to pay taxes, or criminal records. Third, the problem agencies tended to be family-owned small corporations, often employing relatives who sometimes did little home health care work.</p>
<p>Together, the two reports showed that Medicare controls were inadequate. It was found that physicians often had insufficient control over claims, and it was reported that Medicare staff could not review claims adequately because of their massive volume. The Health Care Financing Administration, which oversaw Medicare payments, had previously attempted to alleviate some of the problems by taking steps such as requiring that home health care agencies notify beneficiaries of claims for services rendered to them, broadening the scope of oversight by certification teams, eliminating interim payments to health care agencies, adopting a prospective payment system, and developing a new provider application system. The OIG offered recommendations for related remedies in the testimony.</p>
<p>Following Congress’s adoption of the OIG’s recommendations, payments to health care agencies were made as a lump-sum set before discharge. Total payments immediately dropped by $8.5 billion in 1 year, equal to 40% of previous payment levels—the same percentage that auditors previously estimated as claims paid in error. These lower levels continued for several years, resulting in 10-year savings of more than $50 billion. The OIG then conducted follow-up studies to address the concerns of HHS Secretary Shalala about possible problems of access and coverage stemming from the implementation of the new payment method. The studies did not identify any substantial issues. For example, the OIG reported that the number of independent home health care agencies declined; however, a substantial majority of hospital discharge planners reported that Medicare patients could obtain home health care when they needed it, and home health care agencies reported that they rarely refused to take Medicare patients. Some deficiencies in certifications had occurred; nevertheless, Medicare beneficiaries were positive about their home health care. The evaluators went on to examine ancillary issues such as the characteristics of people who went into home health care agencies directly from the community (as opposed to being transferred from hospitals) and physicians’ practices in using Medicare home health services.</p>
<p>Upon reviewing the series of studies and engaging in preliminary discussions with Grob, the editors were left with two major impressions. First, the Medicare fraud evaluations that Grob and his colleagues led, accompanied by the work of auditors and investigators, are of interest in no small part because of their length and broad reach, the extent of collaboration among members of multiple professions, the blunt and forceful manner in which the evaluators challenged powerful private interests, and their effects on legislators. It is not often that readers of this journal are privy to the workings of evaluators with the purview and resources that were brought to bear in the series of HHS evaluations. Second, the series of evaluations was potentially controversial. The evaluation team decided that the only way that fraud could be addressed was to promote legislation revising Medicare procedures—a most unusual purpose for a series of studies. This might be considered as having adopted an excessively activist role. With these two perspectives in mind, the editors and Grob had an extended discussion, which we report in the form of an interview.</p>
<sec id="section2-1098214012439930">
<title>Interview</title>
<p><italic>Editors:</italic> It’s probably safe to assume that the entire package of studies and subsequent reports that your office conducted are out of the ordinary for most <italic>AJE </italic>readers—indeed, probably for evaluators everywhere. What you accomplished and how you went about it clearly was unique. Can you give us a summary of the unique qualities of the entire effort that helped make it exemplary?</p>
<p>
<italic>Grob:</italic> I think you’re right about all this being unique—including for us. The studies were a game changer for me and my staff. We had had some good successes affecting policy previously, but this one we did on a mammoth scale, and we did it with great deliberation—that is, we <italic>intended</italic> to get the result that we got. When we started doing it, we knew it would take us five years or longer; we knew what we would have to do, we decided to do it, and we were ultimately successful.</p>
<p>What the evaluators had going into this was some strong work done by the auditors and the investigators in the OIG. For example, it was the auditors who determined that 40% of the home health care claims were paid in error. The evaluators built upon this work; in fact, the entire endeavor was a rather unique cooperative effort between evaluators and auditors and investigators. Our bosses always used to say they wanted the investigators and auditors and evaluators to work together, but in those days, it was very, very difficult to do. Evaluators and investigators and auditors were each in their own silos, so to speak; they really didn’t understand each other very well.</p>
<p>You know how it’s commonly said that members of every profession think that they’re the only ones that know how to get to the truth—that was at play here, in that the auditors saw this as an audit problem and the investigators saw this as a law enforcement problem. But the OIG still did not completely understand why Medicare was so vulnerable and whether the home health care beneficiaries were being well treated. These were evaluation issues. So the evaluators and auditors and investigators agreed to participate in a cooperative endeavor. That was one of the unique aspects of the effort. We also received considerable support from our lawyers who advised us on the requirements of the law and reviewed our proposals to change it. They participated in our strategizing and offered their ideas about how to solve the problems we uncovered.</p>
<p>Another unique aspect is that we quickly figured out that only a major policy change would solve this problem. From the initial evaluations and audits, we learned that there was no practical way to control the quality of hundreds of millions of individual claims. Medicare was billed for every single home health visit, one at a time, and every one of those payments had to be either paid or denied. You simply can’t have enough people who could possibly review every claim to deny it if it was bad; it was just humanly impossible to do it. Claims involved the doctors’ determination whether to give a benefit as well as the home health agencies billing Medicare for the benefit, and it was clear that there were just not enough administrative people to oversee the program. It was absolutely, humanly impossible to do quality oversight over these suspicious claims. We could go after crooks, and we could do some auditing, but we would never be able to succeed solely in that way. We couldn’t put enough people in jail, we couldn’t catch them, we couldn’t prove it, we couldn’t be sure that every payment was right—there would never be enough auditors to do this.</p>
<p>We decided that we had to make a case to change the law about allowable claims. There was no other way to do it. So we went after a policy change—a change in legislative policy, not just a change in regulations.</p>
<p>
<italic>Editors:</italic> This seems to be at the heart of much of what is unique about these studies—that you decided to change policy. How typical was it for your office to take this approach?</p>
<p>
<italic>Grob:</italic> Initially, not so typical at all. I’ll tell you a little bureaucracy “war story” that might help put things in perspective. When I started talking to some of the best and strongest leaders in my office about doing something to address the home health care issues, some did not want us to do it. They thought it would be utterly pointless. First, they said we should not set our sights on reducing expenditures on a program that was growing so rapidly, because we had seldom achieved such effects before. We might succeed in changing the rate of growth but not actually leveling it off, much less reducing the expenditures. Second, they said that the entire home health care industry would be against us. The industry had become very large and very influential and could basically out-lobby us. We were a fairly small staff; we could put only a few people on this. Our leadership said, “Look, we’re just going to get out-classed here; there’s no way we can take on the high-paid lobbyists and advocates of this program.” Third, they said, “If we want to get a law changed, we’ve got to persuade the head of Medicare, the HHS secretary, and the staff of the Office of Management and Budget who oversee this program. Then, when we get to the Congress, we’ve got two chambers, and at least two committees that oversee this program, and each of those has subcommittees, and there are two different parties. We’ve got to get them all to agree, while at the same time, we’ll have this powerful industry against us. Furthermore, it will appear that it’s all about the OIG apparently proposing to deprive people of home care. It’s just not going to happen; we simply won’t muster that much strength—and even if we could, it would take five to seven years.” In essence, they basically thought that an all-out effort would be futile.</p>
<p>Upon reflection, I concluded that they hadn’t actually explained why we couldn’t do it, they had given instructions on how to do it—and to be prepared to take five years to get it done. Now I didn’t want to force anyone to work on a project that might be futile. Fortunately, I had some other people who were very bright and wanted to go for it, so we decided to do it, knowing what we were up against. Part of my reasoning was that the lobbyists representing the home health care industry had not come out of their mothers’ wombs with great lobbyist skills. All of the lobbyists and their staffs had to learn how to do what they were doing; we were confident that we could learn it too and do our job as well as they did theirs.</p>
<p>
<italic>Editors:</italic> So how did you decide to proceed to get legislation to change a program as big and popular as Medicare?</p>
<p>
<italic>Grob:</italic> Well, we quickly realized that there was no such thing as a single evaluation that would get us there. There were so many questions to be asked about this program that we knew that a single study would never do the trick. So we began to commission a body of work. If you look at some of our studies, you see that we answered questions such as, How do private insurers handle home health care? How do health maintenance organizations pay for it? How much do they pay? What kind of quality controls are there? Are there accrediting agencies to make sure that the services are of a high quality? What were the requirements for enrolling home health businesses in the Medicare program? Just who were these businesses? Why were expenditures spiking so dramatically? And so forth.</p>
<p>Issues were complicated, and they didn’t all turn out the way we thought. For example, previously we had done studies that showed that the physicians owning medical labs tended to over-prescribe such services. In other words, physicians that have a stake in a lab order a lot more lab services than physicians who don’t have a stake in a lab, because they’re basically sending business their own way. So we decided to see if the same was true of hospitals owning home health services. What we found was that hospitals that owned home health agencies discharged their patients into a lot more home health care than other hospitals, but, strangely, it had nothing to do with whether they were discharging them into their own agencies. The study was “a dry well,” but we would never have known that without doing the study. We had to do a whole bunch of those studies to find wells that weren’t dry and to get a clear understanding of what was causing the home health problem and how to solve it.</p>
<p>As discussed in my testimony, we did one study to find out who the people were that were delivering all the apparently unnecessary home health care. We got a list of people who we called “problem providers” because they had overcharged or in other ways abused or defrauded the Medicare home health program. It turned out that these providers had some common traits; for example, very few of them came from a medical background. They were previous business owners, small business owners of all kinds, and they basically had found out that it was very easy to set up a home health business. That led us to eventually recommend that there should be a stronger set of qualifications for businesses to enroll as Medicare home health care providers.</p>
<p>I’m elaborating on the idea that we actually set out to create a body of work, knowing that it would take time to get it done so that we could understand what was going on here.</p>
<p>
<italic>Editors:</italic> So far you’ve described three unique aspects of the studies: You collaborated with auditors and investigators, you set out to bring about a policy change under unusually difficult circumstances, and you developed a body of work by commissioning multiple studies. Can you describe what happened to make all the work come to fruition?</p>
<p>
<italic>Grob:</italic> The congressional testimony is what really brought all the issues to the forefront. We needed to learn the congressional process. We worked with our OIG and departmental legislative liaisons and public affairs staffs and with key staff members of the congressional committees. Gradually we began to understand the legislative process and eventually to master it. In the beginning, I think the home health industry underestimated us, but with all the support we received, we eventually became as good at it as they were.</p>
<p>We also collaborated with GAO staff who were working on this issue. The GAO connection turned out to be very important. Had the GAO not also been on the case, we might not have made as much headway. I don’t think that we would have been noticed as much. But combining our efforts made a big difference.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you a couple of stories to emphasize this aspect of really knowing and understanding how these congressional committees behave. There were two that were dramatic. After our initial testimony in 1997, which took many in the industry by surprise, the home health care industry got one of the committees with oversight responsibilities over home health to hold a hearing in order to give their home health constituents a chance to respond to our work. I’ll always remember what happened when we repeated during that hearing that we had discovered that the claim error rate was 40%. All of a sudden, the chair of the committee looked up and said, “What did you say?” I repeated that the error rate was 40%, and he said, “40%!” and it just changed the entire mood in the room. The committee was willing to have a sleepy hearing in order to give the industry a chance to be heard, but it suddenly turned into a dramatic event that re-emphasized the problem.</p>
<p>Then the industry got another committee to hold a hearing. Instead of having the usual committee hearing where the committee members would ask the questions, the chairman had me seated at the end of a very long table with 10 or so people there from the industry. As I remember it, the chairman said something to the effect of, “Well, you know these people have some trouble with what you’re saying, Mr. Grob, and I thought I’d let them ask their questions and you could answer them.” They had a list of questions, and each one took a turn to explain why they thought our studies were flawed. For example, they claimed that our studies were not based on random samples. However, with the help of all our staff, we were really ready for their questions. I said, “Before I answer the questions, let me make sure I got them down right. Here are the questions I think you were asking.” I read off the questions and said, “Is that right; do I have them all down right?” They agreed, so I started answering the questions one at a time. For example, the audit that demonstrated the 40% error rate was based on a random sample. Actually, we had 3,000 cases that gave us a precision rate within about 2 or 3 percentage points. Studies like this are often done with a 5% precision, but we were so concerned about this we went to the effort to get 3,000 randomly drawn samples and were within 3 percentage points of the correct answer on the error rate. I got about two-thirds of the way through the questions, effectively refuting each charge of weakness in the study, and the chairman essentially called it off, closing the hearing. So I think this idea of really learning the intricacies of the congressional process and being absolutely ready for the challenging questions was important.</p>
<p>In the end, the Congress enacted legislation to change the way Medicare paid for home health. Under the new law, instead of paying for each home visit one at a time, Medicare pays “prospectively,” similar to the way it pays for hospital care. Home health care providers now receive a single payment for a 60-day course of care. This change had the effect of bringing the program under control.</p>
<p>We also needed to learn to work closely with the executive branch of government to take some controversial administrative steps. When the home health care payments dropped dramatically (about 40%) after legislation was passed, HHS Secretary Shalala became concerned that beneficiaries might be harmed, so at her request, we did studies about access to care for 3 years in a row. We monitored the situation until we and the Secretary were satisfied that everything was okay.</p>
<p>What happened was the supply of shoddy home health agencies dried up, and what was left was the traditional home health care agencies. Reputable home health care agencies were pleased with the outcome. Once I made a conference presentation at an association of home health care providers. It was in a very big hall, and the room was packed. When I was finished, people came running down the aisles to the front. I was a little terrified that they were furious about the legislative changes that had been enacted, but the common response was, “Mr. Grob, whatever you do, don’t stop saying what you’re saying. Fly-by-night agencies moved in on our profession and gave it such a bad reputation without providing good care, so please keep speaking up.”</p>
<p>
<italic>Editors:</italic> You said earlier that your study was a game-changer. Has the process continued in the agency?</p>
<p>
<italic>Grob:</italic> We were able to use our knowledge of the process again when we examined over-priced drugs some time later. By then we knew what it would take to bring about a major policy change, the steps to take, the kind of studies we would have to do, and that we would need to produce a body of work. Again the end result was legislation reducing Medicare payments for certain drugs. The office has continued to use combinations of investigations, audits, and evaluations to achieve beneficial policy changes.</p>
<p>To some extent evaluation reports more than audit reports get attention, mostly because the evaluations aren’t a matter of just compliance but tell stories about who was hurt and how much they were hurting. The evaluation work lends itself a lot more to telling a story.</p>
<p>
<italic>Editors:</italic> Earlier you described internal OIG conversations about whether it would be <italic>possible</italic> to use evaluation findings to change federal policy, but you did not mention any considerations of whether it would be <italic>proper</italic> for OIG evaluators to do so. Might it have been the case that other inspectors general thought it was inappropriate for OIG evaluators to be activists for policy change? Might they have thought that you overstepped your oversight function here by involving yourselves in a lobbying function?</p>
<p>
<italic>Grob:</italic> At the time I had heard that some did feel that way. It may still be true today. Not all inspectors general are into promoting policy changes. They’ll do it when they’re requested, but they would not think so much of trying to get a hearing in order to get a result. Their general practice would be that when there is attention to their studies in Congress, then the Congress will request a hearing. But they may not try to get a hearing themselves or to seek public attention on pressing issues.</p>
<p>I should emphasize that there are legitimate reasons for choosing different styles of managing inspector general-type work. Much hinges on the kind of issues to be dealt with, the best tactics for getting recommendations accepted and acted on, and the best fit for the personality of the IG and key staff. It is not as if the policy-oriented approach is always the preferable one.</p>
<p>
<italic>Editors:</italic> These issues are related to the ongoing debate in evaluation concerning the proper role of evaluators as social activists. Isn’t the primary intent of the OIGs to inform policymakers so they can make better decisions? Couldn’t OIG activism, as you describe it here, be seen as a conflict of interest? Do you worry that subsequent OIG evaluators, no matter how much they believe in the validity of their own data, could become just another powerful, internal special interest group, undermining their primary function of governmental oversight?</p>
<p>
<italic>Grob:</italic> I don’t believe so, but others might disagree.</p>
<p>If we get into this line of work, we have to take careful steps to protect the quality of our work. A vigorous internal quality control system is integral to the culture of the entire IG community. Public scrutiny also plays a role. Our work had to survive scrutiny by advocates who opposed it. In many ways, knowing that highly competent advocates are free to take us to task in the public arena helps to keep us in line.</p>
<p>At the same time, I believe that the danger of misdirected work is a possibility for all evaluators, not just those in the inspector general community. All evaluators have political orientations, and it is incumbent on us all to be wary of our own motives. An openness to understanding all points of view is essential both to do a good job and to avoid misplaced advocacy by evaluators, especially for those who are also career civil servants.</p>
<p>
<italic>Editors:</italic> You used your studies to orchestrate policy change because those were your organizational tools. Other groups use different tools (e.g., political influence, negotiation, manipulation of public opinion, and so forth) when they seek to change policy. Were the OIG studies and testimony the <italic>only</italic> influence in getting the policy changed? The <italic>most important</italic> influence? A <italic>key influence</italic> among other events and actions taking place? How can we put the OIG contribution in perspective?</p>
<p>
<italic>Grob:</italic> By no means was our work the sole or most important influence. There was strong interest in home health issues within the HHS leadership and the staffs of key members of Congress. GAO also played a critical role. To put things in perspective, at the Senate hearing that we discussed earlier, I was the second person testifying, not the first. The first person (who shared the table with me) was from GAO. And the hearing was prepared by hardworking and insightful committee staff who fully understood and were concerned about the Medicare home health program. It would be more accurate to say that we decided to join others in influencing policy, not to do it ourselves. That would have been unrealistic and impractical.</p>
<p>
<italic>Editors:</italic> What if the OIG had worked more collaboratively with the home health care industry (as it did internally among auditors, investigators, and evaluators) instead of viewing them as possible adversaries? To what degree do you think this strategy might have been successful?</p>
<p>
<italic>Grob:</italic> We did work with them. The staff representing the home health industry were quite dedicated and professional and did not want their industry taken over by fraudulent providers. They promoted excellence of care and had no tolerance for fraud or waste. They spoke out as much as we did about the abuses. We kept open communications with them during our work. I retain a very high regard for the people we worked with.</p>
<p>
<italic>Editors:</italic> A concluding question: What were the most important things you learned during the course of doing the home health evaluations and about their influence on legislative policy?</p>
<p>
<italic>Grob:</italic> I would say there were two. The first is the need to develop a body of work rather than using a single study to influence outcomes. Second, and probably most important, is the need to work with all stakeholders and influencers of a public policy—in this case, the home health industry, the Department of Health and Human Services, congressional staff, GAO, and, internally within the HHS OIG, the auditors, investigators, lawyers, and congressional and public affairs staff.</p>

<title>Reflections</title>
<sec id="section4-1098214012439930">
<title>The Unique Features of the Case</title>
<p>In the history of <italic>American Journal of Evaluation</italic> Exemplars section reports, this case stands out as unusual. The autonomy and access to resources of the OIG evaluators that are displayed in the case are highly unusual. In some ways, the OIG evaluators played all three roles of sponsor, client, and evaluator, using their skills and resources to further an agenda they had selected. Few evaluators, even internal evaluators, can select what to study, how to study it, and then take direct action to get the results used as they see fit; few evaluators have such opportunity, authority, and power. Furthermore, the case describes American federal-level evaluation efforts with a degree of nuance and intimate understanding of the policy process that, to our knowledge, has been little reported. All these aspects make the case sufficiently compelling to share.</p>
<p>The number of evaluation studies in the case and the duration of time over which they were conducted, the high-stakes outcomes of the studies, and the power and organizational scope of the participating evaluators, government officials, and other stakeholders (among other aspects of the case) make for complexity little seen in most previous Exemplars cases. Despite this complexity, the case presents an elaboration of fairly typical evaluation logic: (a) the identification of the problem by the HHS auditors and investigators; (b) the implementation of studies that resulted in findings about the breadth, depth, and implications of Medicare fraud and abuse; (c) the use of the studies’ findings by Congress; and (d) the follow-up studies designed to ensure that beneficiaries were properly served after changes in home health care agency payment procedures were instituted. The steps sometimes overlapped and circled, but the description of the progression of evaluative activities over a period of several years clearly explicates the manner in which well conceived and properly conducted evaluation activities are defined, conducted, and used.</p>
<p>Note, however, that this case is not about methods. As we have pointed out throughout our account of the case, its exemplary character stems from the number of studies, as well as the unusual degree of involvement of the evaluators in directing the purpose and the intended outcomes of the studies and of the use of the studies’ findings. The HHS OIG can be described as a kind of internal evaluation office with a broad mandate to help effect significant change; the case is a manifestation of the OIG’s exceptional internal evaluation mandate. The OIG’s efforts in the case ranged across a sequence of evaluation activities including (a) learning from audit and investigation results about the scope of the Medicare expenditure problem, (b) recognizing that a policy change was the only outcome that would succeed in addressing the problem, (c) identifying the path and resources that were necessary to solve the Medicare fraud and abuse, (d) commissioning the studies that provided the appropriate findings, (e) using the results in a manner that succeeded in instigating the appropriate legislation, and (f) responding to HHS concerns about unintended negative consequences by conducting follow-up studies. Evaluators in some settings (particularly internal evaluators) frequently participate in activities designed to gather information that results in modifications in program practices, administrative structures, and sometimes in policies, but to our knowledge, they rarely do so to the degree reported here.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1098214012439930">
<title>Evaluation Use</title>
<p>The case might be defined as an instance of superutilization-focused evaluation. In the parlance of the Joint Committee’s program evaluation standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098214012439930">Yarborough, Shulha, Hopson, &amp; Caruthers, 2011</xref>), the case is not about exemplary evaluation methods addressed in the Joint Committee’s Accuracy Standards; it is about issues addressed in the Utility Standards. From the beginning, the OIG team concentrated its efforts on identifying and carrying out the steps necessary to ensure that changes were made in Medicare funding. The degree and effects of the fraud and abuse were clear and convincing, but had the team not learned how to affect policy and put their learning into action, the likelihood of bringing about change would have been minimal. Changes in administrative oversight were impossible; legislative modifications were necessary.</p>
<p>The case has broad lessons about the use of evaluation findings. Clearly, many evaluators are not in positions to effect change in such a direct and conclusive manner. Their mandates, resources, and contacts are likely to be much more circumscribed than an inspector general in an American federal government department. Furthermore, the efforts that the HHS OIG team took were unusual even for U.S. federal departments. Nevertheless, the OIG team succeeded. Perhaps, the broad lesson is that, with the proper degree of motivation, evaluators in other situations can likewise come to understand their client organizations well enough to develop and apply creative methods for helping enhance the use of findings. It is not by happenstance that research on the use of evaluation findings is probably the most studied topic in the research-on-evaluation literature. Evaluators have explored a wide variety of rationales, methods, and outcomes of enhancing use; the HHS OIG team’s efforts expand the case that evaluators can enhance the use of evaluation findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1098214012439930">
<title>Stakeholder Involvement</title>
<p>Another widely reported topic in the literature on research on evaluation is stakeholder involvement in evaluations. This has been a theme that has run across the previous three cases published by the current Exemplars section editors and was found in some of the reports of previous section editors. The HHS OIG case shows considerable participation by program stakeholders. The HHS Secretary was involved in promoting the studies and requested additional OIG work after congressional action and subsequent changes in home health care agency reimbursement procedures. She also promoted the studies internally; after the hearing, she quipped, “We have turned the cannons against ourselves.” The OIG also was in contact with home health care agencies throughout the course of the studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1098214012439930">
<title>Advocacy Evaluation?</title>
<p>To some readers, this case might highlight the good that evaluators can do as advocates for programs. Advocacy as an intended result of evaluation has a long history in the profession; it is seen as a desirable effect that is appropriate for a democratic society. Usually it takes the form of giving voice to stakeholders with less power and representing the interests of marginalized groups; in contrast, the case profiled here shows advocacy in the interest of the broad swath of citizenry paying taxes that contribute to the Medicare trust fund. To other readers, the case might raise troubling questions about how some evaluators might possibly undertake steps similar to those described here for purposes that do not serve the public welfare. A number of evaluation theorists and commentators have antipathy toward evaluation as advocacy. They believe that the purview of evaluation should be to conduct studies, make recommendations, and perhaps help ensure the use of evaluation findings; this case shows evaluators working with others to achieve legislative outcomes directly.</p>
<p>In our judgment, this case is less about the pros and cons of advocacy evaluation than it is about the wherewithal of groups of collaborating professionals to achieve programmatic efficiency by working closely with clients, conducting as many evaluation studies as necessary to examine the pros and cons of issues, and inserting their results into the normal legislative process. HHS leaders supported the evaluators’ initiatives to change policy because, as they saw it, without pursuing policy changes, the evaluations would have had little or no effect. Instead of the HHS leaders alone using the evaluation results to influence Congress, they agreed with the strategy to have the OIG initiate and participate in the process. In the meantime, the home health care industry served as a buttress against the possibility that the OIG had used unsound evaluation methods to achieve a policy goal. When properly conducted, the democratic process can protect both sides against overzealous program advocates who use flawed methodology or misinterpret evaluation findings to achieve a goal. As it was, the home health care industry representatives failed in their attempt to undermine confidence in the evaluation findings because of the care that the OIG staff took in conducting their studies. Furthermore, HHS leadership asked for a scope of studies that went beyond finding problems with Medicare by ensuring that the policy changes designed to address the problems had not had negative consequences. The case is less an instance of advocacy that has the potential for good or ill; it is more an instance of conducting a body of evaluations that reflect a creative, thorough understanding of evaluators’ client organizations and facilitating collaboration with them to achieve a policy goal.</p>
<p>Finally, the case stands on its own as a source of intriguing insights about the complex workings of the federal government. It is an example of how evaluation can assist in a multimethod, multiprofession, multistage process to serve democratic ends. It is heartening to learn that groups whose mandate is inquiry into organizational structure, activities, and outcomes—the HHS auditors, investigators, and evaluators—facilitated the process through their cooperation throughout the endeavor.</p>
