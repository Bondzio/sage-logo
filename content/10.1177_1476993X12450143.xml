<abstract>
<p>The parallel Sennacherib narratives in Isaiah 36–39 and 2 Kings 18–20 have long intrigued scholars. Although for the better part of the past two hundred years the diachronic methods of historical criticism have defined the exegetical landscape, the recent rise of narrative criticism and its emphasis on the synchronic reading of the text have called many of the previously held views into question. This article will provide a brief overview and critique of both the exegetical issues stemming from the traditional historical-critical methods and of the more recent proposals put forth by scholars like Smelik and Seitz, who argue for a more synchronic understanding of these two texts. This overview reveals a gradual evolution in biblical scholarship, in which the recent synchronic narrative methods are being recognized as aids and correctives to, and not opponents of, the traditional diachronic methods of historical criticism.</p>

<p>Anyone who has spent time studying Isaiah 1–39 (i.e. Proto-Isaiah) will be able to attest that Proto-Isaiah is fraught with numerous exegetical headaches. Perhaps no textual migraine is greater than the narrative of Sennacherib’s invasion, Hezekiah’s illness, and the visit from the envoys of Babylon in Isaiah 36–39, and its differences from the parallel passage in 2 Kings 18–20. The source of this particular migraine can be traced back to Wilhelm Gesenius. Ever since Gesenius argued in his 1821 commentary on Isaiah that 2 Kings 18–20 takes priority over Isaiah 36–39, his conclusion has been the dominant view within biblical studies for the better part of two hundred years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12450143">1820–21</xref>). Nevertheless, scholars have continued to encounter numerous exegetical difficulties in their studies of Isaiah 36–39/2 Kings 18–20 (for more on Gesenius’s work see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">Smelik 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X12450143">Seitz 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X12450143">Childs 1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476993X12450143">2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In more recent decades, with the rise of narrative criticism and a growing appreciation for reading the Bible as literature, scholars have begun to argue that the biblical books are far from being the haphazardly stitched-together ‘Frankenstein monsters’ that early historical-critical methods had suggested. Rather, they are seen to be well-crafted literary works by highly competent writers. This has caused a number of scholars to reevaluate some of the previously held conclusions advocated by the more traditional historical-critical methods. More specifically, some scholars have begun to make the argument that the reason why so many questions still persist regarding Isaiah 36–39/2 Kings 18–20 is that historical-critical methods alone are inadequate for the exegetical task. Recent scholars have argued that, without consideration of the literary integrity of a given biblical text, the diachronic methods of historical criticism often end up obscuring any clear exegetical understanding of that text. Like a pair of glasses with a faulty prescription, diachronic methods can blur the vision of the wearer leaving the scholar with strained eyes and an annoying headache. Such is the dilemma, some recent scholars have argued, of the traditional historical-critical exegesis of Isaiah 36–39/2 Kings 18–20.</p>
<p>In this article, we will provide a brief overview and critique of the scholarly debate between the traditional historical-critical proposals and the more recent scholarly proposals regarding the exegesis of Isaiah 36–39/2 Kings 18–20. As Childs has stated,<disp-quote>
<p>New attention has now been directed to the need of a synchronic reading that would take seriously the literary shaping of the final form of the text. Indeed, the problem of how the diachronic and the synchronic dimensions of a text relate has become a major hermeneutical concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X12450143">2001</xref>: 260).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What will become evident is that the recent scholarly attempts to view Isaiah 36–39/2 Kings 18–20 through both a diachronic historical-critical lens as well as a synchronic narrative lens have not only exposed a number of blind spots in traditional historical-critical methodology, but have also produced some clarifying insights into the exegesis of the text.</p>

<title>1. Wilheim Gesenius’s Foundational Claim</title>
<p>At the heart of this debate are the two parallel texts found in Isaiah 36–39 and 2 Kings 18–20. While the bulk of 2 Kings 18–20 does indeed run parallel with Isaiah 36–39, there are still a number of significant exceptions:</p>
<list id="list1-1476993X12450143" list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>The 2 Kgs 18.1-8 account of Hezekiah’s reforms is not found in Isaiah.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The 2 Kgs 18.9-12 account of the fall of Samaria is not found in Isaiah.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The 2 Kgs 18.14-16 account of Hezekiah’s capitulation to Sennacherib is not found in Isaiah, even though 2 Kgs 18.13, the verse that introduces Sennacherib’s invasion, has its parallel in Isa. 36.1.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hezekiah’s prayer in Isa 38.9-20 after his healing is not found in 2 Kings.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The account of Hezekiah’s death in 2 Kgs 20.20-21 is not found in Isaiah.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Having two clearly parallel texts with such notable differences naturally invites a host of exegetical questions: ‘Who borrowed from whom?’ ‘When was the original account written?’ ‘When did the borrowing take place?’ The first significant historical-critical scholar to attempt to answer these questions was Gesenius who, in his influential commentary on Isaiah, argued that 2 Kings 18–20 was ‘an integral part of the books, whereas Isaiah 36–37 appears to be an appendage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">Smelik 1986</xref>: 71). He claimed 2 Kings 18–20 contained the original material regarding Sennacherib’s invasion of Judah, while Isaiah 36–39 was simply copied from the 2 Kings account. Seitz best summarizes Gesenius’s reasoning regarding Isaiah 36–39 and 2 Kings 18–20:<disp-quote>
<p>Essentially, Isaiah is a text that has smoothed out difficulties in Kings, by means of shortening, consistency of rendering, and generally tidying up. In a classic argument, the ‘difficult text’ has priority, except where clumsy transpositions signal that an original sense has been disturbed. To this, Gesenius added his own logical observations. (1) the narratives conform to the style and larger plan of Kings, not Isaiah; (2) the Book of Isaiah continued to develop after Kings was completed, thus making the direction of dependence from Kings to Isaiah, not the reverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X12450143">Seitz 1991</xref>: 49).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In essence, Gesenius’s assessment came down to three things. First, he felt that the chronology of 2 Kings 18–20 made little sense. After all, why would there be such an extensive account of Sennacherib’s invasion in 2 Kgs 18.17–19.37, when it was already mentioned that Hezekiah sent payment to Sennacherib in 2 Kgs 18.14-16? According to Gesenius, Isaiah 36–39 was a later writer’s attempt to fix the problem. Second, Gesenius thought it odd that such an extended narrative is found in Isaiah, a work of predominantly prophetic oracles. 2 Kings, on the other hand, is clearly a narrative work from beginning to end. Therefore, it seemed logical to Gesenius that the narrative in question originally belonged to 2 Kings. Finally, the book of Isaiah, most notably chapters 40–66, continued to be written and developed during and after the exile. This indicated to Gesenius that it was more likely that the material in 2 Kings 18–20 was inserted into Isaiah at a later time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">Smelik 1986</xref>: 71-72; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X12450143">Seitz 1991</xref>: 48-51). With those three observations, Gesenius laid the groundwork for almost the next two hundred years of historical-critical exegesis of both Isaiah 36–39 and 2 Kings 18–20. The question was seemingly settled. Isaiah 36–39 borrowed from 2 Kings 18–20.</p>

<title>2. The Rise of the Historical-Critical House of Gesenius</title>
<p>Gesenius’s foundational claim has had a tremendous impact on biblical scholarship—the priority of 2 Kings 18–20 is simply assumed by most scholars today. Person, for example, when speaking of Isaiah 36–39, states:<disp-quote>
<p>Since these chapters were copied from 2 Kings 18–20, Isaiah 36–39 are assumed to have a literary unity with the exception of the addition of Isaiah 38.9-20, which has no parallel in Kings and is generally assumed to have been added when the Kings passage was inserted into its Isaianic context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476993X12450143">1999</xref>: 374).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ackroyd echoes this assumption when he writes, ‘Narrative and archival material concerning Hezekiah appears in 2 Kings 18–20, the main part of which is found also, in a partially deviant text, in Isaiah 36–39’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476993X12450143">1984</xref>: 247). Similarly, Rowley states, ‘Much of this narrative stands also in Isaiah 36–37, and it is generally believed that it was taken by the compiler of the book of Isaiah from the account in Kings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476993X12450143">1963</xref>: 100). Countless scholars share the same view.</p>
<p>Given this assumption, scholars have naturally focused on 2 Kings 18–20 when attempting to answer questions regarding both the <italic>composition of the text itself</italic> as well as the <italic>text’s historical veracity</italic>. Since Isaiah 36–39 is simply considered to have been copied from 2 Kings 18–20, exegetical questions concerning it are usually limited to nothing more than <italic>its placement within the book of Isaiah</italic>. It is to the traditional exegetical treatment of both of these texts that we now turn.</p>
<p>The determination that 2 Kings 18–20 held priority over Isaiah 36–39 has yielded a number of problems regarding 2 Kings 18–20 itself. The first problem is that of 2 Kgs 18.14-16, which tells of Hezekiah’s <italic>capitulation</italic> to Sennacherib. In contrast, the rest of the narrative recounts Y<sc>hwh</sc>’s <italic>miraculous deliverance</italic> of Jerusalem from the threat of Sennacherib. According to Gesenius (as per Seitz’s discussion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X12450143">1991</xref>: 48-51), it was this very problem that the writer of Isaiah tried to smooth out by omitting 2 Kgs 18.14-16 and jumping directly from 18.13 (Isa. 36.1) to 18.17 (Isa. 36.2). Childs gives a slightly different explanation when he says, ‘Because v. 13 has a parallel in Isa. 36.1, the suggestion has been made that v. 13 was originally connected to v. 17, and that vv. 14-16 are an insertion which was not in the manuscript copied by Isaiah’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X12450143">1967</xref>: 70).</p>
<p>In any case, 2 Kgs 18.14-16 (labeled by scholars as ‘Account A’) was deemed to be the most historical of the material in 2 Kings 18–20 because it seemed to coincide with what we are told about Sennacherib’s invasion in the Assyrian annals. As Childs states, ‘Both sources are agreed upon the capture of the Judaean countryside, the capitulation of Hezekiah without an assault on the city, and, in general, on the terms of the tribute’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X12450143">1967</xref>: 72). Therefore, because 2 Kgs 18.14-16 is ‘verified’ by the Assyrian annals, scholars have taken it to be the historically reliable account. By contrast, the extended narrative of Sennacherib’s failure to take Jerusalem in 2 Kgs 18.17–19.37 (labeled by scholars as ‘Account B’), since it was not verified by Sennacherib’s own account of his campaign into Judah, was deemed to be nothing more than a theologically-charged and highly legendary account that was not historically reliable. Virtually every scholar who has covered the material in 2 Kings 18–20 has addressed this issue (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X12450143">Chavalas 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X12450143">Childs 1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476993X12450143">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476993X12450143">Cogan 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X12450143">Hess 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476993X12450143">Jenkins 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X12450143">Na’aman 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476993X12450143">Rowley 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X12450143">Seitz 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476993X12450143">Sweeney 2007</xref>: 411-18).</p>
<p>In regard to 2 Kgs 18.17–19.37, Childs points out that Stade carried the argument further, claiming that Account B was actually a combination of two sources: B<sup>1</sup> (18.17–19.9a) and B<sup>2</sup> (19.9b-37). He based this assertion on what he believed to be evidence of a redactor’s seam in 19.9, namely, the expression בשָׁיָּוַ (‘he returned’). This expression, Stade argued, seemed to function as a logical beginning for B<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X12450143">Childs 1967</xref>: 73). Once this division was made, it was noticed that B<sup>1</sup> and B<sup>2</sup> paralleled each other in both structure and content. Therefore, this further convinced scholars of the existence of two separate sources, for it did not make sense to scholars that a single account would repeat itself to the extent found in the Sennacherib account.</p>
<p>Stade’s division of Account B, however, yielded two further problems. First, at the very place where Stade detected a seam in the text, there is a textual variant: where 2 Kgs 19.9b reads בשָׁיָּוַ (‘he returned’), Isa. 37.9b reads עמַשְׁיּׅוַ (‘he heard’). What further complicates matters is, as Childs notes, in 4QIs<sup>a</sup> <italic>both</italic> variants are retained, reading ‘he heard and he returned’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X12450143">1967</xref>: 75). Although this fact potentially weakens Stade’s claim, its implications are largely ignored by scholars who subscribe to the theory that there are two separate accounts of B<sup>1</sup> and B<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The second problem with dividing Account B into two separate accounts is that neither account makes any sense on its own. Rowley notes that in B<sup>1</sup> Isaiah predicts that Sennacherib would return home upon hearing a ‘report of trouble’ (2 Kgs 19.7), but in B<sup>2</sup> not only is there no mention of this, but there is instead the statement regarding the disaster in Sennacherib’s camp (2 Kgs 19.35; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476993X12450143">1963</xref>: 103). Rowley reasons, therefore, ‘Since in neither account is it stated that the retirement of Sennacherib was brought about by a report of trouble elsewhere, there is no reason to suppose that Isaiah’s prophecy of deliverance by that means was fulfilled’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476993X12450143">1963</xref>: 103-104). Of course, as will be addressed later, Rowley’s conclusions are flawed in two respects. First, 2 Kgs 19.7 does <italic>not</italic> say the report Sennacherib would hear would be one ‘of trouble’. Although this is simply assumed by many scholars, Smelik shows that it is a complete misreading of the text. Second, again as Smelik shows, narratives typically do not make much sense when they are cut in half. The first half will obviously not have a conclusion and the second half’s conclusion will be missing a major portion of the narrative that leads up to that conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">Smelik 1986</xref>: 76-81).</p>
<p>The fact that 2 Kgs 19.36-37 is needed as an ending in <italic>both</italic> accounts, B<sup>1</sup> and B<sup>2</sup>, also does not make sense. Childs admits this when he says:<disp-quote>
<p>B<sup>1</sup> needs both a destination for Sennacherib’s return in 9b as well as a setting for his death in v. 37. B<sup>2</sup> requires not only Yahweh’s successful defense of the city (predicted in v. 32), but also the return of the Assyrian king to his own land (predicted in v. 33) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X12450143">1967</xref>: 75).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To resolve <italic>this</italic> problem, Duhm argued that 2 Kgs 19.33 is a secondary addition to the original text. Not only is it unusual to find the phrase הוָֽהיְ<sup>–</sup>םאֻנְ (an oracle of Y<sc>hwh</sc>) within the book of Kings (though it should be noted that such a phrase is commonplace in Isaiah), but also, verse 33 is a composite of 19.28b and 32a, and stands in tension with the complete destruction of the Assyrians described in 19.35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476993X12450143">1914</xref>: 247).</p>
<p>In addition to the scholarly attempts to explain the apparent textual difficulties in 2 Kgs 18.17–19.37, there are two other issues stemming from the foundational claim that 2 Kings 18–20 holds priority over Isaiah 36–39: (1) the date of composition of the text, and (2) the purpose and function of the text within the respective works of 2 Kings and Isaiah. In regard to the question of the date of composition, the traditional historical-critical view is that 2 Kings 18–20 was interwoven from Accounts A, B<sup>1</sup> and B<sup>2</sup>, sometime during the exile, when the books of 1 and 2 Kings were composed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476993X12450143">Ackroyd 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X12450143">Childs 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X12450143">Clements 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476993X12450143">Rowley 1963</xref>). It was then later copied, slightly modified, and inserted into the text of Isaiah to function as a ‘bridge’ between the eighth-century <sc>bce</sc> collection of ‘Proto-Isaiah’ and the exilic/post-exilic writings of ‘Deutero-Isaiah’.</p>
<p>Yet, what about the date and purpose of the writing of the ‘original’ Accounts B<sup>1</sup> and B<sup>2</sup> in 2 Kgs 18.37–19.37? Clements argued that these legendary accounts were written during the time of Josiah with the purpose of inspiring him to rebel against Assyria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X12450143">1980</xref>: 53). It was only later on during the exile when the legendary accounts of B<sup>1</sup> and B<sup>2</sup> were crudely cobbled together with Account A within 2 Kings. However, given the ‘obvious’ conflicting accounts between A and B<sup>1</sup>/B<sup>2</sup> in 2 Kings 18–20, it is believed that the redactor of Isaiah lifted out only the legendary material to insert into Isaiah because he wanted to portray Hezekiah in the best possible light. Regardless of when precisely Accounts B<sup>1</sup> and B<sup>2</sup> were written, there are two things upon which most scholars agree: (1) they were written long after the actual events of 701 <sc>bce</sc>, and (2) they were essentially nothing more than ‘Pro-Hezekiah’ propaganda that had no real historical value. As Ackroyd has stated, ‘The text, both in Isaiah and 2 Kings, clearly implies a quite … historically inaccurate view, namely that Judah was totally delivered from Assyrian power. Hezekiah seems to have had a better press than he deserved’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476993X12450143">1984</xref>: 257).</p>
<p>The final exegetical issue regarding 2 Kings 18–20/Isaiah 36–39 that scholars have wrestled with concerns the accounts of Hezekiah’s illness (2 Kgs 20.1-11/Isa. 38) and the visit from the Babylon envoys (2 Kgs 20.12-19/Isa. 39). As many scholars have pointed out, these events in 2 Kings 20/Isaiah 38–39 are clearly out of chronological order. Both episodes would have taken place before Sennacherib’s invasion in 701 <sc>bce</sc>, and before the accounts in 1 Kings 18–19/Isaiah 36–37. The obvious exegetical question, therefore, is ‘Why have these two episodes been deliberately placed after the account of Sennacherib’s invasion?’ Concerning the redaction of Isaiah, scholars argue that the account of the Babylonian envoys in Isaiah 39 leads nicely into the prophetic call in Isaiah 40 for the Jews in exile to come out of Babylon. Simply put, these episodes were intentionally placed out of chronological sequence, in order to act as a bridge between Proto-Isaiah and Deutero-Isaiah.</p>
<p>This clear evidence of redaction has caused many scholars to argue that the material in Isaiah 36–39 is the product of a much later time than the events they record. Any connections between Isaiah 36–39 and Isaiah 1–35, therefore, are viewed by many scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476993X12450143">Ackroyd 1982</xref>: 6-7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476993X12450143">Childs 2001</xref>: 264-66) as rather artificial attempts by later redactors driven by their own theological agendas. What ‘really happened’ in 701 <sc>bce</sc>, according to these scholars, is that in the face of certain destruction at the hands of Sennacherib, Hezekiah simply paid tribute to Sennacherib, as seen in 2 Kgs 18.13-16, in order to avert the destruction of Jerusalem. Contrary to 2 Kgs 18.17–19.37/Isaiah 36–37, there was no glorious and miraculous sparing of Jerusalem by Y<sc>hwh</sc>. Hezekiah actually survived by the skin of his teeth. Not surprisingly, this traditional historical-critical view of 2 Kings 18–19/Isaiah 36–37, being based on the assumption that the 2 Kings account(s) hold priority over Isaiah, has led to a very different depiction of both Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah from that found in the Bible.</p>

<title>3. The Cracks in the Building and a Foundation of Shifting Sand</title>
<p>In response to the historical-critical scholarly work on 2 Kings 18–20/Isaiah 36–39, recent scholars have raised serious questions. After all, one <italic>should</italic> be suspicious of any exegetical line of reasoning that not only is buoyed by countless speculative assumptions, but also whose ultimate conclusion about any given text is the exact opposite of what that text puts forth. One only has to ask some fundamental questions regarding the traditional historical-critical stance on the relationship between 2 Kings 18–20 and Isaiah 36–39 in order to see just how problematic these arguments are.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that a number of scholars have recently begun to question the stability of the house that Gesenius built, and have argued that the entire edifice is built on shifting sand. Instead of a clear explanation of a coherent text, the historical-critical method has given us hypothetical speculation regarding supposed sources, dissecting them beyond recognition. Having dissected the text, scholars employing historical-critical method then go on to complain that the text has no coherent meaning. Scholars then attempt to reassemble the disjointed parts according to what they assume ‘must have really happened’. How they can know what ‘must have really happened’ is problematic, since they have just taken a scalpel to the only text that gives witness to that history.</p>
<p>An example of this line of thought can be seen in the work of Clements. He argues that the original material of 2 Kgs 18.17–19.37 is a legendary version of Sennacherib’s invasion that was composed during the reign of Josiah in order to encourage the Judeans at that time to revolt against Assyria. He goes on to say that Isaiah 36–39 was taken from the 2 Kings account only after Isaiah 40–55 was written, and that it was inserted into its present position to act as a transitional bridge between Proto-Isaiah and Deutero-Isaiah (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476993X12450143">1982</xref>: 120-21). The material, therefore, cannot be considered to be related to the original work of Isaiah. His views regarding 2 Kings 18–20/Isaiah 36–39 have tremendous implications for the way in which he interprets the book of Proto-Isaiah, as well as the reign of Hezekiah.</p>
<p>What really happened, according to Clements, was that Isaiah had condemned Hezekiah’s attempt to rebel against Sennacherib, and the resulting invasion was a complete disaster for Judah. Clements attempts to prove his theory by pointing to passages such as Isa. 30.1-5 and 31.1-3 wherein Isaiah condemns the ‘rebellious children’ of Y<sc>hwh</sc> for making an alliance with Egypt. He dates these passages to 705 <sc>bce</sc> and claims them as evidence that Isaiah thoroughly condemned and disapproved of Hezekiah’s rebellion against Assyria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X12450143">1980</xref>: 31).</p>
<p>What is perplexing about Clements’s arguments, though, is how selective he is when referencing passages in Isaiah. For example, Clements interprets Isa. 31.4, ‘the Lord of hosts will come down to fight upon Mount Zion and upon its hill’, as saying that Y<sc>hwh</sc> will come and fight <italic>against</italic> Jerusalem if Hezekiah rebels against Assyria. Yet, he completely ignores the rest of the prophecy in 31.5-9, which clearly says that Y<sc>hwh</sc> will protect Jerusalem, and that the Assyrians will fall by the sword ‘not of humans’. Circumventing such a plain reading of the text, he conveniently argues that 31.5-9 is a later redaction that was inserted into the text during the time of Josiah (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X12450143">1980</xref>: 31).</p>
<p>The ultimate flaw in Clements’s work is that he begins with the assumption that Isaiah 1–39 is a random collection of prophecies from the time of Isaiah of Jerusalem, intermingled with later redactions from either the time of Josiah or the exile, with no unifying literary structure whatsoever. The result is that everything is up for grabs. Clements’s criterion regarding what passage was written when is based solely on what he assumes the historical Isaiah ‘must have really said’, <italic>regardless of what the text itself might put forth</italic>. Consequently, when he concludes that (a) Isaiah <italic>really</italic> condemned Hezekiah’s rebellion against Assyria, and (b) Isaiah <italic>really</italic> viewed Sennacherib’s invasion as a complete disaster for Judah, Clements is basing his conclusions, not on the biblical text itself, but rather on his own reconstruction of the events, taken from isolated passages torn from their literary context.</p>
<p>We use Clements’s work as a mere example of a problem that has plagued modern biblical studies for some time: the attempt to do biblical exegesis while, at the same time, showing little or no confidence in the biblical text’s historical reliability or literary coherence. Often, this results in arguments that are built on shifting sand. If one comes to a biblical text already assuming that (a) the text cannot be trusted to relate real history, and (b) the text is a jumbled literary mess, then one’s ‘exegesis’ is going to be based, not on the text, but rather on one’s own assumptions and biases. If we are to assume anything, should we not assume that the biblical writer is trying to relate real historical events, and that he is also a competent writer who has the ability to compose a coherent work? In other words, we must respect the biblical text. This is precisely what more recent scholars are attempting to do.</p>

<title>4. The Proposed Renovations</title>
<p>Given the instability of the house that Gesenius built, scholars are suggesting certain renovations. These renovations cover four general areas: (a) the issue of the priority of either 2 Kings 18–20 or Isaiah 36–39, (b) the issue of the literary unity of the material in 2 Kgs 18.17–19.37/Isaiah 36–37, (c) the issue of the date of composition of the material in 2 Kings 18–20/Isaiah 36–39, and (d) the issue of the historical reliability of the biblical account of Sennacherib’s invasion in 2 Kgs 18.17–19.37/Isaiah 36–37. These issues obviously overlap and influence each other, but for the sake of this article, we will tackle each issue one at a time.</p>
<sec id="section5-1476993X12450143">
<title>The Priority of Isaiah 36–39 over 2 Kings 18–20</title>
<p>As we have seen, the assumption that 2 Kings 18–20 holds priority over Isaiah 36–39 has led to more exegetical confusion than clarity. In response to this, Smelik has proposed that Isaiah 36–39 actually holds priority over 2 Kings 18–20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">1986</xref>: 71-74). Whereas Gesenius had argued that the long Sennacherib narrative did not seem to fit within Isaiah (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">Smelik 1986</xref>: 71), Smelik argues that the Sennacherib narrative does not fit into the context of 2 Kings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">1986</xref>: 72), since nowhere else in Kings does any prophet from among the books of the Latter Prophets appear in a 2 Kings narrative. Smelik points out that there are a number of narrative sections in the book of Isaiah that focus on the prophet Isaiah. Isaiah 7 contains a narrative in which Isaiah confronts Ahaz during the Syro-Ephraimite Crisis, and Isaiah 20 tells of the time during the Ashdod campaign, when Isaiah went naked through the streets of Jerusalem for three years. Given the placement of these narratives in Isaiah (the beginning of Assyrian dominance, and a major military campaign in the middle of Assyria’s dominance in the region), it should not be surprising to find a third narrative in Isaiah that tells of a major defeat of Assyria by the hand of Y<sc>hwh</sc>.</p>
<p>In addition to Smelik’s argument, the basic rules of textual criticism also point to the likelihood of Isaiah 36–39 being the original text. According to Hayes and Holladay, three basic rules must be taken into consideration when evaluating textual variants: (a) the more difficult reading is to be preferred, for ‘the more difficult reading is more likely to have given rise to the simpler reading’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476993X12450143">2007</xref>: 43); (b) the shorter reading is to be preferred, for it has been found that ‘scribes, as a general rule, tended to make additions to the text rather than delete elements from it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476993X12450143">2007</xref>: 43); and (c) ‘a reading that helps explain the origin of the other readings is probably more original’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476993X12450143">2007</xref>: 43). When these three rules are applied to the comparison of the two texts of Isaiah 36–39 and 2 Kings 18–20, it becomes quite clear that it is more likely that Isaiah 36–39 is the original text.</p>
<p>First of all, there is 2 Kgs 18.1-12, a section unique to 2 Kings that tells of the fall of Samaria during the reign of Hezekiah. This account is clearly in the mold of how other kings throughout 2 Kings are summarized—it is shaped according to the Deutronomist’s view of the history of Israel. Bad kings break covenant with Y<sc>hwh</sc> and good kings keep covenant with Y<sc>hwh</sc>. Secondly, 2 Kgs 18.14-16, which tells about Hezekiah’s payment of tribute to the king of Assyria in an attempt to spare Jerusalem, is also unique to 2 Kings. This, too, resembles other passages in 2 Kgs 16.7-8; 17.3; 23.35 where kings of Judah make payment to threatening invaders. Finally, there are the variants found in the 2 Kings account of Sennacherib’s invasion that can only be described as minor elaborations on the Isaiah narrative. For example, one could see why, in 2 Kgs 18.36, the writer would elaborate on Isa. 36.21, and clarify that the ‘they’ in Isa. 36.21 is a reference to ‘the people’ as a whole, and not just Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah. However, it would not make sense for the writer of Isaiah to take a clear reference to ‘the people’ in 2 Kgs 18.36, yet make it more ambiguous in Isa. 36.21. Other examples of textual additions found in the 2 Kings text are: (a) Isa. 36.2-3/2 Kgs 18.17-18; (b) Isa. 36.7/2 Kgs 18.22; (c) Isa. 36.11/2 Kgs 18.26; (d) Isa. 36.14/2 Kgs 18.29; (e) Isa. 36.17/2 Kgs 18.32; (f) Isa. 36.21/2 Kgs 18.36; (g) Isa. 37.4/2 Kgs 19.4; (h) Isa. 37.9/2 Kgs 19.9; (i) Isa. 37.20/2 Kgs 19.19; (j) Isa. 37.25/2 Kgs 19.24; (k) Isa. 37.36/2 Kgs 19.35.</p>
<p>From these observations, I would argue that it seems much more likely that the writer of 2 Kings got the material found in 18.1-12 and 18.14-16 from an earlier source, probably that of the Annals of the Kings of Judah, and then incorporated the material from Isaiah 36–39 into his narrative about Hezekiah. Additional evidence for this is seen in the fact that the writer of Chronicles clearly makes mention of a ‘book of Isaiah’ in 2 Chron. 32.32, when he writes that the other events in Hezekiah’s reign ‘are recorded in the visions of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel’. This ‘book of the kings of Judah and Israel’ is probably the source that the writer of Kings also refers to in his work. More importantly, though, this shows that since Isaiah in some form (i.e. Proto-Isaiah) was circulated in the exilic community along with the royal annals of Judah, an early form of Isaiah was most likely composed before the exile.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Sennacherib account in 2 Chronicles shares the same basic storyline as Isaiah 36–37. This is further indication that the pre-exilic Proto-Isaiah already contained the account of Sennacherib’s invasion found in Isaiah 36–37. Hence, the material in Isaiah 36–39, though probably <italic>shaped</italic> by the exilic community to act as a literary bridge to Isaiah 40–66, was nevertheless <italic>already present</italic> in the Proto-Isaiah text. The reason for this could very well be that the story of Hezekiah was already so important within Jewish history that the writer felt it was important to give extra attention to Hezekiah within the book of Kings. Conversely, if one argues that Isaiah had copied from the book of Kings, one must then explain why he not only chose not to include 2 Kgs 18.1-12, but also why he chose to use 18.13, exclude 2 Kgs 18.14-16, and then pick up the story again at 18.17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X12450143">Anderson and Venter 2009</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a final piece of textual evidence that points toward the primacy of Isaiah 36–39 are the twin episodes of Hezekiah’s illness and the visit from the envoys of Babylon in Isaiah 38–39. Since these chapters are clearly out of chronological order, many scholars have concluded that they act as an ‘editorial bridge’ between Proto- and Deutero-Isaiah. As Walton states,<disp-quote>
<p>Speaking hypothetically, if chapters 40–66 had not originally been part of the oracles of Isaiah, that truncated First Isaiah would have had no reason to have the chronological reversal. The reversal only becomes meaningful when chapter 39 introduces chapters 40–66 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476993X12450143">1985</xref>: 130).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Smelik points to this fact to argue that these chapters are a key element in the literary structure of Isaiah (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">1986</xref>: 72-73). One can see why Proto-Isaiah would be concluded with the narrative about the envoys from Babylon, yet there is no logical reason why the book of Kings, a narrative that chronologically takes us through the reigns of the kings of both Israel and Judah, would place this episode so clearly out of chronological order. Therefore, the placement of Isaiah 38–39 within Isaiah, along with all the other evidence put forth by Smelik, leads one to conclude that the traditional assumptions surrounding the priority of 2 Kings 18–20 over Isaiah 36–39 are wrong, and that priority lies with Isaiah 36–39.</p>

<title>The Literary Unity of 2 Kgs 18.17–19.37/Isaiah 36–37</title>
<p>The next area in which recent scholars are questioning the traditional historical-critical perspective on the biblical account of Sennacherib’s invasion concerns its literary unity. In contrast to the long-accepted ‘two-source hypothesis’ of B<sup>1</sup> and B<sup>2</sup>, Smelik presents a convincing case that the Sennacherib account, far from being the stitched-together work of a clumsy redactor, is in reality a finely woven literary tapestry that uses repetition as a literary device. ‘Repetition’, Smelik argues, ‘is a common phenomenon in biblical narrative’, and such repetition ‘need not indicate a combination of earlier sources’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">1986</xref>: 76). Smelik makes his argument by pointing to a number of examples of three-fold repetition in the Sennacherib account.</p>
<p>Although Stade views Sennacherib’s letter as simply a duplicate of the Rabshakeh’s two earlier speeches and therefore assigns it to Account B<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476993X12450143">1886</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">Smelik 1986</xref>: 74-76), Smelik points out the three-fold nature of the Assyrian taunts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">1986</xref>: 78-81). In the Rabshakeh’s first speech, he tries to convince Hezekiah that he has no one to rely on; in the Rabshakeh’s second speech, he tries to separate the people of Judah from their king; and in Sennacherib’s letter, he tries to separate Hezekiah from Y<sc>hwh</sc> and ends up blaspheming by calling Y<sc>hwh</sc> a deceiver. Smelik’s point is that, ‘these three messages are not duplicates: each has its own function in the narrative and together they enhance the suspense in the narrative: will the Assyrian king taunt the Living God with impunity?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">1986</xref>: 81).</p>
<p>Along similar lines, Smelik addresses Isaiah’s three oracles in Isa. 37.6-7, 37.22-29, and 37.33-35, arguing that each is vital to understanding the overall structure of the narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">1986</xref>: 82-85). Smelik first discusses the initial oracle in 37.6-7, in which Y<sc>hwh</sc> says that he will ‘put a spirit’ in Sennacherib, and that Sennacherib will ‘hear something to hear’, return to his land, and then fall by the sword. Most translations of Isa. 37.7 read, ‘he will hear a rumor’; however, Smelik points out that the Hebrew, ע׭ַקָׁו העָוּמשְׁ is more accurately ‘hear something to hear’. One sees the verbal connection between the two words in Hebrew, but such a connection is lost in translation.</p>
<p>This ambiguous oracle presents a number of questions the reader must wait to have answered. It does not take long, though, for the reader to understand what kind of ‘spirit’ Y<sc>hwh</sc> will put in Sennacherib. This ‘spirit’ is not so much a spirit of panic as it is a spirit of pride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">1986</xref>: 83). We know this, Smelik argues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">1986</xref>: 74-75), because of what comes next in 37.8-9: a three-fold repetition of the phrase ‘he heard’, the last of which Stade ironically characterized as a ‘seam’ between Accounts B<sup>1</sup> and B<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476993X12450143">1886</xref>: 172-79). In 37.8, we find that the Rabshakeh ‘heard’ that Sennacherib had left Lachish to fight against Libnah. Why did Sennacherib do this? We learn in 37.9 that Sennacherib had ‘heard’ that King Tirhakah had come out to fight against him. We are further told that <italic>when</italic> Sennacherib ‘heard’ about this move by King Tirhakah, he sent messengers to Hezekiah with a letter in which he further threatens Hezekiah with the third message.</p>
<p>Stade and Childs, by assuming that there is a ‘seam’ in Isa. 37.9b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X12450143">Childs 1967</xref>: 73-76; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476993X12450143">Stade 1886</xref>), would have us think that when Sennacherib ‘heard’ about the Egyptian threat (in the B<sup>1</sup> account), he was filled with a spirit of panic and ‘returned’ to his own land, only to be killed later (37.37-38). This would seem quite an odd move on the part of Sennacherib, since the Rabshakeh had mocked Egypt’s ability to help Hezekiah earlier (36.6, 9). Consequently, the historical-critical reading of B<sup>1</sup> simply does not make sense. Yet, if taken as a literary unity, the picture becomes quite clear. Smelik argues:<disp-quote>
<p>Instead of withdrawing, Sennacherib continues to taunt the Living God. It is not the Egyptian ally who will silence the Assyrian king, but the Lord Himself, as appears only at the very end of the narrative. By supposing that in the first account the news of Tirhakah’s arrival ended Sennacherib’s attack, Stade actually walked into the trap the author has set for the reader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">1986</xref>: 77).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By the end of the narrative, we see precisely how this first oracle has been fulfilled. Y<sc>hwh</sc> was able to use the very Egyptian alliance which Isaiah had earlier condemned to ignite a spirit of pride and arrogance on Sennacherib’s part, which caused him to further taunt Y<sc>hwh</sc>, ultimately leading to his humiliation and death.</p>
<p>The second oracle in Isa. 37.22-29, in which Y<sc>hwh</sc> condemns Sennacherib’s arrogance, not only builds on the first oracle and Sennacherib’s taunting letter to Hezekiah, but also looks forward to Sennacherib’s humiliating failure. Finally, the third oracle found in 37.33-35 elaborates on the second oracle by specifically saying that Sennacherib’s army would not even shoot an arrow into Jerusalem, let alone enter it, and that he would return on the way by which he came. The reason for this would not be because of some spectacular military defense by Hezekiah or Tirhakah or any other human king; rather, Y<sc>hwh</sc> himself would defend Jerusalem. Since all three oracles find their fulfillment in Isa. 37.36-38, Smelik argues that ‘it is impossible to divide these verses into two strands without serious exegetical loss’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">1986</xref>: 84-85). If it can be shown that the Sennacherib account in Isaiah 36–37 actually fits together as a coherent narrative, the notion of two accounts, based on a supposed redactor’s ‘seam’ with a single ending somehow acting as a conclusion to both accounts, simply seems unwarranted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1476993X12450143">
<title>The Date of Composition of Isaiah 36–39</title>
<p>The third area of scholarly renovation is that of the date of composition of the original text of Isaiah 36–39. Now, there is universal agreement that 1 and 2 Kings, the work of the Deuteronomistic historian, was compiled during the exile. The historical-critical view has therefore been that: (a) Accounts B1 and B2 were legendary accounts that were written some time before, possibly, as Clements would have us believe, during the reign of Josiah (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X12450143">1980</xref>: 53); and (b) Isaiah 36–39 was thus taken from 2 Kings 18–20 and placed as a bridge between Proto-Isaiah and Deutero-Isaiah sometime after the exile, long after the time of Hezekiah. Yet, if priority lies with Isaiah 36–39, the date of its composition would have occurred anywhere between the actual events of 701 <sc>bce</sc> and the fall of Jerusalem in 587 <sc>bce</sc>.</p>
<p>One thing that helps determine the date of the composition of a text is a plausible historical reconstruction of the events that would have led to its composition. As we saw earlier, Clements’s proposal that Isaiah 36–39 was composed during the time of Josiah is highly doubtful. An alternate proposal may be seen in the work of Seitz, who has built upon Smelik’s work. In his book, <italic>Zion’s Final Destiny</italic>, Seitz puts forth his views regarding the questions surrounding Isaiah 36–39 and their form and function within the book of Isaiah. His views can be summarized as follows:</p>
<list id="list3-1476993X12450143" list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>Isaiah 36–39 has its historical roots within the reign of Hezekiah (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X12450143">1991</xref>: 95).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The initial recording and formation of these chapters might have very well happened during the reign of Manasseh, shortly after the reign of Hezekiah, during the later years of the prophet Isaiah himself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X12450143">1991</xref>: 61).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The purpose of these chapters was to bring to a close the recording of the prophetic career of Isaiah by highlighting the fulfillment of Isaiah’s Immanuel prophecies and thus vindicating Isaiah as a true prophet of Y<sc>hwh</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X12450143">1991</xref>: 147).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Both Proto-Isaiah and 2 Kings used an earlier common source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X12450143">1991</xref>: 141).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Later scribal exegetes of the exilic/post-exilic period re-shaped and edited Proto-Isaiah’s concluding chapters of 36–39 to look forward to Isaiah 40–66 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X12450143">1991</xref>: 208; compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12450143">Smelik 1986</xref>: 85).</p></list-item></list>
<p>Seitz crystallizes his view regarding the priority of Isaiah 36–39 when he states that Isaiah 36–39:<disp-quote>
<p>is not a secondary embellishment from the post-exilic period, but is of a piece with 8.23–9.6, 11.1-10, and 32.1-8. In sum, a strong possibility exists that the initial editorial work on Isaiah traditions came not during the period of Josiah (who is never mentioned in the book), but during the reign of Hezekiah, at the end of Isaiah’s own lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X12450143">1991</xref>: 61).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Seitz’s proposal is, in fact, much more historically plausible than that of Clements. Clements would have us believe that the Sennacherib narrative was written a mere seventy years after a supposed humiliating disaster for Hezekiah, to essentially function as a ‘pep talk’ intended to inspire Josiah to rebel against Assyria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X12450143">1980</xref>: 51). If it really was the national disaster Clements believes it to have been, it simply strains credibility to suggest that Josiah would be so ignorant of his own country’s recent history that he would have fallen for such a fanciful story.</p>
<p>Seitz’s proposal, on the other hand, not only respects the text itself, but also seriously takes into account what would have been the immediate fallout in Judah shortly after the events in question. Although it is clear that Sennacherib did not take Jerusalem, he obviously decimated much of Judah—both his own annals and Isa. 36.1 attest to this. In light of the fact that Hezekiah had issued major religious reforms and had tried to stamp out all pagan practices in Judah, Sennacherib’s invasion would have been interpreted in one of two different ways. Some would have viewed Hezekiah as a foolish king who had invited destruction by relying solely on Y<sc>hwh</sc>, angering the gods and their high places, and rebelling against Sennacherib. This was clearly the perspective of Manasseh, for he re-established the pagan practices his father had outlawed, and, according to tradition, even killed Isaiah.</p>
<p>By contrast, those faithful to Y<sc>hwh</sc> would have interpreted the salvation of Jerusalem as proof that Isaiah was a true prophet, Hezekiah was a righteous king, and Y<sc>hwh</sc> was the true God. In response to Manasseh’s actions, therefore, Isaianic scribes faithful to Y<sc>hwh</sc> would have collected Isaiah’s prophecies and shaped them around the two narratives of Isaiah 7 and Isaiah 36–39 in order to vindicate: (a) Isaiah’s prophetic career, (b) Hezekiah as a faithful and righteous king, and (c) Y<sc>hwh</sc> as the true God. Sennacherib’s failure to take Jerusalem would have been seen as a fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophesies during the Syro-Ephraimite crisis, described in Isaiah 7–12. Such a scenario would date Isaiah 36–39 to the early seventh century <sc>bce</sc>—shortly after Hezekiah’s death and Manasseh’s ascension to the throne, when opinion in Judah would have been divided over how to interpret Sennacherib’s invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X12450143">Anderson and Venter 2009</xref>: 5-7; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X12450143">Seitz 1991</xref>: 61).</p>

<title>The Historical Reliability of Isaiah 36–37</title>
<p>If Seitz is correct in dating the material in Isaiah 36–39 to shortly after the death of Hezekiah, it then becomes necessary to re-evaluate the traditional view that Isaiah 36–37 is nothing more than a later legendary account of Sennacherib’s invasion. There are essentially two reasons why scholars have considered these chapters to be unhistorical and legendary. First, there is the correlation between 2 Kgs 18.13-16 and the Assyrian annals as proof of its historical reliability. By contrast, 2 Kgs 18.17–19.37/Isaiah 36–37 are seen as revealing the bias of later redactors who were pushing their own theological agenda. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X12450143">Seitz (1991</xref>: 51) has pointed out that virtually every scholar, with the exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476993X12450143">Provan (1988</xref>: 122, n. 82) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476993X12450143">Hardmeier (1990)</xref>, holds this position. The second reason scholars doubt the account’s historical veracity is the ‘miracle’ in Isa. 37.36 regarding the salvation of Jerusalem, namely, the angel of Y<sc>hwh</sc> destroying 185,000 Assyrian soldiers. Due to its description of a miracle, this one verse taints the veracity of the entire passage in many scholars’ eyes. An example of this ‘anti-supernaturalist’ view is found in Clements, when he says, ‘our knowledge of history…shows us unmistakably that angels do not come from heaven to slay the enemy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X12450143">1980</xref>: 26). Childs disputes Clements’s claim, noting: ‘Clements’s naturalistic position assumes that the sole forces shaping historical events are controlled inexorably by the natural laws of cause and effect. Thus, one can simply deduce that any appeal to another force is a legendary elaboration, dictated by wishful thinking, mythical projection, or simplistic religious belief’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476993X12450143">2001</xref>: 276-77).</p>
<p>Such reasons, though, simply are not convincing. With regard to the belief that 2 Kgs 18.13-16 is more historically reliable because it corresponds to the Assyrian annals, the scholarly assumption that the biblical texts are theologically biased, whereas the Assyrian records are straightforward and objective, is deeply problematic. As Provan points out, <italic>both</italic> accounts are ideological accounts of the past that strive to interpret certain events from their particular point of view. By seeking to portray Hezekiah as a good king, Isaiah 36–37 is no more biased than the Assyrian annals, whose purpose is ‘to exalt the reputation of the king concerned, to glorify the gods of Assyria, especially Ashur, and to encourage loyalty and submission among his subjects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476993X12450143">2000</xref>: 311). Millard adds:<disp-quote>
<p>these compositions had to display the king’s accomplishments in the most glorious terms: he had to appear as a successful viceroy of the gods of Assyria, upholding their honor and power, obeying their commands, and so achieving victory over their common enemies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476993X12450143">1985</xref>: 65).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Contrary to the clear propaganda of Sennacherib, the biblical account of Hezekiah gives a very balanced, straightforward description of Sennacherib’s invasion by presenting both positives and negatives for Hezekiah. First, there are a number of passages in Isaiah that clearly condemn rebellion, as well as reliance on Egypt, both of which Hezekiah seemed to have done at some point in his reign (Isa. 30.1-3; 31.1-3; 36.2, 9). Second, the biblical account forthrightly tells how Sennacherib captured all of Judah’s fortified cities, and how, in light of this, many people in Jerusalem and the surrounding territory likely deserted Hezekiah after seeing what Sennacherib had done. Third, the episode concerning the envoys from Babylon highlights a major blunder on Hezekiah’s part (Isa. 39), in which he showed the envoys all the treasures in his storehouses. Nevertheless, the biblical account tells us that in 701 <sc>bce</sc>, when Sennacherib was on the verge of destroying Jerusalem, Hezekiah, despite his past flaws, displayed great faith in Y<sc>hwh</sc>, and thus Jerusalem was spared.</p>
<p>Although it is true that both accounts have an ‘agenda’, blindly accepting the Assyrian account as the objective one is truly naïve. The scholar must look at <italic>both</italic> accounts, and strive to reach balanced conclusions about the historical event described. When this is done, one can see that both accounts agree that: (a) Sennacherib invaded and took many fortified cities in Judah; (b) Sennacherib did at one point besiege Jerusalem, and Hezekiah seemed completely helpless; (c) the Egyptian army at some point appeared and was dealt with; and (d) Hezekiah eventually paid tribute to Sennacherib. Nothing in the larger biblical account contradicts any of these four points. The only glaring difference, not surprisingly, is the conclusion to the matter. Nevertheless, one thing is clear: Sennacherib never took Jerusalem. Although he boasted that Hezekiah sent him tribute once he had returned to Nineveh, Sennacherib emphasized the capture of Lachish, making the Lachish Room in Nineveh ‘the focus of the whole section of the palace’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476993X12450143">Millard 1985</xref>: 68).</p>
<p>There is good reason to be suspicious of Sennacherib’s version of events. Why did Hezekiah send him tribute, not outside Jerusalem, not at Lachish, but only after Sennacherib had returned to Nineveh? Why did Sennacherib highlight the siege at Lachish and conveniently push Jerusalem to the background? Why, if Hezekiah was the rebel ruler and instigator of the revolt, did Sennacherib choose to leave him on the throne, only requiring tribute? Laato points out that the list of tribute sent by Hezekiah was meant to ‘give the impression that [Sennacherib’s] campaign in Judah had been successfully concluded, even though Hezekiah, the main rebel, was not dethroned’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X12450143">1995</xref>: 218). Indeed, Sennacherib’s account certainly is ‘less straightforward than it may appear when read in isolation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476993X12450143">Millard 1985</xref>: 72).</p>
<p>The second reason why scholars discount Isaiah 36–37, declaring it legendary, centers on the claim that an angel of Y<sc>hwh</sc> killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers. How could anyone believe that a literal angel came down and slaughtered 185,000 soldiers? Perhaps a better question would be, ‘Why can’t we allow the writer to use a certain amount of creative license in the telling of the story?’ One thing is clear: <italic>something</italic> happened that caused Sennacherib to abandon his siege of Jerusalem, whether it be a plague or something else. Whatever it was, the writer of Isaiah interpreted this ‘something’ as an act of God, and couched it in terms that would be accepted by his readers. The end result was that Hezekiah stayed on his throne, and Jerusalem was delivered. Must there have been a literal angel who killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers in order for scholars to give credence to this story? No. Does this mean we must dismiss the <italic>entire account</italic> as legendary and unhistorical? Of course not. All it means is that we need to have common sense and be able to recognize literary artistry when it appears in a text that treats historical events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476993X12450143">Anderson 2008</xref>: 193-94).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Although the work of Smelik and Seitz has not, in many scholars’ eyes, brought about the ‘Fall of the House of Gesenius’, it certainly has exposed some cracks in the foundation. Although Childs ultimately remains unconvinced that (a) Isaiah 36–39 holds priority over 2 Kings 18–20, and (b) Isaiah 36–37 is a ‘unified account of one literary piece’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476993X12450143">Childs 2001</xref>: 262), he does acknowledge that the work of Smelik and Seitz ‘has offered a major contribution because it has successfully demonstrated the complexity of the problem, which had previously not been adequately recognized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476993X12450143">Childs 2001</xref>: 262). When it comes to the specific issue of the interplay between diachronic and synchronic approaches, Childs states:<disp-quote>
<p>In my opinion…literary coherence on the synchronic level in itself cannot be used to refute in principle the presence of sources on the diachronic level. Yet Smelik and Seitz have correctly observed that the older source analysis did not take seriously the synchronic dimension of the final form of the text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476993X12450143">2001</xref>: 263).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite his disagreement with their ultimate arguments, Childs has modified his own views regarding Isaiah 36–39/2 Kings 18–20, in that he no longer sees B<sup>1</sup> and B<sup>2</sup> as two independent literary sources, but rather as redactional layers. Furthermore, Childs parts ways with many other scholars in that he believes Account B holds a ‘preexilic component’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476993X12450143">2001</xref>: 264).</p>
<p>Regarding Childs’s assertion that the proven literary coherence of Isaiah 36–37/2 Kings 18–19 does not refute the traditional diachronic claim of the two separate accounts of B<sup>1</sup> and B<sup>2</sup>, I would simply have to disagree. Not only is the two-source theory based on a problematic ‘redactor’s seam’ in 2 Kgs 19.9b, but Smelik has clearly shown that the Sennacherib narrative displays what we may call a ‘literary irreducible complexity’, in which neither supposed source makes any literary sense without the other. Given those literary facts, along with the textual gymnastics historical-critical scholars have employed in order to make sense of the supposed two accounts of B<sup>1</sup> and B<sup>2</sup>, the textual evidence favors Smelik. In any case, there is no doubt that the debate will continue—and that is the way it should be.</p>
<p>What, in fact, we are witnessing—both in the work of both Smelik and Seitz, as well as in re-evaluations of scholars like Childs—is an evolution within biblical studies. Over the past two hundred years, the landscape in biblical studies has been dominated by the diachronic methods of traditional historical criticism, and those methods have unearthed countless insights into both the history of the ancient biblical world and the composition of the Bible itself. Nevertheless, historical-critical scholars have often been so zealous to dissect biblical texts that they have forgotten how to read them. That is why, as Childs rightly acknowledges, the work of Smelik and Seitz is so important. Far from promoting some sort of post-modern, ahistorical reading of the biblical text, Smelik and Seitz are making the case that a synchronic reading of these texts as literary wholes plays a vital role <italic>alongside</italic> the traditional diachronic methods in the exegesis of those texts. Simply put, a synchronic reading of each biblical text shines light into the darkness of certain blind spots within traditional diachronic methods. As this debate regarding Isaiah 36–39/2 Kings 18–20 has shown, it is simply taking time for scholarly eyes to adjust.</p>
<p>The task of exegesis should be to come to a clearer understanding of Israelite history and literature <italic>through</italic> the biblical texts, not <italic>despite</italic> them. Therefore, we must always remember that any given biblical work not only has a history, but is also a literary work. The authors wrote to address crucial historical events and issues, and therefore, we must do our best to understand those historic circumstances, oftentimes through various historical-critical methods. At the same time, though, these works have come to us in the form of biblical books, and therefore we must strive to understand the literary language and structure of these books. Just as one needs two eyes to gain true depth perception and better vision, the biblical scholar needs to employ the use of both diachronic and synchronic lenses in order to come to a more robust exegetical understanding of the biblical text. It is only then that we will be able to see clearly enough to finely tune scholarly exegetical structures.</p>
