<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore the experience of nurses in relation to courage development in patients with disabling complications of diabetes. The phenomenon of courage has been explored in philosophy, theology, literature, and other fields of inquiry rooted in the humanities. Nursing inquiry has not often been directed toward an exploration of courage, although coping, compassion, caring, and other experiences integral to the nurse–patient relationship have been examined. The holistic view of the cascading effect of complications on the individual patient is often overlooked. This qualitative study used phenomenological inquiry and included face-to-face interviews of nurses to explore their experience in assisting patients in the development of courage. The experience of courage is investigated as it relates to a specific group of patients who have complications of diabetes. Four categories representing the unique opportunities for courage development by nurses were generated. These categories included education, advocacy, relationship building, and humanization. Each category described nursing intentions and actions and taken together formed an essential structure of courage development. Conclusions indicated that nurses recognize and are able to describe their role in courage development. Implications for improved health through deliberate caring nursing interventions, aimed at courage development, are presented.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nurses face many challenges, and one of the most difficult is caring holistically for patients with severe disabling complications of diabetes. The totality of the challenges of these complications is often unnoticed by nurses, who may be focusing on clinical nursing care of each individual complication. It is rare to find descriptions of interventions that address a holistic approach to complications. Patients may be better supported by nurses’ recognition of their need for intense and sustained nursing interventions directed to their entire clinical course of complications. The exacting demands of the illness and the toll of complications require an examination of the role of nursing in recognizing and offering specialized psychological as well as physical care to these individuals.</p>
<p>This article builds on previous research on courage development. The lived experience of nine patients with severe complications of diabetes had previously been explored through the lens of courage. Transcripts of these face-to-face interviews revealed tremendous suffering and the role of courage in their lived experience. Five theme categories describing various dimensions of courage were generated: philosophical, health care, physical, psychological, and interpersonal. Within the health care dimension, the development of courage was found to be an essential part of the experience and, importantly, nurses were identified by these participants as the potential facilitators of courage. Patients stated they were open to nursing influence in courage development in facing complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010112461975">Donohue-Porter, 1987</xref>). Thus, the purpose of this current study was to explore the experience of nurses in assisting patients with diabetes complications in the development of courage. A description of courage, the nurses’ perceptions of courage development in this group of patients, and implications for nursing practice are presented</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>This review first briefly describes diabetes, its many complications, and its significance to nursing care, the focus of this study. Following this, courage is addressed as an important experience for these patients as they live with these many complications. The view of courage across disciplines is synthesized, and literature is presented that captures research findings as well as theoretical perspectives related to the phenomenon of courage and the nurse’s role in courage development, specifically with individuals with diabetes.</p>
<sec id="section3-0898010112461975">
<title>Diabetes and Its Complications</title>
<p>Diabetes is increasing at epidemic rates and is now recognized as the first noninfectious disease posing a global health threat (International Diabetes Federation, 2009). United Nations Resolution 61/225, adopted unanimously in 2006, gave recognition to diabetes as a serious disease that poses a threat to individual well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010112461975">International Diabetes Federation, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898010112461975">2009</xref>). Diabetes affects 25.8 million people of all ages with approximately 11 million U.S. residents 65 years and older having diabetes in 2010. The disease remains the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.</p>
<p>Patients with severe and disabling complications of diabetes face a compromised quality of life. They have many needs: physiological support, metabolic control, and psychosocial adjustment to a demanding chronic illness. These patients face a constellation of challenges. They may experience progressive debilitation from progressive and life-threatening complications, requiring treatments that may be painful, exhausting, and at times, unsuccessful. Although correlations are made between certain complications such as retinopathy and diabetic kidney disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010112461975">American Association of Diabetes Educators, 2009</xref>), many recent studies offer essential information only on each separate complication such as depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0898010112461975">Sorkin et al., 2011</xref>) cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0898010112461975">Yang, Chasens, Sereika, &amp; Burke, 2009</xref>), kidney complications (The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010112461975">The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Research Group, 2011</xref>), retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898010112461975">Jones, Walker, Schechter, &amp; Blanco, 2010</xref>), and foot care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0898010112461975">Scollan-Koliopoulos, Walker, &amp; Bleich, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Nurses have been recognized as playing a central role in support of patients with diabetes. The cross-national Diabetes Attitudes and Wishes and Needs (DAWN) study identified a major role of nurses as providing security for diabetic patients. Improved psychological care for people with diabetes was identified as one of five key roles in the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0898010112461975">Siminerio, Funnell, Peyrot, &amp; Rubin, 2007</xref>). The middle-range theory of adapting to diabetes mellitus has been proposed, emphasizing the synthesis of concepts of self-management, integration, and health-within-illness. This theory captures the experience of patients in an effort to be useful to practicing clinicians. It also incorporates both the values of care and the priorities of nursing in caring for patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0898010112461975">Whittemore &amp; Roy, 2002</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0898010112461975">
<title>The Phenomenon of Courage</title>
<p>Courage has been examined from ancient to present times in a variety of settings and disciplines. Courage has been related to wisdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0898010112461975">Plato, trans. 2004</xref>), a capacity to move ahead despite despair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0898010112461975">May, 1975</xref>), as well as care and concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0898010112461975">MacIntyre, 1984</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0898010112461975">Tillich (1952)</xref> recognized it as an essential part of one’s being. It has been identified with resilience, particularly in recovery from intense suffering such as that experienced in the Holocaust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0898010112461975">Tee, 2003</xref>). Courage has been conceptualized as physical, moral, and psychological and often with the caveat that courageous action is taken for the purpose of a good outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010112461975">Crigger &amp; Godfrey, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Courage has also been related to the search for meaning in one’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898010112461975">Frankl, 1939</xref>), to creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0898010112461975">May, 1975</xref>), to transcending suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898010112461975">Fox &amp; Swazey, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898010112461975">Frankl, 1939</xref>), and to hope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898010112461975">Kubler-Ross, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0898010112461975">Wilkes, 1979</xref>). There are aspects of risk and vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0898010112461975">Shelp, 1984</xref>) integral to courage, and its definition has roots in the military vision of bravery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0898010112461975">Rachman, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010112461975">Aristotle (trans. 1962)</xref> described courage as a constant effort to do the right thing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0898010112461975">Plato (trans. 2004)</xref> considered courage to be a virtue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0898010112461975">Rabieh, 2006</xref>) and both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898010112461975">Frankl (1939)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898010112461975">Fromm (1956)</xref> related it to love and compassion from others. Courage was linked to self-respect in remaining true to one’s most enduring values by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898010112461975">Kennedy (1955)</xref> in <italic>Profiles in Courage</italic>. Although courage examined in these affirmative terms might deem it a concept of high value, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0898010112461975">Shelp (1984)</xref> cautions that a quest for courage should not place a burden on the patient but only be facilitated if desired. This point is especially important for patients with diabetic complications who already bear tremendous responsibilities in coping with their illness.</p>
<p>Courage has multiple descriptions; more than 20 were offered in a recent examination of its defining features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0898010112461975">Rate, 2010</xref>). The purpose of examining courage in detail has been postulated to assist individuals to develop courage in order to build their agency and strengthen their responses to threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898010112461975">Lester, Vogelgesang, Hannah, &amp; Kimmey, 2010</xref>). In a theoretical analysis of courage and nursing practice, four concepts were identified as relevant: the ontological nature of courage, its role as moral virtue, its property as an ethical act, and its creative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0898010112461975">Lindh, da Silva, Berg, &amp; Severinsson, 2010</xref>). Courage has been identified as a bridge to an existential encounter with a goal of alleviation of patient’s suffering through caregivers’ witnessing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112461975">Arman, 2007</xref>). Such encounters are of concern to both patient and nursing experience.</p>

<title>Courage and the Patient Experience</title>
<p>Previous nursing research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898010112461975">Haase (1987)</xref> related to courage addressed the regressive–progressive manner of courage development in chronically ill adolescents with a variety of illnesses. She concluded that asking patients to be brave should be avoided because her study participants described the presence of courage as coming and going.</p>
<p>Fingfgeld, a nurse researcher, has a program of research devoted to courage, investigating it in the chronically ill elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010112461975">Fingfgeld, 1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112461975">1995b</xref>), middle-aged adults with long-term health concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010112461975">Fingfgeld, 1998</xref>), and in young adults with long-term health concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898010112461975">Fingfgeld, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010112461975">Finfgeld (1998)</xref> confirmed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898010112461975">Haase’s (1987)</xref> work when she, too, identified the ongoing progressive–regressive process of becoming and being courageous. The acceptance of the threat of chronic illness and the need for pushing beyond the struggle was seen in her metainterpretation of qualitative studies of courage. She concluded that courage develops over time and includes fully accepting reality, problem solving, and the need to push beyond ongoing struggles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010112461975">Finfgeld, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010112461975">Bournes (2000)</xref> created a unitary definition of having courage that included steadfast risking while creatively living the cherished. Her courage investigation of spinal cord–injured patients, using the Parse nursing perspective of human becoming, revealed that having courage included a fortifying tenacity as well as a guarded confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010112461975">Bournes, 2002</xref>). The paradoxical dimensions of courage are noted in the interplay between tenacity and guarding, in keeping with both Finfgeld’s and Haase’s noted regressive–progressive patterns of courage.</p>

<sec id="section6-0898010112461975">
<title>Courage and Nursing</title>
<p>Theoretical and research publications have identified courage and its importance to nursing. Lanara, a nurse philosopher, identified nurses as aiding in courage facilitation early on when she wrote of nurses offering their physical strength, mental stability, and when necessary, their courageous spirit, for use until the patient’s own resources are strengthened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898010112461975">Lanara, 1981</xref>). More recently, in a theoretical analysis of courage, its beneficial outcomes, such as the strength to face challenges and the aptitude to motivate others, have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0898010112461975">Lindh et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Courage is identified as one of multiple defining characteristics of the nursing diagnosis of readiness for enhanced spiritual well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010112461975">Doenges, Moorhouse, &amp; Murr, 2008</xref>). It was also identified in a hermeneutic inquiry of nurses’ moral strength. The action level of moral strength for a group of eight registered nurses working in different aspects health care in southern Sweden was “having courage to act on one’s convictions.” Two other levels were identified as relational, “being attentive and recognizing vulnerability,” and existential, “facing the unpredictable.” Moral strength, for these nurses, was a driving force to be someone special in the care of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898010112461975">Lindh, Severinsson, &amp; Berg, 2009</xref>, p. 1885).</p>
<p>In a previous study, the nurses’ role in the experience of patients with diabetes’ complications was identified by patient participants as one of inspiration, encouragement, caring, allowing for authentic dialogue, and helping the patient interpret highly technological environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010112461975">Donohue-Porter, 1987</xref>). Although patients said they had not had the experience of having a nurse assist them develop courage, they believed nurses had a capability in this area because of their other skills of encouragement and caring. In a related study, with a focus on patients undergoing stem cell transplantation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010112461975">Coolbrandt and Grypdonck (2010)</xref> identified nurses and doctors as helping patients muster up courage, with nurses viewed as carrying patients through despondent moments.</p>
<p>In a hermeneutic analysis of nurses’ practice stories integrated with literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0898010112461975">Spence and Smythe (2007)</xref> identified multiple dimensions of courage in contemporary nursing practice. They interviewed 26 advanced practice nurses working in a variety of settings and asked them to describe practice situations that they believed had required courage on their part. They did not focus on development of courage in patients, but there were some themes that overlapped into patient experiences because of the interactions of many components of courage. Their patient care narratives addressed courage as a response to threat or challenge, courage as requiring confident knowing, courage as sustained commitment, courage as a paradoxical interplay of opposites, and courage as hope in action; the paradox echoes the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010112461975">Finfgeld (1999)</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, the literature supports that nurses play a central role in caring for patients with diabetes complications. These patients suffer both physiologically and psychologically. Courage has been identified as a bridge to an existential encounter with a goal of alleviation of patient’s suffering through caregivers’ witnessing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112461975">Arman, 2007</xref>). Although patients with diabetes complications in an earlier study on courage said they had not had the experience of having a nurse assist them to develop courage, they believed nurses had a capability in this area because of their other skills of encouragement and caring. The purpose of this study was to extend these findings from this earlier study. A descriptive phenomenological study design was chosen to address the study’s purpose.</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<sec id="section8-0898010112461975">
<title>Philosophical Approach</title>
<p>The methodology of qualitative research is inductive rather than the deductive approach of theory testing. Moreover, phenomenology is the study of the person’s life world as it is experienced, rather than as theorized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0898010112461975">Van Manen, 1984</xref>). The phenomenological philosophy of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898010112461975">Husserl (1964)</xref> guided this study. Husserl believed that pure conscious events could be brought into clarity and subjected to analysis and apprehension of their essences. “And how different the seeing of things shows itself on closer analysis” (p. 9). Critical examination and description of the phenomena are the goals in this approach. This phenomenological study was also informed by the philosophy of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0898010112461975">Merleau-Ponty (1945/1958)</xref>, whose belief was that at any point in time and for each individual, a particular perspective or consciousness exists. Especially important to this study is Merleau-Ponty’s view of embodiment as he believed that it is through one’s body that one gains access to the world. Therefore, detailed descriptions of phenomena, such as courage, in the lives of individuals experiencing the bodily effects of diabetes complications may help in the understanding of the influence of illness in their experience of the world.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section10-0898010112461975">
<title>Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>The research proposal was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of the educational institution of the researcher as well as reviewed and deemed expedited by the institutional review board of the health care institution from which the participants were recruited and where the interviews took place. Human subjects’ concerns such as confidentiality, noncoercion, and attention to sensitive subject material were accounted for in all interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0898010112461975">
<title>Recruitment and Description of Participants</title>
<p>A purposive sample of 14 nurses was selected from a practice setting. These nurses stated that they had experience with the phenomenon of courage development in the experience of care for patients with diabetes complications and were willing to discuss it. Each interview lasted from 45 minutes to 1 hour and was unstructured and audiotaped. Thirteen of the participating nurses were female; 1 was male.There were three Africian American, eight Caucasian, and three Asian/Pacific Islander participants. The ages ranged from 22 to 52 years with a mean age of 34. Nine participants held the BSN degree; 5 held the associate degree in nursing, and 3 of these 5 held a bachelor’s degree in a field other than nursing. Their nursing experience ranged from 3 months to 18 years. Five nurses had 1 year of experience; 9 had an average of 7 years’ experience. They were employed in the emergency, telemetry, neurological, orthopedic, medical/surgical, and step-down surgical units.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0898010112461975">
<title>Generation of Transcripts and Data Collection</title>
<p>An interview guide with broad questions and possible follow-up probes was used. Broad questions allowed the participants to relate their experiences in their own words. Examples of broad and probing questions asked during the actual interviews were the following: Tell me about your care of patients with disabling complications of diabetes? What are your descriptions of courage? Do you feel it is part of the experience of nursing? Describe how the patient looked to you to assist in the development of courage?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0898010112461975">
<title>Analysis of the Text</title>
<p>This phase of the research began with audiotaped interviews with permission of all participants and was followed by researcher-generated detailed notes. These notes served two purposes: first as a reflexive process to ensure, as is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898010112461975">Husserl’s (1965)</xref> belief, the objectivity of the researcher and second to add to the evolving description of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Analysis of the data took place by using both the notes and transcripts to create descriptive profiles of the process of courage development for these nurses. The interviews were transcribed verbatim.The method of phenomenological data analysis as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010112461975">Colaizzi (1978)</xref> was used.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010112461975">Colazzi’s (1978)</xref> steps, data analysis begins with the reading of each description of the phenomenon. Significant statements, those that directly pertain to the phenomenon, are then extracted. The meaning of these statements is then formulated. This refers to the interpretation of the significance of the meaning of the statement by the researcher, within the context of the transcript and the observation during the interview. This phase elicits formulated meanings based on intense reflection. This process is repeated for each of the participants’ interview transcripts. Formulated meanings are then organized as aggregates into clusters of themes. Individual theme categories arise from the grouping of theme clusters. The clusters of themes are continually referred back to the original transcripts in order to validate them. The results are integrated into what Colaizzi calls an exhaustive description of the topic; this description is formulated into a statement of identification of the essential structure of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>The categories of courage development were generated as follows. Significant statements were first coded. Meanings were assessed, formulated, and coded as well. The formulated meanings were clustered and the theme clusters organized into theme categories. Four theme categories were generated. Examples of clusters that were categorized and final themes that were developed may be viewed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898010112461975">Table 1</xref>. The exhaustive description furthered the themes, adding to the whole experience.</p>

<title>Methodological Rigor</title>
<p>To maintain methodological rigor, the researcher used bracketing to put aside prior personal knowledge and experience of the phenomenon and understand the participants’ perspectives. Reflexive notes assisted with this process. To strengthen the findings, more than one method of data collection was included: field notes, reflexive journal notes, and transcribed interviews. The final themes and essential structure were descriptive in nature, and thus related to the descriptive phenomenological philosophy of Husserl. Although Husserl did not advocate a return for checking of the description with participants, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010112461975">Colaizzi (1978)</xref> requires this final step in the process and this researcher sought and received validation of the study’s themes. The auditability is evident and demonstrated in this report through the presentation of the data analysis moving from phrases or statements to clusters to themes and these are supported by verbatim quotations, known as the audit trail.</p>
<p>The fundamental structure and theme categories of the phenomenon of courage development were shared with the participants to determine if they accurately described their experience. The researcher returned to meet with the participants on their nursing units. Each of the nurses read the final essential structural description, including the theme category descriptions, and each was in agreement that the essential structure of their experience was accurate and complete. There were no additions or requests for deletions of the identified descriptions.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The final thematic descriptions related to the following: Educating for Empowerment, Advocating and Reflecting Action, Treasuring the Relationship, and Humanizing the Complexity. Consistent with Husserl’s and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0898010112461975">Merleau-Ponty’s (1945/1958)</xref> tenets, the thematic labels were descriptive rather than interpretive.</p>
<sec id="section16-0898010112461975">
<title>Educating for Empowerment</title>
<p>Educating for empowerment contains four theme clusters: <italic>teaching through narratives, education as portable, effective and timely educati</italic>on, and <italic>specialized content is as necessary as caring</italic>. This theme category describes the nurses’ view of education as communication that must be given in an effective, creative, and timely manner. Education can help patients cope with complications.</p>
<p>Nurses emphasized that the time limitations of the contemporary health care setting meant that patients take their education with them; they are never admitted for patient teaching. There is a need to educate as effectively as possible. Time for detailed education is increasingly limited so they need to educate as creatively and clearly as possible. Nurses spoke of the pressure they felt to give effective care but, importantly, do deliver effective content so the patient can learn self-management. Several nurses mentioned teaching through narratives, using stories of past experiences they have had with patient care situations to focus their present teaching efforts.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If you don’t supply them with education, especially about diabetes complications, they are going to go home in the same state that they are in the hospital. I don’t understand how you could take care of them and not be on the side of giving them education.</p>
<p>People want to know that you are here for them. You want to let the patient know that even though I am not always physically there; if they need to talk I will come back and be here for you. I think education is knowledge and knowledge instills courage in people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0898010112461975">
<title>Advocating and Reflecting Action</title>
<p>The Advocating and Reflecting Action category consists of six theme clusters: <italic>courageous actions through action words, intense nursing presence, careful attention to multiple needs, advocating during vulnerability, capability in sharing emotions</italic>, and <italic>supporting the support system</italic>.</p>
<p>Nurses described action words such as instill, build, push them to have a functional life, going ahead even if afraid, looking forward, move them along, or help their patients. The nurses realize they have an essential part in this encouragement because their intense presence, attention, and emotional support help show their caring for diabetic patients with complications.</p>
<p>One nurse described the insertion of a chest tube as an example of assisting a patient to remain courageous. She described a four-step process that evolved as she first began stopping the treatment at times so the patient could refocus, asking for pain medication for the patient, using touch to calm the patient, and allowing respect for the use of the word <italic>pain</italic> when the health care team discounted that the patient was in pain. The nurse saw this as a clear example of advocating for the patient to remain courageous in the moment of insertion of a chest tube.</p>
<p>In this category, nurses spoke about their own actions and reflection on the actions with statements such as the following
<disp-quote>
<p>I have to push them. Just push them to get out of bed, to push them to get better, to get all the resources they need outside. You need to move them along and get them to understand that this is something that they are going to overcome.</p>
<p>I have had patients come in with amputations and blindness but in good spirits. Then I notice they had family support so I have to make time to take care of the people who were taking care of the patient.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One nurse described the mirroring that occurs as both patients and nurses work together in facilitating courage.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The patient actually comes in and knows they are going to have their leg amputated. It does take courage for the nurse to go in and have that open conversation with them. Some nurses don’t see this side of it; they are very task oriented. But if you have been around the block for a few years, you see that it takes a lot for the patient to come in and know that they are going to have an amputation and a life outside of that. Some may want to give up and you have to to instill in them that there is so much more to their life than losing that limb. So I think the patient has to have the courage to admit they have the issue, and the nurse needs courage to go in and actually help the patient.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nurses viewed themselves as capable of helping people onward and were able to enable them to see how their journey outside of diabetes’ complications could be accomplished.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0898010112461975">
<title>Treasuring the Relationship</title>
<p>Treasuring the relationship contains four theme clusters: <italic>building trust and rapport, comfort and distraction from uncertainty, using humor</italic>, and <italic>staying patient centered through listening</italic>. The nurses identified these as the central aspects of the nurse-patient relationship.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Courage can be a multitude of things, but I think it is getting up out of bed and facing a day that you really don’t want to, and that you don’t know the outcome, the uncertainty of it. I can provide comfort for that.</p>
<p>I know I can be very funny with patients and use humor to help break the ice and help them deal with the bad news. I am careful who I use humor with and I have been a nurse for a long time so I think I can make good decisions about that and find it important in building the relationship and listening, asking appropriate questions and open-ended questions.</p>
<p>The relationship always comes first. We connect and then build trust so patients can talk and we can listen.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants said they treasured the patient–nurse relationship, the aspect of nursing care that brought them meaning when they were using multiple nursing interventions to give care to patients with complex needs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0898010112461975">
<title>Humanizing the Complexity</title>
<p>The Humanizing the Complexity category contains six theme clusters: <italic>recognizing illness and developmental trajectory transitions, lessening the guilt and blame, decreasing isolation through shared humanity, mirroring patients’ strengths, acknowledging loss of control</italic>, and <italic>interpreting technology and treatment decisions</italic>. These mean that nurses affirm the complexities of diabetes care and are responsible for guiding patients through the process. The complexity of diabetes complications was seen as a tipping point where nurses recognized that patients had reached a threshold of coping with multiple and overlapping complications. Respecting family and friendship support, as part of mirroring patients’ strengths, was seen as essential to this category.</p>
<p>Patients are often blamed for the development of complications and nurses are aware of this and tried to avoid placing blame and being judgmental. Some noted that complications occur even if a complex treatment plan is followed.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is difficult—what usually would break my heart is someone who did everything right.</p>
<p>They watched their diet, they went to the eye doctor, they exercised, they tested their blood sugar, they were very good, and then little by little, usually renal problems develop, after a while they are on dialysis, then the amputation. It is very difficult because they feel why even bother? I have no answers but I say just keep your chin up, all you can do is keep your chin up. You try to find little ways here and there to help.</p>
<p>We get a lot of patient contact, more than any other health care professional in the hospital. We get every opportunity. You sit and talk, if you see somebody going through a tough time, you hold the patient’s hand for 5 minutes, just to make them feel better. I don’t see why you wouldn’t take the time to sit and talk about strengths of the patient.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section20-0898010112461975">
<title>Essential Structure of Courage Development</title>
<p>The described experience of courage development by nurses is to assist in the challenges of diabetes complications and help patients move forward through intention and presence. This requires a treasured relationship, advocating for the patient with reflection on one’s own actions, and is characterized by specific actions such as educating. For nurses it means humanizing the complexity of complications the patient experiences, such as feeling blame, guilt, or alone, and then assisting them in developing needed support and coping.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0898010112461975" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This discussion focuses on further support of the identified four themes through a comparison of them with selected published literature. Some presented literature was reviewed earlier and other literature was reviewed and selected as the themes emerged.</p>
<sec id="section22-0898010112461975">
<title>Theme Category 1: Educating for Empowerment</title>
<p>The development of diabetes complications has been noted as a diabetes-related transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0898010112461975">Rasmussen, Ward, Jenkins, King, &amp; Dunning, 2011</xref>). During these transitions, patients with diabetes have increased exposure to nurses who can assist them in their education process. It has long been recognized that patients who have never received diabetes education show an increased risk of a major complication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0898010112461975">Mensing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0898010112461975">Nicolucci et al., 1996</xref>). Nurses in this study realized that they had important evidence-based education that they could and must impart to patients in order to avoid further illness.</p>
<p>Diabetes educators have many tasks in offering self-management skills to their patients. Results of diabetes education have been identified as lowering health care costs, increasing compliance with prescription regimens, and providing care that is aligned with recommended guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010112461975">Duncan et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898010112461975">Fain (2010)</xref> has called for diabetes educators to intervene earlier in the life of the person with diabetes in order to prevent major diabetes-related complications. Education may also benefit the ability of the patient to sustain a strong response to the demands of this chronic illness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0898010112461975">
<title>Theme Category 2: Advocating and Reflecting Action</title>
<p>Participants’ use of action words in the second theme category is not surprising since courage has been defined as essential to action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010112461975">Baumann, 2008</xref>).The action-laden description of advocacy for patients has been noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010112461975">Finfgeld (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898010112461975">Haase (1987)</xref> as assisting patients in transforming threats into challenges and helping them in getting on with life in spite of difficulties. The energy required by nurses to help patients onward has been recognized as one of great demands on the nurses’ emotional resources. The participants in the present study used words such as “moving them ahead” and “pushing them forward” by “building” and “instilling courage.” The need for nurses’ own courage was identified. One nurse described forging ahead with patient-centered care and recognizing the need for pain management even though the team discounted the pain.</p>
<p>This advocacy for the patient has the imprint of Nightingale’s view of the educated and assertive nurse. One of Nightingale’s important contributions to nursing was her own courageous vision. She saw nursing’s role in opposition to the societal view of nursing and health in the context of her day. She was motivated to improve the health status of the individual in the setting of their nurse–patient interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0898010112461975">Selanders, 2010</xref>). These individual encounters between nurses and patients echo her leadership.</p>
<p>The participants worked toward helping the patient view life as much more than the presence of a complication or facing the loss of a limb. They did this by being fully present with their patients. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112461975">Bunkers (2004)</xref> identified courage as enduring, persevering, overcoming, and living each day as fully as possible. Nursing research on assisting patients with diabetes to develop competency in shaping their life has demonstrated links to autonomy by encouraging a wider worldview and perspective on self-management and decision making for patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0898010112461975">Moser, van der Bruggen, &amp; Widdershoven, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0898010112461975">
<title>Theme Category 3: Treasuring the Relationship</title>
<p>Developing a rapport, trust, and comfort were clear strategies for the nurses in this study as they cared for diabetic patients with complications. Treasuring was more than caring; it was holding the relationship as an elevated connection between two engaged human beings. As one nurse said, it was a great deal more than “task orientation.” This connection has been described by earlier writers in nursing. It is an emotional existential presence requiring great and deliberate devotion from the nurse. The price for nurses is high because the care involves ‘being with” as well as “doing to” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898010112461975">Kitson, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898010112461975">Lanara (1981)</xref> alludes to this <italic>being with</italic> when she writes that nurses do not sacrifice their lives for others but rather give what is alive in them to others, instilling courage through vigor and hope. When nurses in the present study described the essences of their relationship building with patients one could see connections to the writings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0898010112461975">Paterson and Zderad (1976)</xref> in <italic>Humanistic Nursing</italic>. These nurse philosophers describe relationships as central to discovering the uniqueness of each other. The nurse shifts emphasis and perspective to always remain with the patient. The work of Nightingale is echoed here as well, in the clinical context, since she advocated sitting and facing the patient in order to give time and attention necessary to forge a connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0898010112461975">Wagner &amp; Whaite, 2010</xref>). The use of humor and personality characteristics of the nurse to connect with the patient is in keeping with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898010112461975">Finfgeld (2000)</xref>, who describes projecting optimism, communicating openly, validating patient worth in spite of problems, instilling trust, and using humor in a prudent manner as the components of the role of health care providers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0898010112461975">
<title>Theme Category 4: Humanizing the Complexity</title>
<p>The complexity and constant balancing that diabetes requires have been well investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898010112461975">Ingadottir &amp; Halldorsdottir, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0898010112461975">Whittemore &amp; Roy, 2002</xref>), and importantly, the humanizing of this complex experience has been identified in nurse-coaching interventions for persons with diabetes. Providing intensive and ongoing counseling recognizes and responds to the need for long-term maintenance of complex diabetes self-management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0898010112461975">Whittemore, Melkus, Sullivan, &amp; Grey, 2004</xref>). Their study helps direct nurses in specific coaching techniques and demonstrates explicit nursing interventions. Improving the recognition and the management of the psychological needs of diabetic patients and helping them discuss unmet psychological needs are recently identified outcomes of the monitoring of individual needs in diabetes, gathered from baseline data from the previously mentioned DAWN study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0898010112461975">Snoek et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Some of the other ideas generated from the category of humanizing the complexity allude to what had been described as the invisible work of nursing, the intuitive, compassionate exploration of meaning in patient care situations where nurses have been found to be prepared with intent to action to demonstrate caring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010112461975">Bowkar, Star. &amp; Spasser, 2001</xref>). This work has been considered largely invisible because often the emotional work comes out of the personal time of the nurse and is not seen as essential as the tasks and products of other kinds of nursing care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010112461975">Bjorklund, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0898010112461975">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Limitations of the study exist in several areas. The researcher did experience the common pressure of time limits and distractions when conducting interviews in the clinical setting. However, the transcripts were complete when reviewed without interruptions in the process. It is important to note that the nurses were administratively supported to be away from patient care during this time. It is usually determined that the phenomenological data are trustworthy to the extent that the subject’s experience of the phenomenon has been exhaustively tapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010112461975">Colaizzi, 1978</xref>). The nurses were available for only one interview and the subject matter is quite complex. Although their responses were thoughtful, this may have had an impact on the depth of description of the phenomenon. Although the researcher did endeavor to separate out her professional experience with this group of patients, nurses may have been able to detect her concern and answered with more emphasis on special care than usual. Although some of the nurses did not have the depth and breadth of experience with patients with diabetes because they were relatively new nurses, all had experience with caring for patients with diabetes complications and were able to offer rich descriptions. Courage is a word with multiple connotations so therefore some clarity in responses may be lacking. Importantly, the participants may also have had more of an affinity for the care of diabetic patients, which may have influenced their views because of the setting; the hospital has a large outpatient diabetes education center that has been in place for more than 30 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0898010112461975" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Nurses were able to articulate their role in facilitating courage development for patients with diabetes complications. Having influence over the patient care situation, they offered nonjudgmental support and helped to problem solve struggles. These nurses encouraged and cared for the family and support systems of their patients. They were able to develop empathic relationships with patients and families. They recognized the complexity of the unique situation of dealing with multiple complications of diabetes. The outpouring of responses from nurses when questions are framed qualitatively is a significant finding. Perhaps it is therapeutic for nurses to enter into discussions of how they value and perceive the meaning in patient experiences. Nurses need the dialogue and narrative afforded through qualitative interviews to articulate the depth and breadth of nursing actions. Courage has not had a wide array of in-depth investigation by nurses, and this may be because of the essential but often overemphasized task orientation of the profession or the inability to have timely reflection and discussion in the frenetic clinical setting. Yet a potential exists for nurses to improve care for patients if more of their experience is revealed. Based on this study’s results, nurses are in a unique position to develop empathic nursing interventions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0898010112461975">
<title>Implications for Nursing Practice and Education</title>
<p>Implications based on this study’s findings relate to continued support for the development of empathic practice, improved nursing education, patient-centered care, and the involvement of other disciplines in these endeavors. There is a continued need for understanding of the emotional needs of patients who usually receive heavily task-oriented care. When nurses hold the emotional needs of patients as a high priority and use nursing interventions such as being present, reflecting with patients, using humor, instilling hope and keeping the dialogue open, courage may be facilitated.</p>
<p>A desire to understand the experience of the patient with diabetes complications and to facilitate their courageous response to the demands of the illness requires a framework of empathetic nursing practice. Empathy has been described as an “almost magical” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0898010112461975">Spiro, 1992</xref>) emotion that when elicited allows one to move into the patient experience with a heightened awareness of the special needs of others. It is evident when “I <italic>and</italic> you” becomes “I <italic>am</italic> you” or at least “I might be you” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0898010112461975">Spiro, 1992</xref>, p. 843.)</p>
<p>An empathic framework needs to be foundational to nursing education and present in the curricula through all levels, undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral. The role of virtues and formation in nursing education has been identified as central to the development of professional identity and has been called for as part of a radical transformation of nursing education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112461975">Benner, Sutphen, Leonard, &amp; Day, 2010</xref>). Knowledege of ethics can enhance nursing education in a variety of ways and the use of the tools of ethical reasoning such as Socratic questioning and Aristotelian dialectic have been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010112461975">Allmark, 2005</xref>). These nursing education strategies would assist in clarifying philosophical concepts such as courage.</p>
<p>In the United States, the recent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898010112461975">Institute of Medicine (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898010112461975">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898010112461975">2004</xref>) initiatives have directed nursing to develop and strengthen patient-centered care. An awareness of how patients view courage and how nurses can assist them can be a focal point for the movement toward patient-centered care. Patient-centered care is deeply related to empathy.</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary teams may benefit from the nursing skills and excellence seen in regard to relationship building.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0898010112461975">
<title>Recommendations for Further Research</title>
<p>Studies that address courage throughout the trajectory of diabetes as a chronic illness of great complexity are warranted. Qualitative studies on the perspective of professionals in other disciplines are also warranted as well as the need to examine courage in other chronic illness states. There is a need for a comprehensive concept analysis of courage. Concept clarification and theoretical frameworks have been noted as foundational to the meaning of nursing practice and research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0898010112461975">Wardell, 2009</xref>). An in-depth analysis of courage can offer specialized knowledge for the practice of holistic care. Conceptual clarity will help bring together other related concepts such as wisdom and compassion that have been identified as overlapping and interwoven with courage. The need for deeper knowledge of these has been identified as helpful for nurses as they are present and responsive to the always changing health patterns of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010112461975">Baumann, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Research into the use of the humanities to help nurses more deeply understand a philosophical virtue, such as courage, is warranted. Expressions of poetry, music, arts, and literature can awaken empathy in nurses and allow them to focus on how they can allay the suffering of their patients. A cultural investigation of courage is also indicated so that its expression in diverse populations can be identified.</p>
<p>The need for qualitative study of issues as existential and interpersonal as courage development exists, and this type of research may be useful for many of the areas of transitions seen during illness. Having a new diagnosis of diabetes is another area that recently was investigated through a lifeworld phenomenological study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898010112461975">Johansson, Ekebergh, &amp; Dahlberg, 2009</xref>) and the use of this research perspective is indicated.</p>
<p>Future research should also examine the relational role of courage development with other professionals with an aim of collaboration throughout the health care team. Most important, further research using a guiding principle of seeking holism in nursing support of the patient experience is indicated.</p>
