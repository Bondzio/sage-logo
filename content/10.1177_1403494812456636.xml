<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alcohol abuse is a significant threat to global health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812456636">1</xref>]. Treatment and prevention of alcohol problems are complex and challenging for hospitals and general practitioners (GPs), calling for collaboration across levels of care. Several barriers preventing GPs from engaging in alcohol interventions have been identified, such as lack of confidence and knowledge, fear of infringing the patient’s right to self-determination, and anticipating patient’s lack of motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812456636">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812456636">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Hospital admissions may motivate patients to change their lifestyle, including drinking habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812456636">4</xref>]. Recent evidence shows that hospital-initiated brief alcohol intervention (BAI) can reduce patients’ alcohol intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812456636">5</xref>]. Since April 2008 patients acutely admitted with somatic alcohol-related conditions to Stavanger University Hospital have been offered BAI during the hospital stay. The first author (TGL) is a Stavanger GP with a long-time interest in substance abuse, the second (KO) and third author (BP) have research experience on alcohol intervention in surgical settings, while the last author (KM) has research experience on vulnerable issues such as humiliation and shame in general practice. We shared a concern to improve collaboration between GPs and hospitals concerning patients with alcohol problems. We therefore set up a study to explore GPs’ follow-up experiences with patients discharged from hospital after admittance for alcohol-related somatic conditions, to examine whether and how BAI received during the stay affected the GPs’ follow up after discharge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494812456636" sec-type="methods">
<title>Design, materials, and methods</title>
<p>A focus group study with GPs of patients admitted for alcohol-related somatic health problems or injury was conducted. The BAI programme in Stavanger, including a booster offered by the hospital’s alcohol nurse (AN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812456636">6</xref>], was the study context, although not our research focus. An effect study regarding this intervention will be reported elsewhere.</p>
<p>Patients were not screened upon admission but enrolled for BAI on the basis of condition and circumstances. A majority of the patients offered BAI are discharged after a few days, but some are transferred to other somatic wards. Eligible GPs were retrospectively identified by review of the case numbers of patients who during 2010 had been acutely admitted for alcohol-related somatic health problems or injury, and who had received BAI. They all had from one to four patients. This procedure identified 49 GPs, who were invited to participate in focus groups, and 29 of these accepted the invitation. They chose between different suggested scheduled group interviews, and TGL and KO then chose the dates and geographical locations that gave the highest number of participants, with variability for age, gender, and experience. The GPs were notified by the hospital AN prior to the interview about which patients were concerned. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics.</p>
<p>Data were drawn from two focus groups, each with five and nine participants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812456636">Table I</xref>). Each group was interviewed once (90 minutes). The first group was composed mainly of young doctors and the second group mainly of experienced doctors, both with a majority of men. A moderator (TGL in the first group, and KO in the second) called for stories about the doctors’ follow-up experiences with respect to patients who had received BAI during hospital stay for alcohol-related conditions. We asked whether the intervention given in the hospital had been recognised by the GP and how this knowledge affected their follow up of the patient.</p>

<p>The interviews were recorded on audio files and transcribed verbatim by TGL. Analysis was conducted as collaborative negotiations between three of the authors (KO, KM, TGL). We used systematic text condensation inspired by Giorgi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812456636">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812456636">8</xref>], reading all the material initially to obtain an overall impression. Then we identified meaning units representing different aspects of the participants’ experiences of follow up within this specific setting and coded for these. Next, the contents of each coded group were condensed. Finally, we summarised the contents of each code group to generalise descriptions and concepts of GPs’ experiences with follow up of patients admitted with alcohol-related morbidity in somatic departments.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A majority of the GPs had experienced patients with well-known prior alcohol problems that were rediscovered by the hospital staff. Still, they presented examples of how seeing the patient in a different context might create new opportunities. Few participants had received adequate information from the hospital about their patient’s alcohol status. They emphasised that a report about what had happened and what was planned, was needed for follow up. Care pathways for patients with alcohol problems were seen as fragmented. Yet the GPs described how alcohol-related hospital admissions might function as an eye-opener for the patient and create an important window of opportunity for lifestyle change. These findings are elaborated below. Quotations are assigned pseudonyms.</p>
<sec id="section4-1403494812456636">
<title>Rediscovering old problems or identifying problems formerly not recognised?</title>
<p>The patients who were offered BAI tended to have severe, long-standing, and obvious drinking problems. Prior to the actual hospital admission, the GP was often extensively involved and had already referred the patient to specialist treatment. One participant stated that she could not understand the reason for involvement by the AN in a specific case, since primary care was already considerably engaged. A very experienced doctor working in a rural district said:
<disp-quote>
<p>The alcohol nurse had been involved, I realised; but I had been more heavily involved so I really don’t see what the alcohol nurse was doing there. We were the ones driving her to the hospital, making all the arrangements. (Lisa)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Some doctors pointed out that since the AN encounters the patient in a different context, new opportunities are provided for the patient, and hence for the GP. Several participants were disappointed that few of the cases “revealed” by the hospital dealt with previously unknown alcohol problems. They knew that there might be patients who were drinking too much while not receiving care insofar as no one had recognised the problem. Participants agreed that the GPs were not able to discover all cases and that a hospital admission might lead to identification of alcohol problems previously not recognised. Another very experienced doctor in a rural district said:
<disp-quote>
<p>But I also believe that the alcohol nurse might probably do us a favour just by identifying people we didn’t imagine could have an alcohol problem, because there are surely some. And it’s self-evident that if we haven’t thought about it, then it’s undiscovered. But we have enough candidates that we’ve thought about and know. (George)</p>

<sec id="section5-1403494812456636">
<title>GPs call for information about patients discharged after alcohol-related hospital admissions</title>
<p>Few of the GPs were aware of the BAI programme offered to patients with alcohol-related conditions by the hospital AN. Some knew that there was a plan for these patients, but not the criteria or indications for the intervention. Participants noted that the only traces of intervention in the hospital reports were statements such as “the patient has seen the AN”, without further information about what had been revealed and what was planned for follow up. Sometimes the hospital reports revealed no signs of intervention at all and hence no visible evidence for the GP that alcohol had been considered relevant for the hospital admission. One doctor told about a patient admitted after an accident. He was not aware of any alcohol problem with regard to this patient; the surgical report did not mention anything; hence the GP did not address alcohol with this patient after the admission either. Only when he later accepted the invitation to the focus group interview did he learn that his patient had received BAI due to an alcohol-related accident. An experienced doctor working in a rural district stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>But it would be nice if it said a little bit, that we got to know a little bit about what kind of alcohol use they’ve had besides this specific episode, to see if it is a problem, or if it has been a chance episode that they drank too much just this night and got into trouble or ended up in hospital. And of course if it’s uncovered that it has been a problem beyond this incident, then it’s nice if [the report] says a little bit about whether the patient wants any help … (Kate)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>All participants wanted more information from the hospital about follow-up recommendations and advice given. Some suggested that the AN’s evaluation should be included in the discharge report, while others requested a specific report. One doctor said that a patient’s expressed need for help, communicated to the GP in the report, might function as a brilliant starting point for the GP. A young doctor working in a small city said:
<disp-quote>
<p>…[-] so once again I would like to emphasise this report from the alcohol nurse, so that one could have some more to work with, really, because we have many, with many of these patients I feel that I have only half the story, and miss the other half. (Daniel)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1403494812456636">
<title>Care pathways for patients with alcohol problems are seen as fragmented</title>
<p>Several participants presented experiences interpreted as signs of low priority in the hospital for addiction disorders, with patients’ pathways being fragmented, leading to poor communication with primary care. Some said that it seemed more or less random whether substance use disorders were dealt with or not during a hospital stay. The GPs wanted the hospital to take on more responsibility for addiction disorders before discharging the patients, because – according to the seriousness of the problem – the hospital ought to act in the same way as when other serious conditions are identified. One GP, working in a city, said:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think, in the hospital, almost as if a colon cancer was detected, like, so directly … “chunk, chunk, chunk, this is so big, you have to accept this”, then of course we might get more out of it. But if it is a counselling session like, like, then I think we get just the ordinary “no, it’s really not a problem, so, I’ll deal with this myself … I have control.” And then they go home and then we’re just at the same spot until the next episode. (Roger)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Some GPs pointed out the importance of advice from the hospital and primary care being consistent. A doctor from a rural district, who told about a severely ill patient with pancreatitis, said:
<disp-quote>
<p>And he feels now that the surgeon has said that he may drink (a few beers) and I say no. And I believe he would have been responsive, very responsive, had he, had the surgeon maybe considered bringing the alcohol nurse to one of the sessions. I would really want that. (Lisa)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1403494812456636">
<title>Alcohol-related hospital admissions may function as an eye-opener for the patient</title>
<p>Various stories illustrated how the unique context of an alcohol-related admission could motivate the patient for change. One doctor told about a patient for whom all prior attempts to address alcohol had been futile, until the patient realised the full extent of the problem after being admitted with a stroke. Another described how the drama entailed in an alcohol-related admission presented an opportunity for intervention. An experienced doctor working in a town told about a patient with several admissions to somatic ward for alcohol intoxication, often followed by an admission to psychiatric ward:
<disp-quote>
<p>And then we talked about it. And I said “can’t you see that it’s every time you drink that you become, that you want to kill yourself and everything is absolutely horrible, because you’re not like that when you’re not drinking”. Yes, that was true, yes, he shouldn’t drink any more. And he has almost stayed [sober] after that, and he has become a completely different man. (Kate)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Several participants had experienced follow up as most proficient when the patient had been sufficiently motivated to make an appointment on his or her own. Some GPs explained how they deliberately took the opportunity to arrange a new visit for blood tests, or tests for other chronic disorders such as COPD or arthritis, to increase the likelihood that the patient would attend. Calling the patient for blood tests, and then addressing the drinking problem in the consultation because of its clinical relevance, was seen as better than calling the patient for a consultation concerning alcohol use. Follow up would be much simpler, several participants said, if the hospital had emphasised more to the patients that they had a serious somatic problem that needed attendance. One experienced doctor working in a city said:
<disp-quote>
<p>So I feel when it comes to those we know about, I feel that a hospital admission often presents an opportunity to, in a way, once again address the problem. So because you have something tangible, something, once in a while there’s something physical caused by the alcohol; that’s in a way, a good starting point to bring up the subject. But I rarely feel it leads to anything. So if it’s your own limitations or it’s related to the system […] From this starting point to arrive at something that really improves the patient’s situation, that I find difficult. (Roger)</p>

<sec id="section8-1403494812456636" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>GPs complain of deficient communication with hospital staff about alcohol interventions performed and a lack of integrated care pathways. Still, alcohol-related hospital admissions constitute windows of opportunity for change. Below, we discuss the strengths and limitations of the study design and the impact of our findings.</p>
<sec id="section9-1403494812456636">
<title>Exploring experiences: sample and validity</title>
<p>Focus groups were chosen since this design is suited for the study of attitudes and experiences, with the interactions within the groups helping to uncover social values and cultural norms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812456636">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812456636">10</xref>]. Our sample of GPs departed from events initiated by their patients. It might be objected that GPs who signed in for the focus groups were more than usually interested in alcohol problems. However, among eligible GPs the majority accepted the invitation. Our sample was diverse, although with a majority of elderly male GPs, which is consistent with the national distribution of age and gender in general practice, hence supporting the external validity of our findings. The Norwegian system, with mainly public owned hospitals and mainly self-employed GPs has many similarities with the system in several other countries, first of all the other Nordic countries, but also the Netherlands and the UK, which further strengthens the external validity of our findings.</p>
<p>Recommendations for sample size in focus group interviews diverge, with two to five groups being commonly conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812456636">11</xref>]. Yet most authors point out that there is no magic number. The important question is whether the sample contains a sufficient amount and variety of events to answer the research question adequately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812456636">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812456636"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812456636">14</xref>]. Very few of the participants knew about the BAI programme, and from direct contact in the recruiting process with a majority of the 49 GPs, we knew that this was representative for all eligible GPs. After the second interview we concluded that the stories presented were mainly in the range of the stories from the first group. We then decided that a responsible analysis, drawing on a substantial presentation of relevant events, could be undertaken from the available empirical data.</p>
<p>Our aim was to describe and discuss GPs’ follow-up experiences from this specific context, not to evaluate the BAI programme. Still, most of the participants were neither aware of the BAI nor of their patients’ enrolment in this programme before the focus group invitation informed them about this. Therefore, the stories from the focus groups dealt more with GPs’ experiences of standard follow-up procedures and their wishes toward the hospital than with their attitudes toward the specific programme, thus adding to the external validity of the conclusions.</p>
<p>The GPs described the interaction between themselves and the hospital ward around these patients as limited. The discussions contained much information about how quality of care could be improved by means of better communication, representing substantiated wishes based on unsatisfactory experiences. Analysis convinced us that the participating GPs did not glorify their follow-up actions, since what they discussed was clearly accounted for as deficient and calling for improvements. We know from previous research that GPs are reluctant to apply screening as a method to identify risky or harmful drinking, but that they accept responsibility for dealing with alcohol-related health problems, even though they may struggle both with diagnosis and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812456636">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812456636">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812456636"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812456636"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812456636">18</xref>].</p>
<p>The study was initiated by one GP who was responsible for the BAI programme (KO) and another GP who himself had experienced the challenges of follow up with regard to this group of patients within the context of the BAI programme (TGL). These positions might have enhanced defensive attitudes; partly on behalf of the hospital and partly by identifying with participating GPs’ limited interaction with the hospital. If so, there would probably have been less critical questions and answers during the interviews than we actually saw. Our analysis was also supported by critical perspectives from authors who were not part of the actual service area or responsible for the BAI programme (BP and KM). The range of age, gender, and profession among the authors would also prevent a unilateral view of the situation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1403494812456636">
<title>Why are pathways of care fragmented?</title>
<p>We are not the first to demonstrate that lifestyle-related health problems are judged by patients and doctors as suitable starting points for addressing change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812456636">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812456636">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812456636"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812456636">21</xref>], with BAI as a potential tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812456636">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812456636">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812456636">23</xref>]. The starting point in our study is a patient experiencing a serious, alcohol-related health incident. We might therefore expect that this situation leads to effective interventions. Yet this is often not the case. Our study supports existing research about deficient collaboration between hospitals and GPs regarding patients with lifestyle problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494812456636">24</xref>].</p>
<p>The present study adds to previous knowledge by indicating various explanations, as perceived by the GPs, of why a “window of opportunity” after an alcohol-related admission is missed. We demonstrate deficient communication to the effect that patients without a previously unrecognised alcohol problem may remain unnoticed by the GP after hospital admission, thus often preventing the patient from receiving adequate health care from his or her GP after discharge from the hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812456636">25</xref>]. The participants in our study viewed implementation of guidelines for diagnosis, assessment, and management of harmful drinking and alcohol dependence as hampered as a result of fragmented pathways of care. Our results deal with the interface between hospital and primary care, and, as described earlier, there are also other explanations to the suboptimal identification and treatment of alcohol problems in general practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812456636">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812456636">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812456636">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Problems faced by the GPs in our study include lacking or sparse information regarding alcohol-related status, intervention, and plans for follow up, and that they are sometimes not even informed about the fact that an intervention was given. Participants suggested that the hospital does not take the same responsibility for addiction disorders compared to other serious illnesses. The GPs called for clarification of shared responsibility across service levels.</p>
<p>BAI seems to be less efficient outside hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812456636">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812456636">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494812456636">27</xref>]. GPs play an important role in lifestyle intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494812456636">24</xref>]. According to the GPs in our study a joint venture across levels of care requires that they together with the hospital represent a consistent unit, emphasising the seriousness of the problem. This is in line with a network perspective, emphasising the need to see coordinated care delivery as a common product, across levels of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494812456636">28</xref>]. Since they sometimes feel as if they are the only one who cares, GPs may find alcohol-related consultations time consuming and demanding but still recognise responsibility for this group of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812456636">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812456636">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812456636">29</xref>].</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that GPs, despite the above-mentioned obstacles, see many opportunities for improved collaboration across levels of care. They believe that a number of patients with alcohol-related admissions probably would have remained undetected in general practice, and that the hospital context should be better utilised. Improving these pathways of care according to guidelines requires attention to the obstacles presented above, to prevent diffusion of responsibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494812456636">28</xref>]. A promising strategy might be a joint responsibility across levels of care to translate guidelines into locally defined integrated care pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494812456636">30</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Hospital admittances provide important opportunities for change, but hospital care is seen as fragmented and poorly communicated to the GPs. For shared responsibility and follow up, all participating agents, including the patient, must be sufficiently informed about what has happened and what will follow. For the patients, hospital admittance is usually brief, while the relationship with their GP is long term, even lifelong. GPs are therefore key partners for programme development.</p>
