<abstract>
<p>Significant minority populations confer richness and diversity to British society. Responsive end-of-life care is a universal need that has ascended the public agenda following myriad reports of inadequate provision. Nevertheless, the potential exists for unwitting discrimination when caring for terminally ill patients on the basis of their religion or faith. Recent implementation of the Equality Act 2010, together with the government and professional initiatives, promises to positively impact upon this area of contemporary relevance and concern, although the extent to which facilitative policies can truly enhance patient care will depend upon how these are translated into care at the bedside. The contributions of health professionals will be central in meeting the challenges and seizing the opportunities for meeting the religion and faith interests of patients of South Asian descent.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Contemporary British society includes followers of a range of religious and secular beliefs, and while diversity undoubtedly enriches modern life, it can nevertheless present ideological and pragmatic challenges for health professionals and organisations in their efforts to provide personalised care for the dying. Despite Britain’s commitment to equality and inclusivity, some individuals, such as those who are older, the disabled and those from minority ethnic backgrounds, tend to experience inequitable access to health services and receive lesser standards of health care generally, as well at the end of life.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012455567">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The provision of personalised care for patients who are dying can present difficult and seemingly intractable dilemmas of profound significance for patients, the bereaved and health professionals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012455567">2</xref>
</sup> End-of-life care is wider in its application than end-stage cancer and encompasses the care of terminally ill patients with kidney failure and other chronic conditions, such as diabetes, connective tissue and cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>Decisions such as whether to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment, to palliate symptoms or to even initiate terminal sedation may well require consideration of a patient’s religion and belief. Perceived, or real, inability to perform end-of-life rituals of religious significance can have negative and enduring repercussions that are significant in that spiritual needs are often unrecognised by health professionals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012455567">3</xref>
</sup> Willingness to embrace an approach that recognises and respects the inner motivations and beliefs that underpin symbolic expression of faith can be expected to positively enhance the care of the dying.</p>
<p>This article considers the opportunities for meeting the potential challenges of providing personalised end-of-life care for patients of South Asian descent who follow the traditional faiths of Hinduism, Islam and Sikhism. In this context, ‘faith’ is used to signify ‘complete trust or confidence; a strong belief in a religion or system of religious belief’<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012455567">4</xref>
</sup> and ‘religion’ as a system of faith and worship that reflects an underlying spirituality and interpretation of either ‘God’ or ultimate reality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012455567">5</xref>
</sup> South Asians have been chosen as the focus of this article since they are currently the largest minority ethnic group in England and Wales.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012455567">6</xref>
</sup> Recently introduced equality laws are considered alongside professional and policy initiatives intended to enhance respect for the dignity of persons and to promote equality of opportunity in the context of care of the dying and the bereaved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0969733012455567">
<title>South Asians: the traditional faiths</title>
<p>According to the 2001 Census, 2.8% of the population of England and Wales is Muslim, 1% is Hindu and 0.6% is Sikh.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012455567">7</xref>
</sup> These figures compare with the sizable majority (71.8%) who consider themselves to be Christian. Those of no religious affiliation amounted to 15.1%, and 0.5% were Jewish and 0.3% were Buddhist. Although 7.8% of the population chose not to respond, these figures indicate that the majority subscribes to an identifiable system of belief that is significant in that allegiance to a faith is likely to influence individualism, liberty and perceptions of human dignity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012455567">8</xref>
</sup> Western liberal philosophies typically permit reasonable pluralism in recognition that personal identification within a circumscribed group can be fundamental to personal well-being. Religious convictions tend to provide a collective morality and guiding philosophy that can be a source of meaningful psychological support at critical times such as end of life. Nevertheless, irrespective of their faith and belief, many live with considerable uncertainty about death and the dying process and vacillate between conviction and doubt. Others will have a supreme faith in redemption and resurrection after death, a conviction that there is no life hereafter, or perhaps the belief that obsessing with thoughts of personal death merely clouds the perfect nothingness (or nirvana) that is being itself. For the devout, faith can make death seem less awful in that it is less final, or else, all the more terrifying on account of prospects of eternal damnation. Faith and belief are sometimes thought to offer a way of coping with the omnipresent fear of death, although evidence suggests otherwise. Lawton, for example, discovered no significant difference in the coping skills of the terminally ill patients who claimed to be religious, compared with others,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012455567">9</xref>
</sup> a conclusion previously reached by Kübler-Ross.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733012455567">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While a detailed study of the main faiths of South Asian patients is outside the remit of this article, several predominant characteristics are summarised. Hinduism is the third-largest world religion after Christianity and Islam and is recognised as the oldest faith. Its sects include Jainism, the Shaivas, the Swarinarayans and the Vaisnavas, each with their own sets of beliefs and modes of expression. Followers live a life of morality and worship and comply with a code of duty and conduct in the hope that their soul will be released from Sansāra or the cycle of birth and rebirth. Decisions about the treatment of, or its withdrawal from, terminally ill patients who lack capacity will tend to be made by the head of the family, and collective decision-making tends to be a pervasive and enduring norm.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012455567">11</xref>
</sup> Following death, an oil lamp may be lit near the body, which is normally cremated within 24 hours of death.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012455567">12</xref>
</sup> The devout Hindu will usually prefer to die at home.</p>
<p>Sikhism is a monotheistic religion characterised by belief in reincarnation. The reading of hymns from the Holy Scriptures, known as the Guru Granth Sahib, may provide solace to the dying. Following death, the body is wrapped in plain white cloth, and for the devout, the ‘5ks’ should remain on the body. These are the Kirpan (ceremonial sword), the Kesh (the uncut hair and beard), the Kangha (comb in the hair), the Kara (steel bracelet worn on the right wrist), and the Kachha (being the short pants or undergarment).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012455567">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Some followers of South Asian faiths believe that prolonging the dying process, particularly where this interferes with clarity of consciousness, ought to be avoided. The definitive aim of the enlightened Hindu, for example, is freedom from the transmigratory wheel of birth and rebirth, which is attained by enlightenment. According to this belief, the soul, or ‘Atman’, is distinct from the mortal body. Death is accompanied by liberation of the Atman, which can exit the body at several levels. When it leaves through the highest part of the body (such as the cranium), that individual is more likely to be freed from the cycle of rebirth, and this prospect will be further enhanced if the dying individual retains competent awareness. Impairment of consciousness, by comparison, might mean that the soul leaves the body at a lower level with consequent prospects of rebirth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012455567">14</xref>
</sup> Awareness of beliefs such as these, if present, might usefully factor into decisions such as those that pertain to terminal pain relief and sedation.</p>
<p>For followers of Islam, death marks the transition from one life to the next. Human action is judged according to its underlying intention, which means that in the context of terminal pain relief, the principle of double effect, whereby a moral distinction is drawn between the consequences of intended actions compared with those that are foreseen, though not intended, may be considered legitimate. Periodic ritual fasting is a prevailing characteristic of the faithful. During Ramadan, for example, although the seriously ill are not expected to fast, many will choose to do so.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012455567">13</xref>
</sup> Given that fasting requires bodily abstinence from all substances (including injections and intravenous infusions), this may have implications for terminal care. Early consultation with the local imam can help the patient to ascertain whether fasting will bring spiritual benefits. The dying Muslim may prefer to sit or lie towards Mecca, and it is customary for another Muslim, usually a relative, to whisper the declaration of faith into the person’s ear.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012455567">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Since it is customary for dying Muslims to receive numerous visits from family and friends, restricted organisational visiting policies can cause upset. Ward regimes that permit patients a maximum of two visitors at any given time might have been introduced in order to enhance privacy and reduce noise and the over-fatigue of patients. But for cultures where care is considered to be the responsibility of the family, failing to visit might be tantamount to abandonment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733012455567">15</xref>
</sup> Following death, the body is washed and buried ideally within 24 h, a religious requirement that can be problematic for Muslims living in non-Islamic societies.</p>
<p>For Western societies, the standards aspired to in health care will include ideals such as respect for self-determined choice, independence and access to state-of-the-art technology. These fundamental values may sit uneasily with those of collectivist and holistic faith communities. By way of example, disclosure of the presence of terminal ill health, out of respect for a patient’s autonomy, may be considered detrimental on the premise that revelation leads to loss of hope. Relatives and friends might implore health professionals to withhold disclosure of a terminal prognosis, and requests to adopt a beneficent paternalist approach can create significant ethical tensions for nurses and clinicians who subscribe to typical Western ideologies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012455567">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Faith operates as a normative force and obliges followers to act in particular ways. When embedded in culture, it can influence profoundly personal conceptions of how the dying ought to be treated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733012455567">16</xref>
</sup> Optimal care and communication can be impeded significantly since the faithful may be unable to explain their actions and beliefs to others. Recognition that faith, as a subjective truth, can be incomprehensible to others and impervious to reason is not a recent phenomenon.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012455567">17</xref>
</sup> Expecting the faithful to explain and rationalise their beliefs and preferences may be to ask too much since inherent motivations cannot always be communicated in absolute and objective terms, even without the possible addition of confounding factors such as cultural and linguistic barriers.</p>
<p>Typical Western societies that adopt ‘individualistic’ philosophical approaches tend to see death as final and the dying process as liminal. Faiths that espouse concepts of death based upon cycles of renewal may adopt a more flexible perspective with dying and death viewed as a necessary aspect of being an essential member of the wider community.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733012455567">18</xref>
</sup> For the devout Hindu, for example, the death of a person acts to renew the entire cosmic order,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012455567">19</xref>
</sup> which could conceivably offer some consolation to the dying and bereaved.</p>

<title>The faith of health professionals</title>
<p>The diversity of British population means that patients and their doctors might not share the same faith and ethnic background. Nonetheless, while the nursing<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012455567">20</xref>
</sup> and medical populations<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733012455567">21</xref>
</sup> of Britain are predominantly White, the proportion of doctors of South Asian descent is higher than in the general population with fewer Christians and more Hindus and Muslims.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733012455567">22</xref>
</sup> This is relevant in that the faith of health professionals can influence their approach and willingness to discuss end-of-life options with patients or with their decision-making surrogates. The Code of Practice of the Nursing and Midwifery Council does not refer to the faith or religious belief of its constituent members, although tangential reference is made that believers should avoid proselytising their faith.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733012455567">23</xref>
</sup> The General Medical Council more directly expects doctors to set aside their personal beliefs where ‘necessary to provide care in line with the principles of Good Medical Practice’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733012455567">24</xref>
</sup> A consultation exercise seems likely to follow on the interpretation of this guidance following a recent complaint about a general practitioner who discussed his Christian beliefs with a patient during a clinical consultation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733012455567">25</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Seale suggests that the faith or beliefs of doctors can influence the extent to which information is disclosed to patients, such as the availability of procedures to which they themselves object on religious or moral grounds. Clinicians, who described themselves as very or extremely religious, were less likely to have discussed decisions that were accompanied by an expectation, or a measure of intent, to hasten death or administer terminal sedation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733012455567">26</xref>
</sup> Others have suggested that health professionals ought to disclose their moral or conscientious objections to patients in order to permit early referral to another practitioner should this be necessary.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733012455567">27</xref>
</sup> Seale argues, on empirical grounds, that it is similarly plausible for the secular to disclose their own partiality since they are more likely to take decisions that include some intent to end life or to administer terminal sedation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733012455567">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Health professionals’ personal faith and belief has the potential to influence their practice, and a balance must be struck between their rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion alongside those of their patients. While acknowledgement and reflection of carers’ personal values seems laudable, its implications as a policy initiative are problematic. While frank disclosure might facilitate the exercise of a patient’s self-determined choice, such obligations could infringe the human rights and privacy of health professionals. A better approach might be to implement targeted educational initiatives designed to enhance self-awareness of professionals to the extent to which religious and secular values can impact upon the provision of end-of-life care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0969733012455567">
<title>The law</title>
<p>The law regulates and circumscribes the practice of nursing as well as the need to respect the faith and diversity of the patients. Specific examples include recent equality reform, human rights jurisprudence, tort liability and the duty of confidentiality. In addition to the law are the professional and regulatory guidelines and Codes of Conduct.</p>
<p>In Britain, although anti-discrimination legislation in respect of race has existed for many years, evidence of inequalities linked to ethnic origin and cultural background persists. Following the death of Stephen Lawrence, the Macpherson Report defined institutional racism as the
<disp-quote>
<p>collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin [that] can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733012455567">29</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote> The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 followed, which, among other things, established a positive duty on public sector organisations to promote equality and positive relationships between racial groups and to eradicate discrimination. More recently, since April 2011, the Equality Act 2010 obliges public authorities to give due regard to a range of ‘protected characteristics,’ including ‘religion or belief (or none)’ in the performance of their functions. The Act extends to service delivery and means that health-care providers must deliver services in a responsive and flexible manner to ensure that those with protected characteristics receive equivalent standards of care when measured against appropriate comparators.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733012455567">30</xref>
</sup> Service users are protected when requesting a service, as well as during service provision, and persons and organisations that deliver health care have a duty to make reasonable adjustments.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733012455567">31</xref>
</sup> In order to receive statutory protection, a person’s religion or belief would need to affect his or her choices or lifestyle. The duty of equality incorporates general and specific duties and includes the need to eliminate discrimination, harassment and victimisation as well as advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations between different groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733012455567">32</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The Statutory Code of Practice on Services, Public Functions and Associations provides definitive guidance on the operation of the Equality Act together with a range of illustrative examples of direct and indirect discriminations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733012455567">33</xref>
</sup> The fundamental concept of proportionality is explained together with the need for adjustments to be made for those with a disability as defined by the Act. The otherwise comprehensive Code has, however, missed an opportunity in failing to provide scenarios of relevance to end-of-life care in respect of any of the protected characteristics including religion or belief.</p>
<p>Pluralism will, at times, justify differential treatment of faith groups in order to promote harmony and social justice. Legal mechanisms, such as judicial review proceedings, are available to formally advance human rights, protect against discrimination and safeguard diversity and equality of opportunity. The duty upon public authorities recognises that differential treatment may be necessary in specific circumstances in order to achieve this. The Equality and Human Rights Commissioner can take action against authorities that fail to comply following service of a compliance notice, and the equality duty can be used to challenge the positions of public bodies such as National Health Service (NHS) Trusts, which have a statutory duty to make reasonable adjustments in service provision.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733012455567">31</xref>
</sup> The advancement of the equality agenda is undoubtedly a positive development, albeit one that requires professional and sensitive implementation in order to effect real change.</p>
<p>The moral justification for respect for religious liberty and for its protection in law can be argued from two sides.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733012455567">34</xref>
</sup> The validity of religious freedom is based upon equality of concept between religion and non-religion and argues against conferment of privilege upon religious perspectives and their manifestation. The alternative approach is that religious freedom must be protected on the grounds that religion has intrinsic and inherent values.</p>
<p>An application of the former approach would operate to prevent faith and belief from being selected for protection against discrimination. In the context of end-of-life care, the compassionate approach would be to flexibly consider the personal needs of each patient as opposed to the application of rule-based organisational processes designed for the avoidance of discrimination on the basis of faith and belief. This approach would similarly prevent religious belief from receiving all-embracing positive protection. On this basis, the touchstone for decision-making would be that of equality of persons, as opposed to respect for diversity of faith.</p>
<p>The alternative approach calls for respect and recognition of religion and belief as inherently valuable and as such serves to justify respect for freedom of belief and its manifestation. One of the myriad problematic issues is the wide variation in the practices of religion and belief particularly in respect of systems that involve theist and non-theist divinities. The court, for example, has found that distilling the irreducible core of two divergent religions is not simple.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733012455567">35</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Freedom of religion and belief is part of the United Kingdom’s obligations under international law, and human rights jurisprudence provides a potentially significant form of statutory protection. Article 9(1) of the European Convention of Human Rights and Freedoms provides that
<disp-quote>
<p>Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance.</p>
</disp-quote> The substantive right is qualified by Article 9(2) in that
<disp-quote>
<p>Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
</disp-quote> Nonetheless, not all spiritual beliefs are protected by Article 9, and member states are afforded discretion as to how these rights are protected. Considerable latitude, or margin or appreciation, is typically granted by the Commission and the European Court of Human Rights since no universal approach exists to the nature of the relationship between member states and the Church. The right to freedom and non-discrimination on the basis of religion is further protected by Article 14. Other Articles that could engage are Article 8 (respect for private and family life), Article 10 (freedom of expression) and Article 11 (freedom of association and peaceful assembly).</p>
<p>Direct discrimination occurs when a person is treated less favourably than another because of a protected characteristic, such as the faith or belief that he or she holds or is thought to hold. It can also occur because a person associates with another who has the protected characteristic. To determine whether treatment is less favourable, a comparison is made with those who do not share the protected characteristic and where no other material difference exists between the circumstances of each case. Indirect discrimination is also a possibility against those of minority faiths in end-of-life care and can occur without any conscious intent of health professionals. A multitude of apparently neutral health-care practices can disproportionately impact upon South Asian patients such as lack of single-sex wards, rigid ward routines, visiting restrictions and lack of accommodation for relatives, to list but a few. For the courts, the need to acknowledge and respect the voice of the minority has been recognised on several occasions. In <italic>Singh</italic>, Munby stated that ‘we live, or strive to live, in a tolerant society increasingly alive to the need to guard against the tyranny which majority opinion may impose on those who, for whatever reason, comprise a weak or voiceless minority’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0969733012455567">36</xref>
</sup> Prevailing political and legal systems endeavour to accommodate the needs and aspirations of the majority with laws that tend to be portrayed in neutral tones that often (quite successfully) obscure their predominantly Westernised Christian religious underpinnings and values. Furthermore, at the level of the individual carers, personal views of ethics and morality can manifest in less than transparent ways.</p>
<p>The Court’s recognition of the central significance of faith in determining the future care of a patient was evident in <italic>Ahsan</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969733012455567">37</xref>
</sup> The case concerned a woman of South Asian origin who had been left in a persistent vegetative state following negligently performed elective surgery. While the Trust accepted liability, the matter of appropriate compensation was at issue since significantly higher levels of damages would be required if the Claimant was to be cared for at home, rather than in a nursing home. The Claimant’s argument was that since she and her family were devout Muslims, nursing care in accordance with her faith would not be possible outside the home environment. In finding for the Claimant, Justice Hegarty held that meeting the woman’s best interests, even though she was insensate, required that she should be cared for at home and in accordance with her faith.</p>
<p>The potential implications for failure to comply with the law can be serious for organisations as well as for individual health professionals. The public sector duty of equality is enforceable by public law rather than conferring a private cause of action on litigants. Although possible, it seems unlikely that the dying, or recently bereaved, would bring an action on account of breach of statutory duty or for judicial review. A more likely response might be a complaint to the organisation, the Care Quality Commission, or to the relevant professional regulatory body.</p>

<title>Recent initiatives in end-of-life care and implications for nurses</title>
<p>Poor end-of-life care, exacerbated by inadequate communication, was identified as a fundamental challenge for the acute sector of the NHS. The Healthcare Commission, as predecessor to the Care Quality Commission, found that more than half of the received complaints related to bereavement and that efforts were necessary to improve end-of-life care.<sup>

<p>In recent years, a range of national policy initiatives have focused on end-of-life care. The Government’s End of Life Care Strategy, for example, has the overall aim of promoting high-quality care for adults who are dying.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012455567">3</xref>
</sup> The central role of the delivery arm of the Strategy, the National End of Life Care Programme, has been to identify and share best practice in order to empower and support health professionals in the delivery of care. Other notable initiatives that emphasise the centrality of spirituality and faith include the <italic>Liverpool Care Pathway</italic>,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969733012455567">40</xref>
</sup> the <italic>Gold Standards Framework</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733012455567">41</xref>
</sup> and the <italic>Preferred Priorities for Care</italic> tool,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0969733012455567">42</xref>
</sup> all of which have been endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence as testament to their evidence base. Guidance on faith and belief is also provided by the Multi-faith Group for Healthcare Chaplaincy,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0969733012455567">43</xref>
</sup> although data protection provisions mean that information about patients’ religious affiliation cannot be disclosed to chaplains without patients’ consent. To date, however, most otherwise commendable initiatives have focused on the physical and psychological aspects of care in preference to religion and faith.</p>
<p>The need to consider the faith and religion of patients at the end of their lives is well recognised.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0969733012455567">44</xref>
</sup> The notion of a ‘good death’, however, tends to be culturally predicated, and it is unfortunate that failure to appreciate the subtleties of religious belief has meant that some patients have not always received the best possible care. The provision of otherwise high-quality nursing on the assumption of its universal appropriateness can be to fail certain patients and the bereaved at their time of need.</p>
<p>Optimal care of the dying requires empathetic approaches that are tailored to myriad factors that include respect for faith and belief. Well meaning yet stereotypical responses are to be avoided merely because a patient who categorises himself or herself as belonging to a South Asian group will not necessarily indicate his or her faith. Certain practices and rituals followed by some proponents of a religion may not be followed by each and every member. Although a patient’s self-categorisation as a Hindu, Muslim or Sikh may be definitive, labels such as these may be used to indicate loyalty to a kindred community rather than any devout allegiance to a particular faith or religion. Therefore, while self-categorisation can be a useful start for a discussion, by itself it may be redundant. These potentially confounding situations seem likely to increase with the encroachment of acculturation, whereby minority groups assume steadily the ethos and values of the predominant culture.</p>
<p>Religious groups are characterised typically by an orthodox and a progressive wing, and variations are ubiquitous, particularly in pluralist societies. Understanding the faith and beliefs of patients, particularly at end of life, can be a real challenge albeit one of unquestionable value. Since communication is the crux, the presence of a trained and independent translator may be necessary, although resource constraints might be expected to engage. Recently, in Holland, for example, contracts for translation services in health care are to be withdrawn on the grounds of cost containment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0969733012455567">45</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the quest to provide personalised care to dying patients of South Asian origin, factors other than faith and belief may challenge health professionals. These include metaphysical considerations of conceptions of duty, attitudes towards death and suffering and, for some, an evident preference for collective or familial decision-making. When patients lack capacity, issues such as these become all the more abstruse. For incompetent adults, the empathetic recognition and respect of their faith and belief will be a necessary consideration in the ascertainment of their best interests. Section 1(5) of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 requires that an act done, or decision made, for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done, or made, in that person’s best interests and according to the least restrictive principle. Section 4 identifies the factors to be considered in determining best interests and includes the beliefs and values that would have been likely to influence the patient’s decision if he or she had retained capacity. Evidence of religious affiliations and cultural background might be gleaned from the patient’s previous wishes, where known, any advance decision, or the input of a welfare attorney,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0969733012455567">46</xref>
</sup> although the extent to which the ideology of advance care planning is supported by those of South Asian descent is doubtful.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012455567">11</xref>
</sup> In any event, wherever possible, engagement of the views of the patient’s family and significant others ought to be obtained.</p>
<p>The traditional nursing syllabus has inadequately provided for the transcultural aspects of care. Few students have any real opportunity to learn of characteristic cultural death rites such as the tendency for close family of terminally ill Muslims to maintain constant vigils,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0969733012455567">47</xref>
</sup> Sikhs who communicate psychological upset as ‘pain in the heart’<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0969733012455567">48</xref>
</sup> and the preference of some Hindu patients to die as close to the floor as possible.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0969733012455567">49</xref>
</sup> Responsive care needs to recognise faith and belief as the basis of religious symbolism that can bring solace and reduce spiritual pain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733012455567">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Faith and religious belief undoubtedly influence personal attitudes and responses to health care. Hermeneutics, as the willingness to understand the experience of human behaviour and society, can promote tolerance and understanding of patient beliefs that deviate from the majority view. It can readily highlight that positions of supposed neutrality in health-care environments can be underpinned, albeit usually unconsciously, by Western cultural doctrine.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Freedom of faith and conscience are central features of liberal democracies and permit each individual to be the author of his or her own life. Whether the faith of any individual reflects the truth, or is correct, cannot be ascertained since ideals of faith are founded upon metaphysical convictions that are impervious to empirical study. Health-care organisational processes, structures and routines can have the unintentional effect of discriminating against members of certain faith groups even if individual health professionals do not. Lack of awareness of culture, religion and faith, together with stereotypical perspectives and prejudice can lead to institutional discrimination evidenced by inappropriate services and facilities, lack of access, and negative staff attitudes that can serve to discriminate against those who follow the minority ethnic faiths.</p>
<p>Every patient has a prima facie right to protection against acts that offend against his or her cultural identity, although the orthodox view in a multicultural liberal society has been that legal protection should not extend to mere insults to feelings associated with faith and cultural values. Nonetheless, whether this approach can be justified when caring for the dying seems questionable since particular kinds of offences to feelings will align with cultural values and norms.</p>
<p>The faith perspective of patients is an essential consideration for the promotion and safeguarding of human rights. Although a range of issues remain unexplored, robust and responsive policy initiatives together with educational campaigns will assist in furthering this critical agenda. For nurses, the guiding principle ought perhaps to be the promotion of fairness and equity, rather than equality for all, and to be achieved by treating each patient as a unique individual with his or her own specific needs.</p>
