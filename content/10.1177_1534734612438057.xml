<abstract>
<p>The term <italic>lymphology</italic> includes both the physiology and the pathology of the lymphatic system. Many disciplines are involved in the study of the lymphatic system, to correctly diagnose lymphatic diseases and to ultimate provide the best available treatment for the patient. Lymphedema is one of the most common lymphatic diseases, potentially causing significant problems for the patient and for the health system in general. The aim of this article is to discuss the best placement and role for each discipline within an interdisciplinary team in order to provide an effective management of lymphedema and related lymphatic diseases.</p>

<body>
<p>The main functions of the lymph drainage system are the regulation of fluid content in the interstitium, the stabilization of physiological protein concentrations, and the regulation of the chemical environment, that is, the maintenance of homeostasis in the interstitium. The interstitium consists of cellular and extracellular compartments. The cellular compartment is made up of not only fibroblasts, macrophages, lymphocytes, and heparin-secreting mast cells but also vascular and neurogenic structures, in particular the endothelium cells of the blood and lymph capillaries. The extracellular compartment is made up of the free protein-rich fluid of the matrix, collagen, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and enzymes such as matrix metalloproteins and so on. Pathological changes in both compartments of the interstitium take place independent of the etiology leading to an insufficiency in the lymph drainage system: Edema results from the raising of fluid content and the typical tissue alterations found in lymphostasis also result from changes to the chemical and cellular makeup. This can be caused by either a disturbance to lymphatic flow or an excessive increase in the production of lymph (restriction of the lymph transport capacity or raising of the lymphatic load).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612438057">1</xref></sup> The most common disease of the lymphatic diseases is lymphedema of the extremities, of the head, or of the genitals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734612438057">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Untreated lymphedema is a chronic disease and may lead to invalidity. Treatment forms for lymphological patients thus encompass prevention, conservative therapy on an inpatient or outpatient basis, rehabilitative or acute medical treatment, surgical therapy, a combination of conservative and surgical measures where required, and palliative therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612438057">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Lymphedema Prevention</title>
<p>Lymphedema risk factors may be present within the lymph drainage system or can result from various diseases associated with disturbances to the microcirculation. The transport capacity of the lymph drainage system is most commonly reduced as a result of cancer treatment or because of traumatic injuries with extensive contusions of the soft tissues. Excessive lymph production is caused by diseases affecting the physiological functional unit of the blood capillaries in the interstitium and the lymph capillaries via endogenic inflammatory mediators or because of the influence of hormones on the water-binding affinity of glycoasminoglycans. Drug side effects are also of mention here.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612438057">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612438057">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Preventative measures are indicated when there is a risk of lymphedema, in postoperative, posttraumatic, and postradiotherapy situations and for hereditary primary lymphedema prior to the manifestation of the edema.</p>
<p>If these lymphedema risk factors are present, the first step is to inform the patient about appropriate lifestyle measures. These encompass the regulation of body weight, the getting of sufficient exercise while avoiding more extreme sports activities which potentially lead to over-exertion and injuries, as well as professional reorientation where required. Manual lymph drainage may be required in series.</p>

<title>Therapy for Manifested Lymphedema</title>
<p>Complex physical decongestive therapy (CDT) may be used exclusively for the treatment of lymphedema that is not associated with other diseases. Combined lymphological diseases, on the other hand, require interdisciplinary treatment. According to statistics of our clinic (Foeldi Clinic), lymphedema is present in its pure form in only 22% of cases; 78% of cases present with various comorbidities.</p>
<p>The therapy is made up of phases. In phase I, the fluid is mobilized and a decrease in the proliferated connective tissue is initiated. Phase II constitutes the prevention of renewed swelling and the optimization of connective tissue reduction. Depending on the degree of the connective tissue proliferation we speak of stage I of lymphedema, whereby the increase in volume is predominantly because of an increase in interstitial fluid, stage II, where the increase in volume is because of both an increase in interstitial fluid content and an increase in connective tissue, and stage III (elephantiasis), where lymphostatic fibrosclerotic tissue alterations dominate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612438057">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612438057">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>If therapy is initiated in stage I of lymphedema, phase I, in which the CDT measures are applied daily, is of short duration. CDT consists of manual lymph drainage (MLD) and lymphological compression bandaging in combination with remedial exercises adapted to the age and general health of the patient, as well as physiotherapy where required, and instructing the patient in self-treatment measures and skin care. Phase II should last for 1 to 2 years with manual lymph drainage 1 to 2 times per week and the wearing of fitted compression stockings. The therapy can be conducted on an outpatient basis, or briefly as inpatient therapy. In stages II and III of lymphedema, the necessity and duration of therapy increases, for both phases I and II. Generally, the patient will require at least 2 to 4 weeks of inpatient treatment. Surgical therapy can be of a reconstructive or additive nature. By reconstructive therapies we mean autological lymph vessel transplantation or lymphovenous shunts. Additive surgical therapy such as dermatolipectomy is conducted after conservative therapy of elephantiastic edema, in addition to surgical treatment of genital lymphedema. Patients with complex therapies naturally require inpatient treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612438057">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Best Place for Each Partner in a Team</title>
<p>The management of lymphological diseases has a multifactorial character with regards to the diagnosis and therapy.</p>
<p>For the management of lymphedema, the cooperation of specialized disciplines is thus required, such as lymphologists, internists, oncologists, angiologists, phlebologists, radiologists, gynecologists, vascular and plastic surgeons, and of course physiotherapists, nurses, sports instructors, and dieticians. Strong and close cooperation between these disciplines secures the best therapeutic effort. Nurses are important members of the specialist medical team in addition to physicians with lymphological expertise. They collaborate directly with physicians and often represent the link between doctors and patients. They must be lymphologically well versed and be able to provide advice on living with lymphedema, communicating to patients which activities are to be avoided, and how to care for their condition. They are the first providers of information for patients and give recommendations on the prevention of lymphedema. Other important partners are physiotherapists and sports instructors. They contribute to the good and effective management of lymphedema not only during but also after the intensive phase of CDT. They spend a good deal of time with patients during and after manual treatment and thus have the advantage of noticing any new problems that may arise, reporting these directly to the physician. They all require training and certification in MLD and compression therapy and special remedial exercise. Psychologists are also integrated in the specialist medical team to support patients in coping with their diagnosis and associated problems, such as potential difficulties within the family, at school, and at work. The patient is, however, the most important partner in the specialist medical team. Patients must be well-informed on every aspect of lymphedema and its treatment, which in turn leads to good compliance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734612438057">Figure 2</xref>). The health system plays an important role as well. Treatment costs must be covered to avoid the progression and complications of lymphedema, which can lead to invalidity.</p>
