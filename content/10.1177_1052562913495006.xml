<p>The identification of threshold concepts allows educators to determine the places in their courses and programs that students are likely to get “stuck” and to design the curriculum, learning activities, assessment, and feedback strategies to help students move through the portal to a transformed understanding. Examples of threshold concepts include opportunity cost in economics, gravity in physics and engineering, depreciation in accounting, and deconstruction for text analysis in English literature. While the potential impact of threshold concepts on educational strategies is well developed in these disciplines, threshold concepts are only beginning to be explored in management education. We see considerable scope for ideas about threshold concepts to further inform both research and pedagogic practice in management education.

Prospective authors and potential reviewers are invited to contact either guest editor about this special issue. The submission deadline is <bold>February 14, 2014</bold>, but earlier submissions for consideration would be welcome from August 1, 2013, onwards.</p>
