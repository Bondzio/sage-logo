<abstract>
<p>We examined whether specialist police training on the dynamics of sexual offending can modify officers’ victim-blaming attitudes and negative perceptions regarding likely case authorization. The sample included 77 Australian police officers specialising in sexual assault investigation. The training, delivered face to face over 4 weeks, included focus on identifying elements of grooming in offending relationships and how these elements can be elicited from victims and suspects within a narrative interviewing framework. Officers’ perceptions of cases were assessed immediately pre- and posttraining using a series of case scenarios. For each scenario, officers rated (on a 10-point Likert-type scale) their confidence that the case should be authorised to proceed to prosecution and the responsibility attributable to the victim. For each case, officers also listed up to 5 factors to justify their case authorization decision. Overall, confidence in case authorization increased from pre- to posttraining, whilst perception of victim “responsibility” decreased. The pattern of results, including the qualitative evidence to justify officers’ decisions, support that the attitude change was due to greater understanding of the dynamics of sexual offending. The implications for police trainers, and directions for future research, are discussed.</p>

<p>Sexual abuse is a prevalent crime, the rate of which continues to rise globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093854813475348">Garcia-Moreno &amp; Watts, 2011</xref>). Conviction rates for sexual offences are low, however, due in large part to high levels of case attrition. Indeed, the rate of attrition in sexual offences is higher than that of all other personal crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093854813475348">Stern, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093854813475348">Victorian Law Reform Commission [VLRC], 2004</xref>). On average, only 14% of all sexual assaults are reported to police organisations, of which only 30% are referred for prosecution. As a consequence of the low reporting and prosecution rates, less than 3% of all sexual assault perpetrators are convicted of their crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093854813475348">Daly &amp; Bouhours, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>One reason that many allegations of actual sexual abuse do not proceed to trial is because there are widespread misconceptions about how sexual offences occur and how victims should behave when they are offended against (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093854813475348">Chapleau &amp; Oswald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093854813475348">Horvath &amp; Brown, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093854813475348">Page, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093854813475348">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093854813475348">Ullman, 2010</xref>). Common perceptions (i.e., “rape myths”) are that “real victims fight back,” “real victims report abuse immediately,” and “real rapes are not committed by persons who the victim knows” when in reality compliance, delayed reporting, and the existence of prior victim–offender relationships are the norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093854813475348">Lievore, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093854813475348">Page, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854813475348">Sleath &amp; Bull, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093854813475348">Ullman, 2010</xref>). Police officers are “gatekeepers” to the criminal justice system (i.e., they determine which cases proceed to prosecution), yet police misconceptions of sexual offences are prevalent irrespective of officer or victim gender, whether the officers specialise in sexual assault investigation, and officer years of service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093854813475348">Jamel, Bull, &amp; Sheridan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854813475348">Schwartz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854813475348">Sleath &amp; Bull, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The relevance of professionals’ misconceptions about how sexual offences occur is that when a victim’s behavior is not consistent with professionals’ prior expectations, this can influence the professionals’ perception of the veracity and strength of the evidence in a manner that is prejudicial for the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093854813475348">Statewide Steering Committee to Reduce Sexual Assault [SSCRSA], 2006</xref>). Perceptions of the veracity and strength of evidence determine whether a case should be pursued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093854813475348">Powell, Murfett, &amp; Thomson, 2010</xref>), and for juries, it determines whether a suspect should be convicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854813475348">Devine, Clayton, Dunford, Seying, &amp; Pryce, 2001</xref>). Even victims’ decisions to pursue a complaint of abuse are influenced by misconceptions about sexual offending dynamics. Attributions of self-blame such as “I should have fought back,” “I should have reported when I first had the opportunity,” and “I should have seen the warning signs” lead victims to withdraw complaints due to fear that their story will not be believed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093854813475348">Jamel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093854813475348">Kelly, Lovett, &amp; Regan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093854813475348">Lievore, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854813475348">Mouzos &amp; Makkai, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093854813475348">van Kesteren, Mayhew, &amp; Nieuwbeerta, 2000</xref>). Feeling supported, listened to, and not judged is of paramount importance to victims, more so than whether their case results in the offender being punished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093854813475348">Powell &amp; Cauchi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093854813475348">VLRC, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Specialised police training targeting knowledge of sexual offending is of paramount importance for reducing the high attrition rates of sexual offences. This conclusion is stated in major government inquiries into sexual offences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093854813475348">Stern, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093854813475348">VLRC, 2004</xref>) as well as independent empirical research. For instance, surveys and in-depth interviews with victims and sexual assault investigators have highlighted an association between rape myths and low prioritisation of, and support for, sexual assault victims during the justice process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093854813475348">Jordan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093854813475348">Kelly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093854813475348">van Kesteren et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, examination of the written justifications for police authorization of sexual abuse cases for prosecution suggests a bias that shares an uncanny resemblance to the public stereotype and myths of how rapes occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093854813475348">Brown, Hamilton, &amp; O’Neill, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093854813475348">Jordan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093854813475348">Powell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093854813475348">Spohn &amp; Tellis, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093854813475348">2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854813475348">Frazier and Haney (1996)</xref>, for example, found that of 569 reported sexual assaults, cases had a higher likelihood of being investigated and authorised for prosecution if the suspect was a stranger, the victim was injured or threatened, and there was evidence of penetration.</p>
<p>The acceptance of rape myths by police officers means that cases that do not fit the stereotype are dismissed as “false reports.” False reports are estimated by officers as between 50% and 80% when the true rate is less than 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854813475348">Lisak, Gardinier, Nicksa, &amp; Cote, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854813475348">Schwartz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093854813475348">SSCRSA, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093854813475348">VLRC, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, evidence is sought, remembered, and compiled by police in a way that supports initial hypotheses regarding the guilt of the suspect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093854813475348">Ask &amp; Granhag, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093854813475348">Hill, Memon, &amp; McGeorge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093854813475348">Rassin, Eerland, &amp; Kuijpers, 2010</xref>). This phenomenon, referred to as confirmation bias, is a fundamental cognitive tendency that impacts performance in almost every professional domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093854813475348">Nickerson, 1998</xref>). In the context of sexual assault investigation, expectations of suspect guilt or innocence can have an effect on questioning style, which in turn can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093854813475348">Hill et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Stereotypes and biases can be tremendously difficult to change in training. Prior studies targeting negative police attitudes have clearly demonstrated this. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813475348">Patterson (2004)</xref>, for example, used a pre-/posttest design to examine the effect of a training course on 81 police recruits’ knowledge and skills of child abuse, as well as the prevalence of negative affect (e.g., anger, disgust, sadness, and discomfort) when reading case vignettes. The reason for targeting these reactions is that they are known to interfere with investigators’ ability to talk objectively with, and support, abusive parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093854813475348">Hazzard &amp; Rupp, 1986</xref>). The child abuse training (part of a larger course delivered in class format over several days) was 8 hours in length and included 1 hour on the dynamics of child abuse and the characteristics of abusive parents. Although the training was associated with improvement in knowledge of child abuse, officers’ perceptions about how they would feel when interacting with an abused child or an abusive parent (as measured by the Child Abuse Survey; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093854813475348">Hazzard &amp; Rupp, 1986</xref>) did not change.</p>
<p>Another study to highlight the difficulty in shifting police attitudes under brief instruction is that by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854813475348">Lonsway, Welch, and Fitzgerald (2001)</xref>, who tested the effectiveness of two sexual assault police training programs. As with the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813475348">Patterson (2004)</xref>, the time devoted to sexual offending dynamics was relatively brief. One program included less than 30 minutes of discussion on sexual offending dynamics, and the other included 2½ hours on the dynamics of sexual offending and the impact on victims. The longer training included a video of a fictional rape of a police officer (to invoke victim empathy) and a role-play with one participant playing a robbery victim being interviewed by the instructor, to demonstrate the impact of interviewer scepticism and blame. For both training programs, attitudes and beliefs that “deny and justify male aggression against women” were measured on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093854813475348">Payne, Lonsway, and Fitzgerald’s (1999)</xref> rape myth acceptance scale,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0093854813475348">1</xref></sup> both before and at various points throughout and after the program. The results showed that neither of the training programs had any effect on police recruits’ acceptance of rape myths, even though the training was effective in improving behavioral performance on several practical skills, including interviewing. The findings are consistent with reviews highlighting the complex array of interrelated social and cognitive processes that underpin attitude change in informational settings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093854813475348">Wood, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study extends the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854813475348">Lonsway et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813475348">Patterson (2004)</xref> by testing the effectiveness of a more intensive, integrated, and interactive training program on sexual offending. The mandatory 4-week course, a foundation training program designed for all police investigators who specialise in sexual assault and sexual child abuse investigation, centres around the “Whole Story” approach to investigation of sexual crime, a model reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093854813475348">Tidmarsh, Powell, and Darwinkel (in press)</xref>. The model proposes that understanding grooming (i.e., the process by which a perpetrator prepares a victim for abuse, by gaining access, compliance, and secrecy) is a central component of the police interview and investigation procedure in cases of sexual assault and sexual child abuse. Specifically, decision-making of investigators, jurors, and legal professionals requires an understanding not only of <italic>what</italic> occurred (i.e., the offence and physical context) but details of <italic>how</italic> the victim came to be in the situation and to respond the way he or she did. These <italic>how</italic> details are elicited by direct enquiry about the offender–victim relationship and the events that occurred leading up to the offence. The dynamics were taught within a variety of different learning modalities, including information sessions, question and answer sessions with actual victims, footage of actual offenders (in the context of therapy) explaining the grooming process, case examples, and role-playing of victims reporting sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Overall, we expected that our intensive training in the dynamics of sexual offending would be associated with (a) significant improvement in awareness of offending dynamics, (b) higher attributions of likely case authorization, and (c) lower attributions of victim responsibility for the offences. We also expected that the improvements would be more obvious for those case scenarios where the evidence against the suspect was ambiguous (i.e., there was no obvious physical or corroborative evidence that indicated the guilt of the suspect, beyond the victims’ report).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>All participants (<italic>N</italic> = 77) were sworn police officers recruited through Victoria Police Service, Australia. The training described in this article was a mandatory course that the participants needed to complete to become specialist investigators in sexual offending and child abuse investigation. The sample was heterogeneous, including members from across the entire state (regional and metropolitan) and from a range of ranks including Senior Constables, Sergeants, and Senior Sergeants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0093854813475348">2</xref></sup> In all, 66% of participants were male and 34% were female. Participants came from a variety of backgrounds, from general duties police officers to criminal-investigation-focused detectives and victim-focused sexual offence investigators. Prior experience in sexual offence investigation ranged from none to more than 20 years. Ethical approval was obtained from the university and police ethics committees. While the course was mandatory, participation in the research evaluation component was voluntary (all professionals agreed to be involved). To protect confidentiality, no identifying information was recorded on the assessment sheets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0093854813475348">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The study adopted a pre-/posttraining design. All participants engaged in the 4-week training course and completed a questionnaire that assessed their perception of cases on Day 1 of the course (prior to the commencement of any educative component) and again on the last day of the training after all the coursework was complete. The questionnaires included 12 scenarios. Immediately after reading each scenario, participants were required to answer a series of four standard questions. They were instructed that there is no right or wrong answer to the questions; judgments were subjective. The details of the training and assessment tasks are described below.</p>
<sec id="section4-0093854813475348">
<title>Training course</title>
<p>The training was delivered over 4 consecutive weeks in classroom format by specialists with backgrounds in the treatment of sex offenders, police investigation of sexual offences, and the impact of sexual abuse on victims. The content focused primarily on the dynamics of sexual offending and interview technique. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093854813475348">Table 1</xref> presents a description of the program including the content areas and their objectives, time allocation, and methods of delivery. The theoretical premise running through the program is that sexual offending occurs within a “relationship” driven and manipulated by offenders and that witness/suspect interviews need to better incorporate the relationship dynamics to enhance the usefulness of these interviews for professional and jury decision making (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093854813475348">Tidmarsh et al., in press</xref>). Specifically, the course included content related to theories and motivations of offending (i.e., how offenders overcome obstacles to offending and the processes of grooming; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093854813475348">Craven, Brown, &amp; Gilchrist, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093854813475348">Howells, 1995</xref>) as well as victim behavior and responses before, during, and after sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093854813475348">Bloom, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854813475348">Levin, 2004</xref>). The elicitation of these elements within a narrative interview process was also covered in detail. Participants were required to demonstrate their knowledge and practical interview skills in various interactive classroom exercises and role-plays.</p>

<title>Questionnaires</title>
<p>The questionnaires contained 12 scenarios (approximately eight lines each) with four standard questions per scenario. The scenarios were based on actual cases; for half, the victims were aged 6 to 17 years, and for the other half, the victims were adults (18 years or over). The cases also differed according to presence of alcohol and drugs, gender of victim/suspect, victim–suspect relationship (e.g., stranger, acquaintance, relative, partner, and caregiver), elements of grooming (e.g., offending games), context of offending (e.g., public, home, party), and reporting time (immediate, delayed, and historical). Two versions of the questionnaire were created (A and B), each containing a unique set of scenarios. Half the officers’ received Questionnaire A prior to the training and Questionnaire B posttraining. For the remaining participants, the order was reversed. In each set of 12 cases, the strength of evidence to support the victim’s allegations also varied; three cases presented strong (i.e., corroborative) evidence, three presented weak evidence (i.e., evidence that contradicts the victim’s account or the suspect is unknown), and the remaining six cases presented ambiguous (little if any) evidence to support the victim’s account beyond the report. Importantly, elements of common misconceptions were included in the case scenarios, such as delayed reporting and perceived compliance with the offender, and these elements were counterbalanced across questionnaires and strength of evidence. An example of an ambiguous case scenario is as follows:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>A 22-year-old girl reports being raped by a man she met at a party. Witnesses saw them “flirting” and dancing together. She states that she agreed to go upstairs with him but told him she wasn’t going to have sex with him. They went into a bedroom and lay on the bed. After some prolonged kissing, he started to take off her clothes. She says that she again told him “No,” but when he took her underwear off anyway, she gave him a condom from her handbag, saying “please use this.” The suspect stated in interview that the sex was consensual.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For each scenario, officers were asked the following questions (in standard order), using 10-point Likert-type scales: (a) “How confident are you that the case will be authorised (proceed) for prosecution?” (from <italic>not at all likely</italic> to <italic>extremely likely)</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0093854813475348">3</xref></sup> and (b) “How much responsibility should be attributed to the victim in this scenario?” (from <italic>none</italic> to <italic>all</italic>). The final question asked officers to justify their rating about case authorization by listing up to five factors (in order of importance) that they considered during their decision-making.</p>

<sec id="section6-0093854813475348">
<title>Coding</title>
<p>The Likert-type ratings were entered directly into SPSS. The factors listed by the officers to justify their authorization decisions were coded in three mutually exclusive ways. First, the <italic>nature</italic> of the factor was noted. These included evidential factors (i.e., the presence of corroborative evidence, and the presence of circumstantial evidence), victim-related factors (i.e., quality of victim disclosure, victim behavior, victims’ credibility, and victims’ wishes for the case), suspect-related factors (i.e., suspects’ admission/denial, suspects’ credibility, and whether the suspects’ identity was known or in question), offence-related factors (i.e., issue of consent, nature of the relationship and grooming processes, and clarity of the offence), and miscellaneous factors that included costs awarded against the police and the prosecution’s public interest test. From the factors listed above, three were identified as relating to the dynamics of sexual offending. These included the presence of corroborative evidence, the victim’s behaviour, and the nature of the relationship (including grooming processes).</p>
<p>Second, each factor listed by the officers was coded as either a positive or negative comment. Examples of positive and negative comments for the three factors related to dynamics of offending are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0093854813475348">Table 2</xref>. Third, the priority given to each factor was noted. Five points was awarded to the first factor to be listed, 4 points for the second factor, 3 points for the third factor, 2 points for the fourth, and 1 point for the fifth.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The results are presented in three sections. First, we present the correlations between officers’ ratings of case authorization and victim responsibility. Although we are primarily interested in pre- and posttraining changes in rating, this analysis is interesting because the argument for conducting the training was based on an implied negative correlation between these factors that (to date) has not been directly tested. Second, 2 (Strength of Evidence; Strong, Ambiguous, Weak) × 2 (Time; Pre- vs. Posttraining) analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted on case authorization and victim responsibility ratings, with both independent measures being manipulated within subjects. Third, a series of paired samples <italic>t</italic> tests compared the factors listed in participants’ case authorization decisions pre- and posttraining.</p>
<sec id="section8-0093854813475348">
<title>Relationship Between Ratings of Victim Responsibility and Case Authorization</title>
<p>Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficients were computed to compare the relationship between victim responsibility and brief authorization pre- and posttraining. There was a moderate negative relationship between victim responsibility and brief authorization both before, <italic>r</italic>(77) = -.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 (two-tailed), and after training, <italic>r</italic>(75) = -.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 (two-tailed). This relationship suggests that as the rating of victim responsibility increases, the likelihood of authorising a case decreases. Before training, 18% of the variance in case authorization decisions could be accounted for by the attribution of victim responsibility (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = .18), which dropped to 14% after training (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = .14).</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0093854813475348">Table 4</xref>, there were significant changes in both the frequency and priority of factors listed in the officers’ reasoning processes. The frequency of comments related to corroborative evidence and victim behaviour significantly decreased after training, particularly negative comments related to the lack of corroboration and counterintuitive (or negative) victim behaviour. Whilst there was no change pre- to posttraining in the priority with which corroborative evidence and victim behaviour factors were listed overall or as positive comments, there was a significant decrease in the priority of negative comments regarding the victims’ behaviour. Further, there was a significant increase in the frequency and priority of overall and positive comments related to the nature of the relationship (including grooming) posttraining. The nature of the relationship was the only factor considered that significantly increased in importance posttraining.</p>
<p>Importantly, the above mentioned changes in the prioritisation of grooming details across time cannot be attributed to differences in response completeness. Paired samples <italic>t</italic> tests revealed that there was no significant difference between the mean number of factors listed per participant before (<italic>M</italic> = 42.19, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.22) and after (<italic>M</italic> = 41.27, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.62) training, <italic>t</italic>(72) = 1.13, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, and no significant difference between the mean number of factors listed per scenario before (<italic>M</italic> = 3.52, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.69) and after (<italic>M</italic> = 3.44, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.80) training, <italic>t</italic>(72) = 1.13, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the first study to demonstrate that police investigators’ confidence in case authorizations and attributions of victim responsibility can be shifted as a result of intensive classroom-based training in the dynamics of sexual offending. The training was associated with changes in both attribution of victim responsibility and case authorization. Specifically, attributions of victim responsibility were lower, and perceptions of likely case authorization were higher posttraining, particularly in those cases where evidence in relation to the crime was ambiguous (i.e., it did not reflect on the veracity of the victims statement one way or another). Overall, the factors listed to support the case authorization decisions reflected a better understanding of the dynamics of sexual offending posttraining. Officers showed a greater consideration of the offending relationship and grooming processes, and they made fewer negative comments in relation to the victims’ behaviour and the lack of corroborative evidence.</p>
<p>Overall, the pattern of results is consistent with the conclusion that greater understanding of the dynamics of sexual offending and grooming processes (as delivered in the training) were responsible for the changes in perceptions of likely case authorization. There are three reasons for making this claim. First, victim responsibility was associated with case authorization decisions, such that the higher the attribution of responsibility to the victim, the less likely the case was to be authorised. Changes in investigators’ understanding of sexual offending dynamics and victim behaviour (due to engaging in the training course) were associated with reduced negative bias against victims. This was especially evident in ambiguous cases that did not support or refute the victims’ allegation of sexual offending.</p>
<p>Second, the police trainees at the time of commencing the course were well aware of the high prevalence of victim blaming attitudes among police as this had been a major finding of two state-wide enquiries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093854813475348">SSCRSA, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093854813475348">VLRC, 2004</xref>), circulated among members by their supervisors prior to the commencement of the course. The course itself provided knowledge related to offending, but it did not address issues related to the high rate of attrition in sexual assault cases and the role of officers’ misconceptions in contributing to these attrition rates. Third, whilst corroborative evidence remained the most important factor considered in case authorization, posttraining, the officers made fewer negative comments regarding the lack of corroborative evidence and counterintuitive (or negative) victim behaviour, such as delayed reporting. There was no change in the frequency of positive comments related to victims’ behaviour pre- to posttraining, suggesting that the participants’ attitudes were not simply more “provictim” after training. Rather, the data support that their considerations of victims’ behaviour were more cautious and considerate of counterintuitive behaviour.</p>
<p>The importance of these findings cannot be underestimated. Poor attitudes among professionals, including police officers, are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093854813475348">Page, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093854813475348">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854813475348">Schwartz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854813475348">Sleath &amp; Bull, 2012</xref>). While the need for training to improve police officers’ awareness of sexual offending dynamics has been widely emphasised (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093854813475348">Criminal Justice Sexual Offences Taskforce, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093854813475348">Hunter, Bentley-Cewe, &amp; Mills, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854813475348">Lonsway et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854813475348">May-Parker &amp; Kiwala, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093854813475348">New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice, 2003</xref>), training to date, using similar designs and assessment measures as the current study, have been unsuccessful in demonstrating a shift in attitudes of sexual offending posttraining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854813475348">Lonsway et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093854813475348">Patterson, 2004</xref>). In a climate where classroom-based training programs have been criticised for their lack of effectiveness in improving police officers’ interviewing skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093854813475348">Powell, 2008</xref>), this research shows that intensive training can effectively improve police investigators’ attitudes and decisions toward sexual offence cases.</p>
<p>Now that we have demonstrated changes in the classroom setting, the next step for researchers is threefold. First, it needs to be determined whether the changes observed here actually transfer to the field and improve the attitudes, decision-making, and interviewing practice of police officers, as well as attrition rates. In particular, the potential association between knowledge of sexual offending dynamics (and grooming processes) and the ability to adhere to best-practice interview guidelines is of particular interest to us in our role as interview trainers. A large body of research has documented the difficulty of police investigators to adopt best practice interview techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093854813475348">Oxburgh, Ost, &amp; Cherryman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093854813475348">Powell, Fisher, &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854813475348">Smith, Powell, &amp; Lum, 2009</xref>). One possible explanation for this finding is that interview skill is mediated by rape myth acceptance, such that those police officers with lower rape myth acceptance show better rapport and open-ended questioning, which is synonymous with interviewing skill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093854813475348">Read, Powell, Kebbell, &amp; Milne, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093854813475348">Rich &amp; Seffrin, 2012</xref>). It is possible that the acquisition of a range of skills, such as best practice investigative interviewing, brief authorization, and engagement with other service providers and victims, is facilitated by concomitant training in sexual offending dynamics.</p>
<p>Second, the posttraining measurement point was scheduled immediately (i.e., on the final day of) training, and thus, research is needed to determine whether the changes observed are stable over time. Ongoing intervention may be needed to maintain these results, particularly if biases are still prevalent within the police units where the investigators work. Finally, the training course evaluated in this study was very resource intensive. It was developed and rolled out amid major state-wide funding aimed to improve the justice systems’ response to sexual assault. The course relied on the coordination of multiple stakeholders (including forensic professionals, school children, and victims), extensive physical space for training and interviewing exercises, facilitators with a background in psychology, offender treatment and police investigation, as well as ongoing development of up-to-date training content. Future research should examine the effectiveness of online training to provide a more cost-effective alternative for jurisdictions with less government funding or resources in this critical area.</p>
