<abstract>
<p>A host of factors including genetic influences, temperament characteristics, learning experiences, information processing biases, parental psychopathology, and specific parenting practices have been hypothesized to contribute to the development and expression of children’s phobias. In the present study, the authors focused on parental psychopathology (phobic anxiety) and parenting behaviors (warmth, involvement) in the prediction of child performance on a behavioral approach test (BAT). All children (<italic>n</italic> = 44) experienced a phobia of animals and were clinic referred. The youth completed two BATs: the first alone and the second one with a parent present. Overall, performance was greater on the parent-present BAT (58% of steps completed) than on the child-alone BAT (38% of steps completed), although considerable variability was present. Performance on the parent-present BAT was associated with parental warmth and involvement but not parental phobic anxiety. Implications of these findings were discussed, and their implications for the use of behavioral analogues tests were explored.</p>

<p>Early theorists suggested that specific phobias were multiply determined if not overdetermined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145445512448191">Marks, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445512448191">Ollendick, 1979</xref>). A host of factors including genetic influences (e.g., both dominant and recessive gene variations), temperament characteristics (e.g., behavioral inhibition), learning experiences (e.g., associated with operant, respondent, and vicarious conditioning), information processing biases (e.g., hypervigilance and overestimation of threat), parental psychopathology (e.g., anxiety symptoms or anxiety disorders in the parents), and specific parenting practices (e.g., overprotection and overly controlling parenting strategies) have all been hypothesized to contribute to the development and expression of children’s phobias (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145445512448191">Ollendick, King, &amp; Muris, 2004</xref>, for a systematic review). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445512448191">Mineka and Zinbarg (2006)</xref> illustrated how these factors and others transact over time, leading to a rich and nuanced account of the etiology and course of phobic and anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>In this article, we focus on parental psychopathology and parenting practices to predict avoidance behavior in youth with specific phobias of animals, the most common childhood phobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145445512448191">Ollendick, Raishevich, Davis, Sirbu, &amp; Öst, 2010</xref>). A number of investigations have examined the role of parental psychopathology in the development of phobias and anxiety disorders, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445512448191">Beidel and Turner (1997)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512448191">Bernstein, Layne, Egan, and Nelson (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445512448191">Ginsburg, Silverman, and Kurtines (1995)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512448191">Kearney, Sims, Pursell, and Tillotson (2003)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512448191">Manassis and Hood (1998)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145445512448191">Messer and Beidel (1994)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145445512448191">Ollendick and Horsch (2007)</xref>. These studies have shown that heightened parental anxiety (evidenced either by the presence of anxious symptoms or an anxiety disorder in the parent) is related to the onset, course, and expression of phobic and anxiety disorders in children. In particular, several studies have shown that children whose parents have panic disorder or panic disorder with agoraphobia as well as those whose parents report heightened levels of phobic anxiety, as measured by the Phobic Anxiety Dimension of the Symptom Checklist 90–Revised (SCL-90-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512448191">Derogatis, 1994</xref>), are at increased risk for the development of these disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512448191">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512448191">Kearney et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512448191">Manassis &amp; Hood, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145445512448191">Ollendick &amp; Horsch, 2007</xref>). Phobic anxiety can be defined as a persistent fear response that is irrational and disproportionate to the stimulus and that leads to avoidance or escape behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512448191">Derogatis, 1994</xref>). Representative items on the Phobic Anxiety scale of the SCL-90-R include “Feeling afraid to travel on buses, subways, or trains” and “Having to avoid certain things, places, or activities because they frighten you.” Although not diagnostic, the symptoms measured by the Phobic Anxiety scale are similar to those observed in panic disorder and Agoraphobia, and these symptoms might be transferred from parents to their offspring. In general, then, children whose parents are characterized by anxiety symptoms or anxiety disorders are at increased risk for the development of phobic and anxiety disorders themselves.</p>
<p>Similarly, a number of investigators have shown that parenting strategies typified by overprotection and overcontrol are related to the presence of phobic and anxiety disorders in children. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145445512448191">Siqueland, Kendall, and Steinberg (1996)</xref> demonstrated that parents of anxiety and phobic-disordered children were rated by observers as granting less autonomy to their children (i.e., more controlling) than parents of nonanxious children, as did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445512448191">Ginsburg, Grover, Cord, and Ialongo (2006)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445512448191">Hudson and Rapee (2001)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145445512448191">Whaley, Pinto, and Sigman (1999)</xref>. Reviews of this literature reveal that a host of other studies have found similar relationships (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145445512448191">Wood, McLeod, Sigman, Hwang, &amp; Chu, 2003</xref>, for a review). Collectively, these studies indicate that phobic and anxiety disorders in children are related to having parents who use parenting practices characterized by overprotection and overcontrol.</p>
<p>Thus, parental psychopathology and parenting practices have been well established as risk factors for the development of anxiety and phobic disorders in children. However, the relationship of these factors to the behavior of children within in vivo phobic situations remains to be explored. The present study represents the first-known attempt to explore the impact of parental psychopathology and parenting practices on the performance of phobic youth in a laboratory-based behavioral approach test (BAT).</p>
<p>Specifically, the purpose of the present study is to examine levels of avoidance behavior in youth referred for the treatment of animal phobias. To measure behavioral avoidance, we used the BAT, a laboratory-based measure designed to assess avoidance behavior in individuals with specific phobias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512448191">Borkovec, Weerts, &amp; Bernstein, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445512448191">Dadds, Rapee, &amp; Barrett, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445512448191">Hersen &amp; Bellack, 1976</xref>). This test consists of a number of increasingly difficult steps in which individuals are asked to approach a phobic object or situation in a controlled setting but are told they can stop the test at any time they wish. Immediately preceding the BAT and on the terminal step of the BAT, individuals are asked to provide ratings of their anticipated fear level, referred to as <italic>subjective units of distress</italic> (SUDS; physiological responses can also be recorded, although this is less commonly done in clinical and applied settings). It is important to note that the BAT is an analogue test and that it attempts to approximate real-life encounters with the phobic object or situation but in a controlled, simulated setting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445512448191">Ollendick and Hersen (1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445512448191">1993</xref>) recommended the use of such analogue tests when it is difficult to observe the child in the naturalistic setting. Performance on this simulated measure, defined as the percentage of steps completed on the test, has been associated with the clinical severity of the presenting phobia (as determined by a diagnostic interview) and SUDS ratings, both preceding the test and on completion of the final step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445512448191">McLean &amp; Hope, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445512448191">Ollendick, Allen, Benoit, &amp; Cowart, 2011</xref>). These findings lend support to the validity of this analogue measure.</p>
<p>In the current study, SUDs ratings and behavioral avoidance on the BAT were examined in relation to measures of parental reports of phobic anxiety and behavioral observations of warmth and involvement exhibited by the parents during the BAT. The measures of warmth and involvement were meant to tap positive parenting variables that would counter the overprotection and overcontrol that has been associated with higher levels of fear and anxiety. Most parental measures were obtained from mothers; although when fathers were the primary caregivers, measures were obtained from them instead of mothers. Based on our review of the literature, it was anticipated that caregiver reports of phobic anxiety and the actual behavior of the caregiver during the BAT would be related to both behavioral avoidance on the BAT and SUDs ratings at the terminal step of the BAT. Moreover, it was predicted that behavioral avoidance and SUDs ratings would be greater when the child performed the BAT alone versus when the parent was present. That is, it was hypothesized that the presence of parents would facilitate behavioral approach to the phobic animal.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Children (ages 7-14) from southwestern Virginia were recruited for a larger randomized control trial for the treatment of specific phobias in youth. Referrals were obtained from child mental health services, family medical practices, schools, and newspaper, radio, and television advertisements. Participants were required to meet criteria for a diagnosis of specific phobia, as defined in the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed.; <italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445512448191">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>). Diagnoses were determined by a semistructured diagnostic interview, the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children (ADIS-C/P; see below; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145445512448191">Silverman &amp; Albano, 1996</xref>). Exclusionary criteria included presence of a pervasive developmental disorder; primary major depression, but only if suicidal ideation or attempt was present; drug or alcohol abuse; or psychosis. Participants were required to discontinue other forms of psychotherapy or anxiolytic medication for the duration of their participation in the study. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512448191">Ollendick et al. (2009)</xref> for further information about the larger study. For purposes of the current study, only children with animal phobias were included.</p>
<p>The current study included 44 children (22 males) with a mean age of 8.9, who were diagnosed with animal phobias. Of the children in the current study, 80% were Caucasian, 16% were African American, 2% were Asian, and 2% were of other ethnicities. Most of the children (25) had phobias of dogs. Other animal phobias included bees/insects (9), spiders (7), snakes (2), and cats (2). Approximately 95% of the youth were diagnosed with at least one other psychiatric disorder, most commonly another anxiety disorder.</p>

<sec id="section3-0145445512448191">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>On referral, parents completed a brief telephone screen with a member of the research team. If the child appeared to meet inclusion criteria, the family was scheduled for an assessment. During the initial session, assessors provided more information about the study, gained informed consent and assent, conducted a semistructured diagnostic interview, and administered self-report questionnaires. Based on information gathered during the first session, a phobia-specific BAT was designed and administered during the second session, at which time several other measures were obtained but are not reported here (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512448191">Ollendick et al., 2009</xref>). The child completed the BAT once by himself or herself and then a second time with a parent present. Participating parents included 31 mothers and 9 fathers. For three children, both parents were present and participated, and one child participated with a female nonparent primary caregiver.</p>

<title>ADIS-C/P</title>
<p>The ADIS-C/P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145445512448191">Silverman &amp; Albano, 1996</xref>) is a semistructured diagnostic interview administered separately to parents and children, and designed to assess childhood anxiety disorders as well as other childhood disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). For the most part, the parent and child interviews are similar. However, the parent interview contains modules for several additional disorders (e.g., conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, enuresis), and requests supplementary information with regard to history and interference of specific problems. The child version also requests additional information regarding symptoms and phenomenology of disorders, and utilizes simpler language. The ADIS-C/P has demonstrated adequate test–retest reliability for child (ages 7-16, κs = .61-80), parent (κs = .65-1.00), and combined (κs = .62-1.00) diagnoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445512448191">Grills &amp; Ollendick, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445512448191">Silverman &amp; Ollendick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512448191">Silverman, Saavedra, &amp; Pina, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Trained-to-criterion graduate clinicians conducted diagnostic interviews for this study, and interviews were videotaped. Following the interview, the parent and child clinicians separately assigned severity ratings (Clinician Severity Ratings [CSRs]) for each diagnosis on a scale from 0 to 8, where 0 = <italic>no symptoms</italic>, 2 = <italic>mild</italic>, 4 = <italic>moderate</italic>, 6 = <italic>severe</italic>, and 8 = <italic>very severe</italic>. Subsequent to this, a clinical consensus meeting was held during which the final CSRs were assigned. To determine reliability of the diagnoses, independent assessors randomly selected and reviewed 30% of the videotaped interviews. Agreements on diagnoses, using the kappa statistic, were .93 and .88 for primary and secondary diagnoses, respectively. Inter-rater reliabilities of the CSRs were .87 and .83 for primary and secondary diagnoses. Mean CSR for the treated phobia was 6.11 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.08) on the 0 to 8 severity scale, reflecting moderately severe levels of disturbance.</p>

<sec id="section6-0145445512448191">
<title>BAT</title>
<p>The BAT is a laboratory-based behavioral measure designed to measure the behavior of a child in the presence of a phobic stimulus. The test consists of a number of increasingly difficult steps in which the children are asked to approach a phobic object or situation but are told that they can stop the test at any time they wish to do so. The BATs were developed for each specific phobia in the current study and were based on the BATs designed for children by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145445512448191">Öst, Svensson, Hellstrom, and Lindwall (2001)</xref>. The BATs created for the animal phobic children were designed to be realistic. For example, a child with a phobia of dogs was asked to approach and pet a leashed dog on the head for 20 s, whereas a child with a fear of bees was asked to hold a jar with a bee inside it for 20 s. The BATs consisted of a series of gradually more difficult steps (ranging from 10 to 12 steps depending on the specific phobia). Because of the variability in number of steps on the BATs, the percentage of steps completed was used as the primary behavioral measure of BAT avoidance.</p>
<p>The child was escorted to a hallway outside the room in which the BAT was to be administered and was given instructions regarding the task. All children were instructed to do their best but were also informed they could terminate the BAT at any time if they wished to do so. Specifically, children were told,
<disp-quote>
<p>Now I want to see how being around [phobic object] is for you. In this room, there is a [phobic object] at the other end of the room. I want to see if you can go into the room and [specific task: e.g., pet the dog on the head with one hand for 20 seconds]. Remember, you don’t need to do this if you don’t want to. You only have to do as much as you like and you can stop at any point in time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>BATs were terminated at the child’s request or when the terminal step was reached. As some children completed very few steps on the BAT or completed it very rapidly, the actual time in the BAT varied from 20 s to 5 min. Immediately following the last step of the BAT, children were asked to provide ratings of their anxiety using SUDS ranging from 0 to 8 (0 = <italic>none</italic>, 2 = <italic>a little</italic>, 4 = <italic>some</italic>, 6 = <italic>a lot</italic>, and 8 = <italic>very much</italic>). In the larger study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512448191">Ollendick et al., 2009</xref>), the BAT demonstrated good test/retest reliability (.92 for the SUDS ratings and .87 for percentage of steps undertaken in the BAT).</p>
<p>For purposes of the current study, children completed the BAT once by themselves and a second time with a caregiver present. Specific instructions were identical to instructions for the child-alone BAT, with the following additional instructions for the parent:
<disp-quote>
<p>[Parent], you should feel free to help [child] as much as you like. However, [child] only has to do as much as s/he wants to do. S/he does not need to do anything s/he does not want to do. Just let me know when you and [child] want to stop and we will stop.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Subsequently, independent raters coded the child’s performance on the BAT as well as the parent–child interactions during the BAT. The parent–child interaction was coded for parental warmth and involvement using a coding system modified from the one developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445512448191">Hudson and Rapee (2001)</xref>. Warmth was defined as any behavior showing affection, gratitude, cordiality, or sympathy. Interactions high in warmth were characterized by encouragement, empathy, and a lack of criticism. Involvement was defined in terms of participation and absorption in the task at hand, as well as emotional commitment to the task. Each interaction dimension was separately coded on a scale from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating higher levels of warmth and involvement, respectively. In all, 20% of the tapes were coded for reliability purposes, and the scales showed good reliability: .95 and 1.0 for warmth and involvement, respectively.</p>

<title>Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI)</title>
<p>The BSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512448191">Derogatis, 1975</xref>) is a 53-item parent self-report measure that assesses psychological functioning in adults. It is an abbreviation of the SCL-90-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512448191">Derogatis, 1994</xref>). The measure includes nine symptom dimensions and a global severity index and possesses adequate reliability and validity (Derogatis, 2004). The Phobic Anxiety subscale of the BSI is composed of five items assessing the presence of specific fears (e.g., “Having to avoid certain things, places, or activities because they frighten you”). Respondents are asked to indicate on a true/false scale (1 or 0) if they experience a given symptom. This subscale demonstrated excellent internal consistency in the current sample (Cronbach’s α = 1.0).</p>

<title>Comparison of BAT Performance (Alone Vs. With Parents)</title>
<p>As noted, the same BAT was presented 2 times: first with the child alone and second with a caregiver present. Under these different experimental conditions, <italic>t</italic> tests were performed to examine differences in child performance and anxiety. Significant differences were revealed in percentage of steps completed, <italic>t</italic>(43) = −5.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, as well as SUDS ratings at the last step of the BAT, <italic>t</italic>(43) = 2.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Examination of the means indicated that children completed a higher percentage of steps with a parent present (58%) versus alone (36%) and reported less distress during the BAT with a parent present (4.20) versus alone (5.20). These differences were expected. In subsequent analyses, we examined sociodemographic factors, parenting behaviors during the BAT, and parental phobic anxiety in predicting the child’s behavior and subjective anxiety during the BAT (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145445512448191">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Prediction of Parent–Child BAT Avoidance</title>
<p>To examine predictors of child avoidance (i.e., percentage of steps completed) on the BAT with caregiver present, demographic factors (i.e., child age, gender), parent–child interaction style during the BAT (i.e., warmth, involvement), and parent psychopathology as reported on the BSI (i.e., phobic anxiety) were entered into a simultaneous multiple regression analysis. The percentage of steps completed by the child in the initial BAT (performed alone) was also entered into the analysis to account for task repetition. The model was significant, <italic>F</italic>(6, 43) = 9.79, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and predicted 62% of the overall variance. Parental warmth independently predicted percentage of BAT steps completed, <italic>t</italic>(43) = 2.80, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, as did parental involvement, <italic>t</italic>(43) = −2.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and performance on the initial BAT, <italic>t</italic>(43) = 5.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.

<title>Prediction of SUDS During BAT</title>
<p>Analyses were repeated to determine the relationships of the variables of interest (demographic factors, parent–child interaction styles, and parental psychopathology) to child self-reported anxiety (i.e., SUDS) at the terminal step of the BAT. All variables of interest (age, gender, parental warmth and involvement, and parental phobic anxiety), as well as initial BAT anxiety ratings, were entered into a simultaneous multiple regression analysis. The overall model was significant, <italic>F</italic>(6, 43) = 5.19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, accounting for 46% of the overall variance. Exploratory analyses revealed that initial BAT anxiety significantly predicted child SUDS in the second BAT, <italic>t</italic>(43) = 4.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. With regard to parenting variables, parental warmth approached significant independent prediction of child SUDS, <italic>t</italic>(43) = −1.89, <italic>p</italic> = .07, as did parental involvement, <italic>t</italic>(43) = 1.51, <italic>p</italic> = .14. The other variables in the model failed to provide significant independent prediction of child anxiety at the terminal step of the BAT (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145445512448191">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results are relatively straightforward and, for the most part, in accord with our hypotheses. First, performance on the BAT was significantly better when the child’s caretaking parent was present than when the child performed the BAT alone. Second, observed parental warmth and involvement significantly predicted the number of steps completed on the parent-present BAT even after controlling for number of steps completed when the child completed the BAT alone. Moreover, although not significant, a trend was present indicating that the subjective anxiety reported by the child when the parent was present during the BAT was also associated with parental warmth and involvement during the BAT. Inconsistent with our hypotheses, however, parental phobic anxiety was not related to performance on this BAT when the parents were present or on the subjective anxiety reported by the child during this test.</p>
<p>The children completed an average of 36% of the steps on the BAT when alone but 58% when with their parents. They also reported less distress during the BAT with a parent present (4.20) than when they completed the task alone (5.20). In understanding these differences, it is important to note that parental warmth and involvement during the BAT predicted child performance in the parent-present condition and that these parental behaviors may have facilitated heightened performance. Our qualitative observations appear to support this conclusion. For the most part, parents were observed to be very supportive of their children when interacting with the phobic stimulus. Comments such as “Try your best,” “Let me help you,” “Watch me first,” “It won’t be as bad as you think,” and “I know you can do it” were common. Parents also engaged in a number of positive behaviors such as smiling, head nodding, putting their arms on the child’s shoulder, entering the room first, and leading the child into the room. Of course, not all parental behaviors were positive, and considerable variability was present. For example, a few parents stated things such as “What if the dog is a big one and growls at you,” “I wonder how active the bee will be and if it will be safe to hold it,” and “What if the spider jumps on you or runs after you.” Some parents also tried to coerce the child to go into the room with the phobic object or were highly critical of the child and appeared to reject the child by their looks of disappointment and disapproval. Other parents seemingly were not engaged They simply stood by the child, looking to the child for guidance, or were simply aloof to what was going on or what the child was experiencing. Not surprisingly, the child’s performance in the presence of these less-warm and less-involved parents was associated with higher levels of distress and fewer steps completed on the BAT. These latter findings are consistent with those obtained by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445512448191">Ginsburg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445512448191">Hudson &amp; Rapee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145445512448191">Siqueland et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145445512448191">Whaley et al., 1999</xref>) and suggest that overly critical and less-autonomy-granting parenting practices are associated with phobic behavior and anxiety in children. Importantly, to our knowledge, this is the fist study to directly observe parental behavior in the presence of a phobic object. Still, overall, our parents were largely positive with their children and displayed a healthy amount of warmth and involvement with their child.</p>
<p>Why was phobic anxiety as reported by the parent not related to child performance on the BAT as we had predicted? Although speculative, we suggest that this dispositional variable was not related to actual behavior because its effects were overshadowed by the direct parenting behaviors of warmth and involvement that were observed during the interaction task. Other studies that have shown positive relations of parental phobic anxiety have tended to use child reports of fear or anxiety and to not directly observe these behaviors in children (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512448191">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512448191">Kearney et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512448191">Manassis &amp; Hood, 1998</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145445512448191">Ollendick &amp; Horsch, 2007</xref>). In retrospect, it might also have been useful to code parental behaviors for anxiety and to determine its relations to actual child behavior during the task. It might be the case that some of the parental behaviors we observed were because of the parent’s own anxiety in the situation—either for themselves or for their children. These possibilities await further inquiry.</p>
<p>As with all studies, our study is not without significant limitations. First, our sample size was relatively small and was composed primarily of European American families. Whether parenting variables and parental psychopathology take on added importance in some cultural groups in the expression of fear and anxiety is largely unknown at this time, although such seems highly probable especially with African American and Hispanic American families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145445512448191">Ollendick, Lewis, &amp; Fraire, 2010</xref>). Second, our study was limited to youth with phobias of animals. Although animal phobias are the most common phobia in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145445512448191">Ollendick, Raishevich, et al., 2010</xref>), it is certainly conceivable that parenting variables might be more (or less) important with natural environment types such as thunderstorms or the dark as well as situational or blood-injection-injury types of phobias. The expression of some of these phobias might be more parent–child in nature (e.g., specific phobia of the dark and getting a shot at the doctor’s office) and hence be more likely to invoke parenting behaviors in their occurrence and expression. Third, we always administered the parent-present BAT after the child-alone BAT, and this may have led to some of the differences that were obtained. In effect, the child had some experience with the phobic object during the individual BAT before the parent-present BAT was administered, and this may have led to increased performance on the parent-present BAT. However, this seems unlikely because in our earlier study, we did repeat the BAT alone a 2nd time and differences in performance were not obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445512448191">Ollendick, Allen, et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, we used a BAT in this study. As such, the BAT attempts to approximate real-life encounters with the phobic object or situation but in a controlled, simulated setting. As noted earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445512448191">Ollendick and Hersen (1984</xref>, 1993) recommended the use of such analogue tests when it is difficult to observe the child in the naturalistic setting. Still, direct observation of parent–child behavior in the natural environment should be pursued. It is conceivable that both parent and child behaviors would differ in such a setting.</p>
<p>These limitations notwithstanding, our study provides valuable information on parenting behaviors in a simulated setting—a setting that is difficult to recreate in a more naturalistic setting. It suggests that both parental warmth and involvement are associated with enhanced performance. It also illustrates that a lack of parental warmth, criticism, and overinvolvement are associated with poorer performance. The role of behavioral assessment in establishing these relations is evident as suggested more than 35 years ago by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445512448191">Hersen and Bellack (1976)</xref>.</p>
