<p>For nearly half a century social and behavioral gerontologists have been studying the challenges that older people face as they try to develop and maintain a meaningful and useful life. These challenges are succinctly summarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898264311412598">Rosow (1976)</xref>, who claims that aging is a “roleless role.” Similar concerns are expressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264311412598">Baltes and Smith (1999)</xref>, who argue that “relatively speaking, old age is young; therefore neither biological nor cultural evolution has had sufficient opportunity to evolve a full and optimizing scaffolding (architecture) for the later phases of life” (p. 158). And little has changed in the ensuing decades, as the work of Lazarus and Lazarus (2006) reveals: “the loss of one’s opportunity to sustain a useful function in life” is one of the major limitations of growing older. Embedded in these perspectives is the notion that as people enter late life, they encounter a social and psychological vacuum and, as a result, they are less likely than younger people to enjoy the benefits and security that come from occupying a meaningful place in society. These fundamental concerns about growing older have led to the development of a tight cluster of concepts that serve as portals for delving more deeply into the nature of successful aging. Among these concepts are feeling useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898264311412598">Rowe &amp; Kahn, 1998</xref>), mattering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264311412598">Schieman, Bierman, &amp; Ellison, 2010</xref>), and belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264311412598">McLaren, Gomez, Bailey, &amp; Van Der Horst, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A good point of departure for finding a solution to the problem of acquiring a meaningful role in late life may be found in the literature on the benefits of social engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898264311412598">Rowe &amp; Kahn, 1998</xref>). More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264311412598">Nuland (2007)</xref> proposes that three key factors are responsible for successful aging. One involves being embedded in a web of social relationships that is characterized by mutual caring. However, the nature of the networks that older people may find and the way in which they provide and receive care is not entirely clear. Fortunately, several options are discussed in the literature. For example, some older adults have found that becoming more deeply involved in formal organizations provides meaningful and useful roles to play in late life. More specifically, a well-developed literature suggests that a number of older individuals have been able to find a satisfying niche in life by becoming involved in formal volunteer work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264311412598">Musick &amp; Wilson, 2008</xref>). Moreover, as Musick and Wilson point out, older people are especially inclined to perform volunteer work through religious institutions. In addition to engaging in formal volunteer work at church there are other ways in which older people may be able to create a meaningful life within the context of religion. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264311412598">Krause (2009)</xref> suggests that informally providing tangible support to fellow church members provides a viable way for older adults to be engaged in the life of a congregation.</p>
<p>The purpose of the current study is to strike out in a different direction by exploring an option that does not appear to have been investigated by other researchers. More specifically, the analyses presented below focus on the mental health consequences of sharing what one has learned in life with fellow church members.</p>
<p>Sharing life experiences may best be viewed within the context of two core constructs in gerontology: generativity and wisdom. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898264311412598">Erikson (1963)</xref>, who coined the term “generativity,” defines it as “concern in establishing and guiding the next generation” (p. 267). Although Erikson proposed that concerns with generativity occupy individuals at an earlier stage in the life course, subsequent empirical research does not support his assertion. Instead, as research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264311412598">McAdams, Aubin, and Logan (1993)</xref> reveals, concerns above generativity are low in young adulthood, they increase in midlife, and they remain high throughout the remainder of life.</p>
<p>Focusing on the meaning of generativity provides a useful point of departure, but it doesn’t go far enough because the specific things that older adults might do to guide the next generation are not entirely clear. Turning to the notion of wisdom provides some useful insight into this issue. Wisdom has been defined in many different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264311412598">Brugman, 2006</xref>), and, as a result, no attempt will be made here to resolve this vexing problem. Instead, following the Berlin wisdom paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264311412598">Baltes &amp; Kunzmann, 2003</xref>), wisdom is defined as the development of pragmatic or practical knowledge about how to live a life that is beneficial to one’s self and others. If older adults are able to derive knowledge about how to live a beneficial life and if older individuals strive to guide the next generation, then perhaps they do so by sharing what they have learned about life with younger people. Empirical support for this perspective is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0898264311412598">Wink and Dillon (2008)</xref>, who found that the correlation between wisdom and generativity is fairly substantial in late life (i.e., <italic>r</italic> = .65).</p>
<p>An effort is made in the analysis that follows to delve more deeply into the implications of sharing life experiences with others. This is accomplished in two ways. The first way links sharing life experiences with the concerns of the social and behavioral gerontologists who were discussed previously. It is proposed that sharing life experiences with fellow church members and believing that significant others value these experiences help older people find a meaningful place in the social order by helping them feel they belong in the place where they worship. The second way to develop research in this area has to do with exploring the mental health consequences of sharing life experiences as well as the feelings of belonging that this type of generativity may promote. It is proposed that sharing life experiences coupled with feelings of belonging are associated with fewer symptoms of depression over time. These issues are elaborated and extended by developing and testing the latent variable model that is presented in the next section.</p>
<sec id="section1-0898264311412598">
<title>Sharing Life Experiences, Belonging, and Depressive Symptoms</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264311412598">Figure 1</xref> contains that latent variable model that was designed to examine the relationships among sharing life experiences, belonging, and change in depressive symptoms over time. Two steps were taken to simply the presentation of this complex conceptual scheme. First, the elements of the measurement model (i.e., the factor loadings and measurement error terms) are not depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264311412598">Figure 1</xref> even though a full measurement model was specified when this conceptual scheme was estimated. Second, though they are not shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264311412598">Figure 1</xref>, measures of age, sex, education, and race were included in the model when the relationships among the core constructs in this conceptual scheme were evaluated empirically.</p>

<caption><p>A conceptual model of being valued at church and change in depressive symptoms</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0898264311412598-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Even though a number of relationships are specified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264311412598">Figure 1</xref>, the following core linkages capture the overall theoretical thrust of this conceptual scheme: (a) Older people who go to church more often are more likely to feel that their fellow church members value their life experiences, (b) older adults who feel that people at church value their life experiences are more likely to believe they belong in their congregations, (c) older individuals who feel they belong in the place where they worship are more likely to experience stronger feelings of self-esteem over time, and (d) increases in self-esteem over time are associated with a decline in depressive symptomatology over time. The theoretical rationale for each of these core relationships is provided in the following section.</p>
<sec id="section2-0898264311412598">
<title>Church Attendance and Life Experiences</title>
<p>At least two conditions must be met in order for older people to benefit from sharing their life experiences at church. First, older people must be in frequent contact with the individuals they are attempting to guide. Otherwise, their overtures may be seen as inappropriate or intrusive. Put another way, older adults are more likely to share life experiences with people at church if they have developed a close relationship with them. And a person can only develop a close relationship with people at church by coming into more frequent contact with them. Attending worship services provides a forum in which the necessary interpersonal contact can take place. Consequently, it is proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264311412598">Figure 1</xref> that older adults are more likely to feel that fellow church members value their life experiences if they come into frequent contact with them by attending worship services more often.</p>
<p>The second condition builds on the first. If sharing life experiences is a process that must be handled properly, then attempts to share this kind of knowledge with others may not always be successful. This is consistent with the general finding in social psychology that even well-intentioned efforts to help others may go awry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264311412598">Eckenrode &amp; Wethington, 1990</xref>). One way to gauge the success of this type of social encounter is to determine whether older people feel that their fellow church members <italic>value</italic> what they have attempted to provide. It is for this reason that analysis that is presented in the following section focuses on whether older people feel that others at church value their life experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0898264311412598">
<title>Sharing Life Experiences and Belonging</title>
<p>A sense of belonging in a congregation involves much more than a stated religious affiliation (e.g., “I am a Catholic”). Instead, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264311412598">Carrier (1965)</xref> points out, when a person feels he or she belongs in the place where he or she worships, “The member sees himself as taking part in his group; he identifies himself with it, he participates in it, he receives his motivation from it; in a word, he is in a state or disposition of interaction with the group, which understands, inspires and welcomes him” (p. 58). This definition is consistent with the notion that in order for an older person to feel as though he or she belongs in a congregation he or she must participate in it and feel as though these efforts are understood and welcomed by the people who worship there. One way this may happen is if older people share their life experiences with fellow church members and find that others at church value their efforts to do so. If older people feel valued by their fellow church members, then they should be more likely to believe they belong in the place where they worship.</p>
<p>There appears to be only two studies that have empirically examined feelings of belonging in a congregation. The first study, which was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898264311412598">Krause and Wulff (2005)</xref>, suggests that individuals who feel they belong in their congregations tend to be more satisfied with their health than people who do not feel they belong in their congregations. Although this study calls attention to the important health-related consequences of belonging in a congregation, it has at least two limitations with respect to the issues that are raised in the current study. First, the data were provided by people of all ages, making it hard to address the ways in which older people attempt to find a meaningful place in life. Second, the findings indicate that belonging in a congregation is beneficial, but the ways in which these benefits may arise were not examined empirically. Both of these issues are addressed in the next section by proposing that a sense of belonging in a congregation is important because it is associated with increases in self-esteem over time in a sample of older adults.</p>
<p>The second study on belonging in a congregation was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898264311412598">Krause and Bastida (2011)</xref>. They report that feelings of belonging in a congregation are associated with better self-rated health. However, this study was based on data that were provided by a sample of older Mexican Americans. Although this study adds support to the notion that belonging in a congregation may have important health-related effects, it is not possible to determine whether these findings can be generalized to older people in other racial and ethnic groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0898264311412598">
<title>Belonging in Church and Change in Self-Esteem</title>
<p>Findings from a number of studies suggest that a strong sense of belonging is associated with greater feelings of self-worth (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898264311412598">Vignoles, Regalia, Manzi, Golledge, &amp; Scabini, 2006</xref>). However, there do not appear to be any studies that empirically examine the relationship between belonging and self-esteem within the context of religion. Moreover, very little of the research on belonging has been conducted with older people. This is unfortunate because focusing on a sense of belonging and self-esteem within the church provides one way to allay the concerns of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898264311412598">Rosow (1976)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264311412598">Baltes and Smith (1999)</xref>. The first step toward gaining the insight that is necessary for accomplishing this task involves turning to two bodies of research that developed in a largely independent manner. If the views of Baltes and Smith and Rosow are accurate, a substantial number of older people should experience a significant loss of self-worth because they cannot find a meaningful role to play in society. Consistent with this assumption, the first body of research suggests that feelings of self-esteem tend to decline precipitously in late life (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898264311412598">Trzesniewski, Donnellan, &amp; Robins, 2003</xref>). However, the second body of work points to a setting in which some older people may be able to avoid a sharp decline in self-esteem. More specifically, a considerable number of studies suggest that older people attend worship services more often than younger individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898264311412598">Stark, 2008</xref>). Taken together, these two bodies of research suggest that the odds of experiencing a loss of self-esteem in old age are high, but becoming actively engaged in the life of a congregation may provide one way to offset this undesirable outcome. But to see whether this assumption is valid, it is necessary to delve more deeply into the way in which greater involvement in the church may perform this vitally important function.</p>
<p>Researchers have argued for more than 100 years that feelings of self-worth are shaped by the appraisals of significant others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264311412598">Cooley, 1902/2003</xref>). Although subsequent research suggests that this may not be a straightforward process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898264311412598">Trice &amp; Wallace, 2003</xref>), this fundamental precept still has considerable merit. Cast within the context of the current study, this perspective suggests that a sense of belonging in a congregation may be a good marker of the endpoint of this process because older people will be more likely to feel they belong in the place where they worship if they have received positive feedback from the people who worship there. And as the discussion in the previous section suggests, this positive feedback may take the form of being valued for one’s own life experience. Consequently, it is proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264311412598">Figure 1</xref> that older people who feel that their fellow church members value their life experience will feel like they belong in the place where they worship and older people who feel like they belong in their congregation will, in turn, enjoy greater feelings of self-worth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0898264311412598">
<title>Self-Esteem and Depressive Symptoms</title>
<p>For more than 40 years, a number of studies have shown that diminished feelings of self-worth are associated with a greater likelihood of becoming depressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264311412598">Brown &amp; Harris, 1978</xref>). However, there has been some concern that the two constructs are conflated and that diminished feelings of self-esteem are merely symptoms of depression. Fortunately, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264311412598">Orth, Robins, and Meier (2009)</xref> helps alleviate these concerns. These investigators developed a sophisticated set of latent variable modeling procedures to analyze data from three longitudinal surveys. They report that low self-esteem is an independent risk factor for depression. An important feature of the model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264311412598">Figure 1</xref> should be discussed at this juncture. As Menard points out, there are a number of different ways to analyze survey data that have been gathered at more than one point in time. In fact, he identifies four “pure” longitudinal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264311412598">Menard, 1991</xref>, p. 59). The model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264311412598">Figure 1</xref> is among them. In this type of conceptual scheme, change in the dependent variable is expressed in terms of change in the value of the independent variable. The logic of this specification is straightforward and is evaluated with respect to the relationship between self-esteem and depressive symptoms: If the level of one variable (i.e., depressive symptoms) depends on the level of a second variable (i.e., self-esteem), then if the second variable changes, the first variable must also change.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The data for this study come from an ongoing nationwide survey of older Whites and older African Americans. The study population was defined as all household residents who were either Black or White, noninstitutionalized, English-speaking, and at least 66 years of age. Geographically, the study population was restricted to all eligible persons residing in the coterminous United States (i.e., residents of Alaska and Hawaii were excluded). Finally, the study population was restricted to currently practicing Christians, individuals who were Christian in the past but no longer practice any religion, and people who were not affiliated with any faith at any point in their lifetime.</p>
<p>The sampling frame consisted of all eligible persons contained in the beneficiary list maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). A five-step process was used to draw the sample from the CMS Files (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264311412598">Krause, 2002a</xref>, for a detailed discussion of these steps).</p>
<p>The baseline survey took place in 2001. The data collection for all waves of interviews was conducted by Harris Interactive (New York). A total of 1,500 interviews were completed, face to face, in the homes of the study participants. Older African Americans were oversampled so that sufficient statistical power would be available to assess racial cultural differences in religion. As a result, the Wave 1 sample consisted of 748 older Whites and 752 older African Americans. The overall response rate for the baseline survey was 62%.</p>
<p>The Wave 2 survey was conducted in 2004. A total of 1,024 study participants were reinterviewed successfully, 75 refused to participate, 112 could not be located, 70 were too ill to participate, 11 had moved to a nursing home, and 208 were deceased. Not counting those who had died or moved to a nursing home, the reinterview rate for the Wave 2 survey was 80%.</p>
<p>A third wave of interviews was completed in 2007. A total of 969 older study participants were reinterviewed successfully, 33 refused to participate, 118 could not be located, 17 were too sick to take part in the interview, and 155 older study participants had died. Not counting those who had died, the reinterview rate was 75%.</p>
<p>Wave 4 was completed in 2008. A total of 718 older study participants were reinterviewed successfully, 61 refused to participate, 92 could not be located, 77 were too ill to take part in the interview, and 153 had died.</p>
<p>The analyses presented as follows are based on data from the Wave 3 and Wave 4 surveys. These data collection points are used because measures of belonging in a congregation were not included in the questionnaires until Wave 3. Although 718 older people participated in the Wave 4 interviews, the responses of only 501 study participants are analyzed. Some cases (<italic>n</italic> = 217) were excluded because it does not make sense to ask study participants whether people in their congregation value their life experiences or whether they feel they belong in a congregation if they attend worship services less than twice a year.</p>
<p>The full information maximum likelihood (FIML) procedure was used to deal with item nonresponse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264311412598">Enders, 2001</xref>). Simulation studies reveal that the FIML procedure produces estimates that are comparable to those that are derived with more time-consuming techniques, such as multiple imputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264311412598">Newman, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Preliminary analysis reveals that the average age of the participants in the current study is 78.2 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.1 years), 34% were older men, 49.5% were older Whites, and the study participants completed, on average, 11.9 years of schooling (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.2 years).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The findings from this study are presented in four sections. Issues involving potential bias associated with sample attrition over time are discussed first. Next, several issues are examined that involve the way the study model was estimated. Following this, data on the reliability of the multiple item constructs are presented. Finally, the substantive findings from the study are reviewed.</p>
<sec id="section16-0898264311412598">
<title>Assessing the Effects of Sample Attrition</title>
<p>As the discussion of the sampling procedures reveals, some older people who were interviewed at Wave 1 did not participate in the Wave 4 survey. The loss of subjects over time may bias study findings if it occurs in a nonrandom manner. Although it is difficult to conclusively determine the extent of this problem, some preliminary insight may be obtained by seeing whether select data from the Wave 1 survey are associated with study participation status at Wave 4. The following procedure was used to address this issue. First, a nominal-level variable containing three categories was created to represent older adults who participated in both the Wave 1 and Wave 4 surveys, older people who were alive but did not participate at Wave 4, and older adults who died during the course of the follow-up period. Then, using multinomial logistic regression, this categorical outcome was regressed on the following Wave 1 measures: age, sex, education, race, the frequency of church attendance, being valued by people at church, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms. The category representing older people who remained in the study served as the reference group. Evidence of potential bias would be found if any statistically significant findings emerge from this analysis.</p>
<p>The results (not shown here) reveal that the loss of study participants over time did not occur in a random manner. More specifically, the data suggest that compared to people who remained in the study, those who died tended to be older (<italic>b</italic> = .093, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, odds ratio = 1.097), they were more likely to be men (<italic>b</italic> = .471, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, odds ratio = 1.602), they had fewer years of schooling (<italic>b</italic> = −.064. <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, odds ratio = 0.938), and they attended worship services less often (<italic>b</italic> = −.216, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, odds ratio = 0.806). The findings further indicate that compared to those who remained in the study, respondents who dropped out of the study but were presumed to be alive were more likely to be older (<italic>b</italic> = .036, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, odds ratio = 1.036), they were less likely to be White (<italic>b</italic> = −.455, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, odds ratio = 0.634), and they attended worship services less often (<italic>b</italic> = −.158, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, odds ratio = 0.854).</p>
<p>Although the loss of study participants over time did not occur randomly, there are two reasons why the study findings may not be biased. First, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264311412598">Graham (2009)</xref> points out, because variables such as age, sex, race, and church attendance are included in the study model as covariates, any potential bias that is associated with these constructs is likely to be minimal. Second, researchers are beginning to question the assumption that nonresponse necessarily creates nonresponse bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264311412598">Groves, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898264311412598">Holbrook, Krosnick, &amp; Pfent, 2008</xref>). However, until this issue has been resolved conclusively, the potential influence of nonrandom subject attrition should be kept in mind as the substantive findings from this study are examined.</p>

<sec id="section17-0898264311412598">
<title>Model Development Issues</title>
<p>The model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264311412598">Figure 1</xref> was evaluated with the maximum likelihood estimator in Version 8.80 of the LISREL statistical software program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898264311412598">du Toit &amp; du Toit, 2001</xref>). Use of this estimator is based on the assumption that the observed indicators have a multivariate normal distribution. Preliminary tests (not shown here) revealed that this assumption had been violated in the current study. Although there are a number of ways to deal with departures from multivariate normality, the straightforward approach that is discussed by du Toit and du Toit was followed here. These investigators report that departures from multivariate normality can be handled by converting the raw scores of the observed indicators to normal scores prior to estimating the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898264311412598">du Toit &amp; du Toit 2001</xref>, p. 143). Based on these insights, the analyses presented in the following are based on observed indicators that have been normalized.</p>
<p>Self-esteem and depressive symptoms were measured at two points in time. Consequently, two important issues involving the measurement of these constructs must be addressed so that the model with the best fit to the data can be identified. The first has to do with seeing whether the measurement error terms for identical indicators of self-esteem as well as identical measures of depressive symptoms are correlated over time. Preliminary tests (not shown here) reveal that the measurement error terms are significantly correlated over time (a table containing the results of these findings is available from the author). The second issue has to do with assessing factorial invariance over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264311412598">Bollen, 1989</xref>). Tests for factorial invariance are performed to see whether the elements of the measurement model (i.e., the factor loadings and measurement error terms) are the same over time for the self-esteem and depressive symptom items, respectively. Preliminary tests (not shown here) indicate that both the factor loadings and the measurement error terms are invariant over time.</p>
<p>The fit of the model that emerged after tests for these measurement issues is quite good. Because the FIML procedure was used to deal with item nonresponse, the LISREL software program provides only two goodness-of-fit measures. The first is the full information maximum likelihood chi-square (172.516 with 145 degrees of freedom, <italic>p</italic> = .059). This statistic tends to underestimate the fit of the model to the data when samples are large, such as the sample in the current study. Even so, the fact that the chi-square estimate is not significant at the .05 level in spite of this limitation suggests that the fit of the model to the data is good. A better grasp of the fit of the model to the data is provided by the second goodness-of-fit measure—the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). The RMSEA value for the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264311412598">Figure 1</xref> is 0.020. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264311412598">Kelloway (1998)</xref> suggests, values below 0.05 indicate a very good fit of the model to the data.</p>

<title>Reliability of the Observed Indicators</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898264311412598">Table 2</xref> contains the factor loadings and measurement error terms that were derived from estimating the study model. These coefficients are important because they provide preliminary information about the reliability of the multiple item study measures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898264311412598">Kline (2005)</xref> recommends that items with standardized factor loadings in excess of 0.600 tend to have reasonably good reliability. As the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311412598">Table 3</xref> indicate, the standardized factor loadings range from 0.681 to 0.949, indicating that the measures that are used in this study have an acceptable level of reliability.</p>

<p>Although the factor loadings and measurement error terms provide useful information about the reliability of each item, it would be helpful to know something about the reliability for the scales as a whole. Fortunately, it is possible to compute these reliability estimates with a formula provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264311412598">DeShon (1998)</xref>. This procedure is based on the factor loadings and measurement error terms in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898264311412598">Table 2</xref>. Applying the procedures described by DeShon to these data yield the following reliability estimates for the multiple item constructs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264311412598">Figure 1</xref>: belonging in a congregation (.870); self-esteem, Wave 3 (.907); self-esteem, Wave 4 (.911); depressive symptoms, Wave 3 (.848); and depressive symptoms, Wave 4 (.816).</p>

<title>Substantive Findings</title>
<p>The substantive findings from the current study are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311412598">Table 3</xref>. Taken as a whole, these data provide support for the core theoretical linkages in the study model. More specifically, the results suggest that older study participants who attend church more often are more likely to believe that their life experience is valued highly by their fellow church members (β = .244, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The data further indicate that older adults who believe that the people in their congregation value their life experience are in turn more likely to feel they belong in the place where they worship (β = .335, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). And consistent with the hypothesis that was developed earlier, older adults who feel they belong in their congregation tend to have a greater sense of self-worth at Wave 3 then older study participants who do not feel they belong in the place where they worship (β = .331, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The relationship between change in self-esteem and change in depressive symptoms is captured by the relationship between the Wave 4 measures of these constructs. The findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311412598">Table 3</xref> indicate that an increase in self-esteem is associated with lower depressive symptoms scores over time (β = −.191, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>One of the advantages of working with latent variable models arises from the fact that it is possible to assess the indirect and total effects of a variable that operate through a model. A simple example helps clarify the meaning of these terms. The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264311412598">Figure 1</xref> specifies that older people who believe others value their life experiences will be more likely to feel they belong in their congregation, and a stronger sense of belonging will, in turn, bolster feelings of self-worth. This means that having others at church value one’s life experiences may affect self-esteem indirectly through a sense of belonging in a congregation. When the direct effect of being valued for life experience is added to the indirect effect that operates through belonging, the resulting total effect provides a broader vantage point for assessing role that being valued for life experience may bolstering feelings of self-esteem. Breaking down the total effects of variables into direct and indirect effects is known as the decomposition of effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898264311412598">Alwin, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Three decompositions will be examined here. The first has to do with the relationship between the frequency of church attendance and self-esteem at Wave 3. A number of studies indicate that individuals who attend church more often tend to enjoy a greater sense of self-worth (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898264311412598">Sherkat &amp; Reed, 1992</xref>). However, the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311412598">Table 3</xref> initially appear to suggest that the direct effect of church attendance on self-esteem at Wave 3 is not statistically significant (β = −.025, n.s.). The seeming contradiction between the findings in the current study and those of other investigators can be resolved by exploring the indirect effects of church attendance on self-esteem at Wave 3 that operate through the model (β = .142, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; not shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311412598">Table 3</xref>). When these indirect effects are added to the direct effect, the resulting total effect is more in line with previous research (−.025 + .142 = .117, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The fact that the positive effect of church attendance on self-esteem is entirely explained by the indirect effects that operate through the model are noteworthy. In effect, the decomposition of effects totally explains why church attendance and self-esteem are positively associated. Put in a more substantive way, these data suggest that older people who attend worship services more often tend to have stronger feelings of self-worth because the ways in which their fellow church members value their life experience helps them derive a greater sense of belonging in the place where they worship.</p>
<p>The second decomposition of effects provides insight into the relationship between belonging in a congregation and depressive symptoms. The relationship between these constructs has not been examined previously within the context of religion. However, studies conducted in secular settings suggest that people who feel as though they belong in their social networks tend to experience fewer symptoms of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898264311412598">Steger &amp; Kashdan, 2009</xref>). Initially, it may appear that a similar relationship is not present in the current study because the direct effect of belonging in a congregation on symptoms of depression at Wave 3 is not statistically significant (β = −.078, n.s.). However, a different picture emerges in the second decomposition of effects. When the indirect effects of belonging (β = −.069, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; not shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311412598">Table 3</xref>) are added to the direct effect in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311412598">Table 3</xref>, the resulting total effect suggests that a stronger sense of belonging is indeed associated with fewer symptoms of depression (−.069 + −.078 = −.147, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>The final decomposition of effects has to do with having others in a congregation value one’s life experience and self-esteem at Wave 3. Although this relationship has not been examined previously in the literature, the fundamental principle developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264311412598">Cooley (1902/2003)</xref> would suggest that if people feel they are valued by their significant others, then they should have a greater feeling of self-worth. At first, the direct effect of being valued for life experience on self-esteem appears to be at odds with this fundamental tenet in social psychology (β = .095, n.s.). However, when the indirect effect that operates through the model (β = .111. <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; not shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264311412598">Table 3</xref>) is added to this direct effect, the resulting total effect (β = .206, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) is consistent with the principle espoused by Cooley. Since a sense of belonging in a congregation is the only variable that intervenes between feeling valued and self-esteem, this decomposition of effects suggests that older people who feel that their fellow church members value their life experience tend to have stronger feelings of self-worth primarily because of the sense of belonging that these feeling valued tends to promote.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the process of reflecting on aging and the life course, Settersten and Trauten observe that “old people are increasingly left to their own devices to determine the directions that the ends of their lives will take” (p. 458). They go on to wonder, “What happens over time to the mental health of individuals when there is no shared framework within which to assess themselves and others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264311412598">Settersten &amp; Trauten, 2009</xref>, p. 458). The question they pose is both challenging and timely, given the rapid aging of the American population. It is unlikely that there is a single best way for all people to grow older. Instead, successful aging is probably manifest in a number of different ways. The purpose of the current study was to explore one such venue—the church. And the analyses that were presented previously focus on one specific way in which this goal may be reached in religious settings. As people move through the life course they tend to learn a great deal about what constitutes a good and beneficial way of living. This cumulated wisdom can be invaluable to those who are younger. By letting older people know that they are valued for their life experience, benefits may be enjoyed by the old as well as the young. The findings from this study suggest that these benefits may arise in the following manner. When older people feel that their coreligionists value their life experience, they are more likely to believe they belong in the place where they worship. This is important because the data further reveal that feeling they have a set place in the wider milieu of the church tends to bolster and maintain feelings of self-worth that might have otherwise declined with advancing age. The consequences of this process are noteworthy because the results indicate that having a strong sense of self-worth serves to lower the risk of experiencing depressive symptoms over time.</p>
<p>The current study contributes to the literature in at least two ways. First, this appears to be the only study that examines the relationship between the valuation of life experience and mental health within the context of the church. Second, the data were gathered longitudinally, making it possible to study change in depressive symptoms over time.</p>
<p>Although the results that are reported previously may provide some insight into an overlooked way in which the church can foster the well-being of older people, a considerable amount of work remains to be done. The analyses presented previously focus on what happens to older people who believe that their fellow church members value their life experience. But the issue of how older people come to feel they are valued in this way was not examined. Researchers need to know how this process takes place. For example, formal Bible study groups or formal prayer groups may provide a forum for letting older church members know that their life experiences are valuable. Alternatively, this kind of interaction may be left to informal interaction among people who share the same faith. Or perhaps occupying a formal role in the church, such as a deacon or elder, provides an opportunity for older people to learn that others value their life experience.</p>
<p>Up to this point, nothing is known about why older people choose to share their life experiences with the people at church. One possibility is that older people share their experiences in order to feel useful. Alternatively, as discussed earlier, they may be motivated by a sense of generativity.</p>
<p>In the process of examining these as well as other issues, researchers should also pay attention to the limitations in the current study. One is especially important. Even though the data were gathered at more than one point in time, it is not possible to conclusively determine the direction of causality between key constructs in the study model. For instance, it was proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264311412598">Figure 1</xref> that self-esteem “causes” depression. However, one might just as easily argue that depression leads to diminished feelings of self-worth. In addition, the study model specifies that church attendance contributes to feelings of being valued by others. But once again, it is possible to argue that older people who feel that people at church value their life experiences are more likely to attend worship services. Moreover, it was hypothesized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264311412598">Figure 1</xref> that feeling valued for one’s life experience promotes feelings of belonging in a congregation. Even so, it might be possible that older people who feel they belong in a congregation subsequently feel that their life experience is valued by their fellow church members. Unfortunately, the conclusive resolution of these issues cannot be obtained by working with survey data.</p>
<p>Researchers have been concerned for decades about the nebulous social world in which many older people find themselves. To help older adults who are faced with this problem, research is needed to identify the contexts that are conducive to helping them find a meaningful role to play in life and greater insight is needed into the way in which the way these benefits may arise. Although there are limitations in the current study, the approach that was taken and the findings that were observed will hopefully motivate other investigators to identify other ways to help older people find a meaningful part in the wider social order.</p>
