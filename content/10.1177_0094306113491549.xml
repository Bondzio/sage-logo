<p><italic>Toward a Unified Criminology</italic> attempts to lay the foundation for integrating the many competing theoretical streams within criminology into what Robert Agnew urges can become a “unified criminology.” He pursues this task by examining what he contends are several underlying assumptions that criminologists make about the nature of crime, the nature of people, society, and reality. Through his analysis of the state of the discipline, Agnew develops a new set of assumptions that he argues extend the discipline’s ability to explain more of the variation in a broader range of crimes. Agnew, author of a number of books in criminology and a past proponent of ‘general strain theory’, is Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Sociology at Emory University and President-Elect (2013-14) of the American Society of Criminology.</p>
<p>Agnew confronts what he concedes is a divided, if not fragmented, discipline. He suggests that while the most prominent division may be between “mainstream” and “critical” criminologists, the borders of the discipline have expanded far beyond these two camps with their simple labels. Indeed, Agnew ticks off a number of versions of critical criminology on page two (Marxist, feminist, critical race, left-realist, constructionist, and postmodernist) before turning to list self-control theory, deterrence theory, rational choice theory, life course or developmental theory, learning theory, and cultural criminology among the other current theory groups. The combined list is exhausting, but given the expanding buffet of criminological theories, it does not constitute an exhaustive enumeration of the theories that have been propounded. In his view, the polarities that underlie these competing orientations impede the discipline’s ability to generate a general theory of crime, and he wishes to integrate the competing theories so that a general theory of crime can be developed.</p>
<p>Agnew proceeds by identifying five core issues about which mainstream and critical criminologists each develop assumptions, although different ones, on which they rely, sometimes inarticulately and implicitly. He believes these faulty assumptions are relied on to the detriment of the discipline. Briefly, the five issues address, (1) the definition of what constitutes a crime, (2) the question of whether crime is largely “determined” by forces beyond an individual’s control or actively “chosen” within a matrix of social conditions, (3) the nature of “human nature”—whether mankind is primarily self-interested, socially concerned, or a “blank slate,” (4) the nature of society—that is, whether it is essentially consensual, conflict-ridden, or complexly intertwined, and (5) the nature of reality—objective, irredeemably subjective, or multi-faceted. In five substantive chapters, Agnew then examines the various assumptions he finds, whether held by “mainstream” criminologists, critical criminologists, or other theory advocates. A number of the points Agnew makes are very well taken although the effort is, on the whole, less than fully satisfactory.</p>
<p>Agnew is correct that criminology may benefit from some continuing self-examination. However, his undertaking suffers from a number of difficulties. One is the lack of definition Agnew applies to his repeated use of the term “mainstream criminology.” Nowhere does he clearly identify nor demarcate the boundaries of his reference. Thus, the reader is left to infer what might be included in the term. Agnew tells us, for example, that most mainstream criminology is based on the positivistic approach which assumes an objective reality. However, it is likely that a wide number of criminologists—many of whom consider themselves “mainstream”—might object to one or the other of these descriptors. For example, various studies of “influence” among criminological theories have suggested that theorists as different as Marvin Wolfgang, Travis Hirschi, and Robert Sampson have been the intellectual leaders of the discipline during different decades. Does this suggest that all three were leaders of “mainstream” criminology? Certainly it is fair to say all three believed in an objective reality. Were all three then “positivists” as well? In this regard, the use of the “mainstream” and “critical” labels is not very helpful and perhaps, counterproductive.</p>
<p>There is also the problem of the target audience for Agnew’s book. The author tells us that the intended audience ranges from “…upper-level undergraduates to professional criminologists.” That, in my experience, is a rather broad range. One consequence of writing for such a broad swath may be the occasional lapses into repetition in the manuscript. Thus, at page 167 we are advised that “[p]ositivistic criminologists assume that there is an objective reality, that one can obtain reasonably accurate measures of it, …” and told again at page 169 that “…we have two different views…one assumes that there is an objective reality, that it can be accurately measured,…” Generally, it is not necessary to remind me every two pages of points raised two pages prior.</p>
<p>There is also the question of whether Agnew’s analysis provides anything new to the fractured discussion that is theoretical criminology. Thus, while he is anxious to establish his quasi-critical street “cred” by pummeling positivism, I recall David Sallach, among others, roundly trashing positivism at Washington University (St. Louis circa 1972) and, of course, C. Wright Mills denouncing “abstracted empiricism” in 1959. This may be more of a comment on criminology than it is a comment on Agnew, but either way it is a telling commentary on the social theory enterprise and the advances made (or not made) over the last fifty years.</p>
<p>Agnew also does not address, let alone solve, the most difficult problem posed by the more extreme positions in criminology’s divided camps: how to adjudicate between the claims. Rather, he simply asserts that theory integration is a worthy goal and one that can be achieved. Both propositions may be questioned. As some may remember, the British criminologist Stanley Cohen, now at the London School of Economics, addressed this view decades ago when he suggested that “theorizing about crime perpetuates the illusion that one can have a general theory of crime.” Thus, rather than the Holy Grail of criminology, some view a “general theory of crime” as its cold fusion. Given views like these, one must be respectfully dubious that Agnew’s invitation to join the “mission” to unify criminological theory is going to be broadly embraced. It seems more likely that criminological theory will, at best, follow the dictum Wilbert E. Moore (1914 – 1987) announced for many of his own sociological productions: “I always looked at a blank piece of paper as an invitation to fill it up with words.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the most cogent criticism of Agnew’s attempt to unify criminological theory around better “explanation” at this point in time is the lamentable record criminology has achieved for translating its few demonstrable principles into useful policies and practices that reduce crime. Since he does not raise it, Agnew apparently does not believe that the theory-to-practice link is one of the core problems that needs to be solved in criminology. Consumers of criminological knowledge, such as the public, may have a different view, however. In the last few weeks as I write this, Americans have been advised that Chicago’s murder rate has risen 38 percent over the same time last year; they have witnessed twelve killed and 58 injured in a Colorado movie theater; and have woken to the news that six were left dead after a rampage at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin. This does not seem like a time to disregard criminology’s obligation to have something useful to offer on events like these. Fortunately, criminologists, like physicians and police officers, are paid for the work performed and not the outcome achieved.</p>
