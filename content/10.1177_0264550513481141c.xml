<p>The Criminal Justice Alliance (CJA) and the Centre for Mental Health recently published a briefing <italic>The Mental Health Treatment Requirement (MHTR): Realising a Better Future. </italic>The MHTR was introduced in 2005 and forms one of twelve requirements attached to the Community Order (CO). The aim of the MHTR is to provide a pathway for those offenders with mental health (MH) problems subject to a CO, to have access to appropriate treatment. It is seen as a liaison and diversion mechanism to obtain support and treatment. However, despite research suggesting a significant amount of offenders supervised by probation have MH problems, the MHTR remains significantly underused. The purpose of this briefing examines the benefits of the MHTR, explores its underuse, and highlights the barriers preventing it from being more effective and thereby suggests ways to promote its use. The information collated is based on interviews with health professionals, offenders and probation officers who are involved with the MHTR.</p>
<p>The profile of the MHTR is now highlighted because of the current provisions being made by the government, against the backdrop of cuts to public spending, to increase the diversion of people with MH problems towards treatment and support. Further provisions include new legislation and the introduction of changes to COs that include reviewing the role of probation and other agencies in the management of offenders. The briefing identifies that the prison population has increased and most people incarcerated have a range of complex and multiple needs. It is felt that the high number of people in prison is as a result of the failure of services in the community to identify and support vulnerable people to break the cycle of offending. Notably 90 per cent of prisoners have a MH problem, substance misuse problem or personality disorder, and 70 per cent have two or more of these problems. Prison itself is recognised as damaging to MH, is expensive and ineffective in reducing subsequent re-offending. </p>
<p>Parallel to the prison population, and an important factor, is that the number of people subject to probation supervision has significantly increased. Positively, community sentences have been proven to be more effective in reducing reoffending than prison. However, reference is made to the limited research available on the numbers of people subject to a CO experiencing MH problems and the lack of recorded information from probation. Reference is made to the integrated offender management (IOM) devised to reduce prolific offending and that more encouragement is required to use the MHTR. This is alongside the CJS and MH services developing improved understanding and communication. Furthermore, emerging findings with the professionals suggests that the courts are using prison sentences inappropriately without individual needs being identified. </p>
<p>Based on research the briefing highlights a number of barriers. Firstly, the uncertainty as to who should receive the requirement as evidence suggests professionals’ individual views differ depending on their profession. Moreover, a significant issue was dual diagnosis of MH and substance misuse that can preclude people from certain services. Furthermore, low awareness and confidence amongst professionals working in the courts, probation and health services, and having different philosophies to the MHTR. Breach procedures are seen as blurring the boundaries between a therapeutic and coercive approach particularly as there has been significant increase in this area. And, finally, seen as the biggest practical barrier, is the requirement of a psychiatric report that can present many difficulties that include delays and high costs. </p>
<p>The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (Section 73) that came into force in December 2012 is instrumental in removing restriction to the MHTR. It brings the removal for an approved registered medical practitioner to provide a report before an MHTR can be issued. It is not suggested expert assistance is not necessary but the scope of the professional offering expert advice has widened., thus reducing difficulties faced by professionals. Nonetheless, concerns are raised in that an MHTR may be made when it is medically inappropriate. </p>
<p>In conclusion, to increase the effective use of the MHTR in dealing with people with MH problems appropriately and proportionately, the paper makes seven recommendations. These include providing a clear guidance on the MHTR for professionals to have increased understanding, more training and information and each area to establish an agreed protocol on the provision of mental health assessments and provide advice to the courts. It is proposed that data is regularly collated by the Government, and for liaison and diversion schemes to provide information to the courts on the MHTR. Significantly, it is recommended that there are health and well-being boards and clinical commissioning groups to monitor local commissioning plans and investment in research to support desistance from reoffending and improve mental health. This is an interesting briefing for all professionals working in probation and the health services.</p>
