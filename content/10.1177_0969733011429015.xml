<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study is to explore how nurses perceive patient participations of patients over 75 years old undergoing hemodialysis treatment in dialysis units, and of their next of kin. Ten nurses told stories about what happened in the dialysis units. These stories were analyzed with critical discourse analysis. Three discursive practices are found: (1) the nurses’ power and control; (2) sharing power with the patient; and (3) transferring power to the next of kin. The first and the predominant discursive practice can be explained with an ideology of paternalism, in which the nurses used biomedical explanations and the ethical principle of benefice to justify their actions. The second can be explained with an ideology of participation, in which the nurses used ethical narratives as a way to let the patients participate in the treatment. The third seemed to involve autonomous decision-making and the ethical principle of autonomy for the next of kin in the difficult end-of-life decisions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In newer public documents, we find an ideology that underlines the rights of patients to participate, to influence and to make personal choices.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011429015">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011429015">2</xref>
</sup> According to Norwegian law,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011429015">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011429015">3</xref>
</sup> nurses are obligated to provide an acceptable level of health assistance to patients and their family members and to allow patients and their family members to participate in the planning of patient care and treatment. This article focuses on how nurses perceive patient participation in dialysis units, that is the way in which patients over 75 years undergoing hemodialysis and their next of kin participate and interact with the clinical team.</p>
<p>Paternalistic ideology, in which patients are assumed to comply and play minimal and passive roles, has dominated health care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011429015">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011429015">5</xref>
</sup> Moving from a paternalistic ideology to one of participation involves establishing a different type of relationship between patients and nurses, in which the nurses have to involve patients and share power with them.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011429015">6</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011429015">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011429015">7</xref>
</sup> Participation might be influenced by the illness, other characteristics of the individuals involved and the context.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011429015">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011429015">9</xref>

</sup> Generally, nurses may use various strategies to promote patient participation, such as establishing close cooperation with patients, getting to know patients on an individual basis and reinforcing self-care capacity. However, patients have identified several barriers to their participation, including their own inability, lack of empathy and paternalistic attitude shown by members of the clinical team as well as structural barriers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011429015">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011429015">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011429015">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Older patients are often described as frail with complex medical problems and stressors such as fluid restrictions and fatigue,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011429015">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011429015"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733011429015">17</xref>
</sup> and they are often depressed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011429015">18</xref>
</sup> Hemodialysis units have been described as having dehumanizing effects on them.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011429015">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733011429015">20</xref>
</sup> Research has indicated that nurses working in hemodialysis units have a biomedical focus and that the complex needs of older patients undergoing hemodialysis are not often met.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011429015">21</xref>
</sup> A systematic review of studies published before 2009 found that there was a gap in the knowledge on how to meet the decision-making needs of patients living with end-stage renal disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733011429015">22</xref>
</sup> Some recent studies have shown that shared decision-making is important from the time when renal failure is diagnosed to when end-of-life decisions need to be addressed,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011429015">23</xref>
</sup> and that patients are willing to make their own end-of-life decisions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011429015">24</xref>
</sup> The decision-making process for life-sustaining treatment for dialysis patients has been characterized by nurses as being fraught with uncertainty and lacking in communication and collaboration.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733011429015">25</xref>
</sup> Murtagh<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733011429015">26</xref>
</sup> states that patients with high co-morbidity should not be considered for dialysis but for palliative treatment and care. </p>
<p>Studies have revealed that, according to nurses, the three moral problems most frequently encountered with dialysis treatment are the following: (1) continuation/discontinuation of dialysis; (2) patient non-compliance; and (3) patients’ wishes versus caregivers’ professional expertise.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011429015">27</xref>
</sup> However, research has shown that nurses faced with ethical dilemmas tend to use conventional ways of thinking as their predominant decision-guided criteria rather than patients’ personal needs and well-being.<sup>

<sec id="section2-0969733011429015">
<title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>The present study is based on Fairclough’s<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733011429015">29</xref>
</sup> statement that discourses not only influence social practice but also are influenced by it. Fairclough<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733011429015">30</xref>
</sup> defined discourse as a ‘particular way of representing particular aspects of social life’. One assumption of critical discourse analysis is that language constructs how individuals think about relationships, identity, knowledge and power,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733011429015">31</xref>
</sup> which are all central concepts, according to patient participation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011429015">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011429015">7</xref>
</sup> This idea represents a social constructivist way of thinking. It claims that the social world is socially constructed<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733011429015">30</xref>
</sup> and that human beings do not find or discover knowledge but rather construct or make it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733011429015">32</xref>
</sup> Fairclough<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733011429015">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733011429015">31</xref>
</sup> identified ideology and hegemony as central concepts of discourse. Ideology, defined as a set of beliefs and attitudes shared by members of a particular group, refers to the dominant discourse in a field. Hegemony refers to the social struggle for dominance as ideological meanings are established. </p>
<p>Allowing older patients to participate in the hemodialysis treatment might raise ethical questions. The traditional principles of ethics are based on rational principles. Two important principles are (1) the principle of benefice, which is based on the acts of mercy, kindness and charity and (2) the principle of autonomy, which is based on equal respect for individuals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011429015">5</xref>
</sup> However, in some situations it is necessary to move behind the principles of ethics to the situational ethics in which individuals are perceived as relational.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733011429015">33</xref>
</sup> Because individuals are particular, situated and self-interpreting, the most faithful way of knowing the good they seek is through their own accounts, their personal narratives; that is, the ethical narratives created by the patients and the nurses.<sup>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Five hospitals in eastern and western Norway with 14, 14, 40, 60 and 60 patients, respectively, were included in the study. Ten nurses were interviewed -- 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 nurses respectively at each dialysis units. The inclusion criterion for nurses was at least 2 years’ work experience in a dialysis unit. During the period from January to December 2008, 10 nurses were interviewed: three were interviewed outside the hospital and seven were interviewed in a suitable room in the hospital. A contact nurse selected nurses to participate at the first author’s request, based on the aim of including participants with different clinical experiences. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0969733011429015">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Data were collected through the use of qualitative interviews in the form of narratives. Polkinghorne<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733011429015">34</xref>
</sup> made the term ‘story’ equivalent to ‘narrative’ and pointed out that narrative is the primary form by which human experiences are made meaningful. The concept of narrative is a collective term about data as life stories and descriptions of situations and ethical dilemmas.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733011429015">35</xref>
</sup> </p>
<p>The nurses were first asked to speak about themselves and the structure of the dialysis units. Then the nurses were asked, with respect to the rights of patients and family members,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011429015">1</xref>
</sup> to describe what happened in the dialysis units and how they cared for and treated those patients undergoing hemodialysis – specifically those who were over 75 years old and were not to be transplanted – and their family members. The information gathered from the interviews covered the patients’ entire course of treatment, from the beginning of hemodialysis to the end of life. From the information gathered about practical events/situations that occurred in the dialysis units, we obtained data about the nurses’ description of the interaction between nurses and patients and their next of kin. </p>
<p>The interviewer herself had extensive experience in hemodialysis nursing for 15 years, and was familiar with the terminology of dialysis. The interviewer followed up by going after the structure of the stories<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733011429015">34</xref></sup> and helped the nurses to construct their stories by asking open-ended and critical questions<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0969733011429015">36</xref>
</sup> such as ‘Can you please tell me more about this event?’, ‘What happened then?’ and ‘Did you ask for the patient’s opinion?’ In that way the possibilities of asking leading questions were minimized. However, the researcher is always part of the interview process and certain events might receive greater attention than others. The first author of the present study conducted and tape-recorded all of the interviews and then transcribed, word for word, the interviews shortly thereafter. The interviews were critically evaluated throughout the creation of the data and the analysis process by listening to the stories several times and by discussing the interpretation with the other authors, who also listened to parts of the stories. </p>

<sec id="section8-0969733011429015">
<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>This study was conducted according to the rules of the Helsinki Declaration of 2002. Permission to carry out the research was granted by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics of Mid-Norway and by the participating hospitals. Data collection followed the guidelines of the Data Inspectorate of Norway. The nurses gave written consent to participate and to allow the interviews to be recorded. The researcher assured the participants by letter that the tape-recorded interviews would be deleted after transcription.</p>

<title>Data analysis </title>
<p>Critical discourse analysis was applied to describe, interpret and explain the data.<sup>

</sup> using the following questions: What words did the nurse use to describe the situations and the interaction between actors? Did nurses use words of appraisal, or plus and minus words? What modalities (e.g. modal auxiliary verbs such as ‘must’ and ‘can’) and metaphors were used? The modality in the sentences expresses the level of power in the interaction between individuals. Metaphors, along with our systems of knowledge and beliefs, structure the way we think and act in a pervasive and fundamental way.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733011429015">30</xref>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Three of the nurses were aged between 30 and 39 years and seven were aged between 40 and 50 years. Six had worked for 6–14 years and four had worked for 15–25 years in a dialysis unit. Two of them had, at the time of interview, a leading function. Each nurse was responsible for three to five patients. Lying side by side, the patients were connected to the dialysis machine for 2--4 hours, two or three times a week. The nurses treated the patients during daytime hours 6 days a week. Four of the five dialysis units offer a ‘kidney school’ for patients and their families to attend before the patients begin dialysis. </p>
<p>From the perspective of participation, the following three styles of discursive practices were found: (1) the nurses’ power and control; (2) sharing power with the patient; and (3) transferring power to the next of kin.</p>
<sec id="section11-0969733011429015">
<title>Nurses’ power and control </title>
<sec id="section12-0969733011429015">
<title>Frail older patients in the context of the dialysis units</title>
<p>The following excerpt is a typical description of the older patients in the context of the dialysis units: <disp-quote>
<p>[In] the last years, there has been an explosion in the number of dialysis patients … and there are a lot of older patients. Older patients are particularly difficult to treat in dialysis . . . They have so many additional diagnoses … and to remove fluid is difficult … Many of them are very frail when we start dialysis … maybe critical ill, and then all the decisions are done, and that’s the way it is.</p>
<p>(N4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When the nurses talked about older patients undergoing hemodialysis, they often used the personal pronoun ‘them’ and the term ‘older people’; they refer to the patients as a group and never use the word ‘we’ when referring to the patients and the nurses. When referring to these older patients they employed words of appraisal, such as ‘difficult’ and ‘frail’. The patients’ frailness and age were used as arguments for not involving them in decision-making processes. The nurses’ power and control are especially visible in the strong modality of the expression ‘that’s the way it is’. </p>
<p>The nurses were also focused on finding ways to improve their patients’ quality of life in the context of the dialysis units. <disp-quote>
<p>Older people will be here until they die…. We should make this world meaningful for them; it requires resources. It should not only be a storage space … a postponement of death but an extension of life in a positive way. It should be quality of life … Some days I feel that we are just running the factory.</p>
<p>(N1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This nurse’s use of certain words of appraisal, such as ‘quality of life’ and ‘meaningful’, were connected to interpersonal modality; that is, ‘we should make’, with the personal pronoun ‘we’ referring to the nurses. It also seems that the nurses tried to exercise control over the patients’ subjective feelings. The use of the metaphor ‘factory’ and the word ‘resources’ suggests that nurses endeavor to ‘work’ for their patients but encounter some obstacles. One of the nurses (N1) used the metaphor ‘factory’ to describe the context of the dialysis unit. A ‘factory’ will usually focus on production, not human relations. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0969733011429015">
<title>Dealing with patient passivity</title>
<p>Several of the nurses classified older patients undergoing hemodialysis as a passive group. One (N8) commented, ‘When you are 75 years, you accept what you get, and you do not demand. Should you have a transplant, you are more active’. Another (N3) remarked, ‘I think they adapt to what we say … very few who have special wishes’. Several nurses talked about how difficult it was to get patients to understand their treatment. One (N2) stated the following: ‘It is to explain and explain and explain, and it’s not so easy with the elderly … It is not so many who want to learn.’ One (N5) explained the situation as follows: ‘We have the responsibility, and we decide… I think they hand over a great deal to us.’ The passivity of the patients is visible in the nurses’ use of words of appraisal, such as ‘accept’ and ‘do not demand’ and in minus words, such as ‘few’. The interpersonal modality – the nurses’ power – is visible in the nurses’ use of the personal pronoun ‘we’ and the verbs ‘explain’ and ‘decide’ when referring to themselves and their actions, respectively. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0969733011429015">
<title>‘We become people of power’</title>
<p>The nurses tried to take control over their patients’ treatment, but not all of the patients passively accepted the treatment that was set for them. To gain control over the patients’ treatment, the nurses might sometimes override the patients’ wishes. One nurse (N3) described the situation as follows: <disp-quote>
<p>There is a man who needs more dialysis because he has so much fluid to be removed. And with a sick heart, it is hard to remove enough water… We’ve tried to tell him that it can become … too much for his heart… He expresses that he does not want more hours in dialysis and sighs, ‘Yes, yes, you get what you wish’ … It is not the way it should be… It is a treatment offer, but he gets overridden … and that is so wrong … We become people of power who dispense our knowledge, without listening to the patient. </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This patient’s situation is typical of most of the stories. The nurses explained and justified their actions based on the seriousness of their patients’ illness: ‘more dialyses’, ‘sick heart’ and ‘so much fluid’. However, the modality of the sentence (‘you get what you wish’, ‘person of power’, ‘overridden’, ‘it should be a treatment offer’) and the negative words (‘that is wrong’) show that some of them reflected on their power as professionals. </p>

<title>Getting patients’ bodies in physiological balance</title>
<p>The nurses in the present study took control and got their patients’ bodies in physiological balance. One (N9) remarked, ‘I used to say we don’t “play store” … when the patients ask, “Can I get only two hours today” ’. Patients’ lack of choice is also visible in the following comment by another (N2): ‘The number of hours a week is constant… If he has less than that, he gets a poor quality of life… You’ll be sicker and frail… We tell them… they really have no choice’. The issue of ‘dry weight’ also showed the lack of choice for patients. One (N5) described the ‘dry weight’ issue as follows: <disp-quote>
<p>This with the ‘dry weight’ is difficult… Many do not want to remove fluid down to the ‘dry weight’… But to ask them ‘What do you think we shall do today?’ I think is difficult. And you can see they are breathing heavily.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Patients undergoing hemodialysis require either a fistula or a catheter. All of the nurses interviewed for this study noted that they preferred patients with a fistula because the rate of infection is lower. One (N7) stated: ‘We prefer fistula. We try to sell it as well as we can.’ This nurse used the word ‘sell’ as a metaphor for how she tried to convince the patients; that the patients did not have a real choice. The nurses’ control and power and the patients’ powerlessness are visible in the interpersonal modality in sentences such as ‘we tell them’ and ‘they really have no choice’. The nurses justify their actions with words of appraising such as ‘difficult’ and ‘poor quality of life’. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0969733011429015">
<title>Interacting with the next of kin</title>
<p>Because the next of kin were not present in the nurses’ stories, the researcher (R) had to ask for them. The nurses remarked that they had very little contact with the next of kin and that, when they did, it was almost always with the wives. In the following excerpt, one (N7) describes the involvement of the next of kin: <disp-quote>
<p>R: The next of kin, are they there?</p>
<p>N7: Very different. You have next of kin who are very visible … and call us. We have a communication book that we have used for some patients when the patients do not take care of themselves… The next of kin is almost a wife… We see … wives who are so actively involved in their husbands’ treatment that they almost ‘kill’ themselves. One wife called us and said, ‘I give up. I hear him locking himself in the bathroom, and he is drinking water’. She runs and looks after him all along. Then we [the nurses] thought that she should not have to do it [anymore]. We stopped telling her … and then she felt that we have bad communication.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the following interview excerpt, a nurse (N5) describes a lack of communication with the next of kin: <disp-quote>
<p>We have a patient … had to remove a lot of fluid… His blood pressure has fallen many times. The wife called us and was angry because we do not care for her husband. I understand how she feels – from the outside it looks bad… There has not been any dialogue or call from them for meetings to get them to understand why things are as they are. </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In both interview excerpts, the nurses noted the extent of dialogue with the next of kin, and the interpersonal modality expressed in the expressions ‘we thought’ and ‘to get them to understand’ shows that the nurses had control and decided when the next of kin should be included or excluded. </p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0969733011429015">
<title>Sharing power with the patients </title>
<p>However, some of the nurses’ texts have another style, where the perspective shifts from the nurse’s actions to the patient’s wishes and actions. </p>
<sec id="section18-0969733011429015">
<title>Actively involved patients</title>
<p>In the following interview excerpt, a nurse (N4) describes one of her actively involved patients: <disp-quote>
<p>She is extremely determined. She marks down the weight, how much fluid we have removed… She is extremely interested and asks about the blood pressure and fluid removed, and she tells us when she feels cramp[s] and so on… The machine is okay, but what we do with her body, she says, ‘It is me who is ill’. She is very determined… She says, ‘Today, I think we have to do it this way because last time I was like that’ … She wants to participate, and we must listen to her.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When describing one of her actively involved patients, she (N4) used positive phrases, such as ‘extremely interested’ and ‘very determined’. The interpersonal modality of the expression ‘we must listen to her’ reveals that the power has shifted from the nurse to the patient.</p>
<p>Another nurse (N2) observed that actively involved patients share some common characteristics: ‘Those who are a little higher up in the social stratum, they impose more requirements… They ask more questions … communicate clearly … what they expect and what they want’. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0969733011429015">
<title>Sharing knowledge and trusting the patient</title>
<p>Nurses who talked about actively involved patients also commented on how they get their patients to participate. In the following interview excerpt, one (N8) describes how one patient’s ability to communicate influenced aspects of her treatment, and she uses the personal pronoun ‘we’ about nurse and patient: <disp-quote>
<p>One lady said, ‘Today, I will not have removed more than 700 mL’. She was very decided. And I accept… when patients know their own body and as long as they have some insight into the illness. I will say that we accept the fluid removed they want, or we together [with the patients]. </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another nurse (N10) described a similar type of interaction with patients:<disp-quote>
<p>To get them to speak and tell a bit about how they feel with the disease, about what they understand about blood pressure, water, food and pee, and that everything is [tied] together… I think they have everything they should have said… I feel that the patients know… maybe better than us. </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this specific example, the patient’s power is visible in the interpersonal modality of the nurse’s use of expressions, such as ‘we ask’, ‘they have’ and ‘I accept’, and in the use of positive words, such as ‘everything’ and ‘better’. By encouraging patients to share their knowledge and feelings, nurses begin to trust their patients. </p>
</sec>

<sec id="section20-0969733011429015">
<title>Transferring power to the next of kin</title>
<p>The third style of the nurses’ stories shifts the focus from the patients to the next of kin involvement. All of the nurses interviewed for this study mentioned the difficulty associated with end-of-life decisions. One (N3) commented, ‘It is always difficult when the patient gets worse, when shall we stop the dialysis?’ Another (N1) described the end-of-life decision-making process as follows: <disp-quote>
<p>I verify that I hear what the patient says and ask him to tell more, if he knows what it means not to be treated, and talk about if he really does not want to live anymore … And we tell the physician… It is obviously difficult for the physician. </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the following interview excerpt, a nurse (N2) describes how the conflicting opinions of those (i.e. the patient, the nurses and the physician) involved in end-of-life decision-making can affect a patient’s dignity: <disp-quote>
<p>I have treated a dying patient who was angry … he should [continue to] have dialysis. He said, ‘I have said that I do not want dialysis’. The doctor said that he should be treated… We were angry because the doctor was not present… And it happened again last time I was working with another patient [N2 sighs]… Is this a dignified end of life? </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The word of appraisal ‘difficult’ was used by all of the nurses interviewed for this study when they talked about end-of-life decision-making. These difficult situations created certain feelings. The nurses used the word of appraisal ‘angry’ and negative words, such as ‘not present’, when they talked about collaborating with physicians about when to stop dialysis. Avoiding the situation seemed to be considered the easiest approach. One (N8) remarked, ‘you … have to be a strong person… if you … deny treatment. It is easier for the nurses and doctors to just treat the patients’. However, someone has to make a decision. According to the nurses interviewed for this study, patients typically approach the nurses and express their wish to stop dialysis. The nurses then convey this wish to the physicians, who often leave it up to the next of kin to make this decision. </p>
<p>In the following interview excerpt, a nurse (N8) describes how difficult the end-of-life decision-making process becomes when the next of kin and the patients do not agree: <disp-quote>
<p>N8: A patient said he did not want dialysis… He had been treated a while and knew what it was. He refused the dialysis again and again … but he had a wife and children … who wanted him to continue… It was difficult to override the patient’s will; he expressed it clearly.</p>
<p>R: And the patient was competent?</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>N8: Yes, I think so … and he said it several times…</p>
<p>R: What happened?</p>
<p>N8: The patient lives, and the next of kin are very tired… The patient has struggled, but he has resigned, I feel. </p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The interpersonal modality of the expressions ‘to override the patient’s will’ and ‘he has resigned’ illustrates how patients feel powerless in this type of situation. The power of the next of kin is seen in the interpersonal modality of the words ‘wanted him to continue’. </p>
<p>One (N10) points to the fact that dialogue is the key to dealing with this type of situation: ‘I often think that we nurses mean it in one way, and the doctors, in another way… It is a difficult situation, and you need experience to handle it… We must talk with each other’. This nurse usually used the personal pronoun ‘we’ when referring to nurses. However, she changed to use the personal pronoun ‘we’ when referring to the entire healthcare team and she used the word ‘communication’ when she talked about dealing with the difficult end-of-life decision.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Three discursive practices are found: (1) the nurses’ power and control; (2) sharing power with the patient; and (3) transferring power to the next of kin. The predominant discursive practice, ‘the nurses’ power and control’ represents a social practice in which nurses know what is best for patients. This is a paternalistic discourse that has traditionally been the ideology of the healthcare system.<sup>

</sup> The third discursive practice concerns the role of the clinic team and the next of kin in the end-of-life decision-making process. </p>
<p>The nurses used both the patients’ ages and the seriousness of the patients’ illnesses as arguments for not letting them participate in making decisions about their treatment. Changing the social practice from paternalism to participation, and allowing older patients undergoing hemodialysis to participate in decisions regarding their care and treatment, might present some challenges. It is well known that the context, the illness and personal characteristics could be hindrances to participation.<sup>

<title>Paternalism versus participation</title>
<p>The nurses used a biomedical explanation to justify the paternalistic attitude and to argue for ‘the nurses’ power and control’. They used their professional knowledge and endeavored to keep their patients’ bodies in physiological balance; in doing so, they believed that they were providing their patients with a better quality of life. Most of the nurses spoke in a style as though they knew what was best for their patients, and let their patients have little influence over the treatment. These nurses used their knowledge, an objective rationale<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733011429015">33</xref>
</sup> and the ethical principle of beneficence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011429015">5</xref>
</sup> However, research has revealed that the complex needs of older patients undergoing hemodialysis are often not met.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011429015">21</xref>
</sup> It is interesting to note that the nurses who discussed the issue of control also talked about the passivity of patients. The ideology of paternalism has been described by patients as a barrier to patient participation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011429015">11</xref>

</sup> a social practice involving active patients in which nurse and patients engage in dialogue and shared decision-making. Some nurses trusted the patients and thought that they knew their own bodies and what was best for them. Moral problems such as non-compliance and patients’ wishes versus caregivers’ professional expertise<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011429015">27</xref>
</sup> were not present in those nurses’ stories. The nurses who talked about the social practice of patient participation used relational narratives. They helped their patients to describe their perceptions of the illness and to engage in shared decision-making. In that way, they shifted from using principle ethics to relational ethics. By contrast, an earlier study showed that nurses used an accepted way of thinking when they encountered moral problems.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733011429015">28</xref>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study adopted a constructive approach. The stories will never be a correct representation of the real world, but were constructed by the nurses in dialogue with the researcher. The stories represent the nurses’ views at the time of the interview. However, rich stories give many data, and noticing how the nurses used their language gives information about the practice that other methods do not. The interviewer’s pre-understanding as an earlier dialysis nurse might be a weakness that might influence the stories, but could also be a strength. The saturation of the data was difficult to ascertain; after 10 informants, the nurses had described the activities in many ways. However, the analysis shows that the nurses with the same style of the discursive practices came from the same unit. Perhaps other dialysis units might have revealed another style if they could tell their stories. The present study cannot, however, be generalized to other dialysis units. </p>

<title>Conclusions and implications for nursing practice </title>
<p>The predominant discourse in the dialysis units in connection to older patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment and their next of kin seemed to have an ideology of paternalism. The nurses generally used a biomedical explanation and the ethical principle of beneficence to justify their actions. However, the perceptions of some of the nurses suggest that establishing the social practice of participation might be possible. These nurses show support for engaging in dialogue and shared decision-making and for using ethical narratives as a way of allowing older patients undergoing hemodialysis to participate in their treatment. The present study also finds that the social practice of the end-of-life decision-making seems to involve the principle of autonomy more for the next of kin than the patients. </p>
<p>These findings are important and relevant for clinical practice when the intention is to let the patients and their next of kin have their rights to participate in hemodialysis treatment. To change the social practice in the dialysis units from paternalism to participation, the nurses need to discuss amongst themselves their beliefs and attitudes connected to allowing the older patients and their next of kin to participate in the care and treatment. Establishing good dialogue among members of the clinical team might be beneficial in dealing with the difficult end-of-life decision-making process. However, this topic needs further research.</p>
