<abstract>
<p>Through case studies drawn from Fort McMurray (Alberta, Canada) near the Athabasca Tar Sands, builders’, residents’ and public officials’ attempts to develop neighbourhoods in the midst of an oil boom and bust economy are considered. Drawing on interviews with these actors, photographs and participant observation, this article considers the production of new suburbs through crown land release and development. Within a highly constrained planning context, the adaptation of land development policy and practice, as well as attempts to stabilize a highly dynamic economic environment, create ‘works-in-progress’; built environments that attempt to materially render the circuits and forces of a global petro-economy habitable in the name of social reproduction. The label ‘feral’ is advanced to highlight how these suburbs transfigure preconceptions of North American suburbia as a cultural form. Residents of Fort McMurray perform novel syntheses which impact on the actualization of cultural forms, including household and community.</p>

<p>A more recent rush for ‘black gold’ in Canada’s boreal north has driven the expansion of Fort McMurray (Alberta Canada) through a series of boom and bust cycles over the last 40 years despite its isolated location, a four-hour drive north of the provincial capital, Edmonton. As in Robert Service’s poem about the Klondike Gold Rush of the late 1890s, strangeness vies with normality as cultural and economic forms of shift-work and suburban life are remade. While suburban patterns of settlement have a certain recognizable sameness of peripherality, every instance is also different. Although familiar narratives<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367877911433743">1</xref></sup> about suburbia describe houses, roadways and so on, any suburb is less manifest in representative but static objects and housing types than as actualized space-time ‘<italic>cultural topologies</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367877911433743">Shields, forthcoming</xref>). The literature on the circulation of cultural forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367877911433743">Gaonkar and Povinelli, 2003</xref>: 386; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367877911433743">Lee and LiPuma, 2002</xref>) such as suburbia(s) and modernities has little to say about the space in which forms circulate. Fort McMurray’s suburbia illustrates how space and time themselves circulate and are transfigured.</p>
<p>This short version of a longer paper derives from four years of research. A photo project with youth aged 13–16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367877911433743">Lozowy, 2009</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1367877911433743">2</xref></sup> and over 100 semi-structured and longer in-depth interviews were conducted in fieldwork in Fort McMurray with residents, workers, entrepreneurs, municipal and provincial administrators and planners using a snowball sample and an ethnographic approach. This fieldwork was supplemented by a statistical analysis of migration, political economic data and ‘Unwrap the Research’, a community-academic research symposium and dialogue.</p>

<title>Black gold</title>
<p>Fort McMurray (pop. 85,000 plus or minus 15,000) is a regional administrative centre. The definition of the place as a city is equivocal as it dis-incorporated to join the surrounding resource-rich Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo (RMWB) in the mid-1980s, taking the term ‘urban service area’. It is located just south of the controversial Athabasca Tar Sands (or Oil Sands depending on one’s politics). These are the largest global deposits of bitumen – an oil resource second only to Saudi Arabia in scale. The petrochemical economy entails global circuits of expertise: Nigerians, Venezuelans, Chilean refinery technicians, Filipinos, Chinese, Brits and Americans work alongside the largest exclave of Newfoundlanders, not to mention others from across Canada. Our respondents, such as municipal planners, provincial policy-makers and private sector developers, have struggled to accommodate expansion of a population which has fluctuated dramatically, expanding rapidly over about five years, then contracting during 2009, and returning to expansion at maximum velocity by late 2010. A municipal official told us ‘we know we are going to grow. We’ve targeted 250,000 people by 2030.’</p>
<p>Non-resident workers often commute from across the continent for several weeks ‘on’, sometimes via non-stop company Airbus flights to private oil sands airports, and either rent rooms (often so-called ‘basement suites’ in private homes) in town, while about 20,000 live in large hotel-like work-camps built from ‘construction trailer’-like modules. These workers form a mostly male ‘shadow population’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367877911433743">Hann, 2010</xref>) that inflects the civic culture with a gold-rush flavour. Still, residents of Fort McMurray have aspired to develop community by expanding suburbia as a family-oriented community form. The tension is suggested by the following quotation from a resident:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If these people brought their families in, all of a sudden you’re in more of a family-orientated community again like it was when I first moved up. And you see that where people are renting out rooms and basements and that kind of thing because of accommodation issues that we had. I think that part of that loneliness, that distance apart, gives you some dysfunctional families as well which doesn’t make a lot of sense. (Long-term resident)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Residents are highly mobile, many commuting hundreds of kilometres to Edmonton, travelling to shop or, if wages permit, to fly out for the occasional weekend in Las Vegas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877911433743">Dorow and Dogu, 2011</xref>). When asked what they would like to see happen for the place, one of our respondents puts it this way:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Better housing opportunities. I’m going to be depressed here myself. I’ll probably have to rent for a few years. (Newly arrived public servant)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Your $1400 a month [salary] isn’t doing it for you there?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Worker:</speaker>
<p>It gets me a room in a trailer. A 6 × 6 room. I’ll be lucky if I get a window … (Worker)</p>
</speech>
<p>Many thus rent basement suites in the new suburbs laid out on freshly cleared land, bulldozed into the pine and spruce forests and muskeg bogs of the flat, boreal plain above the downtown river valley, which is situated at the confluence of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers. Set up above the river valley, suburbia in Fort McMurray is independent of the pre-existing downtown.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1367877911433743">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the time of writing, Parson’s Creek and Saline Creek areas housing developments have been released.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1367877911433743">4</xref></sup> The Province is acting as developer, investing more than $166 million and $75 million, respectively, to drain these areas and prepare basic access routes and utility trunk lines. By 2012, Phase 1 of Parson’s Creek will cover over 450 acres and will house 24,600 people in 2000 new homes and 6000 apartment units, of which 20 percent will be rented out by the Wood Buffalo Housing Authority below market rates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1367877911433743">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>‘A Fort McMurray of the mind’</title>
<p>Unlike most single-industry resource towns (for which there is a significant sociological literature not surveyed here), Fort McMurray sits astride a 100-year petroleum resource, and this time-frame has belatedly forced governments to focus on the social issues raised by such fluctuating migrations. Workers circulate between distant hometowns, importing regional and foreign cultures into a local mix of diasporas which seem to have arrived in the years since the last Canadian Census in 2006, when over 60 percent of respondents had lived locally for three years or longer. Because most are temporary residents, or even just passing through en route to a nearby oil sands mine camp, diasporic communities form as mixtures of class, religious, ethnic and gender positions. There are residents who can count themselves as amongst the first employees of the corporations that pioneered the development of the oil sands – ‘I was Syncrude employee number six’, says an elderly man in a cafe and a respectful hush falls over the coffee shop. This is a claim to more than history: it situates this person as one of the founders of a community – ‘ur-labour’ – a veteran to whom one owes a generational debt, a prime mover of the subsequent and future flows and wealth. Fort McMurray’s suburbs are part of a switching point where financial capital is exchanged for labour that is housed, harnessed and reproduced. It is as strategic as any board room or trading floor.</p>
<p>In the context of suburban living, despite the typical inadequacies of explicit markers and institutions of community, there is nonetheless a coordinated labour of place making, constant upkeep, exchange of favours, and the constitution of a sense of home that is not only a household matter but takes place in a social context is troubled ‘from below’ in Fort McMurray. The basement suites rented out to migrant labourers complicate the stereotype of the single-family dwelling. Even though private property militates against anything other than economic collective action (e.g. to preserve property values, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877911433743">Oestereich, 2000</xref>), nonetheless, there is a broader <italic>oikos</italic> of suburban dwelling that is continually referenced and almost conjured from the hypostatized objects of property. The domestic is ‘virtually’ part of this symbolic circulation of encounters and avoidances, gestures, glances and small talk. According to one respondent, the size of Fort McMurray seems to foster rapid integration and community events: We asked, ‘You mentioned Santa Claus parades. Are there other kinds of public events or public places … ?’</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s ongoing. At any given point and time. Like I heard on the radio this morning and I must admit I didn’t hear about it before but there’s some sort of family skate …</p>
<p>You heard about it? … There’s always that kind of stuff going on. And there’s some pretty big take up on it … there was just blocked you couldn’t … it was hard to find a place to stand, let alone sit. (Resident)</p>

<title>Feral suburbanism</title>
<p>Fort McMurray’s suburbs are arguably well-planned housing developments yet inadequate, unsatisfying places to live in the sense that lack of services and consumption opportunities is compounded by a sense of geographic distance and isolation. Hence the term ‘feral’. This can be understood in a number of ways. Suburbia escapes from a taken-for-granted tameness or ceases to be domesticated. The juxtapositions visible in Fort McMurray, on the half-built-up streets of Eagle Ridge or Parson’s Creek, such as the many trucks of tenants of basement suites or the raw edge of the forest, trouble the conventional staging of suburban environments that inform a taken-for-granted ‘settlement’ of the built environment and the wider landscape of ecosystem and climatic context.</p>
<p>Feral also suggests ‘savage’ suburbs. This synonym of feral hints at the ferocity of the forces of petroleum resource exploitation that so dwarf other forms of engagement with the region’s resources as to push other industries such as forestry aside, not to mention trapping or subsistence activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1367877911433743">6</xref></sup> A third synonym, ‘wild’, reminds us of the almost impenetrably boggy forest at the end of the street, which exists in striking contrast to the vinyl-clad exteriors of suburban houses and their vehicle- and RV-filled driveways and streets which could be almost anywhere. Suburbia collides with a vast ecological totality that retains its complex otherness despite the surveyors’ cuts through the forest. Suburban life in Fort McMurray means to be melancholically governed most of the time by the isolation imposed by the expanse of wilderness, to be fatally forced to respect its climatic extremes, to grimly wrest oil wealth from the strata of the area, or to joyfully respond to its beauties.</p>
<p>What then is one to make of Fort McMurray’s mode of land and community development that is so patently North American ‘suburban’ yet still Other?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1367877911433743">7</xref></sup> It conforms to images and forms of the North American middle class rather than to those of the local, the working class or to the village rubric of the surrounding Métis, Cree and Dene settlements. Indeed, this is a paradise of the lumpen proletariat, wealthy on overtime and double shifts. Our respondents often referred to distant cities when discussing Fort McMurray, such as referring to boxy houses as ‘Calgary houses’ or using arrows to indicate that ‘home’, ‘fun’ or ‘out’ exist off the pages of sketch maps (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877911433743">Dorow and Dogu, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Fort McMurray, like any suburb, is not only constituted by what is present, but also by what is absent and what is far away but topologically linked. There is a sense that the entire city is suburban: it lacks not only formal urban status since it dis-incorporated in the mid 1980s. It also stands as an ex-urban addition, a displaced adjunct and outpost of more southerly metropolises. Understood as a form, suburbia dissolves into only an intensive ordinate of broader forces and flows across a topology. Forms may be instantiated merely by performative quotation – for example, when a neighbourhood is not literally but ‘as if’ a suburb. Neither simply domestic nor properly wild but the ‘domestic’ turned toward an Otherness and elsewhereness.</p>
<p>While acknowledging that many major retail developments are located in suburban or peri-urban locations, one of the key qualities of suburbs is the stereotype of limited consumption diversity. Responding to team-members’ comments about the lack of commercial space in one area of Fort McMurray, a respondent says:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Oh yeah, when they laid out this area, they really underestimated what they should … this is what you call … this is suburban. And a real suburb is you drive out of it to get your commercial, whereas what we were pushing is we want a more urban feel to it, which means you should be within your five-minute walk/hike/drive/bike whatever. You could do your weekly things. And here you can’t even do your daily things. You have to get out of it. (Resident)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some needs and aspirations are displaced elsewhere to places such as Las Vegas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877911433743">Shields, 2011</xref>), where a pure spectacle of consumption reigns, or to the hometowns of the many temporary migrants where family life carries on in their absence, or where society awaits their reintegration as community members. These relationships manifest themselves in multi-layered flows of messages, hopes, dreams and mobile bodies in the many flights ‘out’ and ‘south’ that are the vectors of escape.</p>

<title>Land release: creating real estate from natural space</title>
<p>Despite repeated comments on the benefits of having the forest so close at hand as a natural area, part of the spatialization of Fort McMurray is to rigorously separate the spaces of social reproduction from spaces of production – the forested rural region that is the site of resource extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367877911433743">Shields, 1991</xref>). This is done by ‘creating’ land and constructing suburban tracts that are as typical as possible of other North American cities, including in their blandness. This results in neighbourhoods that are neither ecological nor naturalized. Separation is also a challenge given the cross-sectoral interests, including the oil companies, governments and private developers that are involved in producing the spaces of social reproduction. New housing in Fort McMurray has developed through a slow process of the incremental release of parcels of land to private development from the surrounding Crown Land controlled by the Provincial Government (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367877911433743">Cilliers, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1367877911433743">9</xref></sup> This takes place on the basis of requests from the local government, the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo (RMWB) which also controls the ‘urban service area’ of Fort McMurray since its dissolution. The RMWB has tended to operate partly as a surrogate city council, and partly as a regional industrial development authority, with many complaints from the actual residents of the vast rural area surrounding Fort McMurray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367877911433743">Lagendijk, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Even if it is gridded by surveyor’s lines and has been minutely assayed by mobile seismic units looking for the characteristic echo of subterranean oil deposits, land release is a process of bringing space like boreal forest into the property system where it becomes real estate. Divided into lots, it will be interchangeable with suburban lots in Minnesota or anywhere else in the property system through the medium of money. The process surpasses the creative as it is almost alchemical: the sovereign sets in play a ritual of legislative fiat by which earth itself is transfigured, pulled out of one semiotic system of nature to be reborn as capital in the form of land. Many respondents have expressed anxiety about the involvement of multiple levels of government in this process, which entails cross-jurisdictional collaborations with which few have extensive experience. This legal ritual is troubled by the erosion of the pure difference between nature and culture at the representational level. It may contribute to this through rushed distribution and inadequate due-process to recognize this categorical difference. It is also fraught with the material resistance of, for example, boggy wetlands as unstable, inappropriate building sites. These instabilities make for feral built environments, feral suburbs.</p>
<p>The production of these suburbs is through a mixture of public–private oversight committees, outsourcing to private developers and a syndicalization of risk to large private sector employers, such as CNRL who wish to encourage skilled workers to remain with the firm. As this is a form of company town, public–private partnerships in infrastructure and recreational facilities are extended into families’ everyday lives, not only through awareness of the importance of the oil sands industry but also through financial ties and other bonuses which go beyond remuneration. They are also extended through the formation of family life via the structure of time and the production of suburban housing and neighbourhoods, where diversity is limited by the sheer fact that all residents share in the same economic fate and fortunes of the oil sands.</p>
<p>Despite the rushed urbanization of Fort McMurray, the government prides itself on its diligent review of public interest and the careful extinguishment of any native claim. The slow pace of ‘land release’ means that land is always in short supply despite the miles of surrounding muskeg bog and forest. ‘Look at all that land …’ we naively comment in an interview:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What do you mean ‘you’re surrounded by land …’ the fact remains we’re surrounded by Crown land … the land the municipality controls right now is becoming very, very small … we have something like maybe 22 hectares of available commercial land if that … when we need probably something close to 1000 … based on projections. (Municipal planner)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, the process is anything but clear and transparent. Historical and pre-historical aboriginal peoples understood spatializations of the land in which they were positioned as an integral element of the forest, or as shamanic stewards of natural cycles. Such a spatialization is part of traditional knowledge that is almost impossible to recode into the alienated language of property and objects (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367877911433743">Nadasdy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367877911433743">Taylor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367877911433743">Thornton, 2010</xref>). This repressed web of relations and circuits of harvesting and offering is forcibly interrupted by a transnational regime of flows but contributes to disjunctions that render these suburbs feral.</p>
<p>Land development is a case in point, where old models of the company town are reprised in the form of new public–private partnerships and co-governance by collaborating levels of government. This is much more complex than ‘from company town to corporate town’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877911433743">Dorow and Dogu, 2011</xref>). Different jurisdictions and scales of government, as well as private sector partners, are yoked together around the project of the locality (a very condensed form of new regionalism; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367877911433743">Paasi, 2009</xref>). Much of the frustration of local builders is in the meddling of the Province or the arrival of national scaled development firms as the first movers of development in the form of development zones and plans. Main developers service large tracts of land, sometimes on behalf of the Municipality (RWMB), installing sewers, electrical service, main roadways and new interchanges with arterial roads. In recent cases, the provincial government has become more involved, not only as a facilitator but also a developer by taking the role of guarantor and partner to land developers who ready the area for development. Further down the development feeding chain, builders buy zoned, serviced tracts to construct homes, apartments and retail strip malls. The resulting landscape in completed developments such as ‘Eagle Ridge’ or in new land parcels such as ‘Parson’s Creek’ is not only suburban but a branded space with particular design mannerisms (e.g. fake tudor posts and beams, plasterboard simulations of more massive elements of historical styles), colour schemes and so on, which become a shorthand for the normative zoning of particular types of occupancy and thus of family units.</p>
<p>Each parcel is developed independently of other areas, resulting in a series of relatively disconnected ‘pods’ on the plain above the river valley site of the original settlement (Waterways) and the downtown where administrative services are still mostly centred.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1367877911433743">9</xref></sup> While some apartment buildings were built in the first boom of the late 1970s, single-family homes ‘in suburbia’ are the preferred model, with densification happening through the private development of basement suites for let to individual temporary workers provided with a ‘living out allowance’, rather than work-camp accommodation. This is often a grey market of private rental arrangements, contributing to the difficult-to-count ‘shadow population’ of the town.</p>
<p>It is incorrect to treat this as simply a transition from natural space to abstract space as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367877911433743">Lefebvre (1974)</xref> suggests. An actually materialist approach cannot account for the complexity of alternative modernities, settler societies, postcolonial topologies or the existence of cultural and ethnic bases for conflicting spatializations. In the sites of resource extraction, nature is reduced to a form of non-human bare life (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367877911433743">Agamben, 1998</xref>). This crude resource status, emphasizing the raw caloric capacity of hydrocarbons, could be called ‘<italic>bare nature</italic>’. Reduced to its energy capacity the supplementarity of values in the landscape – nature as beauty, for example, or as a complex ecosystem, including other forms of animate life – is repressed. This form of natural bare life can be consumed without responsibility for the collateral damage to these repressed aspects of the ecosystem. ‘Place’ may literally be consumed by being dug up and strip mined in resource extraction – a disruption for decades of flora, fauna and any habitation before meaningful remediation and renewal of the local biosphere is possible. In this manner, denial of any relation to the non-human is spatialized onto the re-organization of land as property. This is true despite the increasing human and social dependency on resources extracted in the most crude manner. This exclusion deprives bare nature of participation in semiotic systems which give meaning except as a point of contrast to the spaces of everyday life. The landscape without meaning or semiotic form is technically monstrous. In stark contrast to this suburban mindset is the detailed knowledge of geological strata, of flora and fauna, the sense of natural cycles and long-term geological time that laid down the bitumen resources which characterizes interviews with elderly long-term residents.</p>
<p>Unique to Fort McMurray is the sense of boundless wilderness mixed with the constrained development space due to the parsimonious land release process and compressed sense of development time. Our respondents, especially planners and those in the development industry, refer to ‘Fort McMurray Years’ with a 1:4 ratio compared to a metropolitan North American extent and pace of development. Because more is built in a short time, this is a place where a lifetime of experience can be gained in short order. This leads to fewer planning stages and the risk of less consultation.</p>
<p>Rushed urbanization leads to awkward juxtapositions, incomplete retail infrastructure and a lag in the provision of amenities – these are feral, not quite comfortable, undomesticated suburbs where the pace of life and the fractured, multiplying household formations seems at odds with expectations of domesticity and social reproduction. Fort McMurray’s hurried time-space is thus doubly compressed and constrained even if its rhythms are cyclical – ordered by times of premium demand for oil at the peaks of economic cycles when synthetic crude of the type extracted from the shale deposits of the Athabasca basin is most economically viable. Respondents commented to the effect that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>you’re gonna get to do anything you can imagine in planning. I mean you’re gonna be involved in quick like I would estimate that three years experience in Fort McMurray would be the equivalent of … maybe even 15 years in a place like Toronto … you’d have a file that you’d baby along for four years.… Here it’s gonna happen fast and you juggle piles of things. Everything will be different and it’s unique. (Municipal planner)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On a diurnal basis, the cycle of work shifts dominates family life, as do traffic jams and traffic circulation, with corporations building their own overpasses costing hundreds of millions of dollars to ease congestion at entrances to their mine sites north of town. Shift work for both parents permeates family time, resulting in patterns of <italic>shift parenting</italic> with attendant sociopathologies reported in interviews, such as unsupervised teens left with money to fend for themselves. Respondents reported a sense of meaninglessness attached to non-work time. Adolescents, in particular, criticized the community for warehousing youth until they were of legal working age at which time many would quit school for apprenticeships and quick money. As one respondent put it in reaction to international political and ecological criticism:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>if I had to put my finger on it, you have an environment where … [the] eyes of the world are focused on this region good and bad. Some people think we are the economic generator and some people think we’re the next … we are Mordor … was it? (Residential builder)</p>

<title>Cultural topologies of social reproduction</title>
<p>Tensions are managed in this spatialization through a concerted effort to separate domestic space from the production environment of the oil sands without integrating or conceding to the surrounding boreal forest. Yet these suburbs are sites of exchange between more than the built and the boreal, the domestic and Other. They are switching points that embody the full richness of contemporary neoliberal petro-economies and render the urban developments of this economy ‘habitable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367877911433743">Roderick, 1998</xref>). They are hinges where uncomfortable forces held at arm’s length under the rubric of ‘the global’ crash into the local and into the intimacies of family and community life (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367877911433743">Shields, 1992</xref>). This represents a specific cultural topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367877911433743">Shields, forthcoming</xref>), a landscape of circulations in which lives are lived on multiple scales, twisted in knots between several spaces, running at both the global speed of information and the local time of shift-changes and the crawling pace of the doughnut store drive-through on the way to work. Feral suburbs knot together these different flows that are also an encounter between petrochemical resource extraction, contemporary urbanism and the boreal forest. Suburbia could then be described as a <italic>diagram</italic> of the tensions that are set up in everyday life. Residents draw on resources from radically different contexts and scales to weave for themselves a novel synthesis that, in turn, impacts on the actualization of cultural forms including ‘community’, public spheres and the modes by which they are represented and critiqued or consolidated.</p>
<p>Cultural topologies are spatially characterized frames of reference that include not only land and construction but also a set of public spheres, collective engagements and mythic imaginaries that unfold their own temporalities and spatialities at a socially meaningful level of action. Fort McMurray’s suburbs as topological sites manifest the intersection of different spatializations in such qualities as strikingly different attachments to place, investments in neighbourliness, and in the ‘coinage’ of community as a rhetoric of political actors and neoliberal corporate policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367877911433743">Creed, 2006</xref>). The scholarship that discerns ‘suburbia’ within the suburban or peri-urban is already engaged in a cultural topology. By breaking the representational limits of the Cartesian and Euclidean universe – by accommodating the feral – the differential geometries and time-spaces of topology allow cultural studies the opportunity to conceive and analyse the intersection of distinct but compossible spatializations in a single event and place such as Fort McMurray (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367877911433743">Shields, forthcoming</xref>). If they are something to wonder at, they are nonetheless only the latest instalments in a mode of frontier boom-and-bust development which stretches back over 100 years in Canada to the Klondike Gold Rush. Feral, ‘strange things’ are still being done in the ‘land of the midnight sun’.</p>
