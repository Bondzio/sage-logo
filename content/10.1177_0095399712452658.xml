<label>Editor’s Note:</label>
<p>This issue features a contribution from Professor Ali Farazmand. He takes on the daunting task of outlining what he sees as the future of public administration not just in the U.S. but globally as well. While there are positive things that he sees for its future, there are others that are disturbing to say the least, and with which some of will surely wish to dispute or support. Your responses could be enlightening. What do you take issue with? What do you see as the future of the field?</p>

<abstract>
<p>This article addresses the future of public administration as a self-conscious enterprise as well as a field of practice. It discusses four major challenges facing public administration: predatory globalization, institutional failure, poverty of the field, and success of the field, with technology as a fifth challenge, which is not discussed due to space limitation. The article also argues that, ironically, it is these same challenges that can also serve as forces shaping the future of public administration as a theory and practice. A conclusion outlines models suggested by other scholars, and offers new perspectives in favor of the argument advanced here.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Public administration has a history of more than eight millennia of practice and intellectual development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399712452658">Cameron, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095399712452658">Edwards, Gadd, &amp; Hammond, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399712452658">Eisenstadt, 1963</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399712452658">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0095399712452658">Olmstead, 1948</xref>). Although the field has gone through many changes and transformations throughout its history, public administration has never been as sorely challenged as it has during the last 30 years. The changes and transformations in the character, behavior, and outlook of the field have been so profound that scholars need to address a fundamental question: “What is the future of public administration?” This question is not easy to answer, because different perspectives offer different projections, but this itself may be a positive and promising aspect of academic public scholarship. A deeper and more systematic look at the field’s past, current status, and prospects may provide insights into its future: one positive and optimistic, another negative and pessimistic, and the third a perhaps more realistic blend of both.</p>
<p>Whatever the perspective, several dimensions of the field warrant attention and concern as well as providing some bases for hope:</p>
<list id="list1-0095399712452658" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>the legal and constitutional (implementing laws, legislation, and protecting the constitutional foundation of a nation through civilian and military institutions and actions),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>organizational and managerial (organizing and managing government institutions, their governing subsidiaries, private contractors, and all the details and dynamic features of public organization and management),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>political (domestic political maneuvers and international diplomacy in managing the international relations of a nation), and finally,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the intergovernmental as well as international and global dimensions of cooperation in administering and governance in a rapidly globalizing world involving many different challenges and actors.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>All these dimensions of public administration will extend the viability of the field both as practice and a focus for research and study well into the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, it is a future that, although promising, is also alarming, because it raises the prospect that the future challenges facing the field are the dialectical opposites of the more immediate challenges or problems currently confronting us that must first be met, but for which answers are not readily apparent or available. This article argues that the future of public administration and its effect on markets, governance systems, and people worldwide will be more than ever global in character. Five fundamental challenges are facing public administration that together will shape its future identity:</p>
<list id="list2-0095399712452658" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>first, the globalization of predatory corporate capitalism;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>second, the failing institutions of governments and market capitalism;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>third, the current poverty of public administration as an intellectual enterprise;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>fourth, the success of the field itself; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>fifth, the double edged sword of technology, which is beyond the scope of this article.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although not explored extensively in this article, it is important to acknowledge that technology is both enabler and destroyer, a tool both of opportunity and repression, freedom and tyranny, democracy and despotism, and progress and degeneration. As a tool, technological advancement affects all other forms of challenges noted above. For example, body scanning technologies are used these days to enhance airport security administration with efficiency, but they also violate privacy and human freedom. Thus, ironically, and interestingly, it is these same challenges that also serve as sources of strength in helping to revitalize public administration as a field (not a typical discipline) of study and practice.</p>

<title>Challenges Facing Public Administration</title>
<p>Challenges facing public administration are many, but the following four are considered fundamental because of their profound influence on the field, hence the focus of attention and analysis in this article. As noted above, space limitation prevents discussion of the fifth challenge that is fundamental to the future of the field as a “self-conscious enterprise,” to borrow Dwight Waldo’s term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0095399712452658">1982/1992</xref>).</p>

<title>Predatory Globalization of Capitalism</title>
<p>Globalization means different things to different people with different interests; it is an elephantine challenge of the 21st century. There are, however, three perspectives on the subject: those in favor and support of globalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399712452658">Friedman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399712452658">Fukuyama, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0095399712452658">Mueller, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0095399712452658">Ohmae, 1990</xref>), those totally opposed to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399712452658">Brecher &amp; Costello, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095399712452658">Cox, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399712452658">Ellner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399712452658">Foster, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0095399712452658">Kobrin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399712452658">Korten, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399712452658">Mander &amp; Goldsmith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0095399712452658">Mele, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0095399712452658">Petras &amp; Veltmeyer, 2001</xref>), and those with views in the middle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399712452658">Boyer &amp; Drache, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399712452658">Hirst &amp; Thompson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095399712452658">Krasner, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399712452658">Mann, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0095399712452658">Scholte, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0095399712452658">Skocpol, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0095399712452658">Stiglitz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0095399712452658">Zysman, 1996</xref>), which include the more realistic arguments—supported in this article—for the inevitability of globalization as a historical development of capitalism and a natural process of change within continuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399712452658">Farazmand, 1999</xref>). Globalization is viewed, in the latter perspective, as “a process through which worldwide integration is taking place” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399712452658">Farazmand, 1999</xref>, p. 509) in contrast with the first perspective that predicted the “end of the world and of the last man” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399712452658">Fukuyama, 1992</xref>), the “irrelevance of the state” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399712452658">Friedman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399712452658">Fukuyama, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0095399712452658">Ohmae, 1990</xref>), and the “end of public administration” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0095399712452658">Stever, 1988</xref>) as a result of the collapse of the former Soviet Union, as a consequence of globalization, corporatization, commercialization, and privatization, all of which would make “states irrelevant.”</p>
<p>The second perspective argued for total rejection of globalization of corporate capitalism because it is detrimental to state sovereignty, democracy, and public interest and because it simply eliminates “public spheres” contributes to mass poverty, widens the rich–poor gaps, and leads to wider global division into the powerful and powerless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399712452658">Agnew, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095399712452658">Chilcote, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399712452658">Hancock, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399712452658">Mander &amp; Goldsmith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0095399712452658">Mele, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0095399712452658">Parenti, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the third perspective argues that globalization of capitalism does not end the state and public administration; rather the state and public administration survive and indeed are stronger yet subservient to corporate power elite. That is, the state and public administration are here to stay, but their character and behavior are changed and transformed from an administrative welfare state to a coercive corporatist welfare state, from an administration of public “affairs” to an administration of the “public,” from a public administration state to a security-military and social control or domination state tasked to promote the globalizing corporate capitalism now in its advanced stage of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399712452658">Farazmand, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0095399712452658">Williams, 2007</xref>). Hence, globalization is seen as a natural phenomenon of capitalist development in the process of continuity with changes toward what is now considered “predatory globalization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399712452658">Falk, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399712452658">Galbraith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0095399712452658">Scholte, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The concept of predatory globalization derives from the extreme nature and behavior of global and globalizing corporations in search of an absolute rate of profit (or absolute rate of “surplus value,” in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0095399712452658">Karl Marx’s [1967]</xref> term) by all means, including accessing cheap labor, deregulating markets and environmental protections to access more and cheaper resources, and lessening or eliminating state interference. The aim is to develop as free a hand as possible in worldwide operations, as well as the ability to engage in hostile takeovers of competing corporations at home or overseas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399712452658">Falk, 1999</xref>). The term also derives its name from “predatory capitalism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399712452658">Galbraith, 2006</xref>), “supercapitalism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0095399712452658">Reich, 2007</xref>), and hypercapitalism that affect billions of people worldwide.</p>
<p>The concept asserts that transworld corporations recognize no boundaries, no “rules of the game” other than their own, and no laws of prohibition at home and abroad—They are only after the absolute rate of profit overnight and by all means, including removing or changing unfriendly governments around the world, no matter how democratic they may be. The latter has to be done, of course, through use of their “home state’s” military power in covert and/or overt actions, for example, <italic>coup d’tats</italic>, military invasions under the pretexts of maintaining security and protecting political, security, economic, and other “national” interests. It seems not unreasonable to label states engaging in such global actions as predatory, hence to speak of the political economy of predatory globalization, that is, corporations, sometimes in concert with their “home states” that prey on weaker market organizations and economies of unfriendly or resisting states. Like the earlier colonial powers, they attempt to take over and dominate weaker nations by both peaceful and violent means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399712452658">Falk, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0095399712452658">Smith, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>To globalization critics, these and other regional and global military adventures and “peaceful maneuvers” have been strategic designs to establish a global “empire,” a “global oligarchy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399712452658">Berberolgu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399712452658">Kelly, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0095399712452658">Petras &amp; Veltmeyer, 2001</xref>), and a “new imagined world order” that “has failed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0095399712452658">Williams, 2007</xref>). However, those with global designs continue to push for global hegemony as a new “empire” albeit one with massively contradictory outcomes and consequences that dialectically oppose each other. They would enforce, critics argue, a free-market ideology through the force of a globally “domineering state” while stifling and suppressing universal “human rights” by imposing widespread “humiliation” on weaker states and peoples worldwide—forcing them to accept new conditions they do not want and resist. Critics of globalization claim that it will be the result of these continuous struggles “within the West,” not the “war on terror” or “clash of civilizations,” for global domination will produce more devastating wars by the mid-21st century—conflicts and wars that will shape the rest of the new century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0095399712452658">Smith, 2006</xref>, p. 1).</p>
<p>Corporate globalization has also produced major impacts on corporations’ home countries of the United States, Western Europe, and Japan. It has relentlessly pursued a deregulated market and economic environment in which corporations and business organizations could be freely raided in pursuit of “absolute rate of profit,” instead of engaging in “productive” and competitive enterprise with “relative rate of profits” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399712452658">Galbraith, 2006</xref>). Will there be negative consequences? Critics say there will be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399712452658">Korten, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0095399712452658">Scholte, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0095399712452658">Smith, 2006</xref>). The globalizers have been many (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0095399712452658">Williams, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0095399712452658">Woods, 2006</xref>), but the intellectual godfathers promoting large-scale corporate globalization have been the neoclassical and neoconservative economic theorists of public choice or rational choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095399712452658">Buchanan &amp; Tullock, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0095399712452658">Mueller, 1989</xref>) and of the “transaction cost theory” of organization and economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0095399712452658">Williamson, 1985</xref>); the latter provided the economic justification for the idea of “big is beautiful” as long as it is efficient and offers higher rates of profit.</p>
<p>The views of the earlier 1930s precursor of the neoconservatives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399712452658">Coase (1937)</xref> had been overshadowed by Keynesian state-interventionist economic theory, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0095399712452658">Williamson (1985)</xref> solved the big dilemma of the public choice theorists who have been arguing for decentralization, overlapping jurisdictions, and the idea that “small is beautiful” but unable to explain or justify the largesse of giant global corporations and their operations worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399712452658">Niskanen, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0095399712452658">Ostrom, 1974</xref>). Both prescribed a big push toward sweeping privatization of public administration–government organizations and their functions, public enterprises, and everything considered “government.” However, faced with the recent global crisis of corporate capitalism as a result of the Wall Street meltdown in 2008, Williamson and the apparently “reformed” public choice advocate Eleanor Ostrom prescribed a moderate regime of market regulation to save it from “self-destruction,” a position supported not only by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0095399712452658">Marx (1967)</xref> but also by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0095399712452658">Wallerstein (1974)</xref>. Subsequently, Williamson and Ostrom were rewarded by a Nobel Prize Award in 2009. This would seem to affirm a basic principle in systems theory: Systems reward promoters and punish challengers and those threatening their stability.</p>
<p>Sweeping privatization was announced as public policy by Ronald Reagan in the United States, and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom, and they both pursued such a policy globally by requiring “structural adjustment reforms” of developing nations under their political and military or economic control or influence. Market-oriented reforms were required as conditions for international aid—no reforms, no aid. Conditional aid became an instrument of foreign policy, an “operant conditioning” power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399712452658">Amsden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399712452658">Goulet &amp; Hudson, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0095399712452658">Stiglitz, 2003</xref>), or as some critics put it “aid as a tool of neo-colonialism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0095399712452658">Sallnow, 1990</xref>). Reagan and Thatcher declared “government as a problem, not a solution,” and privatization was their official solution to national and international economic problems. The “enforcement” of such policy was pursued through powerful global governing institutions such as the World Bank (WB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global corporations themselves, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and governments as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0095399712452658">Woods, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The result has been a profound transformation of the public sector around the world through private corporatization, commercialization, and marketization, reducing the role of the state to an “instrument of power” providing security for corporations in pursuit of “global hegemony” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399712452658">Agnew, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399712452658">Hancock, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0095399712452658">Wallerstein, 2003</xref>) that has produced homogeneity versus diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399712452658">Frieden, 2006</xref>). Within the public administration community, many scholars also contributed to the ideological transformation of the public sector and to the use of state power in advancing predatory globalization so deadly to the core values of public administration as a noble enterprise. A few scholars have resisted or spoken out against the trend, whereas others enjoyed the lucrative consulting opportunities funded by corporate globalizers, for example, IMF, USAID, WB, and WTO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0095399712452658">Woods, 2006</xref>). Everywhere in the world, the powerful influence of the American corporate and state powers is witnessed, and, indeed to many globalization observers, the term has largely meant “Americanization” of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399712452658">Hoffman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0095399712452658">Mann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0095399712452658">Wallerstein, 2003</xref>). As Stanley Hoffman notes,
<disp-quote><p>The benefits of globalization are undeniable. But . . . it is largely an American creation, rooted in the period after World War II and based on U.S. economic might. Globalization’s reach remains limited because it excludes many poor countries, and the states that it does transform react in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399712452658">Hoffman, 2006</xref>, p. 13).</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Predatory capitalism was bound to burst like a bubble, and it did so with the 2008 Wall Street crash. It was based on shallow intellectual grounds, and its operation was on thin and shaky foundations. The consequences were massive for billions of people worldwide. The crash engulfed the entire world economy in a deep economic crisis, which has required massive bailouts by nations everywhere. In the end, it was the “state,” not the market, that once again had to save capitalism and global corporations, for the two are entwined and codependent; hence, the instrumentality of the state and administration ironically coexists with the “Myth of the Powerless State” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0095399712452658">Weiss, 1997</xref>), the latter myth being reinforced worldwide since September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0095399712452658">Max Weber (1968)</xref> asserted, bureaucracy and capitalism go hand in hand, and bureaucratic administration is a powerful instrument favoring the ruling elites—bureaucratization enhances the more “a crypto-plutocratic distribution of power” (p. 989), dividing society into those controlling the bureaucratic administration and those controlled by it. Moreover, bureaucratic instrumentality of public administration exhibits two forms of “rationality”—one reflecting production, distribution, and provision of public goods and services, and the other the logic of “domination” and social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399712452658">Antonio, 1979</xref>, p. 897). The more efficient the bureaucratic administration, the more efficient it becomes in domination and the less efficient in service provision; hence, an imbalance and contradiction exists in its rational instrumentality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0095399712452658">Weber, 1947</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0095399712452658">1968</xref>). The bureaucratic state and administration has been reduced to serving capitalism and predatory globalization for the last 30 years or so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399712452658">Berberolgu, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>How does predatory globalization challenge public administration? A proper answer is provided in other works (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399712452658">Falk, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399712452658">Farazmand, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399712452658">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399712452658">Garcia-Zamor &amp; Khator, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0095399712452658">Scholte, 2005</xref>). The short answer that must suffice for this article is that globalization of capitalism challenges public administration in many ways, but the key effects are fourfold: (a) paralyzing the state and its institutional capacities; (b) taking over the public sector via sweeping privatization and the de-legitimization of public administration; (c) shrinking the “public sphere” and degrading the state and public administration into a coercive, social control-oriented or security-military state and administration; and (d) diminishing the possibilities for “democracy and human rights” across the globe. It will take a long time and major public policy shifts to reverse these devastating trends in public administration.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a reversal of global capitalism is not likely to develop soon. As the world has witnessed, even the near collapse of corporate capitalism in the face of the severe global financial crisis of 2008-2009 did not trigger any major policy shifts; instead, the globalizing corporate elites used the “state power” to rescue capitalism and renew corporate hegemony through massive multitrillion dollar bailouts worldwide. Average people all over the world have been shouldering the burden of corporate rescue plans, while largely being left to fend for themselves. Once again, as in the Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II, the “state” ultimately served the powerful private elites by rescuing the corporate capitalist system. However, it can at least be said of that era, that it led to a significant expansion of social programs, public works, and the further professionalization of public service, although these have been eroded, neglected, and not significantly advanced in recent decades.</p>
<p>The massive bailout of the U.S. financial sector that began in 2007 has produced little hope and few positive results or help for the average person. Hence the continuity of systemic inequalities, the domination of the many poor by the few super rich, many of whom would no doubt endorse, though perhaps not publicly, the infamous remarks of the Pliny of ancient Imperial Rome, who said “Nothing is more unfair than equality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399712452658">Brunt, 1971</xref>, p. 155) or Seneca who observed “how great a majority are the poor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0095399712452658">MacMullen, 1974</xref>, p. 87), and still other wealthy Romans who believed that “the poor deserve to be held in contempt because they have no money” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0095399712452658">MacMullen, 1966</xref>; 1974, p. 116; also cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399712452658">Antonio, 1979</xref>, p. 900).</p>
<p>Such attitudes no doubt continue to exist among elites of many countries and the mass poor are viewed as a burden because they require efficient domination and social control by the few, a serious problem facing institutions of public administration that are expected to maintain the secure positions of elites while somehow serving the larger society and maintaining a belief that they are serving the society as a whole.</p>
<p>Although the first three fundamental challenges to public administration are somehow self-explanatory, the fourth challenge—the threat to democracy and human rights—may need some elaboration. As one critic observes,
<disp-quote>
<p>In the 1980s capitalism triumphed over communism. In the 1990s it triumphed over democracy and the market economy. For those of us who grew up believing that capitalism is the foundation of democracy and market freedom, it has been a rude awakening to realize that under capitalism, democracy is for sale to the highest bidder and the market is centrally planned by global-mega corporations larger than most nation-states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399712452658">Korten, 1995</xref>, p. 1).</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Even Peter Drucker, a leading proponent of corporate capitalism not too long ago admitted, “We are learning very fast that the belief that the free market is all it takes to have a functioning economy—is pure delusion” (Drucker, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399712452658">Korten, 1995</xref>, p. 151). Equating capitalism with democracy is misleading and dangerous: misleading, because it gives a wrong impression that democracy is promoted by capitalism and free-market enterprise, whereas in reality by looking around the world, one can easily see and experience that the bottom line for market capitalism is always “profit,” and “absolute profit” at almost any cost, including the erosion of the democratic rights of people. Corporations in search of absolute profit are able to manipulate, coerce, and even topple democratic governments to serve their self-interest of profit accumulation and market expansion. Germany under Hitler was a capitalist system, so was Chile under General Pinochet, or Iran under the Shah—All three were under dictatorial regimes, brutally repressive and an affront to humanity and democratic rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0095399712452658">Morgan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0095399712452658">Perrow, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0095399712452658">Roosevelt, 1979</xref>). As a critic observes, history has shown that “economic and national interests” have always pushed democracy and human rights to the back seat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0095399712452658">Murphy, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, equating democracy with capitalism is also dangerous, because it gives a false hope to many oppressed peoples living under dictatorships, who may think rising up against such regimes would possibly lead to democracy and improved human rights. The Kurds and Shi’a population in Iraq under Saddam Hussein learned this brutal lesson after the Western powers—the United States and key European states—left Saddam in power after the Persian Gulf War of 1991 and he murdered masses of Iraqi people with chemical weapons.</p>
<p>Thus, predatory globalization and predatory capitalism pose dangerous—even deadly—threats to democracy, human rights, the state, and to public administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399712452658">Galbraith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399712452658">Korten, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0095399712452658">Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0095399712452658">Stiglitz, 2003</xref>). Yet, as the critics assert, it is the “state” that has once again come to rescue global capitalism from the economic crisis that is actually the inevitable result of its own “self-inflicted apocalypse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399712452658">Berberolgu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0095399712452658">Parenti, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Institutional Failures</title>
<p>One key result of the hegemonic globalization and of sweeping privatization has been a near total failure of public institutions–government and semigovernment, and semipublic institutions that provide public services and serve broad-based public interests. Such failures have plunged the vast majority of world populations into a race to the bottom, widened poverty gaps, driving millions if not billions into desperate activities to feed themselves, whereas the few super rich have prospered even more from the globalization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399712452658">Brecher &amp; Costello, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399712452658">Korten, 2001</xref>). Today, even millions of people in the affluent nations of the North (North America, Canada, Europe) as well as Japan, Australia, and New Zealand have joined the plight of the poor people in the developing or less developed nations of the South Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Massive unemployment, crippled economies, increased poverty, huge national debt, rising prices of goods and services, shrinking opportunities, increasing social and political control mechanisms, and militarization and securitization of the world have plunged more people into a frightened and insecure mass, many of them becoming virtually slave labor for exploitation purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399712452658">Bowe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0095399712452658">Scholte, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Institutional failures have taken several forms. Governments and market institutions can be said to have failed millions of people by not providing them with the necessities of life that are also the fundamental requirements for the market and democratic government: decent living conditions, employment, health care, and education. Despite many promises, explicit and implicit, governments and market institutions have failed to end poverty, reduce the number of people living on less than US$1 a day, eradicate preventable diseases, prevent deforestation and global warming, provide drinking water to more than a billion of the world’s population in need of such basic necessities, and to eliminate wars, conflicts, and discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, race, and color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0095399712452658">Scholte, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0095399712452658">United Nations [UN], 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The ideological proponents of corporate globalization have been promising a new world order—after the collapse of the former Soviet Union—claiming that market institutions would manage the world without any problem and advising governments to turn over to corporations everything governments have been doing (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399712452658">Friedman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0095399712452658">Lindblom, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0095399712452658">Ohmae, 1990</xref>). However, the 2008 global crash of corporate capitalism once again demonstrated how badly market institutions fail—and proved the proponents’ optimistic claims as nothing but a “myth.” Even Friedman and Drucker admitted this to be the case.</p>
<p>Another form of institutional failure has manifested itself in the paralysis of the institutional capacity of the public service and administration brought on by massive downsizing and fear-induced insecurity among public servants in government and semigovernment institutions. In part, the dogma of market supremacy has been propagated through the New Public Management (NPM). NPM has become a powerful intellectual means of socializing citizens, students, scholars, teachers, and administrators in a doctrinal culture that is essentially based on the concept of market supremacy. Many public administration scholars embraced NPM and promoted—intentionally and unintentionally—its corporate-driven tenets and ideology here in the United States and around the world. Very few scholars have dared to criticize or resist NPM despite its corrosive effects on public service and administration’s intellectual and institutional capacities. When an institution is paralyzed by its collapsed capacities, slashed budgets, and loss of competent human capital, it becomes subject to performance failure and subject to criticism from all fronts and vulnerable to proponents of privatization.</p>
<p>Failures in government and market institutions have resulted in the loss of citizen “trust” in both, erosion of institutional ability to perform across both sectors, and to a decline of legitimacy for governments and market capitalism across the world. This trend has been going on since the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399712452658">Denhardt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399712452658">Heclo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0095399712452658">Lipset, 1987</xref>) and indeed has been accelerated and aggravated by corporate globalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399712452658">Falk, 1999</xref>). It has become a serious challenge to public administration institutionally and intellectually: institutionally, because the field’s institutional capacities have been damaged and paralyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0095399712452658">Thompson, 2006</xref>), and intellectually, because its theoretical foundations have been trashed and its legitimacy seriously questioned, leading it to a crisis of identity of the first order, and pushing it to an orphan position in business schools.</p>

<title>The Poverty of Public Administration</title>
<p>The vitality and lifeblood of any field of inquiry and practice is generally found in the richness of its disciplinary or intellectual foundations, its evolving and defining identity as an intellectual field of research and teaching, but public administration is more than these two things—more than a traditional academic discipline. It also supports and nurtures a profession and practicing professionals, which is the other aspect of its fragile but enduring legitimacy throughout its history as a self-conscious enterprise. Historically public administration is among the oldest professions in the world—and a noble one. Indeed, public administration is as old as human civilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0095399712452658">Waldo, 1982/1992</xref>), dating back to at least 8,000 years beginning in the city of Shush in early Iran and Mesopotamia—where large-scale public service organizations flourished and spread elsewhere into the entire Middle East and North Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399712452658">Cameron, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095399712452658">Edwards et al., 1971</xref>). Public administration comprised state-paid employees and workers, volunteers, and obligatory service laborers, that is, slaves.</p>
<p>In fact, Western political philosophy, including its philosophy of governance, has been strongly influenced by ancient Greece, whereas the administrative principles and traditions in the United States and Europe have been most influenced by the Roman system of administration, with its many military characteristics—that is, strong centralization, authoritarian character, command and control orientation, universalization of Roman way of thinking and practice, instrumental rationality, effectiveness of political and economic control, and efficient domination of the periphery as well as the core of the Empire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399712452658">Antonio, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399712452658">Homo, 1929</xref>). There was no escape from the Romanization of life, and its administrative system was highly “bureaucratized and efficient in domination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399712452658">Antonio, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0095399712452658">Rostovtzeff, 1926</xref>, p. 460), and the “military played a central role” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399712452658">Antonio, 1979</xref>, p. 901), with a “routinization of the military discipline” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399712452658">Gibbon, 1932</xref>, pp. 10-17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0095399712452658">Weber, 1968</xref>, pp. 1155-1156), which overpowered persons, societies, and resources. Thus, the Romans provided the basic ideas behind those aspects of governance that became public administration in the modern world, and it has been the U.S. that has led in elaborating upon those ideas and has played a major role in extending them to many parts of the world since WWII.</p>
<p>Public administration has also witnessed remarkable development and growth in scholarship and research into various aspects of practice and theory during the last 100 years, and much of it due to massive American contributions. Major progress has been made in both theory building and empirical testing of its numerous aspects. The number of scholarly journals publishing public administration research has also spiraled upward as has the number of articles and books published in journals worldwide. The field also achieved considerable breadth and continuity as a result of national and international conferences that disseminated new ideas to scholars and practitioners around the globe. As a result, scholars seem increasingly content with public administration and find satisfaction in its multidisciplinary nature as a basis for their identity.</p>
<p>Whether public administration can or should be a traditional academic discipline or remain an interdisciplinary field of study and practice, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0095399712452658">Dwight Waldo (1982/1992)</xref> called its “identity crisis,” has never been fully resolved. As a result, it has not yet gained or enjoyed a real sense of security and identity as a self-conscious academic enterprise. This problem has often led to its being downgraded institutionally and moved into departments of political science or schools of business, planning, and even architecture.</p>
<p>This identity crisis of public administration and the complexity that surrounds its definition and operationalization will not soon disappear. Clearly, it is not a typical academic discipline, but rather a multidisciplinary field of study and practice like law, medicine, or social work. These features may be viewed as positive features of strength, but despite its many achievements and its dedication to public service and interest, it still suffers and will continue to suffer from a deficit of status and respect within and outside the university, some of which derives from the negative attitude toward government, which is generated by a capitalist political economy.</p>
<p>Although it may lack a clear “philosophy” or the status of established academic disciplines, as noted earlier, public administration has a rich history that stretches back over eight millennia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399712452658">Argyle, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399712452658">Argyriades, 2001a</xref>) and has been reinforced in modern times by “British traditions of civil service system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0095399712452658">Van Riper, 1997</xref>). Yet, this “rich essence” is not given the attention it deserves and is often lost in the avalanches of antigovernment political hyperbole and ideological slogans based on self-interest. Market-based ideologies often assert that the “public interest” is best defined by the market and that market institutions are the best providers of “public service” and promoters of the “public interests.”</p>
<p>Both the public choice and transaction-cost theories of economics and politics have always promoted this ideology in the United States but with greater fervor and effect over the last 30 years on two fronts. The first has been a growing academic literature advocating privatization of governmental functions, through the intellectual fad called the NPM. The latter is an effort to eradicate the traditional models and ideas of public administration and replace them with the ideological tenets of NPM in tune with the corporate business ideas and practices of capitalism and globalization. Despite its waning tide, it is still being pushed by corporate elites, and by some in academic circles, in an effort to socialize future generations of leaders to this market-based ideology of governance and administration. NPM has reached its high point and begun to lose its power and appeal in many parts of the world; it will likely die on the altar of its inherent contradictions. Hopefully, it is destined to be just another passing fad in the history of contemporary public administration. Many Latin American countries have abandoned or modified it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399712452658">Argyriades, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0095399712452658">Stiglitz, 2003</xref>), and local governments in some European nations like the Netherlands and Switzerland have legislated it out of their local governments because of problems of accountability and responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0095399712452658">Noordhoeck &amp; Saner, 2005</xref>). Even New Zealand reversed its use with the election of a new government in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0095399712452658">Noordhoeck &amp; Saner, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Privatization has been the most popular of the NPM’s reforms pursued for the last 30 years as a “strategic instrument of accomplishing the goals of corporate globalization of the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399712452658">Farazmand, 2002</xref>, p. 509) with the result that governments have often become the guardians of the privatized system and their role becoming that of maintaining order and social control so that business can operate without interference or interruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399712452658">Frank, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399712452658">Frieden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399712452658">Galbraith, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399712452658">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Added to the spectrum of ideas influencing extant conceptions of public administration is the “war on terrorism,” which has, among other purposes, elimination of threats to business and commerce. A new government–business partnership has been forged to build and operate a long-term strategic alliance that promotes corporate global interests and removes legal/institutional and cultural as well as political obstacles to achieving the goals of corporate globalization worldwide. Although many of the goals of globalization have been achieved, the problems of mass poverty, inequality, and ethnic and other forms of wars and conflicts have significantly increased worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399712452658">Argyriades, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0095399712452658">UN, 2007</xref>). The intimate relationship between governments and corporations that is created by corporate globalization means that governments have not been able to defend and sustain a philosophy of public service and administration, because many of their key supporters and promoters have now become beneficiaries of the corporatist system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0095399712452658">Weber, 1947</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0095399712452658">1968</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, the most fundamental problems of public administration arise from several sources that include globalization of predatory capitalism, the fiscal crisis of the state, the global crisis in capitalist systems more generally, and the role the state has been maneuvered into playing in serving hegemonic corporate systems. This has been augmented by the purported ideology of market supremacy and by the lack of any constitutional legitimacy for public service and administration as a self-defined profession or field of inquiry. The market is a powerful institution with positive functions essential to society, and it has played that role for many millennia. However, predatory capitalism is antithetical to a strong and semiautonomous public administration, and fatal to what it stands for as a noble profession, for it kills the motivation that undergirds public service and administration by objectification and subjectification. Objectification occurs when all functions of government as well as everything else in society, including people, become targeted objects for profit-seeking activities—This is the logic of capitalism’s strategy of commoditization of everything it sees in its way. Subjectification occurs when predatory corporations focus on specified areas, markets, organizations, institutions, and people for objectification and commoditization purposes. Hence, public administration becomes an obstacle to predatory global capitalism and must be removed or kept malnourished.</p>
<p>Indeed, one might go so far as to argue that the gravestone of the field has already been prepared, as the “state” has been militarized and transformed into a “penitentiary state,” and its institutions turned primarily into policing and social control-oriented instruments to maintain peace and security, provide safe space for market capitalism to maximize absolute rate of profit, and make sure the public or citizens comply with the new rules of the system. In addition, this is done through exacerbation—if not invention—of insecurity and threats to national interests—through terrorism (Islam or Communist) or other radical threats to national security. Again, this trend is similar to that in Imperial Rome’s culture of bureaucracy and administration, which was so highly “efficient in domination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399712452658">Antonio, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399712452658">Gibbon, 1932</xref>). Public administration is thus in danger of being transformed from the administration of “public affairs” to the administration of the “public” for social control. This is a huge transformation, a degrading one, which is deepening the “poverty” of the field intellectually and institutionally.</p>

<title>Success of the Field</title>
<p>The fourth source of challenges to public administration has been its own relative success and effectiveness, which has historically posed a serious threat to corporate capitalism. Historically speaking, public administration and its powerful institution of bureaucracy have been among the most enduring professions and institutions for millennia. It has provided stability and order to societies for more than 8,000 years, and perhaps earlier in ancient historical empires of Early Elam and Persia (present Iran), Egypt, Babylon, China, and Rome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399712452658">Eisenstadt, 1963</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399712452658">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0095399712452658">Olmstead, 1948</xref>), and later on in modern empires of Britain, France, Spain, and more recently in the United States and post communist Russia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399712452658">Gladden, 1972</xref>). Aside from temporary lapses, public administration and the administrative state (bureaucracy) have provided stability and order for millennia in the face of crises and turmoil, continuity in the face of disruption and regime changes or system collapses, service delivery, and maintenance in the face of system challenges and breakdowns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0095399712452658">Stillman, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>An example of modern and contemporary public administration success is its administrative performance in rescuing the economic and political system of the United States from collapse during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The various administrative agencies commissioned to combat poverty and other forms of human suffering implemented employment and reconstruction projects of massive public works programs. All this helped strengthen public administration as a field of study and practice, and increased the size of the bureaucracy, leading to the notion of the “administrative state” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0095399712452658">Waldo, 1948/1984</xref>). By the 1950s, the U.S. federal government and its administrative state constituted a formidable institution of economics and governance, a powerful competitor to the big private corporate sector, the largest property owner, and the biggest lender and employer. However, this was not acceptable to the power elites of “corporate America” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399712452658">Henry, 2002/2004</xref>), which saw the administrative state and public administration a major rival to its power structure and hence sought to break it down. It was done through the massive privatization policies in the 1950s under the Eisenhower Administration and attempted again in the Reagan and Bush Administrations. Similar policies were vigorously pursued through labor laws, environmental laws, and administrative procedure acts, which often had among their several purposes the intent to trim down the direct role of government and public administration in economy and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399712452658">Henry, 2002/2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The administrative state has done impossible things in the United States since the Great Depression. However, the success of the administrative state in the post-World War era became a major source of concern for its adversaries, who criticized it for being too big and too intrusive (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0095399712452658">Stillman, 1991</xref>, for more on this), interfering with the functions of the constitutional separation of powers and bureaucratizing the three branches of the federal government, hence standing against democratic values of election-based social actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0095399712452658">Rosenbloom, 1983</xref>). Moreover, public administration was attacked for being unelected, unrepresentative, and undemocratic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0095399712452658">Niskanen, 1971</xref>), and for becoming too powerful and a fourth branch of the American government by making as well as implementing policy decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0095399712452658">Meier &amp; Bohte, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The administrative state and bureaucracy in America, therefore, became the target of criticism by many politicians, political leaders, presidential campaigners, academic consultants, scholars, and of course corporate and media elites who wanted it dismantled and taken over by the corporate business sector. The attack on public administration and bureaucracy thus went beyond partisan differences, as conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats had a hand in “building the welfare state brick by brick during the 1960s and 1970s” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0095399712452658">Stockman, 1987</xref>). Yet, they also joined forces in dismantling it when President Ronald Reagan took office in 1981 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0095399712452658">Thayer, 1997</xref>). The political economy of modern organizations explains how important institutions like public bureaucracies serve multiple functions such as organizational control, ideological indoctrination, service delivery, social progress, economic development, and partisan and powerful “group interests” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0095399712452658">Wamsley &amp; Zald, 1973</xref>). Very often “interest group politics” determine “structural politics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0095399712452658">Moe, 1989</xref>, p. 269), and “organizational effectiveness is repeatedly sacrificed on the altar of interest group protection and representation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0095399712452658">Wise, 2002</xref>, p. 139).</p>
<p>The weakening of the “free-market” ideology and the drive toward privatization that resulted from the Wall Street meltdown in 2008 once again set off a familiar alarm. As in the Great Depression Era, the administrative state was needed to rescue the “free market” (and to prop up the Mecca of global corporations, the United States). This was not something new. Corporations have often asked the state to come to their rescue with giant bailouts. How could the political elites not respond? After all, they are the key beneficiaries of the corporate largesse that is largely made invisible by Supreme Court rulings. Thus, despite the general public’s angry complaints about the multibillion dollars of corporate CEO bonuses and the huge initial US$750 billion bailout given corporations, no serious legislative measure was taken by the lawmakers to stop or curb these big corporate bonuses, and business as usual continued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0095399712452658">Wedel, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The administrative state has once again been called on to perform its instrumental duties—to save and serve the globalizing corporate power structure, which in turn claims ideologically that “saving us means saving America!” Hence, the continuity of the administrative state and public administration as a profession and field of study has been sustained, but this time with less funding and a blurring of identity. It has also become more instrumental to corporate globalization and more functional to capitalism as an instrumentality of social and political control via its security and policing functions. This has been done in partnership with private mercenary armies of global corporations like the notorious Blackwater Corporation and others that operate alongside the regular military forces to militarize the world under different pretexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0095399712452658">Scahill, 2008</xref>). It seems that public administration is implementing what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399712452658">Samuel Huntington (1996)</xref> prescribed in “the clash of civilizations” through which the West is expected to take over the entire world either by violent or peaceful means.</p>

<title>The Future of Public Administration?</title>
<p>As indicated in the beginning of this article, the same forces that pose serious challenges to public administration also, ironically, offer hope and opportunities to the survival, revival, and development of the field in the future. Several possibilities are in the picture.</p>
<list id="list3-0095399712452658" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1. Predatory capitalism’s globalization tends to shrink the size, budget, and scope of public administration and its institutional bases, but it also needs the same institutional foundations to counter what is known in chaos and transformation theories as the “sudden collapse and bifurcation of the corporate system” due to its volatile nature of chaotic behaviors. Predatory globalization has big reservoirs of slack resources and can offset major losses due to chaotic events. However, what it cannot afford or will be unable to counter is the sudden emergence of large-scale changes turning chaotic and threatening to them, such as major riots, revolts, and revolutions. The state in general and the administrative state in particular—civilian and military—must be called to the rescue of global capitalism, institutionally and financially.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>An example of this dynamic need is the massive bailouts of corporations by states across the globe to rescue them from collapse. All these economies had to be saved from collapse or potential “bifurcation” into mixed, socialist, or other forms of market systems. Thus, public administration as a key instrument of the state is in fact once again a savior of capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399712452658">Mann, 1980</xref>). The state will also be viewed as an ideological moderator, a “facilitator” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0095399712452658">Newland, 2006</xref>), and an “instrumental state” functional to profit maximizing corporate elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399712452658">Mann, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0095399712452658">Weber, 1947</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0095399712452658">1968</xref>). The predatory aspects of globalization have not been stopped, only slowed down due in part to popular pressure and in part to its own failures and setbacks. Public administration will prevail, and in the long run might even outdo the predatory globalization, but its character and behavior unfortunately currently favor the coercive military-security and social control goals of states.</p>
<list id="list5-0095399712452658" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>2. The challenges of institutional failures in corporate and public or government sectors also provide opportunities for public administration’s revival and development in the future. So far, institutional failure of the corporate market has led to a pause in its nearly “free-handed” operations worldwide. Popular dissatisfaction and frustration with market institutional failures have resulted in calls for “regulatory regimes” to modify rules of conduct of markets, to monitor market behavior, and to hopefully curb its potential abuses and destructive behaviors. In this respect, even some of the most famous and strongest advocates of libertarian capitalism (e.g., Milton Friedman, Peter Drucker, and Allan Greenspan) recently conceded its flaws and admitted the need for a degree of market regulations. This realization has been echoed by other scholars: Economist Paul Krugman, political scientist Eleanor Ostrom, and sociologist Oliver Williamson have recently managed to win prestigious Nobel Prizes for arguing in favor of a “regulated market” economy to curb abusing corporate behavior to save itself and to help the state do its job.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Institutional failures are also found in the state administrative system, in public administration, but these are due in part to the institutional paralysis caused by sweeping privatization, massive downsizing, and outsourcing of public institutions and their personnel—a loss of social capital as well as financial capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0095399712452658">Thompson, 2006</xref>). When there is poor institutional capacity, failure is bound to happen, and public sector institutional capacities have been drastically damaged, or in some instances destroyed, by corporatization, commercialization, and downsizing. Yet, these same institutional failures are now serving as sources of strength for the revival and development of a regulatory-based administrative state. The new administrative state is expected to correct for the market failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0095399712452658">Stillman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0095399712452658">Wamsley et al., 1990</xref>), monitor the troubled spots in the market sector, signal warnings to corporate and administrative elites of the coming storms, and help serve the public and market interests—Hence, the potential still exists for development of a “regulatory administrative state and public administration” in the future. Yet, its effectiveness will be subject to the degree to which the corporatist and other powerful interest groups influence and manipulate public policy through formal and informal channels. It will only succeed if empowered politically, legitimized by popular support, and advanced by philosophy of public service doctrine.</p>
<list id="list6-0095399712452658" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>3. The poverty of public administration will similarly call for a collective effort from the public administration community—both practitioners and scholars—to explore ways to legitimize and establish the field with a well-deserved identity as a professional field of multidisciplinary inquiry and practice. It cannot and should not become a typical academic discipline, but rather it should resemble other professional fields of study and practice like law, medicine, and social work. Practitioners and scholars need to work on this endeavor, for there is no escape from this challenge. The call must be made to build a philosophy grounding for it and to advocate specific road maps, strategies, and requirements that establish rigorous standards of learning and professional conduct and hold members to values and standards that promote and sustain sound administrative and governance principles supportive of democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399712452658">Farazmand, 2004</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The current poverty and problems of the field can also be a source of its strength on which it can build, develop, and expand a philosophy of public administration. Recognizing and acknowledging problems is a first step in search for solutions to overcome the intellectual poverty of the field. Its “intellectual poverty and problems” can be a source of interest and motivation to find means, approaches, and ways to make progress toward solving the intellectual, indeed philosophical, problems of public administration. Some works have already been moving in that direction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399712452658">Bozeman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399712452658">Caiden, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0095399712452658">Stillman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0095399712452658">Waldo, 1982/1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0095399712452658">Wamsley et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0095399712452658">Wamsley &amp; Wolf, 1996</xref>), but more are needed. What the field needs is innovation and creativity combined with courage to challenge the established doctrines, and certainly NPM is not up to the task—It is in fact the reverse of what the field needs in its mission to reduce or eradicate the current poverty of the field’s study and practice. Institutionally, public administration should also be moved out of the locus of political science departments and business schools everywhere.</p>
<list id="list7-0095399712452658" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>4. Finally, the success of the field itself is a major promising source for rebuilding, redeveloping, and refounding public administration as a self-conscious enterprise (theory) and a professional practice. Records of success must be collected, examined, analyzed, and disseminated as a reservoir of knowledge, expertise, experience, and intellectual foundation for future teaching, educating, and training of practitioners and scholars dedicated to the noble profession of public service and administration as a novel field of study and practice. Public administration is as old as human civilization and its administrative organizations or institutions are traceable back over 8,000 years in early civilizations of the Near East. For that matter, public bureaucracy has survived millennia of political changes and social upheavals, provided continuity through changes, and rendered stability in service provision and order through revolts and revolutions as well as chaotic situations worldwide. Success of the field is an asset, and its failures should be seen as reason for self-evaluation, self-reflection, and self-correction.</p></list-item>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In an excellent book, <italic>Preface to Public Administration</italic> published about two decades ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0095399712452658">Richard Sillman (1991)</xref> outlined four possible future directions of public administration using a dialectical approach among “competing state visions” of schools or models of the field: (a) the “negative-state” model with “public administration more privatized, decentralized, and ‘less public’ and focused on private, nonprofit, and return to old family traditions”; (b) the “bold-state” or positive-state model with emphasis on “institution building” and capacities to manage “the issues that confront men and women who must grapple with the daily operational problems of public administration”; (c) the “pre-state” Wilson’s “middle-way” model with a focus on unique American situational characteristics of the state and society that maximize normative political and traditional values; and (d) the “pro-state model” with a focus on narrow-based specializations of the field, such as budgeting, personnel, and evaluation to justify a professionalized technocratic identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0095399712452658">Stillman, 1991</xref>, pp. 219-227). These are apt characterizations of possible future directions of the field, a very useful and inspiring approach to open doors to intellectual inquiries into the field’s future.</p>
<p>However, the realities of a rapidly globalizing world paint a far more different picture for the new millennium and demand new ways of thinking, conceptualization, and operational models that take Americans and others to a different playing field—What was once exclusively American is now shared with the rest of the world as common issues, problems, challenges, and opportunities that must be dealt with. Neither Woodrow Wilson’s “middle-way” nor the “negative-state” model is realistic or practical in today’s world of highly integrated and demanding affairs. Societies that are agrarian and “family oriented” may prefer decentralized and tradition-oriented government systems, but they also want less expensive and more plentiful choices—that is, the Walmart model of consumer accessibility to items considered essential. America has long been involved in trade, conflict, war, and human rights issues in every corner of the world. In that respect, it is similar to the Persian and Roman Empires of the ancient world and the British and Spanish empires of more recent times. Public administration is therefore a globalized enterprise, and American public administration is also a “globalizing” enterprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399712452658">Eisenstadt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399712452658">Hoffman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399712452658">Mann, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>Two powerful global trends will likely affect the character and behavior of public administration worldwide: One is the continuous attempt at Americanization of the world and expansion of American administrative models, particularly in developing countries, China, the former Soviet Union, and Eastern Europe. Like its ancient predecessors Persia and Rome, the United States fostered establishment of bureaucracies that resembled its own in the wake of World War II, not only in countries it defeated but also in those to which it extended aid and assistance, for example, the Republic of Korea. No doubt this pattern will continue, has been amplified since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, and has contributed to the rapid globalization and the dominance of American corporate power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399712452658">Hoffman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399712452658">Mann, 1980</xref>). This trend is being institutionalized and will have major effects on the future of public administration, as military, civilian, academic, political, and security advisors or consultants flood the countries under U.S. global influence. New ways of thinking—American ideologies and economic/market systems—as well as American public administration models and practices will be institutionalized globally for years to come. Many American institutions—academic universities, consulting firms, researchers, and of course the USAID—have played, and will continue to play, such a role of Americanization of the world by a variety of means. This would seem to inevitably be the case, even in China. The influx of Chinese scholars into U.S. universities would seem to make it inevitable that American ideas of administration will have an influence on organization and management in the Chinese public and emergent private sectors.</p>
<p>The second powerful global trend will likely be developed as a negative reaction to, or disillusionment with, the Americanization in many developing and some former Soviet bloc nations now under heavy influence of the United States. This trend may arise from several factors: the increasing control orientation of American interactions and aid (economic, military and security) to other countries, especially after the attack of September 11, 2001. Since that attack, the United States has shown an increasing acceptance and tolerance of control-orientations (political, economic, military, and security) on the part of nation-states with which the United States has relations, or to which it offers aid and assistance (political, economic, military, and security). Whether intended or not, increasing tolerance for heavy handedness on the part of economic, political, military-security, and corporate elites obsessed with maintaining order and stability serves to promote corporate globalization at the expense of progress toward national development and citizens’ welfare. This merging of elitist and security-military orientations with Americanized systems of administration—unless altered or mitigated—will only enrich and empower the ruling elites and the administrators that serve them while repressing the vast majority of people in those countries. Hence, the potential for public administration developed with American aid or under its tutelage becoming a means of promoting secrecy, corruption, and authoritarianism. As Weber noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0095399712452658">1968</xref>, p. 989), bureaucratic social structure is often accompanied by a “crypto-plutocratic distribution of power,” and as “instrument of domination, bureaucracy is almost always a means for realizing the interests of the ruling elites” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399712452658">Antonio, 1979</xref>, p. 897). This is an unfortunate “contradiction” to the promises and ideas of transparency, openness, citizen participation, and democracy that American models of public administration often claim and tend to promote in slogans and literature. However, unfortunately, the politics, national security concerns, and economic interests of America as a global superpower seem to be tending to dominate and supersede all other aspects of ideas. The concerns for advancing democracy are too often sacrificed at the altar of American security concerns and interests, hence reducing public administration to a purely instrumental tool of foreign policy, moreover a foreign policy heavily weighted with corporate global interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399712452658">Goulet &amp; Hudson, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095399712452658">Hamilton, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0095399712452658">Murphy, 1988</xref>). To many critics, this is “neo-colonialism or imperialism” in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399712452658">Amsden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399712452658">Foster, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399712452658">Hancock, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399712452658">Korten, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0095399712452658">Parenti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0095399712452658">Petras &amp; Veltmeyer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0095399712452658">Woods, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Consequently, a second global trend of public administration will likely emerge in reaction to, or resentment toward, Americanization of other nations’ systems of public administration. Such a negative reaction seems most likely and the attempt to search for and develop indigenous models or systems that can represent domestic needs and preserve national identity continues. This potentially negative reaction to Americanization is already shaping up worldwide, for example, in countries like Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia, Malaysia, and postrevolutionary Iran, as well as China or even Korea and Russia where the search for indigenous philosophies and models of public administration has produced some discernable results (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399712452658">Amsden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399712452658">Argyriades, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399712452658">Henderson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, of course, there is the possibility of a third global trend, a “hybrid” or mixed model of public administration based on indigenous values, traditions, and cultures supplemented—not supplanted—by American and other Western models of organization, management, rationality, bureaucracy, and public administration and governance. The latter will most likely be the ultimate winning prospect.</p>
<p>Thus, the future of public administration is and will continue to be shaped by a number of key challenges outlined in this article, and it is the same challenges—along with other forces—that can help revive and reshape the future of the field as a professional field of study and practice. The <italic>study and research of public administration</italic> can and must draw on a variety of academic disciplines to understand the practice of public administration, and <italic>the practice of public administration</italic> can and must encompass a variety of disciplines and professions as self-conscious entity of practice.</p>
<p>The future identity of public administration will, therefore, be characterized by at least five possible elements: (a) its instrumental character as a “facilitator” of the corporate globalization and competing national interests; (b) the “reluctant regulatory administrative state” armed with a growing wealth of information and technology supportive of control and regulation; (c) the increasing efforts on the part of scholars and thinkers to recognize the need and take steps to create a philosophy of “public administration” that emphasizes, in theory and practice, a healthy balance between instrumentality of control and domination on one hand, and public service/public interest, on the other; (d) the building of administrative capacities for public governance and administration in the age of rapid globalization based on such a philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399712452658">Farazmand, 2009</xref>); and (e) the rapid technological advances that affect the future of governance and public administration, a factor beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>In contrast to the way Americans wish to think of themselves and their nation, its strong influence in world affairs and its part in the globalization of capitalism seem likely to produce growing resentment and alternative, mixed, or indigenous-based models of public administration unless we work energetically to avoid this. The United States has and driven by security concerns in a post-9/11 world, tended toward an unbalanced, domination-oriented model of public administration, which is uncomfortably reminiscent of Imperial Rome. If anything is to be learned from history, this tendency must be reversed for a healthy advancement of the field in the future. Public administration will persist and mature in theory and practice, but its character and behavior will continue to change as globalization and other global forces affect nation-states in the 21st century. The road to building a discipline with a philosophy of public administration <italic>supportive of democracy as well as security</italic> is treacherous and difficult, but it can be done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0095399712452658">Wamsley et al., 1990</xref>); one has to enter it with courage, persistence, creativity, and innovation, all the while drawing on what Lincoln called the “better angels of our nature.”</p>
