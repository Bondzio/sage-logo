<p>After some opening pages on the Turkic origins of the Cossacks and on Cossack history prior to about 1650 (years for which the sources are not very good), Brian Boeck concentrates on the period between the Russo-Polish Treaty of Andrusovo (1667) and the Russo-Turkish Treaty of Niš (1739). Under the first of these, Moscow achieved a lull in its long-running conflict with Poland which gave it the chance to think about some of the other troublesome elements on its peripheries. Under the second, the Russian empire came into permanent possession of the Ottoman town of Azov at the mouth of the River Don, which enabled it to consolidate the hold that it had been establishing in that vicinity for several decades. Between the two treaties, Russian Tsars went a long way towards achieving the full incorporation of the Don Cossacks into their empire, denying them the status of freebooters and setting them on the path to what they eventually became, the most fervently patriotic of all the Russian army’s auxiliaries.</p>
<p>This transformation of the Don Cossacks is the subject of Boeck’s book. This would have been more immediately evident if the word ‘Don’ had figured in its title, for the author is not concerned with the Cossacks of the River Dnieper. A major difference between the Cossacks of the two regions was that, ethnically speaking, those on the Don became predominantly Russian in the second half of the seventeenth century. As serfdom became firmly entrenched in Muscovy, peasants fled south to escape it. At first, the Tsar had a number of reasons for not pursuing them. Free communities in the south could serve as a buffer between the lands of Muscovy and those of the Tatars and Ottomans; Cossacks on the Don (unlike those on the Dnieper) tended to prioritize Moscow when they felt the need for an external associate (offering Azov to Muscovy, for example, when they captured it from the Turks in 1637); and the lower reaches of the Don were far beyond the ‘Belgorod line’, the line of forts which the Tsar began constructing in 1635 to protect his Southern flank.</p>
<p>For a while, therefore, it looked as if Russian peasants who migrated to the Don had made the right decision. The treaties of Andrusovo and Niš, however, fell either side of the reign of Peter the Great. Famous in retrospect for his achievements in the North (the annexation of Livland and Estland, the creation of a new capital and administrative system in St Petersburg), Peter had initially set his heart on the South. The ships which so captured his imagination saw their first effective military deployment in the capture of Azov from the Turks in 1696. Unlike his grandfather, who had turned Azov down when the Cossacks offered it to him in 1637 (with the result that the Turks got it back), Peter intended to hold on to the town. Although he was not able to do so, his equally firm commitment to Russian control of Don Cossack society bore fruit. When, before the Tsar’s birth, the Don Cossack Stepan Razin ran amok on the Caspian and the Volga, Muscovy sought an end to the disquiet but waited for divisions among the Don Cossacks to bring it about. When, on the other hand, the Don Cossack Kondratii Bulavin turned to violence in 1707–8, Russia again took advantage of Cossack divisions, but this time also engaged in a pitiless harrowing of Don Cossack territory. Peter was making it clear that henceforward he would accept only the features of Don Cossack society which he found conducive to the well-being of the Russian empire as a whole. Before his time, Don Cossacks came under the section of the Muscovite administration which was responsible for foreign relations. From 1718, they came under Peter’s Military College. Thus the Tsar signalled that he welcomed the Don Cossacks’ military outlook, but not their general inclination to autonomy. The peculiarities of their society that survived his reign did so on sufferance.</p>
<p>Boeck presents and analyses these developments on the basis of a wealth of manuscript material and printed literature in many languages (including Turkish). Although the book lacks a bibliography, it benefits from footnotes. The author’s methodological framework is much more sophisticated than a brief review can convey. No reader could come away thinking that the shift in the fortunes of the Don Cossacks came about entirely because of Peter the Great’s penchant for violence and regimentation. Boeck makes clear that there were instances in which Russia colluded with leaders on the Don and instances in which Don Cossacks felt that they could benefit from greater metropolitan involvement in their affairs. Although one of the more startling features of the book is its emphasis on how far ahead of west European countries Russia was in its attachment to controlling the physical mobility of its inhabitants (a feature which militated strongly against Don Cossack society and rather supports the traditional image of the Russian steamroller), another is its emphasis on the fact that, even at the end of the story, the Don area retained some of its individuality. Thus a final merit of the book is that it whets the reader’s appetite for the work of Bruce Menning, Shane O’Rourke and Peter Holquist on the history of Don Cossacks in later periods.</p>
