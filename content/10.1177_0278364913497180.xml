<p>Singapore, Oriental Hotel</p>
<sec id="section1-0278364913497180">
<title>Objective</title>
<p>The goal of the ISRR Symposia is to bring together active leading robotics researchers from academia, government, and industry to assess and share their views and ideas about the state of the art in robotics, and to discuss promising new avenues for future research.</p>
<p>The spirit of ISRR, with its single-track format, is to encourage stimulating and dynamic discussion and debate about the future of robotics and robotics research. The symposium is the flagship of the International Foundation of Robotics Research (IFRR) and this meeting will celebrate 30 years of these extraordinary events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0278364913497180">
<title>Symposium Format</title>
<p>The Symposium will be held in an informal setting with a limited number of participants to encourage close technical and personal interactions. During the four-day Symposium, approximately 45 papers will be presented. The meeting will be organized as a single-track meeting, and contributions that cover all aspects of robotics research are solicited. Sessions and social events will provide ample opportunity for discussion. Attendance will be limited and priority is given to authors and invited participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0278364913497180">
<title>Paper Solicitation</title>
<p>We seek papers that report on new areas and discuss novel work of interest to the broader robotics community, as well as position papers that review existing work or offer critical analysis of specific robotics methodologies, or speculate and discuss new avenues in robotics research. ISRR is an open forum and researchers who are new to ISRR are particularly encouraged to submit. In addition to the open call, a number of leading researchers will be solicited to contribute by personal invitation. Members of the Symposium Program Committee will review all submissions. The quality of the papers and the related presentations are a central priority for ISRR.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0278364913497180">
<title>Submission Procedure</title>
<p>Papers must be submitted in LaTeX format according to the template for the Springer STAR series proceedings downloadable from the submission webpage at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://isrr2013.org">isrr2013.org</ext-link>.
