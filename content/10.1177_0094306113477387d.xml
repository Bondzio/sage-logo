<p>Studying twins gives researchers the ability to distinguish between genetic and environmental influences on behavior. Monozygotic, or identical, twins share 100 percent of their DNA, while dizygotic, or fraternal, twins share only half of their genes. Consequently, detection of greater similarity in myriad psychosocial outcomes in monozygotic versus dizygotic twins would indicate that said outcomes have a genetic root. As useful as twin studies are in assessing the relative contributions of genes and environment to behavioral and social outcomes, these naturally occurring experiments are not perfect. Indeed, researchers who utilize the twin study methodology rely on a crucial assumption: similarity in the social environment of identical twins does not translate into similarity in outcomes. In his book, <italic>What Can We Learn From the Study of Twins?</italic>, Jacob Felson both acknowledges the evidence that supports this equal environments assumption (EEA), while also asserting that the EEA should not be viewed as a single assumption that can be confirmed or denied. Instead, Felson argues that there should not be an EEA and that the presence of equal environments should be evaluated and controlled for as opposed to taken as a given in twin research.</p>
<p>Though the book is written for an academic audience, the language is not overly technical and can be understood by anyone vaguely familiar with the literature on twin study methodology and/or the influence that genes and environments have on human behavior. Felson organizes his book much like an empirical research article, starting with an extensive literature review before delving into research methods, analysis, and conclusions. Though the author finds that heritability estimates for behavior, or the net impact that genes have on behavioral outcomes, may be biased due to the unequivocal acceptance of the EEA, these biases are small. Further, Felson concludes that genetic similarity is a very real determinant of similarity in behavioral outcomes and that similarity in the environment may serve as a mediator to the relationship between genes and outcomes. In summation, <italic>What Can We Learn From the Study of Twins?</italic> is a must read for scholars who engage in twin research and for members of the broader academic audience who are interested in the relative contributions of both nature (genes) and nurture (the environment).</p>
