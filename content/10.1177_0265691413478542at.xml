<p>Wendy Ugolini’s research explores the complex and varied experiences of the Italian Scottish population during the Second World War. <italic>Experiencing War as the ‘Enemy Other’</italic> draws on dozens of interviews, and examines defining moments of Italian resisters and collaborators, as well as how the Italian Scottish experience is remembered. Ugolini argues that ‘the traumatic events of 1940–45’ reinforced difference and ‘contributed to a heightened sense of Italianness amongst the children of Italian immigrants’ (13). She disagrees with Terri Copli’s thesis that Italians ‘camouflaged’ their identity, and instead shows overlapping allegiances to the nation and their ethnicity. The book’s rich use of primary sources provides convincing evidence that the war ‘served to reinforce a sense of “otherness” amongst second-generation Italians’ (13).</p>
<p>The first half of the book examines Italian immigrants during the nineteenth century until the outbreak of the Second World War and the internment of people with hostile origins or associations under Defence Regulation 18B. Ugolini shows how Italians and other immigrants in Britain were ‘racialized’, which had a lasting impact on perceptions about ‘others’. Since 1861 the Italian diaspora numbered 25 million people and that population faced continued hostility from Britons for several reasons. Linda Colley has previously discussed how anti-Catholicism was incorporated in British identity, and Ugolini shows how religion as well as immigrants’ poor English and the invasion of Ethiopia had influenced that hostility prior to the war. She concludes that ‘the war saw a dramatic heightening of already existing prejudice’ (47). In addition, Ugolini explores the ‘fascist diaspora’, pointing out the social and cultural reasons why a non-political person would join a fascist club, and therefore arguing for ‘the need to differentiate amongst those who adopted leadership positions and those who were simply members of the <italic>Fasci</italic>’ (81). Nonetheless, the government failed to acknowledge this, and many Italians and British-born Italians were interned for their associations to the <italic>Fasci</italic> or as result of other allegations in 1940. Ugolini describes the Italian internment in Britain and compares the experience with other interned ethnic groups in North America and Australia.</p>
<p>The second half of the book explores the identity of Italians in the armed services, women’s experiences and commemoration of war, as well as remembrances of internment. Ugolini classifies Italian Scots in three groups: resisters, negotiators and consenters. She estimates that 7282 men of Italian origin fought in the British Army and argues that, in contrast to the American military, Italians had ‘conflicting loyalties’, which prevented assimilation, with some resisting the military or becoming conscientious objectors. Many who joined faced stereotypes or assaults and were constantly reminded of their ‘otherness’ by fellow soldiers. Likewise, Italian Scottish women faced open hostility, ranging from threats to assaults. With men interned or in the war effort, women took on prominent roles by running family businesses or doing auxiliary work and endured attacks on their livelihood. For the women who served in the British forces, Ugolini argues that the ‘war could quite dramatically reinforce a sense of difference’ (213). Lastly, she addresses memory and commemoration of the war, internment and the 1940 sinking of the Arandora Star that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of interned Italian men. She explores how the sinking of the ship and subsequent awards given to survivors points to a desire to remember, but ‘it is less central to Italian Scottish wartime experience than it is now presented’ (228). Ugolini also discusses the Italian Prisoner of War memorials for those who died in Britain and the commemoration of the Arandora Star as having a ‘displacing’ effect on Italian Scottish experiences, from resisters to British Army veterans. She concludes that such focus ‘perpetuates the dominance of a one-dimensional discourse of Italian Scottish wartime experience, silencing the memories of others’ (243).</p>
<p><italic>Experiencing War as the ‘Enemy Other’</italic> contains solid research and provides an important look at the varied experiences of the Italian Scots during the Second World War. It expands on the historiography by challenging arguments that Britain ‘came together’ during the war and criticizes a singular understanding that displaces the range of experiences and views of the Italian Scottish population. One issue Ugolini should have explored more was the interwar exchange between the British and Italian fascists. Oswald Mosley purposefully used fascism, a foreign political ideology, and started a large political party that blended British and Italian ideas, while also secretly receiving money from Benito Mussolini. There was a sizable population that was not hostile and even welcomed the Italian influence, which should have been more thoroughly addressed. Nonetheless, Ugolini’s work is a valuable study with rich primary sources that challenges notions of a singular wartime experience.</p>
