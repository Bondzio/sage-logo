<p><italic>Objective</italic>. Little is known about the lifestyle adjustments made by patients with asthma to reduce symptoms and maintain control when exposed to environmental triggers. The objectives of this study were to understand patient perspectives on asthma control, the triggers they identify in their lives, and any lifestyle adjustments they make to control their asthma by avoiding or managing known or perceived triggers. <italic>Methods</italic>. Focus groups were conducted with patients in the United States who had clinically documented persistent asthma. Participants completed a sociodemographic form and the Asthma Control Test (ACT), on which a score of 19 or lower indicates that asthma may not be well controlled. <italic>Results</italic>. A total of 19 participants participated in 1 of 2 focus groups. Most participants (n = 14; 74%) reported moderate asthma; 3 (16%) reported mild, and 2 (10%) severe. Mean ACT total score was 16 ± 4; 15 (79%) participants had a score of ≤19, and 4 (21%) participants had a score of ≥20. The most common asthma triggers affecting patients included indoor/outdoor allergens (n = 14; 74%), environmental pollutants/irritants (n = 6; 32%), foods (n = 6; 32%), strong odors (n = 5; 26%), and weather (n = 5; 26%). Additional triggers reported by some patients included exercise, stress, sinusitis/respiratory infections, medications, and strong emotions. Patient-reported behaviors used to maintain asthma control included use of controller medication, use of rescue medication, avoidance of asthma triggers, and relaxation or breathing exercises. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. Participants perceived themselves to experience symptoms or exacerbations when encountering triggers and to make frequent lifestyle adjustments to cope with triggers encountered.</p>

<p>Consensus recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of asthma have identified that the primary goal of asthma management is to optimize asthma control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129713483307">1</xref></sup> The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150129713483307">2</xref></sup> guidelines describe evaluating control through the assessment of daytime symptoms, activity limitation, nighttime awakenings and symptoms, the need for rescue treatment, lung function, and exacerbations. The GINA describes 3 levels of control: controlled, partly controlled, and uncontrolled. Similarly, the joint American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) task force report determines level of control based on existing symptoms and the extent to which the patient can carry out activities of daily living and achieve optimal quality of life, while taking into account risk of future adverse events including loss of control, exacerbations, accelerated decline in lung function, and side-effects of treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129713483307">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite widespread focus on control as the goal of asthma treatment, relatively large proportions of patients around the world are poorly controlled; in the United States, it has been estimated that up to 51% of patients may not be well controlled.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129713483307">3</xref></sup> Although a number of factors likely contribute to poor asthma control, the focus of this article is on the role of asthma triggers, defined as exposures that may lead to acute worsening of asthma symptoms over minutes to hours or exacerbations lasting several hours or days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129713483307">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150129713483307">5</xref></sup> Triggers may be significant contributors to severe exacerbations and the need for intensive care unit admittance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150129713483307">6</xref></sup> A recent literature review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150129713483307">7</xref></sup> of the types and prevalence of asthma triggers worldwide found that common triggers of asthma symptoms were similar across countries and included allergens (particularly pollens, molds, dust, and pet dander), tobacco smoke, exercise, air pollutants/particulates, weather patterns/changes, and respiratory infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129713483307">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150129713483307">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150129713483307"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150129713483307">10</xref></sup> Broadly, triggers discussed in the literature can be categorized into allergic triggers and nonallergic triggers, with the former potentially avoidable (eg, pet dander) and the latter less so (eg, weather patterns or changes). Although there is an abundance of literature on common types of asthma triggers worldwide, little is known about how patients perceive triggers in their environments and what lifestyle adjustments patients make to maintain control in the presence of triggers.</p>
<p>Asthma patients regularly receive messages from their health care providers and the popular press regarding how to best manage triggers encountered in their environments. Typically, patient education programs provide advice for patients to strive to identify and then avoid or reduce exposure to known triggers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150129713483307">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150129713483307">12</xref></sup> For example, <italic>Reader’s Digest</italic> recently published guidance from the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology in an article titled, “Allergy Trigger Avoidance,” offering suggestions such as staying indoors during mid-day and afternoon hours when pollen counts are highest (for pollen allergies), avoiding dried flowers (which may contain mold), washing hands after handling pets (for pet allergies), along with a number of other tips for ways to reduce exposure to common allergic asthma triggers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150129713483307">13</xref></sup> Studies have found that patients receiving asthma management education may keep symptom diaries to link symptom experiences to triggers, actively engage in trying to identify triggers of symptoms, take medication prior to exposure to triggers, and avoid triggers subsequent to asthma education programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150129713483307">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite widespread advice given to patients regarding reducing exposure to triggers, few empirical studies have examined either positive or negative consequences associated with behavioral or lifestyle changes undertaken to reduce exposure to triggers. In a review of recent literature, only 5 interventional studies were found that tested the effects of trigger education and avoidance on improved asthma control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150129713483307">7</xref></sup> Results were mixed with some studies demonstrating improvements in control in interventional groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150129713483307">15</xref></sup> and others not demonstrating reductions in exacerbations with lifestyle modifications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150129713483307">16</xref></sup> Not all avoidance techniques for all trigger types have been empirically tested for effectiveness, and no studies have explored the potential negative impacts on patients as they make lifestyle adjustments to avoid triggers. For example, advice to stay indoors on high pollen days may affect patients’ abilities to conduct their daily activities or may reduce their willingness to pursue outdoor fitness activities, thus impairing health-related quality of life. Furthermore, there is controversy as to what degree allergy avoidance reduces asthma symptoms and under what circumstances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150129713483307">17</xref></sup> In a review of the literature, no studies were found that described the types of behaviors general populations of asthma patients engage in the real world to manage trigger exposure; thus, it is unknown the extent to which patients perceive triggers in their environments and the behaviors they engage in to avoid them, despite widespread advice to do so.</p>
<p>The objective of this study was to understand asthma patients’ perspectives on the triggers they encounter and the lifestyle adjustments they make in response to those triggers.

<sec id="section2-2150129713483307">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This cross-sectional, qualitative study involved 2 focus group sessions with participants who had clinically diagnosed and documented persistent asthma. Participants were recruited through a large pulmonology clinic in the Southeastern United States. Eligible participants were identified through chart review by clinic staff who also screened to ensure that they met the study entry criteria. Inclusion criteria included the following: 18 to 70 years of age; documented clinical diagnosis of asthma as defined by the ATS for at least 6 months; mild, moderate, or severe persistent asthma; experienced one or more of the following symptoms more than once per week in the past 4 weeks: wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, or nighttime awakenings due to asthma; exposure to at least 2 triggers in the past 4 weeks (based on patient report); able to read, speak, and understand English; and willing and able to provide written, informed consent. Participants with a known history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, or other condition known to affect lung function were excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2150129713483307">
<title>Study Procedures and Focus Group Guide</title>
<p>The focus groups were held in a private room at the clinical site and were moderated by researchers trained in qualitative methods and focus group moderation. All participants provided written, informed consent prior to the focus group discussions. With the consent of participants, all discussions were audio-recorded. The moderator followed a semistructured focus group guide when leading the discussions, and participants were encouraged to discuss their experiences with each other. The focus group guide was designed to elicit information on patient terminology, definitions, and experiences specifically related to asthma symptoms, asthma control, asthma triggers encountered in patients’ daily lives, and the ways that patients cope with such triggers to maintain asthma control. Specifically, the group discussions were opened with very general questions (“Please describe your asthma”). As participants began to discuss and describe more specific symptoms of their asthma, themes related to triggers and trigger management that emerged were followed with neutral probes using the participants’ language. For example, when discussing asthma symptoms, participants often spontaneously discussed factors contributing to symptoms including weather or allergies; thus, these topics were used as an entry into discussion around other triggers of asthma symptoms. In this way, the guide started with general questions, and themes and terminology were allowed to emerge spontaneously.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of each discussion, participants were asked to complete a brief sociodemographic and clinical questionnaire. Furthermore, participants were asked to complete the Asthma Control Test (ACT), a 5-item, validated, patient-reported outcome questionnaire that was designed to assess asthma control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150129713483307">18</xref></sup> Each of the 5 items are assessed on a 5-point Likert-type scale, and respondents are asked to select the response option that best described their asthma symptoms, use of rescue medication, impact on activities, and overall asthma control in the past 4 weeks. To score the ACT, the point values for each response are summed to obtain the total score. Scores range from 5 to 25, where higher scores are indicative of better asthma control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150129713483307">18</xref></sup> Total scores of 19 points or lower may indicate that the patient’s asthma is not well controlled, whereas scores of 20 or greater are suggestive of well-controlled asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150129713483307">19</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2150129713483307">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed, with the verbatim transcripts serving as the data for qualitative analyses and organized using ATLAS.ti.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2150129713483307">20</xref></sup> A content analysis approach was used to analyze the data. Themes that emerged from discussions included asthma symptoms, definitions of asthma control, triggers of asthma, methods of coping with asthma triggers encountered, and other discussed issues or concerns related to asthma. Based on participants’ comments, themes were identified and coded. Each transcript was independently coded by one researcher, and codes were reviewed for accuracy and consistency by a second member of the research team. When differences in coding were observed, these codes were reconciled through collaborative review and rereading of each focus group transcript. Themes that emerged from the data were organized by topic and results are presented in the sections that follow.</p>

<p>Mean age at asthma diagnosis was 23.2 ± 17 years. Consistent with inclusion criteria, all participants reported experiencing asthma symptoms during the past month, including wheezing (n = 17, 90%), coughing attacks (n = 19, 100%), shortness of breath (n = 18, 95%), and chest tightness (n = 16, 84%). Most participants (n = 16, 84%) reported using a daily controller medication. The mean ACT total score was 16 ± 4. Fifteen participants (79%) had a total ACT score of ≤19, and 4 (21%) had an ACT score of ≥20. Question 5 of the ACT asks, “How would you rate your asthma control during the past 4 weeks?” To this question, one (5.3%) participant each reported “not controlled at all” and “poorly controlled,” 10 (52.6%) participants reported “somewhat controlled,” 7 (36.8%) participants reported “well controlled,” and no (0.0%) participants reported that they were “completely controlled.”</p>

<title>Symptom Experience</title>
<p>At the beginning of the focus group discussions, participants were asked to describe the symptoms they experience associated with asthma. Codes were assigned to the specific symptoms that patients reported. Most frequent symptoms of asthma reported by the participants included difficulty breathing (n = 7, 37%), chest pressure or tightness (n = 6, 32%), coughing (n = 6, 32%), and wheezing (n = 6, 32%). Symptom experiences were variable, with some participants reporting symptom worsening at night and others reporting more severe symptoms during the day. When describing their asthma symptoms, participants also mentioned that asthma symptoms have secondary negative consequences, including causing voice hoarseness, difficulty talking, physical discomfort, fear, and confusion. The quotes below illustrate some of the ways in which participants in this sample described their asthma symptom experiences:
<disp-quote>
<p>Feels like someone is standing on your chest.</p>
<p>It’s almost like I’m breathing through a straw, you know, not a full breath.</p>
<p>My lungs or my chest will get tight, and I’ll go into a coughing fit where you’re coughing out so much that your lungs, you can’t get a breath in.</p>
<p>I guess I started sweating, because I felt like somebody had just cut off my air and I got a little confused, because I was trying to find my inhaler.</p>
<p>It was like everything closed up, and I couldn’t get anything in. It was scary.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2150129713483307">
<title>Asthma Control</title>
<p>When asked to define “asthma control,” most participants mentioned that control meant being able to do what one wants to do, with confidence that asthma symptoms will not occur (n = 7, 37%). Others defined asthma control as not experiencing asthma symptoms or an asthma attack (n = 5, 26%), and still others reported asthma control as not having to use a rescue inhaler or medication (n = 5, 26%). Quotes illustrating participants’ definitions of asthma control are provided below:
<disp-quote>
<p>Not having to use the inhaler, not having symptoms.</p>
<p>I would like to think it didn’t involve any medication if it’s well controlled.</p>
<p>I’m not coughing or wheezing able to run, and I’m able to exercise without having a flare-up of symptoms.</p>
<p>Being able to breathe without ever gasping for air.</p>
<p>Normal activities without having to worry about needing an inhaler.</p>
<p>It would be so wonderful to be able to have the confidence to go for a run and not have to have it [inhaler].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-2150129713483307">
<title>Asthma Triggers</title>
<p>When discussing the experience of asthma symptoms, participants spontaneously discussed triggers in their environments that might lead to the onset or worsening of asthma symptoms. Common asthma triggers included indoor/outdoor allergens (n = 15, 79%), environmental pollutants/irritants (n = 8, 42%), strong odors (n = 7, 37%), foods (n = 6, 32%), weather (n = 5, 26%), exercise (n = 4, 21%), sinusitis/respiratory infections (n = 4, 21%), stress (n = 4, 21%), medications (n = 2, 11%), and strong emotions (n = 2, 11%). For example, some of the common indoor/outdoor allergens mentioned by participants in this sample included pollens, molds, animal dander, dust mites, and pets. Examples of environmental pollutants and irritants included cleaning agents, such as bleach, ammonia, and chlorine, as well as car exhaust fumes and other air particulates. Some participants reported that strong odors, including perfumes and smoke, would trigger asthma symptoms; weather conditions, such as humidity or cold air temperatures, were also reported by participants as triggers of asthma symptoms. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2150129713483307">Table 3</xref> provides quotes illustrating experiences with triggers for each of the different types of triggers reported above (allergens, pollutants/irritants, strong odors, foods, weather, exercise, infections, stress, medications, and strong emotions).</p>
<p>Triggers were variable both between, and within, participants. Different participants reported different triggers of asthma symptoms. Furthermore, trigger experiences were variable within participants, with some participants reporting that different triggers may lead to asthma symptoms at varying times. Quotes below illustrate the within-individual variability in trigger experiences:
<disp-quote>
<p>Mine are not always the same. The same ones do affect me but not all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah. I do run, and sometimes it would trigger it and sometimes not.</p>
<p>I would say 95% of the time when I encounter a cat I’ll have asthma.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several participants reported that exposure to triggers and the symptomatic consequences can vary depending on the day, season, or region. For example, some participants reported that they encounter more triggers and therefore experience more asthma symptoms and poorer control in the winter, whereas others reported trigger exposure increasing and symptom worsening in the fall and spring. The quotes below illustrate the links between trigger exposure, asthma symptoms, and seasonal variation experienced with respect to triggers/symptoms:
<disp-quote>
<p>Mine are year round, the symptoms are year round, and I have allergies year round.</p>
<p>. . . and mold is just horrible in the winter.</p>
<p>I do a lot better in the colder weather, rather than the hotter weather.</p>
<p>Winter and summer are usually better. Fall and spring are usually bad, once everything has bloomed.</p>
<p>Winters are terrible for me.</p>
<p>When we were in England, I didn’t have any problems and then when we were in northern California, I only had problems in the summer when we’d go to hike.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section11-2150129713483307">
<title>Behaviors Undertaken to Maintain Asthma Control in the Presence of Triggers</title>
<p>Participants in this sample each reported a number of different actions and behaviors undertaken to maintain asthma control when encountering triggers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2150129713483307">Table 3</xref>). For example, the majority of the participants reported using controller medication (n = 15, 79%). Many also reported using rescue medication (n = 10, 53%). When discussing use of rescue medication, participants described using this medication as a preventative measure (eg, taking a puff of inhaler prior to exercising) or as a way of getting symptoms under control once they are being experienced (eg, taking a puff of inhaler when difficulty with breathing starts). Furthermore, participants reported “stepping up” medication use during high trigger exposure times (eg, spring allergy season) by either taking their regular controller medication more regularly or adding allergy medication to their regular treatment. When describing altering routines to limit exposure, they described changes to their day-to-day plans, such as staying inside and exercising indoors on bad trigger days (eg, high pollen days or hot, humid days). Some participants reported taking measures to avoid triggers altogether, for example, participants gave up family pets to avoid allergens, or quit jobs where triggers were present. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-2150129713483307">Table 5</xref> provides quotes illustrating trigger coping techniques for each of the different types of techniques reported above (medications, reducing exposure, avoidance, quitting jobs, wearing a mask, nebulizer/breathing treatment, breathing/relaxation exercises).</p>

The results of this study suggest patients with asthma perceive a wide array of frequent allergic and nonallergic asthma triggers in their environments, including in their homes, outdoors, at their places of employment, or in other every day settings, that contribute to the frequency and severity of asthma symptoms and can result in a loss of control over their disease. These findings are consistent with work by Ritz and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150129713483307">21</xref></sup> who have recognized the broad array of frequent and important triggers that patients perceive in their environments through the development of a comprehensive Asthma Trigger Inventory. Types of triggers reported in this sample were consistent with those reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129713483307">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150129713483307">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150129713483307"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150129713483307">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150129713483307">21</xref></sup> However, this is the first study that has reported on behaviors and lifestyle adjustments that patients undertake to maintain control when they encounter triggers in their environments. This study found that patients make profound lifestyle changes to maintain control in the presence of triggers. Some of the lifestyle adjustments that patients make may have positive health consequences, for example, quitting smoking or avoiding secondhand smoke. Other behaviors may negatively affect patients’ health and health-related quality of life, such as avoiding exercise and avoiding certain social, recreational, and occupational activities or opportunities.</p>
<p>A limitation of this study is that it included a small, nonrepresentative sample that only included adult patients; results provide a first look into relevant aspects of control and avoidance behavior in the face of trigger exposure rather than statistically generalizable results. Future work should be conducted in multiple regions of the United States and worldwide, include more sociodemographic and clinical diversity, and take into account children and family perspectives of triggers and avoidance techniques.</p>
<p>Consensus recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of asthma have identified that the primary goal of asthma management is to optimize asthma control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129713483307">1</xref></sup> The importance of control is underscored by findings from a recently published analysis of pooled study data, suggesting that current control predicts future risk of instability and exacerbations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150129713483307">22</xref></sup> Given that asthma triggers have been identified as a contributor to poor asthma control and have been identified as contributing to severe exacerbations and the need for hospitalization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129713483307">4</xref>

Indeed, clinical assessments of asthma control that limit queries to the presence of symptoms, nighttime awakening, rescue medication use, or unexpected clinic visits may overestimate control because they register the absence of symptoms but not the elaborate efforts patients are making to avoid these symptoms. A recent international survey indicated that asthma is currently underdiagnosed and undertreated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2150129713483307">23</xref></sup> Implications from this work suggest that when discussing treatment options with patients, and determining whether current treatment courses are adequate and appropriate, clinicians should consider asking patients to discuss any perceived triggers and lifestyle adjustments they are making, in order to determine whether a patient truly is well controlled on a current treatment course.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Information on triggers plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of asthma. Current practice guidelines include recommendations to avoid or reduce exposure to triggers for maintaining control, but few empirical studies have tested the efficacy of avoidance on improved levels of control. Furthermore, few studies have examined other potential positive or negative consequences associated with behavioral or lifestyle changes undertaken to reduce exposure to triggers. Whereas some studies have demonstrated improved control with trigger education and avoidance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150129713483307">15</xref></sup> other studies evaluating the efficacy of trigger avoidance on improved asthma control have found prevention measures (ie, smoking cessation, influenza vaccinations, and behavior/attitude changes) employed by the patients were insufficient to prevent asthma exacerbations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150129713483307">16</xref></sup> Given that patients are instructed to engage in avoidance or trigger reduction techniques, and this study demonstrates that patients are doing so with both positive and negative consequences, findings here demonstrate the need for further empirical studies evaluating the efficacy of trigger avoidance or reduction techniques on improved levels of asthma control. These studies should also take into account potential negative consequences of lifestyle modifications on health-related quality of life outcomes, such as social, emotional, or work/educational outcomes.</p>
