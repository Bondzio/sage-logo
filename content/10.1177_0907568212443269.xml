<abstract>
<p>The text material analysed in this article consists of 20 teddy-diaries that circulated between the families of 6-year-old children in Beijing, China and in Oslo, Norway. The circulation process makes teddy-diaries highly normatively saturated domestic stories from families with 6-year-old children. A quantitative analysis of these texts inspired by Membership Categorization Analysis (MCA) developed by Harvey Sacks (1972) reveals what is deemed significant relations for children in each culture. By identifying actions and contexts that are described as relevant and appropriate for these significant relations, the researcher can also achieve a better understanding of how these relations are constructed as socializing relations in the everyday lives of children. The article finds that the learning styles and positioning of the child in everyday lives is participatory, play and peer oriented in Norway and instructional, encouraging and progress oriented in China.</p>

<body>
<p>The function of the family as a socializing unit has been challenged by many structural changes and has led us to take a wider look at who and what the socializing relations in a child’s life are. The family or extended family are still considered significant socializing agents in the lives of children, but cannot be rendered as universally valid categories of relations. In this article we analyse how a child’s significant relations are conceptualized when young children and their families write about their everyday lives. Children’s socializing relations are constructed and structured by children’s experiences as well as culture, traditions and social circumstances. The stories that these families share with each other also describe actions, activities and sentiments connected to the relations, which can reveal how these relations are constructed as socializing relations.</p>
<p>Cultures share certain ideals and norms about how family relations ought to be, who should be included as important people in a child’s life, how and where these relationships should be played out. When people talk about relations in their everyday lives, they don’t really question the categories of mother, father, sister, brother, friend or relative. Yet the categories are saturated with cultural meaning and connotation, and as such they are very powerful categories for children’s self-understanding and social identity.</p>
<p>In this article we use a quantitative content analysis on two sets of texts, to reveal significant relations in children’s everyday lives in urban Beijing, China and suburban Oslo, Norway. The analysis further explores the appropriate actions and contexts for these relations and interprets these within a socialization framework, looking at what kind of relations are highly valued, and identifies and conceptualizes the learning styles of the two cultures.</p>
<sec id="section1-0907568212443269">
<title>Exploring significant relations by using Membership Categorization Analysis</title>
<p>The texts used for this analysis are so-called ‘teddy-diaries’. Teddy bears and teddy-diaries were introduced as a pedagogical device in Norway after the school reform of 1997 in order to bridge the transition between family and school for students’ first year of school. Upon entering school, each school class is provided with a teddy bear, which will visit every child’s home in turn, carrying a diary where the bear’s experiences in the children’s home are recorded. The diary entries are written by the children or by the children together with their parents and must be read as a negotiated textual description of what the family regards as a valid account of their activities any given day. Most importantly, the entries represent a choice of things that they find worth mentioning for classmates, teachers and other families. In other words, the texts are normative descriptions in the sense of being family representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568212443269">Finch, 2007</xref>). The entries are then shared with teacher and classmates, as well as with the families who receive the book subsequently. The circulation between families is significant for the quality of the data and makes it highly saturated by social and cultural norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0907568212443269">Griffin, 2007</xref>). These teddy-diaries provide a methodological tool for family studies that is particularly fitting for the comparative study of norms and representations of ideals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0907568212443269">Haldar and Wærdahl, 2009</xref>). Having two sets of data from different cultures adds to the richness of the data by providing a contrast that is needed to illuminate the taken-for-granted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568212443269">Lamont and Thévenot, 2000</xref>) or to challenge our own membership categorizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0907568212443269">Sacks, 1992</xref>). Such contrast also serves to bring out particularities in data from unfamiliar cultures.</p>
<p>Our datasets are produced in China and in Norway. While the 10 Norwegian books were collected from just three schools in Oslo after use in 2006 and 2007, the Chinese books are a result of a researcher-initiated process in 2006, where 10 school classes at six schools in the centre of Beijing were given teddies and books to use in the same manner as in the Norwegian schools. The diaries in both sites circulated between families of the children in the school class and between the families and the school. The Norwegian books contain 319 entries, or stories from visits to a child’s home, while the Chinese books contain 284 entries, or stories, in total.</p>
<p>In this article we present a quantitative analysis of these two sets of books, inspired by Membership Categorization Analysis (MCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0907568212443269">Sacks, 1972</xref>). MCA is an ethno-methodological tool used in discursive approaches for exploring the everyday reproduction of meaningful categories. Harvey Sacks, who developed MCA, was primarily interested in how people produce membership categories in conversations. When people talk to and read others, they are bound to categorize or choose a certain characteristic in a person, action or object in order to understand them by. No characteristic is neutral, as it will decide <italic>what</italic> we see, <italic>whom</italic> we see and <italic>how we understand</italic> the situation. The rationale behind MCA is that we organize shared realities through our use of language. It is not the categories in themselves that contain a shared set of meanings, but the ways in which they are produced in collaboration with other meaning making individuals within a given group or a culture. The production of categories is rich with cultural meaning and ‘a great deal of knowledge that members of a society have about the society is stored in terms of these categories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0907568212443269">Sacks, 1992</xref>: 40–41). In our analysis we follow Sacks’s interest in revealing membership categories, but our interest is less directed towards the production process, and more focused on the occurrence of these categories, and the relations and activities that are conceptually tied to them in the texts.</p>
<p>Obviously, a quantitative content analysis of texts will only capture the categories and units that are explicit. One advantage of using a schematic analysis and revealing manifest patterns is a more precise approach for comparing data from two cultures, as it gives a better overview of the material, an overview based on categories that have evolved from each of the dataset’s particularities. We identify and count characters and social relations in the texts. By analysing how these relations are brought forward, presented and contextualized in the texts we mean to reveal the norms and ideals of what significant socializing relations a child should have and the qualities that are regarded as important for such relations.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Below is a diary entry from one of the Chinese books that we will use as an example of how the analysis was conducted:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>5/5: (C, Parent)</italic> Saturday 28th of October 2006, fine weather. When school was over and it was the weekend, <bold>the teacher</bold> told me I had behaved very well and I got to bring home our special class friend ‘Xiao Xiao’ to spend the weekend together. I was very happy, especially excited, because I could be with Xiao Xiao for two days, I was very happy in my heart. After I finished class, <bold>dad</bold> came to meet me. I was proud of myself as I told <bold>dad</bold> about this, <bold>dad</bold> was very happy and smilingly told me: ‘You are really great!’ Arrived at home, put down the book bag, <bold>dad</bold> started helping me to do my homework. I put ‘Xiao Xiao’ on the table and it studied together with me. We were writing characters and reading English. After we finished doing homework I brought ‘Xiao Xiao’ with me to <bold>my good friend’s</bold> house to play. Together we watched my favourite cartoon film. Time flies too fast</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We start the analysis by counting the characters that are mentioned in the texts. The narrator in the stories is the teddy or the child, and as narrators they are not counted. In addition, each character is only counted once per story. In the example entry we can see that the word ‘dad’ is mentioned four times, and ‘teacher’ and ‘good friend’ only once. In the tables this will be counted as one child–father relation, one child–teacher relation and one child–friend relation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0907568212443269">Table 1</xref> gives an overview of the characters in all the stories that are described in the texts, in relation to the child.</p>

For both sets of texts, the three-character relation mother–father–child as well as the relation mother–child and father–child are the most frequently mentioned. Separate accounts for each of these three relational pairs and their appropriate actions and contexts are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0907568212443269">Tables 1</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0907568212443269"/>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0907568212443269">3</xref>. The remaining two analyses are of the relational pairs that are most frequently mentioned beyond the parent–child relations in the two datasets. These are peer relations and the child–teacher relations, presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0907568212443269">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0907568212443269">5</xref> respectively.</p>

<sec id="section3-0907568212443269">
<title>Socializing relations in a child’s everyday life</title>
<p>Apart from the teddy and the child, 15 different categories of characters are found in the material. These categories of ‘others’ in the texts range from mothers and fathers to domestic animals. The range of characters is similar for both cases, with the exception of pets, domestic animals and a parent’s new partner, which are found only in the Norwegian texts.</p>
<p>There are both similarities and differences between the two text samples that are interesting for our analysis. Mother and father are very much present in the stories from both countries. In the Norwegian texts, mother and father are mentioned in equal amounts in the texts (95 mothers and 99 fathers), while mother is more frequent than fathers in the Chinese texts (97 vs 59). The reference to grandparents and extended family are also present in both countries, yet mentioned more often in the Norwegian books. Not surprisingly, siblings are more present in the Norwegian texts than in the Chinese texts, as the urban Beijing families are subject to the one-child policy. Because of this, we omit siblings from the ratio calculations. Still, the ratio of characters per diary entry in Norway is very much higher (2.5 with siblings, 2.2 without siblings) as compared to a 1.1 ratio in the Chinese diary entries. We interpret this as an expression that having many relations and people in their lives is regarded of great value for the Norwegian children. In the Norwegian stories it is not unlikely to write about having friends over, visiting friends as well as visiting a grandparent, all in the course of one day.</p>
<p>The most prevalent references in the Norwegian books are, however, friends or peers (187 references compared to 31 in the Chinese material), while the Chinese references to the teacher exceeds the Norwegian references to the teacher by far (44 references to 4). These two relations represent the highest contrast between the two datasets and are described in the second part of the analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0907568212443269">
<title>Socializing relations with parents</title>
<p>For the first part of our analysis, we choose to explore the most relevant activities and context for the three relational pairs connected to the child–parent relation, where the first represents a triangle with both parents and the child (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0907568212443269">Table 2</xref>), while the two other pairs are between each of the parents and the child (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0907568212443269">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>In the Chinese stories we can see that the formal introduction of the visiting teddy bear to both parents is highlighted in 13 of the 284 stories. Both parents are also frequently given the role as evaluators of the child, to express pride in their progress and give encouragement for further progress and development as a good student as well as a healthy human being with the right kind of values. In six of the stories the child is taught or tutored by the parents, and 17 of the stories describe how parents praise and encourage their child to study and work hard to improve themselves. The following excerpt from a Beijing diary exemplifies how such encouragement is expressed:<disp-quote>
<p>Today I am especially happy because I get to bring the bear Xiao Xiao home. Dad and mum will praise me for this. Before when other classmates happily brought Xiao Xiao home, I was very envious of them. Every time this happened I told my dad and mum, and they told me that I just had to keep on studying hard and then you will receive the teacher’s praise.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While study hard, work hard, abide by the rules, be attentive and honest seems to be the official parental message from Chinese parents to their children, there is an equal amount of praise and pride and expressions of unlimited love and support to soften this apparent strictness. Nevertheless, academic achievements evidently have a very high prestige in the Chinese material, even for the 6-year-olds. And both parents uphold this value, together and separately (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0907568212443269">Table 3</xref>). In the Chinese material, there are very few references to parents and child doing leisure activities together.</p>
<p>Thus it may seem that an instructional and encouraging style of socialization is what is expected and accepted in the Chinese context, at least in the formal parent–child relation. We accordingly classify the Chinese parenting style as <italic>achievement parenting</italic>.</p>
<p>In the Norwegian stories the teddy is usually immediately described a part of the daily activities of the family. In contrast to the Chinese data, we become aware of the fact that there are no descriptions of parents praising a child for his/her achievements. However, the list of activities that the parents and child do together is quite varied, from playing ball and doing gardening together, to eating together and sleeping in the same bed. Besides eating, there is no single activity that stands out as exceptionally important, so it is a more general value of ‘doing things together’ that is expressed. And contrary to the Chinese stories, the things they do together are not related to school or educational settings, but rather leisure, sports or common chores for the family. In one of the stories the description of a child–mother–father goes like this:<disp-quote>
<p>On Sunday Mum, Dad and I went to the circus.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We accordingly classify the Norwegian parenting style as <italic>activity based parenting</italic>.</p>
<p>What becomes visible in the comparison of the two sets of stories is that, for example, the Norwegian material also has descriptions of activities that parents do without the participation of their children. ‘Sitters’ are only mentioned in the Norwegian material, which could point to a norm that it is more legitimate for Norwegian children to be left with a sitter while the parents work, travel or do household chores on their own. Again, we need to underline that this does not mean that Chinese parents never leave their children in the care of others, it is just not something to write about for others to read.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to look at where children and parents are when they are together, and whether the setting or context is described as significant at all. In the Norwegian diaries the places are often abstract, such as ‘in’, ‘out’, ‘home’, ‘cabin’, while the Chinese homes and interior are described in concrete details, such as ‘my grandmother’s room is behind the kitchen, and bigger than my parents’ room’.</p>
<p>Time spent together without doing anything in particular is hardly ever mentioned in either the Norwegian or Chinese stories. This may not come as a surprise, as writing about ‘nothing’ can seem pointless. However, if either of these cultures put a high value on time spent together in silence, contemplation, meditation or prayer, this would surely have been mentioned in the texts. So, <italic>not</italic> mentioning time spent together in silence is a trait that the two cultures share.</p>
<p>Moving on, we take a closer look at the actions, activities and context that are described with regard to the relation child–mother and child–father. There are many reasons to anticipate that the social relation to mothers and fathers and the activities tied to these would be different. It is interesting to see if these differences are consistent across the two cultures.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0907568212443269">Table 3</xref> we have counted the actions and locations where only mother or father is mentioned as the participant of the relational pair. We can observe some of the same tendencies as for the triangular relation presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0907568212443269">Table 2</xref>, for example that there is a wider range of activities mentioned in the Norwegian stories. However, the range and variety of activities expand substantially also in the Chinese stories when we look at activities with only one of the parents. A typical one-parent activity is the everyday task of transport, delivering or picking the child up from school, taking the child to activities or to be with friends. Transportation is obviously rendered a one-parent task in both the Norwegian and Chinese contexts. Other daily activities that the child and one of the parents do together are connected to food preparation and eating, short trips or outings for leisure or having a conversation and sharing experiences. There are only a few differences between the appropriate actions and contexts for the child–mother and child–father relations in the two cultures.</p>
<p>The most visible difference between mother and father activities is found in the Chinese material, where two activities are more commonly described for the child–mother relation than for the child–father relation. One is related to preparing a snack for the child or family, while the other is the mother sharing a story or having a conversation with the child. The following example from Beijing shows how this relation was described:<disp-quote>
<p>Today I brought a new friend home, I told my mum: It is called Liang Liang, because when I was little mum gave me the name Yue Liang/moonlight, she said that at that time I was round as the moon on the 15th [full moon].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The other visible difference between the mother and father relation is in the Norwegian material, where shorter trips outside the home for leisure activities seem to be a more common characteristic of the child–father relation, yet not exclusive to this relation. Most commonly, the activities with daddy are described concisely, as in this example from a Norwegian story:<disp-quote>
<p>Daddy and I went outside to play some football.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Whereas Chinese parents, both collectively and in separate relations with their child, are expected to give encouragement, instructions and praise the child for his/her achievements, Norwegian parents are not even in their separate relations described as praising their children, or as helping them with their homework. The Norwegian material does, however, contain more descriptions of children who spend time with one or the other parent doing things that are not on the child’s terms, such as going to work-out sessions for adults, running errands with the parent or taking part in adult celebrations or parties. Going on weekend trips with only one of the parents is also frequently mentioned in the Norwegian stories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0907568212443269">
<title>Socializing relations beyond the primary family</title>
<p>The second part of our analysis looks at two relational pairs where the Norwegian and Chinese texts differ in which characters the child is most frequently described in relation to (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0907568212443269">Table 1</xref>). These relational pairs both extend beyond the primary household. For the Norwegian case in particular, we find it interesting to explore the actions and contexts of the relational pair of child–friend/peer in more detail, while the Chinese child–teacher relation leads to an exploration of how the appropriate emotional ties to, and perceived expectations from, the teachers are described.</p>
<p>Starting with friends and peer relations, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0907568212443269">Table 1</xref> show that more than every second story in the Norwegian material mentions a friend or a classmate. In the Chinese stories, approximately every 10th story has a friend or a classmate in it. This difference is striking and merits attention. Friends and peers are given extraordinary importance when Norwegian children and families are presenting themselves and writing about their everyday lives. The stories can say something about what friendships are supposed to be through the activities and contexts that are described for the friendship relation.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0907568212443269">Table 4</xref> we have counted and sorted activities with friends under three broad categories. First, is a category where friends are present in generic contexts, second, where a locality is specified and finally, we have counted activities that are done together with friends where specific activities are mentioned. All activities in every story are counted in table. This means that for the Norwegian case, where each story may have descriptions of several activities with one friend in one day, the number of activities and contexts is larger (294) than the number of friends (187) that are counted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0907568212443269">Table 1</xref>. The details in the Chinese stories are not so elaborate in regard to these kinds of activities, so the number of activities and contexts corresponds exactly to the number of friends shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0907568212443269">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The amount of idiomatic terms used in relation to friends, like ‘go to’, ‘be with’ or ‘play with’, hints at a relationship with friends or peers that is very common, and where there is no need to explain further what they are doing together. Being with friends is a mundane, everyday activity. There are 76 such references to friends ‘just being there’ in the Norwegian material, while in the Chinese material there is only one such reference. This is a strong indication that having friends around you is something that is perceived as important for Norwegian children.</p>
<p>There are also many activities mentioned as something you would do with a friend. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0907568212443269">Table 4</xref> shows a range of these activities. Celebrating birthdays stands out as something particularly worth mentioning. Every sixth Norwegian diary entry contains a birthday party or birthday celebration. Sometimes the teddy even attended two birthdays during one weekend, like in the following:<disp-quote>
<p>At 14.00 we went to Anna’s old doctor, because we were going to Jenny’s birthday. At the birthday [party] I had a great time, lovely cakes and many children who took good care of me. . . . [Sunday] I joined Anna on another birthday, and there were many who had dressed up [in fancy dress] there. That was fun!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Friends are worth mentioning, and the Norwegian stories contain many examples of peer togetherness. The standardized relational pair of child–friend points to playful and team activities as well as shared, intimate relations such as sleepovers. Both the high frequency and the detailed description of activities with friends underscores the fact that peer socialization is highly valued in the Norwegian context. This corresponds to a theoretical conceptualization of children where peers are acknowledged as important socializing agents. It is particularly in relation to the development of competence (e.g. social, communicative, emotional) that peers have gained their status as socializing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0907568212443269">Frønes, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Moving to the Chinese context, the child–peer relations look different, mainly because the references to friends are fewer and further apart. Every 10th story mentions a friend of the child, and four of these references are to classroom situations. In 12 of the instances where friends are mentioned, friends are for the most part referred to as someone you think about or care about and not so much described as a unit for play or action. A few references are made to play activities in the park or at home, indicating that playing is something worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The reference to peers and friendship activities is one of the two significant differences in children’s presentation of relations in their everyday lives in the two cultures. The other striking difference is in the description of the relation between the child and the teacher.</p>
<p>Beside parents, the child–teacher relation is the most prominent in the Chinese material. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0907568212443269">Table 5</xref>, this relationship is categorized by its descriptions. In general, the Chinese diary entries express deep gratitude, admiration and respect for the teacher, and the relation is described as one that makes the child strive to become a better person and for achieving better results in school.</p>
<p>For the Chinese children, not addressing the teacher in the text could be interpreted as impolite and disrespectful. For one, the teacher is the initiator of the communication, and a visit by the teddy and having the book for the weekend is often seen as a reward for doing well in school. However, since the teddy diary was originally meant as a communication between home and school in Norway also, we find it curious that the teacher is almost absent in the Norwegian texts. The absence of descriptions of the child–teacher relation in the Norwegian context could indicate that there are fewer positive connotations or references to the relation within the membership category, and thus it is difficult to find acceptable ways to talk about it. This contrast underscores the importance attributed to the teacher in the Chinese context. The teacher–child relationship underscores achievement parenting, and the adult–child relationship as being evaluative and reward or sanction based.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0907568212443269">
<title>Actions, duties and obligations tied to relational pairs</title>
<p>Inspired by MCA, we have identified characters mentioned in the diary texts from Norway and China and how they are paired to other characters and categories in the texts. When categories are organized in pairs we can treat them as one unit. By way of a systematic analysis of common descriptions that are activated for each relational pair, we can give a more detailed description of the unit as a standardized relational pair. If we further know which actions and contexts this unit is most commonly mentioned in relation to, we can tap into the expectations of the pair or group that forms our impression and knowledge about it. The descriptions of everyday life that are given in the teddy-diaries are not full, naturalistic accounts of what has happened in the given day or weekend, but accounts of what a child and its family render as important to tell the others in school and the other families about their lives. We can therefore assume that the socializing relations that are described in a child’s life are considered important, and that these descriptions are highly normatively saturated and understood as valuable. Through our analysis, we achieve a better understanding of how these relations are constructed as socializing relations in the everyday lives of children. How these socializing relations are described also underscores how different forms of socialization and learning styles are valued in the two contexts.</p>
<p>Three types of relations that are frequently mentioned in the books, and must be interpreted as highly valued are the child–parent, child–friend and child–teacher relations. Our analysis shows that the relevant contexts to understand these relations are both similar and yet very different between Norway and China. Not surprisingly the child–parent relation is most frequently mentioned in the texts from both countries, paired either as child–mother, child–father or child–both parents. When we move on to analysing the emotions, actions and activities that are tied to these relational pairs in the texts, there are notable differences in how these are described. In the Norwegian books the relation between the child and his/her parent or parents is usually described in terms of activities. In the Chinese books, the relation is usually described as an evaluative relationship where parents give praise or advice and where the child expresses hope that the parents will be proud of him or her. In short, we can summarize the most explicit traits of these relations to be interaction oriented focusing on learning sociability and autonomy in Norway, and achievement oriented focusing on learning through instruction and encouragement in China.</p>
<p>The Chinese descriptions of the child–teacher relationship holds many of the same qualities as the child–parent relationship, described as a unit focusing on instructions from adult to child, oriented towards respect, achievement and praise. Comparing the descriptions of the adult–child relationships in the Norwegian texts, there are strikingly few, if any, descriptions of the parent as an authority of knowledge and experience. The fact that the teacher is never mentioned in these texts, tells us that that there are substantial cultural differences in the adult–child relationship in the two contexts. In the Chinese books, children are expected to make the adult happy or pleased, while in the Norwegian books the parent is described as a facilitator of the child’s happiness.</p>
<p>The chosen addressee of the diary entries underscores this same idea. While Norwegian children and parents solely write to other children and parents, the Chinese children and parents often write to the teacher. While the Norwegian learning style is exploration-oriented, focused on gaining experience through trial and error, the learning style in China is <italic>instructional and self-study based, centered on transmitting</italic> formal knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>While the Norwegian material is rich in sociability, activity and interaction, the Chinese material is more intellectually oriented and has many reflections, thoughts and emotions related to the described relations. In line with the more instructional style of learning described in the Chinese material, it seems reasonable to assume that peer socialization is given less significance than in the Norwegian material. Respect for elders and the passing on of knowledge between generations holds a much higher value. This kind of handed down knowledge is not mentioned in the Norwegian material, where the learning style expressed is through personal experience in interaction with others, and the idea that children learn from other children is very strong. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that peer relations are the most frequently mentioned relation outside the parent relation in the Norwegian books, a relation that is heavily saturated with high intensity playful activities as well as close togetherness and celebration of friendship. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0907568212443269">Table 6</xref> we summarize the main findings.</p>

<p>When applying the logic of membership categorization and not least by comparing the conceptualizations of these relational pairs in the Norwegian and Chinese texts, important similarities and differences appear.</p>
<p>In both sets of texts, the family unity of child–mother–father unquestionably stands out as the most important socializing relation. Sometimes, there are two-person families, at other times extended families, but in the child–parent negotiated stories, the child–parent relation is always front and centre as a socializing relation in the everyday lives of children. Outside the primary family, the Chinese stories portray the teacher as the most important socializing relation, while the Norwegian stories describe peer socialization and friendships as a valuable socializing relation.</p>
<p>What Chinese and Norwegian children find an appropriate representation of their lives to narrate to their school also differs in terms of the most common actions, activities and contexts of their socializing relations. These relations place the Chinese child predominately in the contexts of the home or school, as a learner who needs to be instructed, evaluated and rewarded in his/her development to become a skilled and knowledgeable adult. The Norwegian children are, on the other hand, described in terms where having many relations in itself is valuable, and where leisure activities, preferably outdoors, and peer socialization is rendered as important.</p>
