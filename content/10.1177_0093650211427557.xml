<abstract>
<p>This current study investigated how the gain versus loss framing effect would be moderated by gender of message recipients in the context of breast cancer screening (BCS) intervention that promotes both men and women to recommend regular BCS to their close women. A 2 (male vs. female) x 2 (gain vs. loss) between-subject experiment was conducted using 128 African American participants (mean age = 45.9). The results showed that men and women processed the BCS messages with a different elaboration depth, and also perceived gain- versus loss-framed messages differently. For instance, compared to gain frame loss frame was more effective for women in increasing their message elaboration and supportive thoughts about BCS. In contrast, gain frame was more effective for men in increasing their memory of the BCS messages than loss frame. The findings provided practical implications for health communication practitioners in how to strategically use gain versus loss framing in accordance with their target population.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Interest in the relative effectiveness of gain versus loss framing in terms of changing recipients’ attitudes, intentions, and possibly, behaviors has been mostly based on the theoretical framework of prospect theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211427557">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979</xref>). Over the past several decades, the prospect theory has been extensively applied in the health communication field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093650211427557">McElroy &amp; Seta, 2003</xref>). A series of researchers have assessed how framing effects can provide a guideline for developing effective health messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093650211427557">Rothman, Bartels, Wlaschin, &amp; Salovey, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This current study aims to examine how individuals’ gender would moderate the effects of gain versus loss framing in the context of breast cancer screening (BCS) messages. Most previous studies on breast cancer communication have typically involved middle-aged female participants only. However, in real intervention context, many campaigns are taking note of the role of men in promoting breast cancer awareness among women. For instance, the National Breast Cancer Awareness Month program in the United States has been conducting the <italic>Think Pink and Tell a Friend</italic> campaign, which targets both men and women. The program attempts to motivate men to encourage the women in their lives to get regular BCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0093650211427557">Sporer, 2007</xref>). This is in line with health campaign scholars who have recognized the importance of interpersonal communication in media campaign effects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093650211427557">Afifi et al., 2006</xref>; Hornik et al., 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0093650211427557">Southwell &amp; Yzer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0093650211427557">Valente, 2002</xref>). Based on the two-step flow and agenda-setting models, a series of researchers claimed interpersonal communication as an important outcome of media-based health campaigns, wherein a nontarget audience talked to their loved ones about what they learned through media regarding a particular health topic such as drug use (Hornik et al., 2000) and organ donation (Ariri et al., 2006).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0093650211427557">1</xref></sup> In the context of breast cancer interventions, only a few researchers have considered the important role of families and friends in improving the BCS rate among women (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211427557">Jones, Denham, &amp; Springston, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0093650211427557">Tanjasiri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0093650211427557">Wilkin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0093650211427557">Xie, Turner, Lamm, &amp; Southard, 2005</xref>), and few have investigated the role of male population in facilitating the interpersonal influence of BCS campaigns. The current study aims to advance such literature by examining the effects of message framing and how such effects would be moderated by the gender of recipients of BCS messages. A number of health communication researchers have considered gender as an important moderator given that gender is an easily attainable piece of information that can guide practitioners to tailor and distribute health messages for a specific target audience (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650211427557">Albrecht &amp; Bryant, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211427557">McQueen, Vernon, Meissner, &amp; Rakowski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0093650211427557">Zajac, Klein, &amp; McCaul, 2006</xref>). The goal of the present study is to clarify the need to target male versus female population separately in order to enhance the effectiveness of BCS campaigns.</p>
<p>Previous framing studies have unanimously suggested that, based on prospect theory, loss framing over gain framing would be more effective in breast cancer interventions. The question, however, is whether such advantage of loss framing will actually influence male audiences, too. This present study aims to answer this question with regard to the relationship between framing and cognitive elaboration. Most previous studies have overlooked the possibility that the advantage of loss framing may not work if the interventions target a male audience, who could process BCS messages differently than a female audience.</p>
<p>This present study specifically examines the response of African American men and women to BCS advocacy messages that include African American breast cancer survivors’ testimonies. According to the CDC (2010) report, African American women are more likely to die from breast cancer than women in other ethnic groups and are less likely to survive for 5 years after diagnosis. Studies suggest that this disparity is due to the fact that African American women are often diagnosed and receive treatment at a later stage of the disease. This current study will further understanding for developing effective breast cancer intervention messages aimed at increasing BCS rates among African American communities, specifically by facilitating interpersonal conversations and recommendations of BCS through both male and female audiences.</p>
<p>In sum, the purpose of this study is to examine the cognitive mechanism behind gain versus loss framing effects and to provide practical implications that will help practitioners understand which target population is more likely to respond to the gain versus loss framing, depending on the public sectors’ involvement levels in a given issue and their message elaboration depth.</p>

<title>Gain Versus Loss Framing in Health Communication</title>
<p>Framing effects refer to “the findings that decision-makers respond differently to different but objectively equivalent descriptions of the same problem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093650211427557">Kuhberger, 1998</xref>, p. 150). More specifically, gain versus loss framing research focuses on the differential effects on persuasion of presenting information in terms of the benefits gained or the consequences suffered in decision-making contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211427557">Loroz, 2007</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093650211427557">McElroy and Seta (2003)</xref> noted, predictions concerning framing have been typically derived from the theoretical framework of prospect theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211427557">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979</xref>). The basic assumption of prospect theory is that individuals’ decisions in the context of “risky choice” are not necessarily rational. With regard to an individual’s decision-making process, prospect theory predicts people’s risk aversion for gains (i.e., preference for the sure gain) and risk seeking for losses (i.e., rejection of sure gain for gamble of lower probability). This propensity to choose risk-averse options when a problem is framed as gain and risk-seeking options when a problem is framed as loss has been applied to the context of persuasive message design, producing empirical evidence to support this proposition of prospect theory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0093650211427557">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the original prospect theory focuses on individual decision making regarding a certain behavior involving risk (e.g., gambling), a number of communication researchers have extended the scope by testing the effectiveness of gain- versus loss-framed messages with respect to recipients’ attitudes, behavioral intentions, and cognitive processing in various communication contexts (e.g., radio news reports on urban growth—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0093650211427557">Shah, Kwak, Schmierbach, &amp; Zubric, 2004</xref>; message about the Free Trade Agreement issue—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211427557">Lee &amp; Park, 2011</xref>; political news covering KKK rally—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211427557">Borah, 2011</xref>; organ donation messages—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0093650211427557">Reinhart, Marshall, Feeley, &amp; Tutzauer, 2007</xref>). In health communication, a series of researchers have proposed that when people are considering a behavior that may involve some risk of potentially unpleasant outcomes (e.g., detecting a health problem such as breast cancer), loss-framed health messages would be more effective and that when people are considering a behavior that may involve a “relatively low risk of an unpleasant outcome” (e.g., preventing the onset of a health problem), gain-framed health messages would be more persuasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093650211427557">Rothman et al., 2006</xref>, p. 205). This conceptual framework has been supported by a large body of empirical research in health communication (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650211427557">Apanovitch, McCarthy, &amp; Salovey, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093650211427557">Banks et al., 1995</xref>; Detweiler, Bedell, Salovey, Pronin, &amp; Rothman, 1999; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650211427557">Gerend &amp; Cullen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093650211427557">Kiene, Barta, Zelenski, &amp; Cothran, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211427557">Maheswaran &amp; Meyers-Levy, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093650211427557">Meyerowitz &amp; Chaiken, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093650211427557">O’Keefe &amp; Jensen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093650211427557">Rivers, Salovey, Pizarro, Pizarro, &amp; Schneider, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0093650211427557">Robberson &amp; Rogers, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0093650211427557">Schneider et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0093650211427557">Williams, Clarke, &amp; Borland, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of breast cancer intervention, since a majority of breast cancer–related messages involve detection behaviors (e.g., mammography, self-examinations), loss-framed appeals over gain-framed appeals have been considered as more effective in encouraging breast cancer–related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093650211427557">Rothman et al., 2006</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093650211427557">Meyerowitz and Chaiken (1987)</xref> found that compared to pamphlets with gain-framed appeals pamphlets with loss-framed appeals were more effective in increasing undergraduate women’s positive attitudes toward and engagement in breast self-examinations (BSE). Banks and his colleagues (1995) also found that women were more likely to obtain a mammogram 1 year after viewing a loss- versus gain-framed videotape. Indeed, in the recent meta-analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093650211427557">O’Keefe and Jensen (2009)</xref>, the authors examined 17 studies regarding breast cancer detection behaviors (<italic>N</italic> = 2,736) and found that a dependable advantage for loss-framed appeals was apparent for breast cancer detection behaviors (mean <italic>r</italic> = –.056).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, although many studies have revealed empirical evidence suggesting gain-framed messages work better for promoting <italic>prevention</italic> behaviors, and loss-framed messages for promoting <italic>detection</italic> behaviors, another line of researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093650211427557">Keller, Lipkus, &amp; Rimer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093650211427557">Lee &amp; Cameron, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211427557">Loroz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093650211427557">Meyerowitz &amp; Chaiken, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093650211427557">Obermiller, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093650211427557">O’Keefe &amp; Jensen, 2009</xref>) have claimed that the relative effectiveness of gain versus loss framing can be moderated by various situational factors (e.g., mood—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093650211427557">Keller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0093650211427557">Yan, Dillard, &amp; Shen, 2010</xref>; issue salience—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093650211427557">Obermiller, 1995</xref>) and individual factors (e.g., motivation system—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211427557">Mann, Sherman, &amp; Updegraff, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0093650211427557">Shen &amp; Dillard, 2007</xref>; need for cognition—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0093650211427557">Zhang &amp; Buda, 1999</xref>; social distance—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211427557">Nan, 2007</xref>), in addition to the simple distinction of prevention versus detection behaviors. This current study will specifically examine the moderating role of gender, which is a critical piece of information that can guide health communicators to tailor and distribute their messages (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211427557">McQueen et al., 2008</xref>). The next section will review previous literature on how gender influences gain versus loss framing effects.</p>

<title>Gender as a Moderator of Message Framing Effects</title>
<p>A series of researchers have examined the role of gender in the gain versus loss framing effects of persuasive messages. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093650211427557">Braun and Gaeth (1997)</xref> created two versions of chocolate-bar packaging, gain frame (“80% fat-free”) versus loss frame (“20% fat”) and examined how differently such framed attributes were perceived by male versus female participants. The authors expected that women and men would have different levels of involvement (i.e., motivation to process) regarding the “fat” issue. The findings revealed that framing effects emerged only from female participants. That is, the gain frame was more effective for female participants than the loss frame, whereas there was no difference with male participants.</p>
<p>In the context of health communication, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093650211427557">Meyerowitz and Chaiken (1987)</xref> showed that loss-framed messages were more effective in persuading <italic>women</italic> to use breast self- examination (BSE) than gain-framed messages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093650211427557">O’Keefe and Jensen (2009)</xref> noted that, based on Meyerowitz and Chaiken’s findings, one might suspect that on any disease detection topic, loss-framed messages were more persuasive than gain-framed messages for <italic>women</italic> than for men. To explore this idea, O’Keefe and Jensen conducted a meta-analysis of 36 studies examining the relationship between a study’s effect size and the proportion of female participants in that study. Results revealed that there was little evidence indicating that men and women are differentially susceptible to gain- versus loss-framed messages regarding disease detection behaviors. In fact, in the context of testicular cancer communication, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0093650211427557">Umphrey (2003)</xref> revealed that loss-framed messages were more effective in persuading <italic>men</italic> to perform testicular self-examination. Umphrey’s findings, along with Meyerowitz and Chaiken’s, provide an interesting insight and suggest that the level of issue involvement, rather than gender itself, could be a significant factor in moderating loss versus gain framing effects.</p>
<p>In a similar sense, Rothman et al. examined the framing effects in skin cancer detection messages, employing participants’ gender as a proxy for degree of issue involvement. Their expectation was based on the assumption that women would be generally more concerned about skin care than men would. The results were consistent with their expectations. In terms of promoting skin cancer detection behaviors, loss-framed messages were more effective for female participants, whereas for male participants gain-framed messages were more effective. Such findings prompted the current study to expect that men and women may have different levels of issue involvement in a gender-specific disease such as breast cancer, and such gender differences may moderate the effectiveness of gain versus loss framing as in prior literature on gender and framing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093650211427557">Meyerowitz &amp; Chaiken, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093650211427557">Rothman, Salovey, Antone, Keough, &amp; Martin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0093650211427557">Umphrey, 2003</xref>). However, it should be noted that the aforementioned studies have not provided clear explanations of why and how gender moderates the framing effects. This current study aims to explain the cognitive mechanism behind the framing effects in light of message elaboration. Before posing the hypotheses, therefore, it would be worth to review prior literature on the relationship between issue involvement and framing effects with regard to cognitive processing depth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0093650211427557">
<title>Issue Involvement, Elaboration Depth, and Framing</title>
<p>There are two main research streams that attempt to explain the relationship between involvement level and framing effects in light of elaboration depth. First, Rothman and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0093650211427557">Rothman &amp; Salovey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093650211427557">Rothman et al., 2006</xref>) propose that “framing effects may <italic>only</italic> be obtained when people care about a health issue and, thus, are systematically processing the information in the message” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093650211427557">Rothman et al., 2006</xref>, p. 207). In a similar sense, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211427557">Loroz (2007)</xref> explained the moderating role of involvement on framing effects under the prevention-detection paradigm. That is, in a <italic>detection</italic> behavior context, individuals highly involved in the issue and engaged in elaborative processing were more likely to be persuaded by <italic>loss frames</italic> recommending detection behaviors for heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211427557">Maheswaran &amp; Meyers-Levy, 1990</xref>), STD, and skin cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093650211427557">Block &amp; Keller, 1995</xref>), or breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093650211427557">Cox &amp; Cox, 2001</xref>). On the other hand, in a <italic>prevention</italic> behavior context, individuals highly involved in the issue and engaged in elaborative processing were more likely to be persuaded by <italic>gain frames</italic> recommending prevention behaviors for skin cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093650211427557">Rothman et al., 1993</xref>, Experiment 2) or safe driving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093650211427557">Millar &amp; Millar, 2000</xref>). This perspective, however, did not provide clear explanations about the cases when individuals were <italic>not</italic> involved with a particular issue. Rather, Rothman and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0093650211427557">Rothman &amp; Salovey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093650211427557">Rothman et al., 2006</xref>) implied that framing effects would simply <italic>not</italic> occur for those whose involvement levels were low.</p>
<p>On the other hand, another line of research has proposed that when individuals are highly involved with an issue and systematically processing the message, loss frames will be more persuasive than gain frames. On the contrary, when individuals are not involved with an issue and heuristically processing the message, gain frames will be more persuasive than loss frames. According to this perspective, when individuals rely predominantly on systematic processing, due to the high level of issue involvement or motivation, loss-framed messages should be more persuasive because “negative information has been shown to be non-normative and often unexpected. Thus, when viewed as more diagnostic than positive information, systematic processors often assign it greater weight during judgment formation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211427557">Meyers-Levy &amp; Maheswaran, 2004</xref>). In contrast, when individuals rely predominantly on heuristic processing, gain-framed messages should be more persuasive because heuristic processors tend to base their judgments on simple decisions related to “surface features,” and generally approach what is positive but eschew what is negative, based on hedonic principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093650211427557">Higgins, 1998</xref>). This perspective is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211427557">Maheswaran and Meyers-Levy’s (1990)</xref> findings that, in the context of heart disease blood tests (i.e., detection behavior messages), loss framing was more effective than gain framing for systematic processors, whereas gain framing was more effective than loss framing for heuristic processors.</p>
<p>In this current study on BCS messages, the two research streams propose an advantage for loss framing over gain framing in the case of highly involved individuals/ systematic processors. For individuals with low involvement/heuristic processors, however, there has been disagreement. Whereas one line of research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0093650211427557">Rothman &amp; Salovey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093650211427557">Rothman et al., 2006</xref>) proposed that framing effects would not occur for those whose involvement levels are low (i.e., null effect), another line of research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211427557">Meyers-Levy &amp; Maheswaran, 2004</xref>) argued that gain framing would be more effective than loss framing when the level of issue involvement was low. The current study will examine this yet unclear area based on the latter stream of research. This current study chose the latter perspective as a theoretical guideline because some researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211427557">Maheswaran &amp; Meyers-Levy, 1990</xref>), using samples that were less likely to be involved with the health issue, found that gain-framed appeals were more effective in promoting detection behaviors. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211427557">Meyers-Levy and Maheswaran (2004)</xref> argued, gain-framed messages would be more persuasive than loss-framed messages for individuals showing low involvement because heuristic processors tend to base their judgments on superficial aspects of the message and generally approach what is positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093650211427557">Higgins, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, based on the literature reviewed above, this study proposes that male versus female participants will have different involvement levels in the issue of breast cancer and will process breast cancer intervention messages in a different elaboration depth from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093650211427557">Braun &amp; Gaeth, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211427557">McQueen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093650211427557">Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093650211427557">Petty, Priester, &amp; Brinoal, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093650211427557">Rothman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0093650211427557">Umphrey, 2003</xref>). It is also hypothesized that such differences in elaboration depth will then lead men and women to perceive loss versus gain frame in breast cancer intervention messages, differently. Thus, the following hypotheses are suggested:</p>
<list id="list1-0093650211427557" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Participant’s gender will influence his or her involvement in the issue of breast cancer, such that female participants will be more highly involved in the breast cancer issue than male participants.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Participant’s gender will influence his or her message elaboration in breast cancer intervention messages, such that female participants will have greater message elaboration than male participants.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Participant’s gender will interact with the type of frame in breast cancer intervention messages to increase message elaboration.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3a</italic>: Female participants will have greater elaboration for the loss-framed message than the gain-framed message.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3b</italic>: Male participants will have greater elaboration for the gain-framed message than the loss-framed message.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The dual-processing theorists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093650211427557">Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986</xref>) predict that greater attention to message-relevant arguments will result in, depending on the quality of those arguments, lasting attitude change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0093650211427557">Slater &amp; Rouner, 2002</xref>, p. 180). In the present study, since the messages include relatively strong arguments from breast cancer survivors’ testimonies, which were developed by a credible nonprofit organization, the extent of elaboration will increase the chance that people process the persuasive information in the messages rather than generating counterarguments. That is, participants who process BCS messages in the greater depth of elaboration will be more likely to produce supportive thoughts about BCS because they have more opportunities to reflect on either the benefits of following a recommended action or the costs of failing to take the action. In this sense, the interaction between gender and frame in BCS message elaboration (as hypothesized in Hypothesis 3) will also lead to the interaction between gender and frame in the number of supportive thoughts about BCS. Therefore, the following hypotheses are proposed.</p>
<list id="list2-0093650211427557" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: Participants’ breast cancer message elaboration will be associated with their supportive thoughts about BCS.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 5b</italic>: Male participants will have greater supportive thoughts about BCS after exposure to the gain-framed message than after exposure to the loss-framed message.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Such supportive thoughts about BCS will be associated positively with the individuals’ attitude toward BCS and related behavioral intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093650211427557">Ajzen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093650211427557">Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093650211427557">1980</xref>).</p>
<list id="list3-0093650211427557" list-type="simple">

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 7</italic>: Participants’ supportive thoughts about BCS, triggered by the breast cancer message, will be positively associated their behavioral intentions regarding BCS.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Although prior studies on framing effects generally have not measured memory as a dependent variable, the outcome measure of memory may be crucial in determining the effectiveness of message strategies designed for health campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093650211427557">Lumpkins, 2007</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650211427557">Flora and Maibach (1990)</xref>, message design research has commonly focused on memory to ensure that there is an influence on health outcomes. That is, memory of information in breast cancer intervention messages will be one of the important indications of how message recipients process the message’s recommendations. Previous literature has shown that increased elaboration is associated with higher levels of retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650211427557">Fisher &amp; Craik, 1980</xref>). Based on the literature, it is expected that gender and frame type will interact in increasing memory in the same way as they interact in increasing BCS message elaboration. Therefore, the following hypotheses are proposed:</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 141 African Americans over age 30 participated in this online experiment. All participants were of African descent (African Americans) and had not been previously diagnosed with breast cancer. Once the data were collected, the time frames that participants spent on the experiment were checked to ensure that they spent a reasonable amount of time viewing the stimuli and answering the questions with no elapse of time. The data of 13 participants who spent too little or too much time on the system (i.e., less than 10 min or longer than 45 min) were excluded. As a result, a total of 128 valid responses were used for analysis—64 women and 64 men.</p>
<p>Participants were recruited from a predominately African American graduate student group and an African American undergraduate student group at a large Midwest university, predominately African American churches in a Midwest city, a State branch of the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People), and a local health fair and barber shops. The researcher left flyers with leaders of organizations and posted solicitation for the study in church bulletins as well as online communities for African American professionals. The convenience sample of participants were told that they would be participating in a study investigating African Americans’ responses to breast cancer interventions. They were informed that they would receive US$20 after completion of the online study.</p>
<p>Participants’ age ranged from 30 to 65. The mean age was 45.85 (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.10). The mean age of female participants was 43.78 (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.78), and the mean age of male participants was 47.92 (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.07). The majority of participants (89.8%) had at least some college school education; 39.1% had graduated from college, and 36.2% had advanced degrees (MA, PhD, MD, JD, etc.). As for household income, the majority of participants (64.8%) made US$50,000 and above. These statistics suggest a well-educated and relatively affluent sample.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0093650211427557">3</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section9-0093650211427557">
<title>Stimuli</title>
<p>Two video presentations about BCS were created. The thrust of the presentations was to persuade individuals of the importance of early detection through regular BCS. The 3-min videos contained a brief introduction, three video clips in which African American breast cancer survivors recommend BCS, and fact information regarding BCS and the intervention center.</p>
<p>To create systematic message variance between levels of treatments, multiple interview clips were selected. A pool of BCS advocacy video clips was constructed from the database of the NCI-sponsored project, <italic>The Story Telling Project. The Story Telling Project</italic> staff recorded the personal testimonials of 50 African American female breast cancer survivors, and then categorized all of the interviews, unitizing each feature of the interviews into distinct video clips and coding each clip according to several topics and story attribute variables. The current study utilized the database of interviews because previous research has shown that messages incorporating testimonials from breast cancer survivors are most effective in changing attitudes toward breast cancer prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211427557">Leshner et al., 2008</xref>). Specifically, this study examined the combined impact of a specific message attribute (i.e., loss vs. gain frame) and an individual factor (i.e., gender).</p>
<p>Possible messages for the current study were identified with the help of previous coding by a prior study that identified 60 possible messages from the NCI database of <italic>The Story Telling Project</italic>, and then pretested the messages with a group of students (<italic>n</italic> = 20) who rated each message on message categorization and emotional valence. The pretest was conducted to verify prior coding and to ensure the equal variance in emotional valence among interview clips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211427557">Leshner et al., 2008</xref>). Based on the pretest results, six interview clips were identified for use in this study: three for loss-framed and three for gain-framed condition. All video clips, ranged from 22 to 68 s with similar intensity of emotional valence, were nonnarrative interviews of individual women, shot by a single camera in medium close-up with no cuts, edits, or camera movement.</p>
<p>In this study, gain frame was defined as emphasizing the advantages and benefits of engaging in BCS, and loss frame was defined as emphasizing the disadvantages and costs of not engaging in BCS. Both the loss-framed and gain-framed presentations were approximately 3-min long, each composed of three interview clips and eight text shots. The texts addressed such issues as the detection procedure, the importance of early detection, and facts about BCS<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0093650211427557">4</xref></sup> and the intervention center (e.g., the website address of American Cancer Society). The factual information was identical across conditions because all participants would be asked the same questions measuring their memory of BCS messages. The importance of regular BCS was presented differently between gain and loss conditions based on previous framing literature. Loss-framed message addressed “The costs of failing to obtain BCS,” whereas gain-framed message addressed “The benefits of obtaining regular BCS.” Note 5 lists some exemplary gain- versus loss-framed statements from the interview clips of each condition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0093650211427557">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Experiment Procedure</title>
<p>The individuals who had agreed to participate in the study received an email from the researcher. The email included one of two different URL links randomly assigned to each participant. Once clicking on the link, the participants were asked to read a written consent form briefly describing the study. After the participants agreed to the consent form by clicking on the button, they were asked to answer a few preexposure questions (e.g., their involvement level in the issue of breast cancer). Then they watched a 3-min BCS intervention video. After watching the video, the participants answered a questionnaire. At the end of the questionnaire, the participants were asked to provide their postal addresses in order to receive their reward by mail.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section12-0093650211427557">
<title>Issue involvement</title>
<p>The definition of issue involvement in this study was based on personal relevance. That is, issue involvement refers to the perceived importance of the breast cancer issue. Since Zaichkowsky’s (1986, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0093650211427557">1994</xref>) definition of involvement focuses on personal relevance, this study measured the <italic>issue involvement</italic> variable, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0093650211427557">Zaichkowsky’s (1994)</xref> involvement scale. Participants’ involvement level in the issue of breast cancer was measured using a 7-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (<italic>Not at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>Very much</italic>), with six items: important, relevant, interesting, means a lot to me, valuable, and involving. After considering this study’s topic, breast cancer, three items from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0093650211427557">Zaichkowsky’s (1994)</xref> involvement inventory were dropped: exciting, fascinating, and appealing. The six-item index was reliable (α = .89).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0093650211427557">
<title>Personal background regarding breast cancer</title>
<p>Participants’ personal background regarding breast cancer was controlled in this study. The basic assumption of this study was that men and women would have different involvement levels in the issue of breast cancer. However, a male participant with a family member diagnosed with breast cancer would have higher involvement than other men who did not have such a background. Therefore, individuals were asked whether someone close to them had been affected by breast cancer before they watched the stimuli; 67.2% of the participants reported they were in a close relationship with a woman who was affected by breast cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0093650211427557">
<title>Perceived vulnerability</title>
<p>In this study, perceived vulnerability was defined as the belief that her or his close others are vulnerable and likely to be affected by breast cancer. Based on the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0093650211427557">Witte (1992)</xref>, perceived vulnerability was measured by asking participants to indicate the level of their agreement with two statements on a 7-point Likert-type scale: “It is possible that my close women (e.g., family, partner, friends) will develop breast cancer,” and “My close women (e.g., family, partner, friends) are at risk for breast cancer.” The spearman rho = .85 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0093650211427557">
<title>Message elaboration</title>
<p>Message elaboration is defined as the degree of mental effort used to process a given message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0093650211427557">Priester &amp; Petty, 2003</xref>). This study employed a traditional thought-listing technique based on Priester and Petty’s study. Participants were asked to list the thoughts that they had experienced while watching the video. Their responses in this thought-listing task were then coded as supportive thoughts, neutral thoughts, irrelevant thoughts, or refutative thoughts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093650211427557">Cameron, Jacks, &amp; O’Brien, 2002</xref>). As for the intercoder reliability, the percentage of agreement between two coders’ coding was 0.85. In testing Hypotheses 5 to 7, to reduce the possibility of extreme scores and wordiness distorting the findings, the <italic>number of supportive thoughts</italic> variable was used as a ratio in which the denominator is the number of thoughts listed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0093650211427557">
<title>Attitude toward BCS</title>
<p>Participants’ attitudes toward BCS were measured based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211427557">MacKenzie and Lutz’s (1989)</xref> scale, which is composed of three bipolar items: good-bad, favorable-unfavorable, and pleasant-unpleasant. Each item was measured on a 7-point scale (α = .76).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0093650211427557">
<title>Behavioral intentions regarding BCS</title>
<p>Participants’ behavioral intentions regarding BCS were measured using three categories: intentions to obtain BCS, intentions to recommend BCS to close women, and intentions to act regarding BCS campaign. Only the female participants were asked questions about the first dimension, whereas questions concerning the other two dimensions addressed both male and female participants. Male and female participants were asked to indicate the level of their agreement with six statements on a 7-point Likert-type scale: “I would recommend women in my life (e.g., family, partners, friends, etc.) to get regular breast cancer screening,” “I would encourage women in my life to think about breast cancer screening,” and “I would suggest women in my life visit a doctor to discuss breast cancer screening” (three items for <italic>intentions to recommend</italic>, α = .87). “I would participate in breast cancer screening campaigns if I have the opportunity in the future,” “I would suggest that my friends support breast cancer screening campaigns if they have the opportunity in the future,” and “I would seek out additional information about breast cancer screening” (three items for <italic>intentions to act</italic>, α = .80).</p>

<sec id="section18-0093650211427557">
<title>Memory</title>
<p>First, a visual recognition test was conducted using a picture recognition task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211427557">Macmillan &amp; Creelman, 1991</xref>). Each participant was exposed to a total of 10 pictures and was asked to indicate whether he or she recognized a picture from the video they just watched (i.e., choosing between “Yes” or “No”). Six pictures were from the actual stimuli (three from gain-framed interview clips; three from loss-framed interview clips), and four pictures were from other interview clips not adopted in this study. That is, for each participant, three pictures came from the video segments that he or she watched (from either gain-framed or loss-framed message), and the rest came from other interview clips, which were not included in his or her message. Recognition was assessed using signal detection scores calculated as A’ = .5 + [(y–x)(1 + y – x)] / [4y(1 – x)], where x is the probability of a false alarm (incorrect acceptance of a foil claim) and y is the probability of a hit (correct acceptance of a true claim<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0093650211427557">6</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093650211427557">Grier, 1971</xref>). These scores measure the discrimination ability uncontaminated by the response tendency of participants, and they are the recommended measures of ad recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093650211427557">Putrevu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0093650211427557">Singh &amp; Churchill, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, a content recognition test was conducted by asking participants to answer five multiple-choice questions about the content of the video clip (e.g., “Please select how many types of Breast Cancer Screening methods were mentioned in the video you just watched”). Each item added one point to the content recognition scores.</p>

<title>Manipulation check</title>
<p>The validity of the independent variable manipulation was checked by independent <italic>t</italic> tests. The manipulation of the frame type (gain vs. loss) was assessed by asking participants to rate the emphasis of the video clip with two items on a 7-point scale. The score for the first item ranged from “Costs of failing to obtain breast cancer screening” (–3) to “Benefits of obtaining breast cancer screening” (+3). The score for the second item ranged from “Negative outcomes of not obtaining breast cancer screening” (–3) to the “Positive outcomes of obtaining breast cancer screening” (+3). The <italic>t</italic>-test analyses revealed that there was a significant difference between the gain and the loss groups. For the first item, gain group (<italic>M</italic> = 2.68, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.94) versus loss group (<italic>M</italic> = 0.45, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.53), <italic>Mdiff</italic> = 2.23, <italic>t</italic>(126) = 6.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.

</sec>
<sec id="section23-0093650211427557">
<title>Control variable</title>
<p>As noted in the Method section, participants’ personal experience regarding breast cancer was measured to be controlled when assessing the effects of frame type and gender on responses to BCS messages. Participants were asked to identify whether someone close to them has been affected by breast cancer or not. Since this possible covariate was a categorical variable, it was added as another fixed factor along with the independent variables in a series of ANOVAs, which were used to test hypotheses. Because the current study was not interested in the possible interactions between this control variable and two other independent variables, the researcher selected a custom model and only included a main-effect term of the control variable for the following analyses used for testing the hypotheses.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0093650211427557">
<title>Tests of the Hypotheses</title>
<p>Hypothesis 1 proposed that participant’s gender would influence his or her involvement in the breast cancer issue. To test this, ANOVA was used with gender as an independent variable and breast cancer issue involvement as a dependent variable. The analyses indicated that gender had no main effect on involvement levels in the breast cancer issue, which suggests a ceiling effect. There was no significant effect of gender on issue involvement even after controlling for participants’ personal background regarding breast cancer. That is, there was no significant difference between male (<italic>M</italic> = 5.96, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.22) and female participants (<italic>M</italic> = 6.08, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.00) in their involvement levels in the breast cancer issue, <italic>F</italic>(1, 125) = 0.16, <italic>p</italic> = .69. Therefore, Hypothesis 1 was not supported.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 2 expected that female participants would have greater message elaboration than male participations. The ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference between men and women in their message elaboration as measured by the thought-listing task. That is, female participants (<italic>M</italic> = 2.47, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.34) listed more thoughts related to BCS right after watching the video than did male participants (<italic>M</italic> = 1.60, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.78), <italic>F</italic>(1, 123) = 6.89, <italic>p</italic> = .010, η<sup>2</sup><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>= .053.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3 expected the interaction between gender and frame type in increasing message elaboration. The ANOVA showed that there was a significant interaction between gender and frame type on message elaboration, supporting Hypothesis 3, <italic>F</italic>(2, 123) = 3.67, <italic>p</italic> = .028,η<sup>2</sup><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = .056. To examine the interaction more closely, the Bonferroni pairwise comparisons tests were conducted. The results indicated that among the female participants there was a significant mean difference between the gain-framed group and the loss-framed group in their elaboration levels. That is, women in the loss-framed group (<italic>M</italic> = 1.62, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.10) were more likely to have higher elaborations compared to women in the gain-framed group (<italic>M</italic> = 1.22, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.10), which supports Hypothesis 3a (<italic>Mdiff</italic> = 0.391, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.148, <italic>p</italic> = .009). In contrast, among male participants, there was no significant mean difference between the gain-framed group and the loss-framed group, which does not support Hypothesis 3b (<italic>Mdiff</italic> = 0.095, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.148, <italic>p</italic> = .519).</p>
<p>Hypothesis 4 proposed that participants’ BCS message elaboration would be positively associated with their supportive thoughts about BCS. In testing Hypothesis 4, a regression analysis was conducted with elaboration as an independent variable and the number of supportive thoughts as a dependent variable. The result showed that participants’ elaboration (<italic>M</italic> = 1.30, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.58) significantly increased their supportive thoughts regarding BCS (<italic>M</italic> = 0.78, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.58), <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = .263, <italic>F</italic>(1, 126) = 44.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, β = 0.52, <italic>t</italic> = 6.70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 5 expected the interaction between gender and frame type in increasing supportive thoughts about BCS. The ANOVA showed that there was a significant interaction between gender and frame type on the number of supportive thoughts about BCS, supporting Hypothesis 4, <italic>F</italic>(1, 116) = 5.09, <italic>p</italic> = .026,η<sup>2</sup><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = .044. To examine the interaction more closely, the Bonferroni pairwise comparisons tests were conducted. The results indicated that among female participants there was a significant mean difference between the gain-framed group and the loss-framed group in their elaboration levels. That is, women in the loss-framed group (<italic>M</italic> = 0.62, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.07) were more likely to have greater supportive thoughts about BCS compared to women in the gain-framed group (<italic>M</italic> = 0.32, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.07), which supports Hypothesis 5a (<italic>Mdiff</italic> = 0.306, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.101, <italic>p</italic> = .003). In contrast, among male participants, there was no significant mean difference between the gain-framed group and the loss-framed group, which fails to support Hypothesis 5b (<italic>Mdiff</italic> = 0.019, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.102, <italic>p</italic> = .853) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0093650211427557">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Hypothesis 6 proposed that participants’ supportive thoughts about BCS would be positively associated with their attitude toward BCS. In testing Hypothesis 6, a regression analysis was conducted with the number of supportive thoughts as an independent variable and attitudes toward BCS as a dependent variable. Participants’ gender, perceived vulnerability, and personal backgrounds regarding breast cancer were controlled. The results showed that there was no significant association between supportive thoughts and attitudes toward BCS (<italic>M</italic> = 6.33, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.02). Thus, Hypothesis 6 was not supported, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = .032, <italic>F</italic>(4, 116) = 0.94, <italic>p</italic> = .446; β = .15, <italic>t</italic> = 1.57, <italic>p</italic> = .120.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 7 expected that participants’ supportive thoughts about BCS would be positively associated with their behavioral intentions regarding BCS. In testing Hypothesis 7, a regression analysis was conducted with the number of supportive thoughts as an independent variable and behavioral intentions as a dependent variable. Participants’ gender, perceived vulnerability, and personal backgrounds regarding breast cancer were controlled. There were three types of behavioral intentions: intentions to obtain BCS (women only), intentions to recommend, and intentions to act. The result showed that there was no significant association between supportive thoughts and intentions to obtain BCS (<italic>M</italic> = 6.60, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.65), <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = .069, <italic>F</italic>(3, 58) = 1.36, <italic>p</italic> = .266; β = .16, <italic>t</italic> = 1.20, <italic>p</italic> = .237, or intentions to recommend BCS (<italic>M</italic> = 6.74, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.56), <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = .064, <italic>F</italic>(4, 116) = 1.92, <italic>p</italic> = .112; β = .081, <italic>t</italic> = 0.87, <italic>p</italic> = .386, which suggests a ceiling effect. On the other hand, there was a significant positive association between supportive thoughts and intentions to act. That is, the more supportive thoughts about BCS participants had, the more likely they intended to act regarding BCS (e.g., participating in BCS campaigns in future; <italic>M</italic> = 5.66, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.42), <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = .093, <italic>F</italic>(4, 116) = 2.86, <italic>p</italic> = .027; β = .18, <italic>t</italic> = 1.99, <italic>p</italic> = .048. Therefore, Hypothesis 7 was only partially supported.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 8 expected that participant’s gender will interact with frame type in breast cancer messages to increase their memory of the breast cancer message. In testing Hypothesis 8, a series of ANOVAs were conducted with gender and frame type as independent variables and two types of memory measures as dependent variables. First, the analyses showed that an interaction between gender and frame type did not reach statistical significance on visual recognition scores, <italic>F</italic>(1, 119) = 2.92, <italic>p</italic> = .090, η<sup>2</sup><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = .024. However, the ANOVA showed that there was a significant interaction between gender and frame type on content recognition scores, <italic>F</italic>(1, 124) = 6.07, <italic>p</italic> = .015, η<sup>2</sup><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = .047 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0093650211427557">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The Bonferroni pairwise comparisons tests indicated that men had greater content recognition scores when the breast cancer message was gain framed (<italic>M</italic> = 4.09, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.17) than when the message was loss framed (<italic>M</italic> = 3.63, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.17), supporting Hypothesis 8a (<italic>Mdiff</italic> = 0.469, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.24, <italic>p</italic> = .055).

<title>Post Hoc Analyses</title>
<p>Contrary to expectations, there was no significant difference between men and women in their self-reported issue involvement levels with breast cancer. Although the following analyses found that both men and women process BCS messages with different amounts of elaboration, it is still not clear in this study whether the self-reported issue involvement itself would influence the depth of message elaboration. To further investigate the possible effects of issue involvement on message elaboration, a regression analysis was conducted using issue involvement as an independent variable and message elaboration as a dependent variable. The regression analysis showed that there was no significant association between issue involvement and message elaboration, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = .010, <italic>F</italic>(1, 126) = 1.28, <italic>p</italic> = .26; β = .15, <italic>t</italic> = 1.13, <italic>p</italic> = .260. A multiple regression analysis was also conducted to check whether there was any interaction between issue involvement and frame type on message elaboration, <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = .033, <italic>F</italic>(3, 124) = 1.42, <italic>p</italic> = .240. The result indicated no significant interaction between issue involvement and frame type on message elaboration (β = .35, <italic>t</italic> = 0.63, <italic>p</italic> = .531). That is, the post hoc analyses showed that participants’ issue involvement measured by their self-report did not influence their BCS message elaboration in this study.</p>
<p>Next, in testing the main hypotheses, this study controlled for the effect of participants’ background on breast cancer awareness (i.e., whether their close women have been affected by breast cancer). Among the 128 participants of this study, 67.2% answered that they had close relationships with women affected by breast cancer. To further investigate the possible effects of such background, a post hoc analysis was conducted. The ANOVA found a significant interaction between such background and frame type on message elaboration, <italic>F</italic>(1, 124) = 7.21, <italic>p</italic> = .008,η<sup>2</sup><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = .055; however, there was no significant interaction between such background and gender on message elaboration, <italic>F</italic>(1, 124) = 3.45, <italic>p</italic> = .066,η<sup>2</sup><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = .027. That is, when it came to increasing their BCS message elaboration, loss frame (<italic>M</italic> = 2.66, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.05) was more likely to be effective for those with close relationships with women affected by breast cancer than gain frame was (<italic>M</italic> = 2.17, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.91). In contrast, gain frame (<italic>M</italic> = 2.05, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.17) was more likely to be effective for those without such a background than loss frame did (<italic>M</italic> = 1.40, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.99). The pattern of interaction between individual background and frame type was similar with the patterns found in the main analyses regarding gender and frame type and was consistent with prior framing literature. In sum, post hoc analyses of the data yielded some interesting findings such that the self-reported issue involvement itself did not influence participants’ message elaboration. On the other hand, the background regarding breast cancer was found to influence the degree of BCS message elaboration in an interplay with gain versus loss frame type.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This present study examined the effects of gain versus loss framing in BCS messages designed to facilitate interpersonal recommendations of BCS through both male and female audiences. Specifically, this study tested how framing effects would be moderated by the gender of message recipients. Based on prospect theory and framing literature, the key expectation was that loss frame would be more effective for women and that gain frame would be more effective for men. Although there was no significant difference between men and women in their self-report responses about breast cancer issue involvement (Hypothesis 1), the results did reveal that men and women processed breast cancer messages with different elaboration depths (Hypothesis 2). This study also examined how such gender differences in elaboration depth would lead men and women to perceive gain versus loss frame in BCS messages differently. The results found significant interactions between gender and frame type in the persuasiveness of BCS messages. That is, compared to the gain frame loss frame was more effective for women in increasing their message elaboration and supportive thoughts about BCS (Hypothesis 3 &amp; Hypothesis 5). On the other hand, when compared to loss frame, gain frame was more effective for men in increasing their memory of the BCS messages (Hypothesis 8). These findings were consistent with prior framing literature (i.e., loss framing would be more effective in promoting a <italic>detection</italic> behavior because people tend to be risk seeking when a problem is framed as a loss) as well as this study’s expectation that such framing effects would be evident for female participants only. The current study expected that the advantage of loss framing would not occur for men, who might not pay much attention to the framing cues. Rather, based on hedonic principle it was expected that men would focus on superficial aspects of the BCS messages and approach what is positive. The results partially supported this expectation. That is, gain framing was found to be more effective in increasing men’s memory of BCS messages compared to loss framing (Hypothesis 8).</p>
<sec id="section27-0093650211427557">
<title>Theoretical Implications</title>
<p>From a theoretical point of view, the current study validated and advanced the gain versus loss framing literature in the context of breast cancer interventions. Prior framing studies have suggested that loss framing would be more effective in BCS messages than gain framing because BCS is a detection behavior and not a prevention behavior. The question posed in the present study, however, was whether loss framing for BCS messages would actually influence male audiences too. The key expectation of this study was that loss frame would be more effective for women but not for men. This expectation was based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211427557">Maheswaran and Meyers-Levy’s (1990)</xref> arguments that loss framing would be more effective than gain framing only for those who process the message systematically. The results supported this expectation. That is, the advantage of loss framing was only found for women whose elaboration level was deeper than men’s. As for men whose elaboration level was relatively shallower than women’s, this study found some limited but significant advantage with gain framing.</p>
<p>As discussed in the literature review, there have been apparent conflicts between the two lines of research regarding the framing effects for heuristic processors. One line of researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093650211427557">Rothman et al., 2006</xref>) argued that the framing effects would simply <italic>not</italic> occur for heuristic processors (i.e., null effect), whereas another line of researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211427557">Maheswaran &amp; Meyers-Levy, 1990</xref>, 2004) argued that loss framing would be more effective for systematic processors and that gain framing would be more effective for heuristic processors. The findings of the current study supported the latter. That is, this study found that gain framing tended to increase men’s memory of BCS messages compared to loss framing. This finding adds empirical evidence to this controversial area in the framing literature.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it should be noted that the advantage of gain framing for men was not found for message elaboration but for content recognition only. This is an interesting finding given the fact that previous research suggests that the degree of elaboration is associated with memory outcomes. One possible explanation is that the advantage of gain framing in increasing men’s memory was not due to men’s deeper processing of gain messages but due to their tendency to approach <italic>superficial aspects</italic> of gain messages and avoiding loss messages. This is in line with the argument of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211427557">Meyers-Levy and Maheswaran (2004)</xref>, that heuristic processors tend to approach what is positive but avoid what is negative based on hedonic principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093650211427557">Higgins, 1997</xref>). In the present study, male participants might approach gain-framed messages enough for content recognition but not to the extent of increasing the message elaboration depth as measured by thought listing. In a recognition test, participants would not need to retrieve cues related to the BCS messages because multiple choices were explicitly presented and participants were required only to discriminate among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093650211427557">Lee &amp; Lee, 2011</xref>). Therefore, male participants might be able to better recognize the contents of gain-framed messages via simple encoding, even though their elaboration levels were not significantly enhanced to the extent of facilitating retrieval. Another possible explanation is that the advantage of gain framing for heuristic processors may not be as strong as the advantage of loss framing for systematic processors. That is, for heuristic processors, gain framing may be only one of the peripheral cues that influence their message processing. Besides framing, there could be many other message/situational factors that influence the message effects for heuristic processors. Such possible, but limited, impacts of gain framing might be the reason why the conflicting arguments and mixed evidence have existed between the two lines of research on framing. The findings of the present study could provide a preliminary milestone to build a bridge between those two conflicting literatures. Future research should explore other factors that possibly moderate the advantage of gain framing for heuristic processors. Also, examining the advantage of gain versus loss framing for systematic processors in promoting <italic>prevention</italic> behaviors (compared to <italic>detection</italic> behaviors assessed in the present study) would be another step needed to untangle the conflicts between various past research works on framing.</p>
<p>The present study also extended the framing literature by broadening the scope of <italic>risk perception</italic>, which is a critical concept in gain versus loss framing research. It is possible then that the original prospect theory examined individuals’ decision making with regard to a certain behavior that involved the target audience’s own risk. The current study advanced the literature a step further by demonstrating that the differential effects of gain versus loss framing could emerge not only among a target audience but also among a nontarget audience. In this study, male participants were found to process gain- versus loss-framed BCS messages differently, suggesting the role of <italic>indirect</italic> risk perceptions. That is, although male participants might not have the direct risk perceptions regarding breast cancer, the possibility that their close women may get diagnosed with breast cancer could lead them to have another type of risk perceptions (e.g., loss of loved ones). This is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093650211427557">Kühberger’s (1998)</xref> argument that the prospect of risk in framing research is often not specifiable. The current finding suggests that a risky option (e.g., breast cancer screening) in gain versus loss framing research may induce not only direct risk perceptions from a target audience but also indirect risk perceptions from a nontarget audience. Future research should further investigate differences in the quality of risk perceptions between various gain- and loss-framed messages. Also, considering the important role that nontarget population plays in health prevention efforts, further exploration of the framing effects for different audiences with regard to their risk perceptions also might be warranted.</p>

<sec id="section28-0093650211427557">
<title>Practical Implications</title>
<p>The current study provided a few practical implications for practitioners who attempt to develop effective health communication messages. First of all, this study showed a great potential for male population in promoting breast cancer awareness, prevention, and treatment for women they are close to. Most breast cancer research and campaigns have typically involved middle-aged female participants only. However, in the current study, the majority of male participants indicated that the breast cancer issue was important for them (<italic>M</italic> = 6.25 in the 7-point scale, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.12) and, after watching the BCS promotion video, the majority of them indicated fairly high intentions to recommend BCS to the women in their lives (<italic>M</italic> = 6.82 in the 7-point scale, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.40). This finding validates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0093650211427557">Sporer’s (2007)</xref> argument that the breast cancer campaign should motivate both men and women to encourage the women in their lives to obtain regular BCS. Practitioners should, therefore, consider the important role that men play in improving the breast cancer intervention rate among women.</p>
<p>Next, this study of gender difference in processing gain- versus loss-framed health messages demonstrated that health communication practitioners should strategically use gain versus loss framing to achieve their communication goals. Practitioners need to develop message framing in accordance with their target population, considering the disease characteristics and the public sectors’ possible elaboration of the disease intervention messages. Specifically in the context of BCS campaigns, practitioners may need to utilize loss framing for female participants and gain framing for male participants.</p>
<p>Finally, the current study unexpectedly revealed another key moderating factor for framing effects: whether an individual has a close relationship with someone affected by a certain health problem. When it came to increasing their BCS message elaboration, the post hoc analyses found that loss framing was likely to be more effective than gain framing for those with close relationships with women affected by breast cancer. On the other hand, for those without such a background, gain framing was more likely to be effective than loss framing, which was consistent with the prior framing literature. The current study did not further discuss the role of personal background in influencing the message-framing effects. Nevertheless, it still suggests that practitioners might need to consider people who have vicarious experiences regarding certain health problems as a key audience for health intervention campaigns. In the present study, people with such a background were found to pay more attention to the BCS messages. Practitioners also need to consider that in order to persuade those individuals to actively participate in BCS campaigns loss framing would be more effective than gain framing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0093650211427557">
<title>Limitations and Future Study</title>
<p>There are a few limitations that need to be addressed regarding the present study. First, it should be noted that the participants of this study were more educated and affluent compared to African American population in general. This volunteer sample was also limited in the sense that the study had the potential to recruit male participants who were already highly involved with the breast cancer issue. For instance, since African American participants were told that they would be participating in a study investigating African Americans’ responses to breast cancer interventions, individuals who were already interested in breast cancer issues might have been more likely to agree to participate in the study. This might cause some sampling bias. This assumption is based on the fact that among the 128 participants of this study, more than 65% had close relationships with women affected by breast cancer. That is, individuals who had families or friends affected by breast cancer might be more conscious of the issue, and therefore, more willing to participate in the study. This biased sample produced some unexpected but interesting findings such as the interaction between such a background and the frame type. As a consequence, the sample was limited when it came down to testing the main expectation of this study: Men would be less involved in breast cancer issue than women. This could explain why this study failed to reveal the significant mean difference between men and women in their level of involvement with breast cancer issue (Hypothesis 1 not supported) and why the study ended up with some ceiling effects when measuring participants’ attitudes toward BCS. To further investigate the relationship between frame type and issue involvement among the general population, future studies might need to adopt random sampling of the population to eliminate this sampling issue.</p>
<p>Second, in relation to the point above, the data failed to support the primary expectation of this study that men and women would have different involvement levels in breast cancer issues. However, it is noteworthy that the post hoc analyses found the issue involvement as measured by self-report did not influence participants’ BCS message elaboration. One possibility for this might be related to the sampling bias. Another possibility could be the demand characteristics. The participants knew that the study would be about breast cancer intervention, and thus, when they were asked initially whether the breast cancer issue was important to them, they might have felt they were expected to be interested in the issue. The high mean value of issue involvement gives weight to this presumption (<italic>M</italic> = 6.03, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.12). One other possibility is that the issue involvement should have been conceptualized and measured as a multidimensional concept rather than a unidimensional one as used in the present study. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093650211427557">Marshall, Reinhart, Freely, Tutzauer, and Anker (2008)</xref> recently argued that in the context of health communication issue involvement should be conceptualized as a three-dimensional construct: value-, outcome-, and impression-relevant involvement. Value-relevant involvement is “the psychological state that is created by the activation of attitudes that are linked to important values” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211427557">Johnson &amp; Eagly, 1989</xref>, p. 291), impression-relevant involvement is the “concern with holding an opinion that is socially acceptable” (p. 291), and outcome-relevant involvement is “the relevance of an issue to their currently important goals or outcomes” (p. 292; for a more detailed review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093650211427557">Marshal et al., 2008</xref>). Marshall et al. measured these three dimensions of involvement across six health behaviors and found evidence of the three-factor structure conceptualized by Johnson and Eagly and measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650211427557">Cho and Boster (2005)</xref>. Future research on framing and involvement in health communication might need to employ this multidimensional perspective to issue involvement rather than using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0093650211427557">Zaichkowsky’s (1994)</xref> unidimensional scale, which was employed in this current study. It would be a worthy goal to examine which of these subdimension(s) of involvement would be related to men’s and women’s response to breast cancer interventions and how the subdimension(s) would moderate the effects of gain versus loss framing.</p>
<p>Third, this study employed two types of memory measures in examining the effects of gender and frame type on participants’ memory: visual recognition and content recognition. It is interesting that each of these two memory measures produced different results. Results showed a significant interaction between gender and frame type on content recognition scores but not on visual recognition scores. The conflicting result between visual versus content recognition scores might be due to the fact that visual information was easier to process than auditory information, as evidenced in prior literature (e.g., Basil, 1994; Grimes, 1991; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211427557">Lang, 1995</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093650211427557">Lang, Potter, and Bolls (1999)</xref> claimed that people encode visual information automatically while having to rely on the controlled allocation of cognitive resources to encode the auditory information. In this current study, visual recognition was not affected by the interaction between gender and frame type, suggesting that the visual information was encoded automatically and, in turn, resulted in ceiling effects in which scores are predominantly high. The relatively high percentage in the accuracy scores of visual recognition gives weight to this presumption (for women, <italic>M</italic> = 88.72%, <italic>SD</italic> = 15.01; for men, <italic>M</italic> = 85.07%, <italic>SD</italic> = 19.62).</p>
<p>Fourth, another area for future study is to further investigate the validity of attitude measures. This study found inconsistent results between a self-report scale and a thought-listing task for attitudes toward BCS. That is, results revealed a significant mean difference between the number of men and women having supportive thoughts, an item measured with the thought-listing task, but not in attitudes toward BCS as measured by a bipolar scale composed of three items that range from “favorable” to “unfavorable” on a 7-point scale. Admittedly, for measuring attitudes toward socially desirable behaviors, self-report scales and thought-listing tasks may both produce demand characteristics that cause participants to suppress negative views. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0093650211427557">Watt, Maio, Rees, and Hewstone (2007)</xref> argue that thought-listing measures are relatively better than close-ended self-report scales at reducing such pressure. The different results from these two measures in this current study add more weight to Watt and colleagues’ argument. Thus, future research should consider this methodological issue regarding open-ended versus close-ended measures and further examine the validity of these measures in the field of health communication.</p>
<p>Fifth, this study examined the responses of African American adults to the BCS messages featured by African American breast cancer survivors. This study was conducted based on the essential proposition that for basic human information processes the effects of independent variables are universal. The current study addressed a fundamental communication question, and the dependant variables were likely to be universal factors that permit generalizations to the general population. In this sense, this study constitutes an important preliminary step in furthering the fundamental knowledge of the role that framing plays in influencing people’s responses to health messages. The findings from the current study should serve as a foundation or pioneering effort to be tested with other types of participants (e.g., different ethnic groups, cultures, age groups, etc.).</p>
<p>Last, it should be acknowledged that this study employed only BCS messages, which limits the generalizability of its findings. Although this study used multiple interview clips (i.e., three interview clips for each condition) to create systematic message variance between conditions, the interview clips were grouped together to create a single video presentation for either gain or loss condition. Thus, the observed differences between gain and loss condition are limited with regard to message generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211427557">O’Keefe, Craig, Tracy, &amp; Aakhus, 2008</xref>). More health communication contexts involving various health issues should be examined with multiple message experiments to extend our findings about framing and gender/involvement to other health communication contexts. Also, this study employed BCS messages sponsored by a nonprofit organization (i.e., American Cancer Society). Future research should adopt other types of organizations as possible sponsors. For example, government-owned organizations such as the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), corporate organizations sponsoring a BCS campaign as part of its CSR (corporate social responsibility) efforts, or religious organizations such as local churches, which are well-known as an integral part of the lifestyle of many African Americans. Different types of sponsoring organizations might influence the recipients’ credibility perception and elaboration depth, which in turn could affect their responses to gain versus loss framing.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093650211427557">Kühberger (1998)</xref> provided empirical evidence to support this perspective of prospect theory by conducting a meta-analysis of framing effects in a variety of disciplines. The result of this meta-analysis of 136 empirical studies (experiments with about 30,000 total participants) shows that the overall framing effect between gain and loss conditions is of small to moderate size, concluding that framing is a reliable phenomenon; the results also reported a tendency of risk aversion for positively framed problems and a tendency of risk-seeking for negatively framed problems.</p></fn>

<p>According to the 2009 American Community Survey (ACS), particularly in the state in which this study was conducted, 15.2% of the African American population had bachelor’s degree or a higher educational qualification. Also, the median household income was US$29,143 for African Americans residing in the given state in 2009 (Retrieved from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/">http://www.census.gov/acs/www/</ext-link>).</p></fn>

<p>This study was conducted in March 2010, a few months after the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released new guidelines regarding BCS, which state that women aged between 40 and 49 years do not need to obtain <italic>routine</italic> mammogram unless they are at high risk and that doctors should not teach breast self-examination (BSE). The USPSTF guideline was inconsistent with that of other organizations’ in this regard, such as Center for Disease Control (CDC), American Medical Association (AMA), and American Cancer Society (ACS), at that time. As a result, the guideline sparked much controversy and confusion regarding early detection of breast cancer. To control possible confounding factors from that controversy, this current study focuses on the general importance of BCS (e.g., “Encourage women in your life to think about BCS”; “Visit a doctor to discuss possible screening methods”). Also, at the end of experiment, participants were asked whether they had heard about the new guidelines from USPSTF. To this, 57.8% of participants answered they had heard about it before, but, in regard to the dependent variables in this study, there was no significant difference between the exposed group and the nonexposed group. The controversy over BCS recommendations has yet to be resolved, nor have health organizations reached a general consensus. Future research might need to investigate how such a controversy would influence the public’s attitudes and behavioral intentions regarding BCS as well as their responses to breast cancer intervention messages.</p></fn>
