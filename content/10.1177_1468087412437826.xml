<abstract>
<p>In order to extend the operational range with a gasoline fueled multi-cylinder homogeneous charge compression ignition engine, a blowdown supercharge system and an exhaust gas recirculation guide was developed. The concept was to provide a large amount of diluted mixture and a strong in-cylinder thermal stratification for decreasing nitrogen oxide emissions and pressure rise rate during high-load homogeneous charge compression ignition operation. Secondary air injection was also proposed to reduce a cylinder-to-cylinder variation in ignition timing, which is one of the limiting factors of multi-cylinder homogeneous charge compression ignition operation. In advance of experimental works, the blowdown supercharge system and the exhaust gas recirculation guide were proved to be effective to reduce pressure rise rate for high-load operation using three-dimensional in-cylinder flow simulations and zero-dimensional multi-zone simulations with detailed chemical kinetics. Based on the simulation results, experiments were conducted using a slightly modified production four-cylinder gasoline engine. At first, the effects of the proposed techniques were experimentally investigated by focusing on one cylinder out of four. Then, a four-cylinder homogeneous charge compression ignition operation test using the new techniques was carried out. The one-cylinder measurements revealed that the blowdown supercharge system with an exhaust gas recirculation guide is capable of extending the homogeneous charge compression ignition operating range up to a net indicated mean effective pressure of 590 kPa for naturally aspirated conditions. In addition, secondary air injection was experimentally demonstrated as a technique for reducing a cylinder-to-cylinder variation in ignition timing. Reducing the cylinder-to-cylinder variation in ignition timing, four-cylinder homogeneous charge compression ignition operation with a net indicated mean effective pressure of 570 kPa was successfully achieved with the blowdown supercharge system and the exhaust gas recirculation guide.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines are based on a highly efficient and low nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) emission engine operating strategy. However, to apply HCCI operation to a production engine, several issues need to be addressed. The main issues of operating an engine in HCCI mode are the limited operational load range achievable and the difficulty in controlling ignition timing.</p>
<p>In order to achieve HCCI combustion using gasoline fuel, the in-cylinder temperature has to be increased to realize autoignition of the lean and diluted mixtures. Various techniques, such as intake air heating, variable compression ratio and a large amount of hot exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), have been demonstrated to obtain a high enough temperature to achieve autoignition at the appropriate timing. In recent studies, hot EGR gas obtained by using variable valve actuation has been widely used to control HCCI combustion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087412437826">1</xref></sup> One of the most common methods to obtain a large amount of EGR gas is the negative valve overlap (NVO) method in which the burned gas trapped inside the cylinder is retained. Although the presented results are limited, the so-called rebreathing method, in which the exhaust gas is directly recharged from the exhaust manifold by reopening the exhaust valve during the intake stroke, is also a well-known technique.</p>
<p>Using a large amount of EGR gas to increase the in-cylinder mixture temperature decreases the amount of intake air, and the amount of diluted gas (consisting of air and EGR gas) also decreases because of the higher in-cylinder temperature. Due to a lack of the dilution gas, the in-cylinder pressure rise rate (d<italic>P</italic>/dθ) and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions increase with increasing load. At low-load conditions, combustion stability and combustion efficiency decrease, and CO and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions increase due to the decreases in fuel concentration and EGR gas temperature. As a result, HCCI operation is achieved only for a limited range of operating conditions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087412437826">Figure 1</xref> shows the HCCI operating range achieved with the NVO method and the operation area used under the Japanese 10-15 driving mode test cycle, which covers a typical urban driving pattern with a typical production vehicle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087412437826">2</xref></sup> The vertical axis is gross indicated mean effective pressure (gross IMEP) and the horizontal axis is engine speed. It can be seen that the upper load limit of the HCCI operation using an engine with a compression ratio of 11.5 is about 400 kPa in gross IMEP at 1500 r/min. Similarly, Hiraya et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468087412437826">3</xref></sup> showed the upper load limit of HCCI operation using the NVO method was an IMEP of 430 kPa. Fuerhapter et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468087412437826">4</xref></sup> showed that the upper load limit using a rebreathing strategy was an IMEP of 470 kPa (gross or net IMEP is not specified in Hiraya et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468087412437826">3</xref></sup> or Fuerhapter et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468087412437826">4</xref></sup>) In all cases, the HCCI operating range attained is much lower than that required in practical usage. Today, HCCI operation is seen as a part-load operation strategy, and switching to conventional spark-ignition (SI) operation at low and high loads is necessary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468087412437826">5</xref></sup> However, this dual mode operation reduces the advantage in fuel consumption of HCCI operation. Then, even though such a dual mode operation is used, extending the HCCI operating range and reducing the frequency of the combustion mode switching are important to promote HCCI combustion in practical usage.</p>

<p>The upper load limit of gasoline HCCI combustion using a conventional approach is generally below a gross IMEP of 400 kPa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087412437826">2</xref></sup> This limit is dependent on the maximum value of d<italic>P</italic>/d<italic>θ</italic>; that is, the knock intensity allowable for normal engine operation and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, both of which are mainly governed by a steep heat-release rate and increase in in-cylinder gas temperature during combustion determined by the mass ratio of in-cylinder working gas to supplied fuel (<italic>G/F</italic>). Hiraya et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468087412437826">3</xref></sup> pointed out that the <italic>G/F</italic> ratio required for the HCCI operation with an acceptable level of d<italic>P</italic>/dθ and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions is more than 30. Therefore, providing a large amount of working gas in the cylinder is important to realize high-load HCCI operation without increasing d<italic>P</italic>/dθ and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. Supercharging is widely used to extend the upper load limit. Hyvönen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087412437826">6</xref></sup> demonstrated HCCI operation at a brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) of 1000 kPa using a turbocharger. However, it must be noted that the maximum in-cylinder pressure rise rate (d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub>) was 1850 kPa/° in Hyvönen et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087412437826">6</xref></sup> which is beyond the acceptable level. Urata et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087412437826">2</xref></sup> showed that the upper load limit defined by knocking was extended up to a gross IMEP of 650 kPa without an increase in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions by using a supercharger with the NVO strategy. Furthermore, supercharged gasoline HCCI operation at a gross IMEP of 1.6 MPa was attained by Dec and Yang.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468087412437826">7</xref></sup> However, when using a mechanical supercharger, brake thermal efficiency deteriorates and maximum BMEP decreases due to the high mechanical loss of superchargers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087412437826">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087412437826">8</xref></sup> In addition, a turbocharger would not be effective for HCCI operation because providing effective intake boost pressure using a turbocharger is difficult due to the low exhaust energy of HCCI combustion. Takanashi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087412437826">9</xref></sup> developed an inter-cylinder EGR boost (ICEB) system to obtain a large amount of dilution gas without an external supercharger. The upper load limit, defined by d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> of 400 kPa/°, was extended up to a gross IMEP of 600 kPa using the ICEB system. However, this system is difficult to apply to a production engine because the fully variable valve actuation with a large degree of freedom and the special exhaust system used in this system require complex construction in the hardware and controlling system.</p>
<p>For reducing d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> to extend the upper load limit, stratified distributions of fuel concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087412437826">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087412437826"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468087412437826">12</xref></sup> and temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468087412437826">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468087412437826"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468087412437826"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468087412437826"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468087412437826"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468087412437826"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468087412437826"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468087412437826">20</xref></sup> have been widely examined. Direct fuel injection has been applied to provide in-cylinder fuel stratification. Sjöberg and Dec<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087412437826">10</xref></sup> experimentally and numerically investigated the effect of fuel stratification on d<italic>P</italic>/dθ using several kinds of fuels that had different research octane numbers (RON). The results showed that partial fuel stratification was effective, with the fuel exhibiting some amount of heat release by low-temperature oxidation; however, partial fuel stratification is unlikely to be effective with fuel with little heat release by low-temperature oxidation, such as regular gasoline, because of low sensitivity of ignition timing to equivalence ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087412437826">11</xref></sup> Aroonsrisopon et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468087412437826">12</xref></sup> also showed that the engine performance, in terms of exhaust emissions and d<italic>P</italic>/dθ was not improved by fuel stratification for high-load conditions using the fuel with a 91.8 RON. Urata et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087412437826">2</xref></sup> applied direct fuel injection during the late stage of the compression stroke for retarding ignition timing and reducing d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> for high-load operation. The combustion timing was retarded and the upper load limit, as defined by knocking, was successfully extended. However, NO<sub>x</sub> emissions largely increased due to slightly stratified fuel concentration.</p>
<p>In-cylinder thermal stratification has been shown to possibly reduce d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> and to extend the upper load limit of HCCI operation. Sjöberg and Dec<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468087412437826">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468087412437826"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468087412437826"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468087412437826">16</xref></sup> investigated the effect of in-cylinder thermal stratification, mainly generated by heat transfer between the cylinder wall and the in-cylinder mixture, on d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> by experimental and numerical methods. The potential of the in-cylinder thermal stratification for reducing d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> was quantitatively demonstrated using a multi-zone chemical kinetics model. Multi-zone analysis revealed that by providing a wider temperature distribution of the core of the in-cylinder mixture, the combustion duration was prolonged and the pressure rise rate decreased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468087412437826">14</xref></sup> It was also experimentally revealed that thermal stratification within the bulk gas controls d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> and that the temperature distribution generated by heat transfer to the cylinder wall plays a smaller role in reducing d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468087412437826">16</xref></sup> It is considered that to generate a large thermal stratification within the bulk gas zone, techniques to reduce mixing between the relatively low-temperature intake mixture and the hot EGR gas are required. However, insufficient mixing between the fresh air–fuel mixture and EGR gas provides a spatial distribution of in-cylinder mixture composition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468087412437826">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468087412437826">18</xref></sup> Krasselt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468087412437826">19</xref></sup> and Herold et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468087412437826">20</xref></sup> investigated the effect of in-cylinder stratifications of temperature, fuel concentration, air–fuel mass ratio (<italic>A/F</italic>) and specific heat ratio on d<italic>P</italic>/dθusing a single-cylinder engine and an optical engine. The results revealed that the effect of the stratification of in-cylinder mixture temperature on d<italic>P</italic>/dθ could be canceled out by the competing effect of the distributions of fuel concentration and <italic>A/F</italic>. From these results, it is suggested that in-cylinder stratification should not be introduced into a production engine because the magnitude of stratification maintained until combustion commences is quite limited and the temperature stratification is accompanied by distributions of fuel concentration and <italic>A/F</italic>. By contrast, the simulation results carried out by Babajimopoulos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468087412437826">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468087412437826">18</xref></sup> using three-dimensional (3D) simulations of in-cylinder flow and multi-zone chemical kinetics showed that, even though the distribution of equivalence ratio has a competing effect against the effect of temperature distribution on ignition, the temperature distribution is still the dominant factor that determines ignition timing.</p>
<p>The new combustion concept, the so-called spark-ignition–compression-ignition (SI–CI) combustion combined with flame propagation and autoignition has been proposed as a technique to obtain a wide operating range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468087412437826">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468087412437826"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468087412437826">23</xref></sup> In this technique, SI combustion of the slightly stratified mixture is followed by autoignition of a homogeneous lean mixture. Since SI combustion is used as a trigger for the lean mixture’s autoignition, relatively low in-cylinder temperature is allowed to attain autoignition, and high volumetric efficiency of the intake mixture can be achieved. As a result, the upper load limit defined by knocking was extended up to an IMEP of 650 kPa (gross or net IMEP is not specified).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468087412437826">21</xref></sup> However, an increase in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions due to SI combustion is an issue to be solved. Yun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468087412437826">23</xref></sup> also demonstrated high-load SI–CI operation at a net IMEP of 650 kPa. A stoichiometric mixture was used to utilize a three-way catalyst for reduction in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. However, some of the attractive advantages of HCCI operation, such as extremely low NO<sub>x</sub> emissions and high thermal efficiency due to lean mixture combustion, were sacrificed in this approach.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a cylinder-to-cylinder variation in combustion timing is also one of the limiting factors of the HCCI operating range for a multi-cylinder engine. In the four-cylinder HCCI test conducted by Flowers et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468087412437826">24</xref></sup> there was significant cylinder-to-cylinder variation in combustion timing, and the difference in combustion timing between cylinders increased with combustion timing retard. It is concluded that reducing the phase difference in combustion timing between the cylinders is necessary to achieve a higher BMEP. The benefit of reduction in the cylinder variation in combustion timing can be seen in Yun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468087412437826">25</xref></sup> A closed-loop control system, which controls the fuel injection duration and SI timing of each cylinder and the amount of external EGR gas, was developed to reduce the cylinder-to-cylinder variation in ignition timing of an SI–CI engine. It was found that the cylinder variation in air–fuel ratio significantly affected the cylinder variation in ignition timing. It was also shown that combustion phasing control could decrease the average ringing intensity, which is an indicator of the combustion noise associated with d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> without decreasing combustion stability by providing stable retarded combustion.</p>
<p>Overall, to extend the upper load limit of HCCI operation, a technique capable of obtaining a large amount of in-cylinder mixture would be necessary. In addition, providing a strong thermal stratification within the bulk gas zone would have significant potential for allowing much higher load HCCI operation by decreasing d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub>. However, a practical method to provide a large in-cylinder thermal stratification has not yet been proposed. Additionally, reducing the cylinder-to-cylinder variation in combustion timing is also necessary to extend the operating range of multi-cylinder HCCI operation.</p>
<p>The objective of this study is to develop a practical technique to achieve multi-cylinder HCCI with a wide operating range. Experimental and numerical work was conducted, focusing on the extension of the high-load HCCI operating limit. A blowdown supercharge (BDSC) system and an EGR guide, which provide a large amount of intake air and EGR gas and a strong in-cylinder thermal stratification, were newly proposed and demonstrated. In advance of the experimental work, the effect of in-cylinder distributions of temperature and fuel concentration provided by the BDSC system and the EGR guide on d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> was numerically investigated. Based on the simulation results, the effect of the proposed system on the high-load HCCI operating limit was experimentally examined using a slightly modified production gasoline engine. Additionally, the effects of a direct fuel injection and a cooling water temperature on the HCCI operating range were also investigated. Moreover, a practical technique that can control combustion timing was proposed and applied to reduce the cylinder-to-cylinder variation in ignition timing, which is one of the limiting factors of the operating range of the multi-cylinder HCCI engines.</p>

<title>The BDSC system</title>
<p>Using a conventional approach, the upper load limit of gasoline HCCI combustion is generally below an IMEP of 400 kPa.<sup>2</sup> This limit is dependent on the maximum value of d<italic>P</italic>/dθ; that is, the knock intensity allowable for normal engine operation and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, both of which are governed by combustion temperature and steep heat-release rates.</p>
<p>The concept of the BDSC system is to obtain a large amount of diluted mixture without an external supercharger. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087412437826">Figure 2(a)</xref> shows the idea of a four-cylinder BDSC system. This system has a 4–2–1 exhaust system, which is common for high-performance production engines. The exhaust system is divided into two groups of cylinders: 1 and 4, and 2 and 3. This configuration provides blowdown pulse separation for each pair of cylinders with 360° phase difference. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087412437826">Figure 2(b)</xref> shows an example of the valve timing used in the BDSC system. In the early stage of the compression stroke for cylinder 4, the exhaust valve of cylinder 1 opens, and the exhaust blowdown pressure wave from cylinder 1 causes an increased pressure in the exhaust system. When the exhaust valve of cylinder 4 opens again at this timing, some of the exhaust gas is recharged into cylinder 4 through the exhaust port by the high exhaust pressure wave propagated from cylinder 1.</p>

<p>The BDSC system allows the induction of a large amount of intake air–fuel mixture into the cylinder, since EGR gas is supercharged into the cylinder just after the end of the intake stroke, with no effect of volumetric efficiency. This allows an increased fuel supply. Furthermore, the total mass of in-cylinder diluted mixture increases because the EGR gas returns into the cylinder at high pressure. A large amount of diluted mixture avoids an increase in d<italic>P</italic>/dθ as well as an increase in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions due to relatively slow heat release and low combustion temperature.</p>

The EGR guide consists of half-circular rings attached on the edge of the exhaust ports and the piston head with a protuberant surface.

<p>The valve timings used in the BDSC system are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468087412437826">Figure 4</xref>. The exhaust valve timing was fixed, while intake and EGR valve timings were varied according to the target load. With increasing target load, intake valve closing timing retards and EGR valve opening timing advances. The intake valve lift is increased and the EGR valve lift is increased simultaneously when the target load is increased. The valve timings were varied by changing a pair of intake and exhaust valve camshafts. Three pairs of intake and exhaust valve camshafts were used for different target loads. The valve timings for each target load were numerically optimized for obtaining suitable in-cylinder temperature and fuel concentration, both of which allow lower fuel consumption, lower maximum in-cylinder temperature to avoid NO<sub>x</sub> production and sufficiently high in-cylinder temperature to allow suitable ignition timing. The optimization was carried out using a commercially available one-dimensional (1D) simulation code, GT-POWER, and an optimizer software, mode-FRONTIER.

<p>In the base engine, a variable valve timing and lift electronic control (VTEC) system was originally installed in the exhaust valve train. The exhaust VTEC was used to control EGR valve lift actuation to switch the operating mode between HCCI and SI, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468087412437826">Figure 6</xref>. In the experiment, the engine was operated with SI mode without the EGR valve lift for warming up the engine components. After the warming-up run, the EGR valve lift was activated by exhaust VTEC to switch the engine operation mode from SI to HCCI. The exhaust manifold of the test engine was newly designed for the BDSC system based on 1D simulation results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468087412437826">26</xref></sup> To obtain a large exhaust blowdown pressure pulse, the diameter of the manifold was decreased from φ38 mm to φ30 mm, and the joint angle between the two exhaust pipes (θ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087412437826">Figure 2</xref>) was changed to 180°. The compression ratio of the test engine was increased by changing the piston head geometry. The piston head, which had the EGR guide wall, was newly designed. For practical usage, HCCI operation would be used partially, switching to and from conventional SI operation, because the whole operation range in terms of load and speed is difficult to be covered with only the HCCI operation. Therefore, the compression ratio could not be increased so much. The piston head was designed with a target compression ratio of 12.0. The measured compression ratio was 11.4 for the piston head without the EGR guide, and 11.6 for that with the EGR guide, respectively.</p>

<title>Effect of EGR guide geometry on in-cylinder thermal stratification</title>
<p>At first, the effect of EGR guide geometry on in-cylinder temperature distribution was numerically investigated to find an optimized geometry of the EGR guide. The simulated geometries are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412437826">Figure 9</xref>. The location of the EGR guide was examined. In Case 1, the EGR guide geometry was designed to utilize in-cylinder tumble flow as a means to enhance thermal stratification. In Case 2, the geometry was designed to guide the flow direction of the recharging EGR gas towards the cylinder wall for reducing mixing between EGR gas and the air–fuel mixture. In Case 3, the geometry was designed to guide the flow direction of the recharging EGR gas towards the center of the combustion chamber for reducing heat transfer between the EGR gas and the cylinder wall. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1468087412437826">Figure 10</xref> shows simulation results. The cross-sectional views of the horizontal and vertical center axis of the combustion chamber are shown. It is found that the EGR guide geometry of Case 2 is more efficient than the other two geometries for generating thermal stratification. In Case 1, the temperature distribution is not affected by the tumble flow. It is also found that mixing between recharged EGR gas and intake air–fuel mixture is promoted around the center part of the cylinder. In Case 3, recharged EGR gas is well mixed with an air–fuel mixture around the center part of the cylinder, and the most homogeneous temperature distribution among the three tested cases is provided. In Case 2, high-temperature EGR gas does not distribute over the center part of the cylinder. Therefore, the mixing between recharged EGR and air–fuel mixture is successfully reduced.</p>

<p>In the temperature distribution of Case 2, it can be seen that hot EGR gas entering into the cylinder moves towards the piston crown along the side-wall surface of the cylinder. EGR gas goes along the piston surface from the exhaust port side towards the intake port side after arriving at the piston crown. From this result, it is considered that a much stronger thermal stratification could be generated by preventing the EGR gas from moving to the intake port side. Therefore, the piston head with a protuberant surface shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087412437826">Figure 3</xref> was applied. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1468087412437826">Figure 11</xref> shows the effect of the EGR guide on the in-cylinder temperature distribution. In the case with the EGR guide, both the circular rings on the exhaust port and the piston head with the protuberant surface shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087412437826">Figure 3</xref> were applied. The cross sectional views of the horizontal and vertical center axis of the combustion chamber are shown. The upper images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1468087412437826">Figure 11(a)</xref>) show the in-cylinder temperature distributions without the EGR guide. The lower images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1468087412437826">Figure 11(b)</xref>) show the in-cylinder temperature distributions with the EGR guide. It can be seen that by attaching the EGR guide on the piston head, a high-temperature region successfully remains at only the exhaust port side in the cylinder. As a result, in-cylinder thermal stratification with the EGR guide is much stronger than that without the EGR guide. To estimate the thermal stratification quantitatively, a five-zone analysis was applied. In this method, the in-cylinder mixture was divided into five equal mass zones classified by the temperature distribution. The temperature difference (ΔT) between the highest temperature zone (zone 5) and the second lowest temperature zone (zone 2) was used as an indicator of the in-cylinder temperature stratification. To define the effect of the EGR guide on the thermal stratification, the lowest temperature zone (zone 1) that would be largely affected by the heat transfer between in-cylinder gas and the cylinder wall was not considered. In this method, a larger ΔT indicates a stronger thermal stratification. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1468087412437826">Figure 12</xref> shows the effect of the EGR guide on temporal variation of ΔT. Prior to 60° before top dead center (BTDC), ΔT without the EGR guide is larger than that with the EGR guide. However, after 60° BTDC, ΔT with the EGR guide is larger than that without the EGR guide. From these results, it can be concluded that the EGR guide is effective for reducing the mixing between hot EGR gas and intake mixture.</p>

<title>Effect of in-cylinder distributions of temperature and fuel concentration on pressure rise rate</title>
<p>To investigate the effect of in-cylinder stratifications of temperature and fuel concentration generated by the EGR guide on d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub>, 0D multi-zone simulations with detailed chemical kinetics was carried out. In the simulations, the three cases shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468087412437826">Table 3</xref>, which have different in-cylinder distributions of temperature and fuel concentration, were examined. Regarding the temperature distribution, two different stratified temperature distributions were examined. The 3D numerical simulation results presented in the previous section showed that the BDSC system with the EGR guide generates a strong in-cylinder thermal stratification. Meanwhile, even though the EGR guide is not used, a relatively small in-cylinder thermal stratification would be formed by heat transfer between in-cylinder gas and the cylinder walls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468087412437826">30</xref></sup> Therefore, two temperature distributions, one generated by the EGR guide and the other by heat transfer, were examined to estimate the effect of the stratified EGR gas distribution on d<italic>P</italic>/dθ Regarding the fuel concentration distribution, a uniform distribution and a fuel distribution provided by the EGR guide were considered. Using PFI, an intake air–fuel mixture is expected to be fully premixed. However, using the BDSC system with the EGR guide, the mixing between a well-mixed air–fuel mixture and a recharged EGR gas is insufficient. Because there is a small amount of air–fuel mixture in a high-temperature zone, local fuel concentration in the high-temperature zone would be relatively lean. Namely, fuel concentration is also stratified using the EGR guide. The fuel concentration in the high-temperature zone, which consists of a large amount of EGR gas and a small amount of intake mixture, is relatively leaner than that in the low-temperature zone. Generally, ignition is advanced with increasing temperature, but retarded with decreasing fuel concentration. This implies that with the BDSC system and the EGR guide, the stratified fuel concentration may cancel out the effect of the in-cylinder temperature distribution on ignition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468087412437826">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468087412437826">20</xref></sup> Therefore, the effect of the stratified fuel concentration generated by the BDSC system and EGR guide was examined. In Case 1, the uniform fuel concentration distribution and the temperature distribution stratified by the heat transfer were applied. In Case 2, distributions of fuel concentration and temperature generated by the EGR guide were applied. In Case 3, the temperature distribution with the EGR guide was applied, but fuel concentration distribution is uniform. Note that in Case 3, the fuel concentration (<italic>G/F</italic>) is spatially uniform, but <italic>A/F</italic> is stratified. In addition, it should be noted that the stratified temperature distribution used in Case 2 and Case 3 includes the effect of heat transfer to the wall, in addition to the effect of the EGR guide. The calculation was commenced from −120° after TDC (ATDC) and stopped at 40° ATDC. The initial conditions, such as in-cylinder distributions of temperature and fuel, were based on the temperature and fuel distributions obtained from 3D numerical simulations. To eliminate the effect of the combustion timing on d<italic>P</italic>/dθ, the in-cylinder mean temperature was regulated so that the crank angle of 50% mass fraction burned (CA50) occurs at 8° ATDC in all tested cases.</p>

<p>The simulation results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1468087412437826">Figure 13</xref>. The in-cylinder pressure of each case was smoothed with a filtering width of 1° CA. From this figure, it can be seen that d<italic>P</italic>/dθ with thermal stratification generated by EGR guide (Case 2) is lower than that in Case 1. Although the temperature distributions of Case 2 and Case 3 are similar to each other, d<italic>P</italic>/dθof Case 3 is much lower than that of Case 2 due to uniform fuel distribution. The in-cylinder temperature distribution generated by the EGR guide (Case 2) indicates 52% lower d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> than that with a temperature distribution generated by heat loss (Case 1). A uniform fuel concentration distribution with a temperature distribution generated by the EGR guide (Case 3) shows 36% lower d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> than that of stratified distributions of temperature and fuel concentration generated by the EGR guide (Case 2). These results indicate that a strong thermal stratification causes lower d<italic>P</italic>/dθ In addition, the EGR guide has a high potential to reduce d<italic>P</italic>/dθ by creating a strong in-cylinder thermal stratification, though the fuel distribution that has a competing effect against the temperature distribution is also formed. Hence, the upper load limit of the acceptable HCCI operation is expected to be extended using the EGR guide. It is also suggested that d<italic>P</italic>/dθ is greatly decreased by providing a uniform fuel concentration distribution with a strong thermal stratification generated by the BDSC system with the EGR guide.</p>

<title>High-load operating limit of an HCCI engine using the BDSC system without EGR guide</title>
<p>Based on the simulation results, the effects of the BDSC and the EGR guide were experimentally investigated. At first, the upper load limit of acceptable HCCI operation using the BDSC system without the EGR guide was investigated in two-cylinder operation.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1468087412437826">Figure 14</xref> shows temporal variations of in-cylinder pressure of the HCCI operation using the BDSC system. The intake pressure, the exhaust pressure, the valve lift profiles and the mass flow rate through the intake and exhaust valves are also presented. The negative mass flow rate through the exhaust valve indicates the exhaust gas recharging flow into the cylinder. The mass flow rates through the valves were obtained from the 1D engine cycle simulations including the gas exchange process using GT-POWER. In this 1D analysis, measured intake pressure and exhaust pressure were used as boundary conditions. The measured in-cylinder pressure is also used to obtain the heat-release profile to make the cycle simulations. This method is called three pressure analysis. In the operation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1468087412437826">Figure 14</xref>, the valve timing designed for the highest target load was used. The mean exhaust pressure was regulated by the exhaust throttle valve at 144 kPa (abs.) to set the CA50 at 8° ATDC. The amount of supplied fuel was set at 14.7 mg/cylinder corresponding to a net IMEP of about 450 kPa. It can be seen that the in-cylinder pressure increases up to about 170 kPa during the EGR valve opening period due to EGR gas recharging. Because the EGR gas was recharged at the intake valve closing timing, the recharged EGR gas flow has almost no effect on the intake air charging. In addition, it can be seen that the total effect of the BDSC is defined by the mean exhaust pressure and the exhaust pressure pulsation due to the exhaust blowdown pressure wave from another cylinder. Here, the effect of the BDSC is investigated focusing on the effect of blowdown pressure pulsation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1468087412437826">Figure 15</xref> shows the effect of the mean exhaust pressure on in-cylinder pressure at the EGR valve closing timing, <italic>P<sub>EGRC</sub></italic>, the amount of the working gas including EGR gas and air, and the amount of the intake air. The amount of working gas is obtained from 1D engine cycle simulations. A difference between <italic>P<sub>EGRC</sub></italic> and the mean exhaust pressure could be treated as a supercharging effect due to the blowdown pressure wave. It can be seen that <italic>P<sub>EGRC</sub></italic> and the amount of the working gas increase with increasing the mean exhaust pressure. This indicates that the effect of the BDSC can be controlled by mean exhaust pressure. However, the supercharging effect defined by the increase in in-cylinder pressure before the compression stroke due to the blowdown pressure wave is about 25 kPa, regardless of the mean exhaust pressure. In addition, it can be seen that the mean exhaust pressure has little effect on the amount of intake air.</p>

<p>Next, the upper load limit of acceptable HCCI operation using the BDSC was investigated. The EGR guide was not applied. The valve timing for the highest target load was used. In this experiment, the amount of supplied fuel was increased with steps of about 50 kPa in net IMEP. With each amount of supplied fuel, the combustion phase was varied by adjusting the mean exhaust pressure within the range providing acceptable HCCI operation in terms of COV of IMEP and d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub>. The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1468087412437826">Figure 16</xref>. With a constant amount of supplied fuel, the increase in the mean exhaust pressure increases the amount of recharged EGR gas and in-cylinder mixture temperature. The increase in the in-cylinder temperature advanced combustion timing. This leads to the increase in d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub>. In contrast, the decrease in the mean exhaust pressure retards combustion timing. Excessively delayed combustion timing deteriorates the ignition and combustion stabilities. Two contour lines, d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> = 400 kPa/° and COV of IMEP = 5%, are presented in the figure. The combustion timing between the two lines provides acceptable HCCI combustion, and the intersection of the two contour lines indicates the upper limit of acceptable HCCI operation. Note that lower load limit with this condition was not specified. The plots in the figure show measurement points. ISNO<sub>x</sub> is also shown in the bottom of the figure. It is revealed that acceptable HCCI operation at net IMEP of 480 kPa can be achieved using the BDSC. During the upper load limit operation, the charging efficiency of the intake air is about 70%, the EGR rate is about 34% and the charging efficiency of the working gas is 109%. The charging efficiency of the working gas with a naturally aspirated HCCI operation using the NVO technique was reported to be about 70%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087412437826">9</xref></sup> and the high-load limit is about 350 kPa to 400 kPa in net IMEP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087412437826">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468087412437826">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087412437826">9</xref></sup> It can be concluded that the BDSC is capable of increasing the total amount of in-cylinder mixture without an external supercharger leading to the extension of the upper load limit of acceptable HCCI operation with naturally aspirated conditions. It is worth mentioning that although d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> is larger than 400 kPa/°, HCCI operation with extremely low NO<sub>x</sub> emissions could be achieved at higher IMEP values (supplied fuel of 16.4 mg/cylinder in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1468087412437826">Figure 16</xref>). This implies that the upper load limit can be extended more, if d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> can be decreased, as the limiting factor of high-load HCCI operation is d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub>, in this case.</p>

<title>Effect of EGR guide on the high-load operating limit of an HCCI engine using the BDSC system</title>
<p>The effect of the EGR guide on d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> was experimentally investigated. The amount of supplied fuel was fixed at 17 mg/cylinder and 15 mg/cylinder, corresponding to a net IMEP of about 570 kPa and about 480 kPa, respectively. A net IMEP of 480 kPa is the high-load limit of HCCI operation with the BDSC. The valve timing for the highest target load was used. CA50 was varied by adjusting the mean exhaust pressure. The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1468087412437826">Figure 17</xref>. The horizontal axis is CA50 and the vertical axis is d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub>. d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> with the EGR guide is about 15% to 20% less than that without the EGR guide, probably because of a stronger thermal stratification provided by the EGR guide, as shown in the 3D simulations. Without the EGR guide, the HCCI operation with allowable d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> at net IMEP of 570 kPa cannot be attained. However, using the EGR guide, HCCI operation with net IMEP of 570 kPa with d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> of about 400 kPa/° can be achieved.</p>

<p>The effects of the EGR guide on fuel consumption and exhaust emissions were investigated. The mean exhaust pressure was fixed at 147 kPa, and the amount of supplied fuel was varied. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1468087412437826">Figure 18</xref>. The black solid points indicate the operation points with unacceptable HCCI operation with larger d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> than 400 kPa/°. The effect of the EGR guide on indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC) and exhaust emissions can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1468087412437826">Figure 18</xref>. With an acceptable HCCI operation with d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> lower than 400 kPa/°, no significant differences in ISFC and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions was found between the case with the EGR guide and the case without the EGR guide. However, for operation with d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> higher than 400 kPa/°, NO<sub>x</sub> emissions in both cases steeply increased. This is probably because the combustion temperature increases due to steep heat release. CO and HC emissions with the EGR guide are higher than those without the EGR guide. Because a relatively lower temperature zone appeared due to a strong thermal stratification with the EGR guide, combustion efficiency in the lower temperature zone may deteriorate, and HC and CO emissions would be increased.</p>

<p>The EGR guide is demonstrated to be an effective technique to decrease d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> during high-load HCCI operation. Therefore, using the EGR guide, the upper load limit of HCCI operation, as restricted by d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub>, was successfully extended. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-1468087412437826">Figure 19</xref> shows the effect of the EGR guide on the HCCI operating range with the valve timing for the highest target IMEP. Note that the low-load limit is not specified in the figure. The HCCI operating range using the BDSC without the EGR guide is also presented in the figure. Because the d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> with the EGR guide is lower than that without the EGR guide, the higher IMEP operation is realized with the EGR guide at fixed combustion timing. As a result, the high-load limit of acceptable HCCI operation was extended up to a net IMEP of about 590 kPa (gross IMEP of 620 kPa) using the EGR guide together with the BDSC. This high-load limit is much higher than the maximum load realized using the previously proposed techniques. However, the stable HCCI operation was not achieved without exhaust throttling because a high enough in-cylinder temperature to attain suitable ignition timing was not obtained without increasing the mean exhaust pressure. The increase in mean exhaust pressure increases pumping losses. Therefore, the reduction in mean exhaust pressure is an issue to be solved. The HCCI tests presented in the following subsections were conducted using the EGR guide.</p>

<title>Effect of cooling water temperature on high-load operating limit of an HCCI engine using the BDSC system</title>
<p>Higher cooling water temperature increases EGR gas temperature by decreasing heat loss during the expansion stroke. In addition, higher cooling water temperature decreases wall heat loss during the compression stroke. Therefore, it is considered that the temperature of the in-cylinder mixture increases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468087412437826">31</xref></sup> and the mean exhaust pressure to achieve acceptable HCCI operation using the BDSC decreases with increasing cooling water temperature. Then, the effect of cooling water temperature on the pumping loss and fuel consumption rate during the HCCI operation was investigated. The cooling water temperature was varied from 85°C to 105°C, and the valve timing for the highest target load was used. The result is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-1468087412437826">Figure 20</xref>. In the figure, the measurement points with the combustion timing for the best fuel consumption rate at constant amount of fuel are plotted. The combustion timing was varied by regulating the mean exhaust pressure with constant amount of fuel supply to find the timing for the best fuel consumption rate. It is revealed that the higher cooling water temperature reduces pumping mean effective pressure (PMEP) and improves fuel consumption rate, as expected. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21-1468087412437826">Figure 21</xref> shows the HCCI operating ranges obtained using the valve timing for the highest target IMEP with a cooling water temperature of 85°C and 105°C. Note that the lower load limit is not specified in the figure. The amount of the supplied fuel was varied in steps of about 50 kPa in IMEP. The combustion timing was varied by regulating the mean exhaust pressure at each amount of fuel supply. As a result, it is found that the upper load limit of acceptable HCCI operation was almost not affected by cooling water temperature.

<title>Effect of direct fuel injection on in-cylinder fuel concentration distribution</title>
<p>Using the BDSC system with the EGR guide, the spatial distribution of the fuel concentration is also stratified. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22-1468087412437826">Figure 22</xref> shows an example of simulated in-cylinder distributions of temperature and <italic>G/F</italic> using a PFI system with the BDSC and the EGR guide, which is obtained from the same simulations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1468087412437826">Figure 11</xref> in the previous section. The cross-sectional views of the vertical center axis of the in-cylinder temperature and the <italic>G/F</italic> distributions at 40° BTDC are presented. It can be seen that the fuel concentration in the high-temperature zone is leaner than that in the low-temperature zone. Because there is a small amount of air–fuel mixture in the high-temperature EGR gas zone, the local fuel concentration in the high-temperature EGR gas zone is relatively lean. As was discussed in the previous sections with the results of the multi-zone chemical reaction simulations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1468087412437826">Figure 13</xref>), it is expected that d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> decreases, and the HCCI operating range is extended by providing a uniform fuel concentration distribution with a strong thermal stratification. To attain a uniform fuel concentration distribution with a strong in-cylinder thermal stratification, a direct fuel injection system was employed. To increase the fuel concentration locally in the high-temperature and fuel-lean zone, some amount of fuel was directly injected into the high-temperature EGR gas using a direct injector attached under the intake port.</p>

<p>Firstly, the effect of fuel injection timing on the in-cylinder distribution of fuel concentration was investigated via 3D numerical simulations. In the simulations, the total amount of supplied fuel was fixed at 15.8 mg/cylinder, and 20% of the supplied fuel was directly injected into the cylinder while 80% of the total supplied fuel was injected into the intake port before intake valve opening. The calculation conditions are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468087412437826">Table 4</xref>. Three different fuel injection conditions were examined. In Case 1, DI is not used. In this case, all fuel is supplied into the intake port, and a fully premixed intake air–fuel mixture is provided. In Case 2, 20% of the supplied fuel is directly injected into the cylinder during the compression stroke. The end of the direct fuel injection timing is set at −165° ATDC. In this case, fuel is injected towards the recharged EGR gas zone to increase the fuel concentration in the high-temperature zone. In Case 3, 20% of the total supplied fuel is injected into the cylinder at 300° ATDC during the exhaust stroke. In the BDSC system, exhaust gas pushed out from the cylinder to the exhaust port is charged into the cylinder again at the beginning of the compression stroke. Therefore, the directly injected fuel into the burnt gas during the exhaust stroke is supposed to be pushed back into the cylinder together with the recharged EGR gas during the next cycle. Because fuel and EGR gas can be well mixed, the fuel concentration distribution would be more uniform.</p>

<p>The simulation results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig23-1468087412437826">Figure 23</xref>. The frequency distribution of the in-cylinder mixture in terms of fuel concentration and temperature is shown. The vertical axis shows the mixture temperature and the horizontal axis shows the mass ratio of fuel to working gas (<italic>F/G</italic>). The color bar indicates the mass fraction of the mixture. It is found that injection during the compression stroke (Case 2) provides the most stratified fuel distribution. In this case, the fuel concentration shows a broader distribution than that in the case without DI (Case 1). By contrast, exhaust stroke injection (Case 3) provides a more uniform fuel distribution while keeping a broad temperature distribution. From these results, it is found that a small amount of fuel injection directly into the cylinder during the exhaust stroke is effective at generating a homogenized fuel concentration distribution with strong thermal stratification.</p>

The total amount of supplied fuel was 15.4 mg/cylinder, and 20% of the supplied fuel was directly injected into the cylinder, whereas 80% of the supplied fuel was injected into the intake port before the intake valve opens. The mean exhaust pressure was set at 138 kPa (abs.). The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig24-1468087412437826">Figure 24</xref>. The effect of DI timing on d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub>, COV of IMEP, CA50 and exhaust emissions can be seen in this figure. With the direct fuel injection after 320° ATDC during the exhaust stroke, d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> decreases without increasing NO<sub>x</sub> and HC emissions. In addition, CA50 is retarded. With direct fuel injection before 320° ATDC during the exhaust stroke, although d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> decreases, HC emissions increase with an advance in the DI timing. This is because the fuel would not be recharged due to excessively earlier injection timing than the exhaust valve reopening. When 20% of the total fuel is directly injected during the compression stroke, d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> decreases and CA50 is delayed without increasing NO<sub>x</sub> or HC emissions as the DI is retarded up to −100° ATDC. Meanwhile, when the injection timing is retarded much later than 100° BTDC, d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions steeply increase and CA50 is advanced. 3D calculations were carried out to investigate the spatial distribution of fuel concentration. When fuel is injected at −40° ATDC, the fuel spray impinged on the piston top, forming a local fuel-rich zone. With this local fuel-rich zone, as autoignition occurs early, combustion temperature increases and the NO<sub>x</sub> emissions increase. With direct fuel injection during the intake stroke, d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> and exhaust emissions are not affected by ignition timing.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, the effect of the amount of DI fuel on d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> and exhaust emissions was investigated. The total amount of supplied fuel was fixed at 15.2 mg/cylinder. Two different DI timings were examined: one was −100° ATDC during the compression stroke and the other was 310° ATDC during the exhaust stroke. At these two injection timings, the lowest d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> without an increase in exhaust emissions was obtained in the previous experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig24-1468087412437826">Figure 24</xref>. The results with a compression stroke injection (EOI = −100° ATDC) can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25-1468087412437826">Figure 25</xref>. The horizontal axis is the mass ratio of the directly injected fuel to the total amount of supplied fuel. By increasing the amount of the DI fuel, CA50 is advanced, while d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions increase. This is because an increase in the DI fuel during the compression stroke enhances fuel stratification. Due to a generation of relatively fuel-rich zones, ignition timing advances and d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> increases. HC emissions are not affected by the DI fuel amount. The results with an exhaust stroke injection (EOI = 310° ATDC) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26-1468087412437826">Figure 26</xref>. It is found that d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub>, CA50 and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions are not affected by the amount of directly injected fuel. However, HC emissions increase with increasing amount of DI fuel. When the injection duration increases with fixed EOI timing, the start of injection timing is advanced. With an early start of injection, the fuel directly injected at the early stage of the injection period would not be recharged into the cylinder, thereby HC emissions increase with increasing amount of DI fuel.</p>

</fig>
<p>From these results, it is found that direct fuel injection timing and the amount of DI fuel largely affects combustion timing (CA50), which largely affects d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub>. To eliminate the effect of the combustion timing and to clarify the effect of in-cylinder fuel concentration distribution provided by the direct fuel injection on d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub>, the correlation between d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> and CA50 was investigated. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig27-1468087412437826">Figure 27</xref>. The experimental results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig24-1468087412437826">Figure 24</xref> are replotted. The vertical axis is d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> and the horizontal axis is CA50. There is no significant difference in d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> between the different fuel injection timings. This indicates that d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> is decreased mainly due to the delay in combustion phase (CA50) when direct fuel injection is used.</p>

</fig>
<p>According to the simulation results, some amount of fuel injection during the exhaust stroke could provide a homogeneous distribution of fuel concentration and reduce d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub>. However, d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> was not affected significantly by the direct fuel injection. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28-1468087412437826">Figure 28</xref> shows frequency distributions of the in-cylinder temperature and fuel concentration at −20° ATDC with direct fuel injection during the exhaust stroke calculated by the 3D numerical simulations. It can be seen that the fuel concentration with the exhaust stroke injection is more homogeneous than that without DI. However, the in-cylinder temperature distribution with the exhaust stroke injection is also more homogeneous than that without DI. With the exhaust stroke injection, the amount of high-temperature gas decreases and the amount of medium-temperature gas increases. Namely, the DI during the exhaust stroke decreases recharged EGR gas temperature. As a result, the temperature difference between the intake mixture and EGR gas is decreased, and the temperature distribution becomes more homogeneous. The effect of a uniform fuel concentration on d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> would be canceled out by the effect of relatively uniform in-cylinder temperature distribution on d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, the effect of the DI on the upper load limit of the HCCI was investigated. The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig29-1468087412437826">Figure 29</xref>. The operating range obtained with the DI at −100° ATDC is shown. Twenty per cent of the supplied fuel was directly injected into the cylinder. ISNO<sub>x</sub> is also presented in the bottom of the figure. As the correlation between d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> and CA50 is not affected by the DI, the HCCI operating range defined by the d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> and COV of IMEP with the direct fuel injection is similar to the case with the PFI. However, the direct fuel injection slightly increases NO<sub>x</sub> emissions around the upper load limit, probably due to a slightly stratified fuel distribution. Thereby, high-load HCCI operation with direct fuel injection is limited by NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. The HCCI operating range is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30-1468087412437826">Figure 30</xref>. The mean exhaust pressure and EGR rate required for the HCCI operation are shown on the horizontal axis. Compared to the case without DI (PFI 100%), acceptable HCCI operation with the DI is attained with higher mean exhaust pressure. Because directly injected fuel decreases the in-cylinder mixture temperature, a larger amount of EGR gas is required to achieve HCCI operation. When only PFI is used, the acceptable HCCI operation around the upper load limit is achieved with a limited exhaust pressure range. This means that the operational robustness around the upper load limit is low. Using direct fuel injection combined with PFI, the operational HCCI is attained with a relatively wider exhaust pressure range. It is considered that direct fuel injection has a possibility to improve the operational robustness for high-load HCCI operation.</p>

<title>Reduction in cylinder-to-cylinder variation in ignition timing using secondary air injection</title>
<p>The experiments presented in the previous subsections were conducted focusing on only one cylinder among four cylinders. Considering a multi-cylinder HCCI operation, the cylinder-to-cylinder variation in ignition timing is one of the limiting factors of the HCCI operation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468087412437826">24</xref></sup> Controlling the ignition timing of each cylinder in each cycle is important. To achieve this, a secondary air injection system was proposed and examined. In this system, secondary air was injected into the exhaust port before the EGR valve closes to control the recharged EGR gas temperature. The injection pressure of the secondary air was set at 250 kPa (gauge). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1468087412437826">Table 6</xref> shows the secondary air injection conditions.</p>

<p>Firstly, the effect of secondary air injection on ignition timing was investigated with two-cylinder operation. The air injection duration was varied to control the amount of air. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig31-1468087412437826">Figure 31</xref> shows the effect of secondary air injection on the heat-release rate. The IMEP is about 485 kPa. It can be seen that the combustion phase retards and the combustion duration increases when the amount of air is increased. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig32-1468087412437826">Figure 32</xref> shows the effect of the amount of air on CA50 for high-load HCCI operation with a net IMEP of 485 kPa. As shown in this figure, CA50 retards when the amount of air is increased, until misfiring occurs. Next, secondary air injection was applied to reduce cylinder-to-cylinder variation in ignition timing. Because the ignition timing of cylinder 1 was earlier than that of cylinder 4, the air injection duration for cylinder 1 was varied to adjust the ignition timing of cylinder 1 to that of cylinder 4. The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33-1468087412437826">Figure 33</xref>. It can be seen that when using the secondary air, there is almost no difference in the heat-release rate between cylinder 1 and cylinder 4. Secondary air injection is validated as an effective technique to reduce cylinder-to-cylinder variations of the ignition and combustion.</p>

<p>Finally, the secondary air injection system was applied to four-cylinder operation to see the effect of reduction in cylinder-to-cylinder variation in ignition timing on the operating range of the multi-cylinder HCCI engine. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34-1468087412437826">Figure 34</xref> shows the effect of secondary air injection on the upper load limit of the HCCI operation with fixed valve timing. The net IMEP on the vertical axis is the averaged net IMEP between the four cylinders. Without secondary air injection, the upper load limit is a net IMEP of 520 kPa, which is about 12% lower than that obtained with two-cylinder operation. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34-1468087412437826">Figure 34</xref>, it can be seen that the operating range with four-cylinder operation is mainly restricted by the cylinder with the lowest combustion stability. With the reduction in cylinder-to-cylinder variation in ignition timing by secondary air injection, the upper load limit is successfully extended up to a net IMEP of 570 kPa (BMEP of about 520 kPa), which is slightly lower than that obtained with the two-cylinder operation. The effect of secondary air on fuel consumption and exhaust emissions can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig35-1468087412437826">Figure 35</xref>. Fuel consumption and exhaust emissions are little affected by secondary air injection. However, it should be noted that when secondary air injection is used, brake thermal efficiency would be decreased. When the secondary air is injected with an injection duration of 8.0 ms (about 16cm<sup>3</sup>/cylinder) and an injection pressure of 350 kPa (abs.) for four cylinders, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33-1468087412437826">Figure 33</xref>, the work required for secondary air injection is roughly estimated to be about 250 W. With a high-load HCCI operation with a BMEP of 520 kPa and engine speed of 1500 r/min, output from the test engine used in this study (displacement volume of 1998 cm<sup>3</sup>) is about 13 kW. So, the energy used for secondary air injection is estimated to be about 2% of the engine output in this case.</p>

<p>Using secondary air injection, cylinder-to-cylinder variation is successfully reduced and the upper load limit of operational four-cylinder HCCI is extended without any disadvantages in exhaust emissions. Additionally, the gas fuel injector has a high enough responsivity to control the injection duration in each cycle. Therefore, the secondary air injection system is expected to also be applied to reduce a cycle-to-cycle variation of ignition timing.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>To extend the operating range of a gasoline-fueled multi-cylinder HCCI engine, a BDSC system and an EGR guide were developed. The concept was to obtain a large amount of working gas, consisting of air and EGR gas, and strong in-cylinder thermal stratification without an external supercharger for extending the upper load limit of HCCI operation, whilst keeping d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> emissions low. Additionally, to reduce cylinder-to-cylinder variation in ignition timing with a multi-cylinder HCCI operation, a secondary air injection system, which independently controlled the recharged EGR gas temperature and the ignition timing of each cylinder, was applied. The effects of the proposed systems on the HCCI operating range were numerically and experimentally examined. As a result, the following conclusions were obtained.</p>
<list id="list1-1468087412437826" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Using the BDSC system, together with the EGR guide, d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> during high-load HCCI operations could be decreased because a large amount of in-cylinder working gas and a strong thermal stratification would be provided. As a result, the high-load limit of the HCCI operating range was successfully extended up to a net IMEP of 590 kPa (gross IMEP of 615 kPa) for naturally aspirated conditions with limits of d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub>≤ 400 kPa/°, COV of IMEP ≤ 5% and ISNO<sub>x</sub>≤ 0.1 g/kWh. However, to achieve stable HCCI operation by using the BDSC system, the effect of the exhaust blowdown pressure on EGR gas recharging has to be enhanced by increasing the mean exhaust pressure. This increase in mean exhaust pressure decreases the fuel consumption rate due to an increase in pumping loss.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A higher cooling water temperature could decrease the mean exhaust pressure to achieve acceptable HCCI operation using the BDSC system. As a result, the fuel consumption rate was improved by increasing the cooling water temperature, mainly due to a reduction in pumping loss.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When some amount of supplied fuel was directly injected into the cylinder during the beginning of the compression stroke or the end of exhaust stroke, ignition timing was retarded and d<italic>P</italic>/dθ<sub>max</sub> was decreased due to the decrease in in-cylinder temperature. Direct fuel injection slightly increased NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. The upper load limit of acceptable HCCI operation with direct fuel injection was restricted by NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. In addition, the mean exhaust pressure required for acceptable HCCI operation is shifted to a higher pressure range with direct fuel injection, leading to an improvement of the robustness of HCCI operation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The cylinder-to-cylinder variation in ignition timing restricts the operating range for a multi-cylinder HCCI operation. Using secondary air injection, the cylinder-to-cylinder variation in ignition timing was reduced and the upper load limit of the four-cylinder HCCI operation was successfully extended up to a net IMEP of 570 kPa for naturally aspirated conditions without any disadvantages in exhaust emissions.</p></list-item>

<p>IMEP is a measure of the work done by the gas on the piston per unit volume of the cylinder during one engine cycle. There are two kinds of IMEP: net IMEP and gross IMEP. Net IMEP refers to the work throughout the intake, compression, expansion and exhaust strokes, while gross IMEP refers only to the work during the compression and expansion strokes. Gross IMEP differs from net IMEP by ignoring pumping losses (pumping mean effective pressure; PMEP) during the exhaust and intake strokes.
