<abstract>
<p>The stabilized organic fraction of municipal solid waste (SOFMSW) is a product of the mechanical/biological treatment (MBT) of mixed municipal solid waste (MMSW). SOFMSW is considered a ‘grey’ compost and the presence of pollutants (particularly heavy metals) and residual glass and plastic normally prevents agricultural use, making landfills the typical final destination for SOFMSW. Recirculation of leachate in landfills can be a cost-effective management option, but the long-term sustainability of such a practice must be verified. Column tests were carried out to examine the effect of SOFMSW on leachate recirculation. The results indicate that organic matter may be biologically degraded and metals (copper and zinc) are effectively entrapped through a combination of physical (adsorption), biological (bacterial sulfate reduction), and chemical (precipitation of metal sulfides) processes, while other chemicals (i.e. ammonia nitrogen and chloride) are essentially unaffected by filtration through SOFMSW.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Landfill leachate is a potential source of ground and surface water contamination. Moreover its migration through soil is often slow and the effect of improper management might become evident only after a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11433527">Maione et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The composition of leachate depends on a variety of parameters, such as the type of waste, climatic conditions, mode of operation and age of the landfill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11433527">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11433527">Kjeldsen et al., 2002</xref>). The pollutant load of the leachate generally reaches the maximum level during the first years of operation of a landfill and then gradually and slowly decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11433527">Heyer and Stegmann, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The organic fraction of landfill leachate is highly variable in composition, ranging from simple ligands, like acetate or volatile fatty acids, to high molecular weight compounds with many phenolic, carboxylic and amminic chelating groups, such as fulvic and humic substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11433527">Gourdon et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11433527">Oman and Hynning, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>A pre-treatment can be carried out in order to reduce the organic load, so decreasing, in intensity and duration, the main impacts (due to leachate and biogas) of landfilled waste. According to the Waste Directive (1999/31/EC), municipal solid waste pre-treatment is now mandatory in the European Union.</p>
<p>The most common pre-treatment option for the mixed municipal solid waste (MMSW) is the mechanical/biological treatment (MBT) consisting of a mechanical separation (after shredding) of two fractions: a ‘coarse dry’ one (mainly composed of slowly or non-biodegradable materials), and a ‘fine wet’ fraction. The latter contains most of the organic matter of the original waste and it is usually aerobically stabilized, yields the so-called stabilized organic fraction of municipal solid waste (SOFMSW). A similar pre-treatment can be applied to waste to be incinerated with the goal to obtain a ‘dry fraction’ with a heating value higher than the raw municipal waste.</p>
<p>The SOFMSW that is generated by both the above-mentioned processes, may be considered a ‘grey’ compost because the presence of pollutants (particularly metals), as well as residual glass and plastic, normally makes that material unsuitable for agricultural use. As a consequence, this material is generally disposed into landfills, in layers of 20 to 50 cm, as a daily cover. However, several existing landfills still show a condition where most of the volume is occupied by untreated waste and only the very last layers are composed by the alternation of the coarse dry fraction and of SOFMSW. Leachate from these landfills is similar in composition to that of the landfills accepting untreated waste.</p>
<p>Leachate can be treated by different methods: biological (aerobic, anaerobic) and physico-chemical methods (i.e. precipitation, oxidation, adsorption, stripping, reverse osmosis and evaporation) typically are utilized to remove the high pollutant load (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11433527">Renou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11433527">Wiszniowski et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Recirculation of raw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11433527">Benson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11433527">Bilgili et al., 2007</xref>) or membrane-concentrated leachate could be a cost-effective management option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11433527">Heinigin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X11433527">Peters, 1998</xref>), but the long-term sustainability of this practice should be confirmed, particularly in the case of concentrated leachate. Opinions differ concerning the consequences of leachate recirculation: those in favour declare that the potential negative effects are negligible or at least limited to the period immediately after re-injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11433527">Heinigin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X11433527">Peters, 1998</xref>), while opponents claim that the practice is not sustainable in the long term because of the increase in concentration of potentially harmful persistent organic and inorganic substances (e.g. chloride, ammonia nitrogen and slowly or non-biodegradable organic matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11433527">Heyer and Stegmann, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11433527">Calabrò et al., 2010</xref>) reports the results of the monitoring of the landfill of the municipality of Monsummano Terme (Tuscany, Italy) where concentrated leachate obtained during membrane treatment is recirculated and SOFMSW is used for daily cover. The results from the first 30 months of monitoring of recirculation showed that leachate volume did not increase significantly and that only a few leachate quality parameters (i.e. chemical oxygen demand (COD), nickel and zinc) presented a very moderate increase. Moreover, after the beginning of the recirculation, biogas composition changed with a large reduction in methane content. The authors concluded that the change could be related to the partial inhibition of methanogens as a result of the competition of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) due to the high sulfate concentration of the concentrated recirculated leachate. The non-accumulation of conservative chemicals such as ammonia nitrogen and chloride in the leachate was instead mainly attributed to the possible sorption of leachate and associated chemicals by the waste itself.</p>
<p>Many studies highlight the capacity of organic materials such as bark, compost, and sawdust to remove pollutants from aqueous media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11433527">Lens et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433527">Onay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11433527">Rodrigues et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X11433527">Xiaohui et al., 2007</xref>) but only few deal with the interactions between MBT waste and leachate (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11433527">Sormunen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11433527">van Praagh et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, the ability of SOFMSW to reduce pollutants load in the landfill leachate (i.e. ammonia nitrogen, chloride, sulfide, zinc, and copper) was examined using column tests, in order to assess its effect on the sustainability of leachate recirculation.</p>

<title>SOFMSW characterization</title>
<p>The SOFMSW used in the tests was obtained from a MBT plant in which the incoming waste was subjected to an initial size reduction via shredding, followed by sorting in a rotary drum screen to separate the fine fraction (average diameter below 40 mm) from the coarse fraction. The latter fraction represented approximately 70% of the incoming waste by weight. The coarse fraction was directly landfilled while the fine fraction was subjected to an in-vessel aerobic biological treatment for about 4 weeks. The treatment resulted in a value of the static respirometric index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X11433527">IPLA, 1998</xref>) lower than 450 mg O<sub>2</sub> (kg VS)<sup>−</sup>1 h<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>Water content, total and volatile solids, maximum water sorption capacity, and maximum water sorption capacity under a constant vertical load of 100 kN m<sup>−2</sup> were determined. The latter parameter provides an estimate of the water absorption capacity of SOFMSW under an equivalent load caused by a 10 m height of landfilled waste. In order to measure the water sorption capacity, the SOFMSW sample was placed into a cylinder and pressed until the desired density (8 kN m<sup>−3</sup>) was achieved. The cylinder was then closed with a metallic cover to prevent swelling and the sample was saturated with distilled water. After 1 h the excess water was removed and weighed to provide an estimate of the pore volume at the density of 8 kN m<sup>−3</sup>. The water sorption capacity under a constant vertical load of 100 kN m<sup>−2</sup> was measured in the same way except that after the saturation with water a vertical load (100 kN m<sup>−2</sup>) was applied to the sample.</p>
<p>Leaching tests of SOFMSW were carried out according to the UNI-EN 12457-2 standard method for waste characterization (stirring time 24 h, temperature 20 °C, liquid–solid ratio, 10 L kg<sup>−1</sup>). The eluate pH (pH-meter WTW inoLab pH/cond 720), COD, ammonia nitrogen, sulfate, chloride (ion chromatography; Dionex), zinc and copper (atomic absorption spectrophotometer; Shimadzu AA – 6701F) were determined in accordance with standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11433527">APHA, AWWA and WEF, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Column experiments</title>
<p>The two columns used in the experiments were identical Plexiglas cylinders 5 cm in internal diameter and 50 cm long filled with SOFMSW. The density of the SOFMSW in the column was 0.8 kN m<sup>−3</sup> for a total mass of 770 g. The tests were performed supplying the columns with a synthetic contaminated solution (constant upward flow of 0.5 mL min<sup>−1</sup>) using a peristaltic pump (Ismatec ISM 930) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X11433527">Figure 1</xref>). The total duration of the experiments was 25 days during which nine samples were withdrawn from each column (columns A and B) at pre-set intervals. The total volume of solution flowing through each column was set at 18 L, equivalent to about 115 pore volumes. This volume can be considered representative of the leachate flowing through a landfill section equivalent to that of the column in a period of time in the order of decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11433527">Heyer and Stegmann, 2002</xref>).</p>

<p>The synthetic leachate solution was prepared by adding ammonium chloride (purity 99.998%; Sigma-Aldrich), ammonium sulfate (purity 99.0%; Sigma-Aldrich), zinc chloride (purity 99.999%; Sigma-Aldrich), and copper chloride (purity 99.999%; Sigma-Aldrich) to distilled water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 8.2 using concentrated sodium hydroxide solution. The final solution contained 1200 mg L<sup>−1</sup> ammonia nitrogen, 200 mg L<sup>−1</sup> sulfate; 2100 mg L<sup>−1</sup> chloride, 13.0 mg L<sup>−1</sup> zinc and 13.5 mg L<sup>−1</sup> copper.</p>
<p>The composition of the synthetic solution was chosen on the basis of literature data about leachate composition during the methanogenic phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11433527">Ehrig, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11433527">Kjeldsen et al., 2002</xref>). In order to ascertain potential substrate-limited conditions for biological activity, glucose (equivalent to 2000 mg L<sup>−1</sup> COD) was added continuously to the solution flowing in column B after 11 days from the start of the experiment.</p>
<p>Samples withdrawn from the columns were analysed for pH, COD, sulfate, ammonia nitrogen, chloride, zinc and copper. The analyses were carried out using the same methods applied on eluates from the leaching tests.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The water content of the raw SOFMSW was 35%, the total solids were 650 g kg<sup>−1</sup>, and the volatile solids content was 411 g kg<sup>−1</sup>. These values are similar to those previously reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11433527">APAT, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11433527">Bayard et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The water content of the sample at a density of 8 kN m<sup>−3</sup> was 61.4%. The corresponding excess water volume was 16%. The water sorption capacity under a constant vertical load of 100 kN m<sup>−2</sup> was 51.9%, indicating the high water absorption capacity of SOFMSW.</p>

<p>The pH of column A leachate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11433527">Figure 2</xref>) remained stable during the entire test at a value slightly lower than the influent solution. The pH of column B effluent was similar to that of column A before glucose addition. After glucose addition a decrease in pH occurred in column B leachate due to the production of organic acids typical of anaerobic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11433527">Ehrig, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11433527">Kjeldsen et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The COD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X11433527">Figure 3</xref>), sulfate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X11433527">Figure 5</xref>), copper, and zinc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X11433527">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X11433527">8</xref>) showed similar behaviours. The concentrations for all of these contaminants were initially elevated due to their leaching from the SOFMSW, they then dropped significantly, eventually reaching a plateau. It is also noteworthy that the concentrations of sulfate, copper, and zinc, after the first massive leaching phase, at the beginning of the flushing of the SOFMSW, were significantly lower than the corresponding values in the influent solution. Only slight differences in the COD values were observed between columns A and B. This experimental result could indicate that the readily biodegradable substrate added to column B was promptly utilized by micro-organisms whereas the organic matter leached from the SOFMSW (mostly composed of humic substances) was much more slowly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11433527">De Gioannis and Muntoni, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The ammonia nitrogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X11433527">Figure 4</xref>) and chloride (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X11433527">Figure 6</xref>) concentrations stabilized at levels very close to the influent solution after a brief transient period at the beginning of the experiment with concentrations respectively lower and higher than that of the influent solution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0734242X11433527" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>With regard to ammonia nitrogen concentration, the first samples withdrawn from both columns showed lower concentrations than the ones in the influent solution. This result can be explained with a dilution of the influent solution with the water contained in the SOFMSW, having a lower ammonium concentration. The described effect also agrees with the result of the batch leaching tests indicating a low content (72 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) of ammonia nitrogen released to the demineralized water. A similar phenomenon was observed in field monitoring activities at the beginning of leachate recirculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11433527">Benson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11433527">Calabrò et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11433527">Morris et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The similar behaviour observed for sulfate, zinc and copper, during the whole experiment, seems to indicate a sulfate role in metals removal mechanism.</p>
<p>Several studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11433527">Jong and Parry, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433527">Onay et al., 2010</xref>) have described how landfilled waste (in particular, soil, organic matter, and similar fractions) exhibits significant sorptive capacity, particularly at neutral to high pH levels. Moreover, the formation of scarcely soluble metal sulfides due to the anaerobic reduction of sulfates by SRB effectively reduces the presence of metals in the column effluent. This mechanism is known as the ‘sulfides barrier’ and it is strongly pH dependent.</p>
<p>The experimental results agree with the described metal removal mechanism. The high sulfate concentration at the beginning of the test, which was probably not reduced due to the acclimation of SRB, corresponded to the highest metal concentrations. When sulfate concentration decreased, most probably because of biologic sulfate reduction, metal concentrations also declined due to their precipitation as metal sulfides. The high correlation coefficients between sulfate and metal concentrations in the effluent of the two columns (respectively 0.85 for copper and 0.96 for zinc) further confirm that the processes involving sulfate and metals are closely related.</p>
<p>From measurements of all of the parameters it is evident that the leaching from SOFMSW was very moderate and significantly influenced only the first part of the experiment. This leaching phase was essentially completed after the flushing of 10 to 30 pore volumes of contaminated solution, depending on the different parameters considered (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11433527">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X11433527">8</xref>). The addition of the readily biodegradable substrate in column B did not produce any significant effects. It is thus concluded that the processes under observation were not substrate-limited.</p>
<p>In order to ascertain the actual capacity of SOFMSW in reducing the concentrations of organic and inorganic substances present in leachate, the mass balance for the most significant parameters (i.e. ammonia nitrogen, chloride, copper, and zinc) was calculated according to the following equation:</p>

<p>In which <italic>M</italic><sub>IN</sub> is the total inflowing mass of the selected pollutant; <italic>M</italic><sub>LEACH</sub> is the mass of the pollutant leached from the SOFMSW evaluated on the basis of the specific mass removed during the leaching test. Although the leaching conditions were obviously different in the column tests with respect to the batch ones (i.e. probably more effective in the batch tests) this assumption probably does not lead to severe errors since, the leaching process from the SOFMSW, as already noted, can be considered essentially completed before the end of the column experiment, for all the investigated pollutants. Besides, the thus calculated leached mass generally represents a small fraction of the total inflowing mass (2.5% for ammonia nitrogen, 7.1% for chloride, 3.3% for copper, and 10.2% for zinc); <italic>M</italic><sub>OUT</sub> is the total output mass from the columns, for each of the selected pollutants, as determined from the results of analyses of the samples withdrawn at the columns outlets; <italic>M</italic><sub>PORES</sub> is the mass present in the pores of the column evaluated by multiplying the pore volume (experimentally measured to be 16% of the total volume) by the average concentration of the selected substance in the column at the end of the experiment; this mass also represents a very small contribution compared to the inflowing mass (between 0.4 and 0.8%); <italic>M</italic><sub>REM</sub> is the mass removed.</p>
<p>Results from the mass balance, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X11433527">Table 2</xref>, confirm that the SOFMSW is effective in retaining metals while ammonia nitrogen and chloride are virtually unaffected by passage through the column.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Large amounts of SOFMSW can be produced during the MMSW management process, but its behaviour after landfilling and specifically its potential role in reducing pollutants concentration in leachate, is not well documented in the literature. The tests carried out in this study highlight the relevant water sorption capacity of SOFMSW. It was also observed that the biodegradable substrates may be easily consumed and metals may be effectively entrapped through the passage in the SOFMSW, most likely due to several and concurrent biologic (sulfate reduction by SRB), chemical (metal sulfide precipitation), and physical (sorption) processes. For these reasons the potential negative effects due to leachate recirculation (increase in leachate production and pollutant load) could be retarded and reduced by SOFMSW. However, the capacity of SOFMSW for attenuating ammonia nitrogen and chloride was found to be negligible.</p>
<p>Recirculation of a pre-nitrified leachate could represent an option to exploit the potential of SOFMSW to sustain biological activity, by obtaining a partial leachate denitrification in the landfill body.</p>
