<abstract>
<p>A comparative study has been carried out on microstructure, ultrahigh temperature tensile properties, and erosion behavior of non-equilibrated four-directional reinforced carbon/carbon composites, prepared using polyacrylonitrile based carbon fibers as the reinforcement and coal-tar pitch as the matrix, to assess the effect of microstructural changes on the properties of the composites in an ultrahigh temperature environment. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopic analyses suggest that the carbon matrix is highly graphitized, which is composed of mosaic and domain structures. The composites retain superior tensile properties with a visco-plastic behavior at ultrahigh temperature, which is consistent with the observation of mixed microstructural changes, crack propagation, and deflection as well as fiber debonding. The ablation behavior of non-equilibrated four-directional reinforced carbon/carbon composites is mainly dominated by thermo-chemical ablation and mechanical erosion, and different microstructures exhibit distinguished erosion mechanisms.</p>

<p>Four-directional reinforced carbon/carbon (shortly 4D C/C) composites are one of the most promising structural materials for high-temperature applications because of their high strength-to-weight ratio, resistance to thermal shock, and retention of strength at high temperature. Due to impressive high-temperature properties, C/C composites are suitable for application in throat nozzles, nose cones, and leading edges of hypersonic and re-entry type vehicles, which are exposed to elevated temperature environments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312441813">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312441813"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312441813"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312441813"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312441813"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312441813">6</xref></sup> At present, the most difficult problem for them to be used as thermal structural materials is their oxidation and erosion during exposure to a flaming atmosphere at high temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312441813">7</xref></sup> These degradation processes, resulting in a high interfacial mass transfer and performance degradation, induce a non-negligible influence on the high-temperature service.</p>
<p>A survey of literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312441813">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312441813"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312441813"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312441813"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312441813"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312441813"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312441813"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312441813">15</xref></sup> suggests that significant research has been carried out on the ordinary 2D and 3D C/C composites on their thermo-mechanical and erosion behaviors at high temperature. However, these properties of the 4D C/C composites are relatively less documented, and only limited information is available. Oh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312441813">16</xref></sup> reported the pore formation in 4D C/C composites prepared with different pressures. Sarkar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312441813">17</xref></sup> just studied the strength and fracture behavior of 2D, 3D, and 4D C/C composites at room temperature only. Their results showed that the tensile and flexural strengths of the C/C composites were related to fiber volume fraction. Fang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998312441813">18</xref></sup> studied the progressive damage and non-linear analysis of 4D braided composites under unidirectional tension using an anisotropic damage model with finite element method.

Lee and Joo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312441813">21</xref></sup> prepared a kind of 4D C/C composite by impregnation–carbonization processing at different pressures and assessed the effect of microstructural changes of the composites on ablation properties in a liquid rocket engine. Further investigation on the thermo-mechanical and erosion behaviors of 4D C/C composites for thermo-structure analysis and structure design of C/C parts at high temperature are of considerable importance.</p>
<p>So far, there have been few or no reports in which the microstructure of pitch hot-pressure impregnation–carbonization non-equilibrated 4D C/C composites is studied in an ultrahigh temperature tensile test and oxyacetylene flame ablation test. Our intent here is to carry out such an evaluation for both tests in parallel so as to obtain a better understanding on the degradation mechanisms of the material.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0021998312441813"><title>Material preparation</title>
<p>The non-equilibrated 4D C/C composites were prepared using polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based carbon fibers (JiLin Carbon Co., China) as the reinforcement and coal-tar pitch (JiLin Carbon Co., China) the matrix. To fabricate the preform of the composites as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312441813">Figure 1(a)</xref>, the rods intended for the reinforcement in the ‘fourth’ direction were made from bundles of fibers. They were stiffened, then impregnated in a phenolic resin, and burned at 300°C. The fiber bundle arrangements (without stiffening) present in the composites were laid out in three directions (1, 2, and 3) 120°apart, and the central carbon fiber rods were kept protruding in the ‘fourth’ direction. The diameter of the rod was controlled to 1.1 mm and the distance between the rods fixed to 3.2 mm. Furthermore, the net volume fraction of the carbon fibers in the 4D C/C composites is ca 56.6% (<italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>v</italic><sub>2</sub> = <italic>v</italic><sub>3</sub> = 11.2%, and <italic>v</italic><sub>4</sub> = 23.0%; <italic>v</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>v</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>v</italic><sub>3</sub>, and <italic>v</italic><sub>4</sub> are the fiber volume fractions along the directions 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively).

</fig></p>
<p>The non-equilibrated 4D C/C composites were fabricated through many repeated hot isostatic pressure impregnation and carbonization (HIPIC) processing cycles, including pressure impregnation, carbonization, and graphitization, whose objective is to achieve maximum densification and thus minimize the development of both open and closed porosity. The preforms were first impregnated with coal-tar pitch at 250°C for 3–5 h under a pressure of 0.1 MPa and carbonized at 1000°C for 2–10 h. Subsequently, the pitch-impregnated preforms were subjected at 650°C to hot isostatic pressing under 80–100 MPa pressure for 2–10 h. This was followed by carbonization at 1000°C for 2–10 h and graphitization at 2500°C for 210 h, both under 1 atm pressure. The HIPIC cycle is repeated four to six times to obtain 4D C/C composites with high density.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0021998312441813"><title>Tensile tests at elevated temperature</title>
<p>To study the tensile properties of non-equilibrated 4D C/C composites at elevated temperature, tensile test was performed on an ultrahigh temperature mechanical properties test system according to DqES383-2001 Standards. The tests were carried out at 2800°C with an upgrade heating rate of 500°C/s. Before load was applied, the samples had been held for 10 s to make sure that temperature distribution in them was homogeneous. The extension rate was 0.2 mm/min. The complete design of the tensile samples is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312441813">Figure 1(b)</xref>, and the test direction was parallel to the direction of the carbon fiber rods (the 4th direction). The extension strain of the sample at elevated temperature was accurately measured by a contact ultrahigh temperature extensometer. The number of specimens used in the tensile test was not less than five.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0021998312441813"><title>Ablation tests</title>
<p>According to the GJB 323 A-96 Standards of China for material testing, the ablation properties of non-equilibrated 4D C/C composites were tested with an oxyacetylene flame, which was parallel to the direction of the carbon fiber rods. Cylindrical samples (ϕ 30 mm × 10 mm) for ablation tests were machined from the composites. The pressure and flux of O<sub>2</sub> were 0.4 MPa and 0.42 L/s and those of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> 0.095 MPa and 0.31 L/s, respectively. The heat flux on the samples received from the flame was 4.2 MW/m<sup>2</sup>. The inner diameter of the nozzle was 2 mm, and the distance between the nozzle tip and the sample was 10 mm. The sample was fixed in a water-cooled copper concave fixture and exposed to the flame with an estimated temperature of 3000°C for 30, 60, 90, and 120 s in atmosphere, respectively. Both the mass and linear ablation rates were calculated by weight and height losses per unit time according to the formulas

<p>The microstructural features of the non-equilibrated 4D C/C composites were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), polarized light microscopy (PLM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The XRD was carried out on a Philips X'Pert MPD diffractometer using Cu as the anode material and graphite monochromator.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312441813">Figure 3</xref> shows the PLM and SEM analyses of the pitch-based 4D C/C composites. It is well known that the formation of cracks and voids is inevitable in pitch-based C/C composites during carbonization process because of the matrix shrinkage and decomposition of pitch matrix. The distribution of cracks and voids in 4D C/C composites is clearly shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312441813">Figure 3(a)</xref> to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312441813">c</xref>). It indicates that large-size pores and cracks are mainly formed in the matrix, resulting from the gaseous by-products of the pitch matrix decomposition after carbonization which are difficult to be released under HIPIC processing, and the tensile stress caused by the carbonization shrinkage. The voids in matrix are sphere like with a diameter of around 100–150 µm. Much smaller band-like pores (20–100 µm) can also be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312441813">Figure 3(a)</xref>; it is suggested that some gaseous by-products of the pitch matrix decomposition after carbonization will centralize at the fiber–matrix interface. Therefore, the strength of the fiber–matrix interface may be affected, which could weaken the mechanical properties and erosion resistance. Some small inter-fiber pores and cracks can also be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312441813">Figure 3(b) and (c)</xref> under a higher magnification. At the inner of both transverse and longitudinal fiber rods, some interspaces survive from the penetration of the pitch impregnant. Comparing with previous similar studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312441813">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312441813">21</xref></sup> it can be found that the use of high pressure during the densification process in preparing C/C composites reduced their pore size; so, the as-prepared non-equilibrated 4D C/C composites have lower porosity.

The mosaic structure was formed inside the fiber bundles and gaps between the adjacent bundles, and the domain structure around the carbon fiber rods. The structure of matrix carbon is thought to be related with the viscosity of coal-tar pitch, which is affected by the pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312441813">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312441813">22</xref></sup> Because the preform was first impregnated under a lower pressure (0.1 MPa), the viscosity of coal-tar pitch was low and the pitch was easy to fuse together; then, the domain structure was formed after carbonization. The mosaic structure was formed when the melting pitch spheres were difficult to coalesce together due to the increase in viscosity of coal-tar pitch during the high-pressure process.</p>

It is seen that the mechanical properties of the 4D C/C composites are better at an ultrahigh temperature environment, which is significant for the practical application of the composites.

<p>The fracture mechanism of the non-equilibrated 4D C/C composites at room temperature has been analyzed in our previous study;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998312441813">23</xref></sup> so, this article mainly focuses on the fracture mechanism at an elevated temperature. The SEM micrographs of fracture surface of the pitch-based 4D C/C composites after testing at elevated temperature are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312441813">Figure 5</xref>. It can be seen that layered fracture occurred between the carbon fiber bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312441813">Figure 5(a) and (c)</xref>), the fracture surface of carbon fiber rod is scraggly with fiber evulsion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312441813">Figure 5(e) and (f)</xref>), and the carbon matrix is broken under tensile stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312441813">Figure 5(b)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312441813">d</xref>)). The cracks and voids in the composites have great influence on the mechanical properties, because they are the points of the stress concentration, where the cracks are easily initiated and propagated, spreading along the weak interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312441813">Figure 5(d)</xref>). However, a part of cracks and voids may be healed, as well as the stress concentration may be released when the thermal expansion of the composites increases at elevated temperature. Hence, the mechanical properties of C/C composites are enhanced with the increase of temperature until a critical point.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312441813">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312441813">10</xref></sup> Moreover, edge effect is another factor that influences the mechanical properties of 4D C/C composites by modifying the local stress distribution near a free surface and leading to the formation of some cracks and delamination. It is found that some surface of carbon fiber bundles and matrix are covered with debris carbon that forms during the tensile test at elevated temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312441813">Figure 5(a) and (b)</xref>).

<p>It is well known that fiber content and orientation are the important factors for dominating the mechanical behavior of composites. During tensile test at elevated temperature, the initial thermal damage is of compressive nature, since the outer parts are dilated while the cooler interior maintains them under compression. Moreover, some studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312441813">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998312441813">24</xref></sup> suggest that the tensile strength of carbon fibers increases gradually with the increase of temperature up to 1500–1800°C and then weakens with further increase in temperature. It is logical to conjecture that the tensile strength of carbon fiber at 2800°C is lower than its maximum and the structure is well graphitized to a lamellar type. For 4D C/C composites, the carbon fiber bundles could perform their full reinforcement function as the test direction are vertical to their axial direction and layered fracture occurs. Some laminar avulsion could also be found on the surface of carbon fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312441813">Figure 5(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312441813">c</xref>)). It is suggested that the carbon fiber rods play a major role on the tensile strength of 4D C/C composites when their content is high (ca 23%) and their orientation is parallel to the test direction. The scraggly fracture surface of carbon fiber rod shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312441813">Figure 5(e)</xref> indicates that the fibers rupture gradually under tensile stress at 2800°C, exhibiting a visco-plastic behavior on the stress–strain curve. The lamellar structure could also be observed clearly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312441813">Figure 5(f)</xref>.</p>
<p>During the tensile process at elevated temperature, the failure mechanisms of 4D C/C composites can be explained as follows: first, the cracks and layered fracture patterns were easily initiated at the edge of fiber bundles under tensile stress, as ultrahigh temperature environment obviously affected the microstructure of the composites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312441813">Figure 5(a)</xref>). In addition, some microcracks and voids were inevitably present in the composites prepared using HIPIC process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312441813">Figure 3</xref>); they helped to initiate cracks under tensile stress; Second, the cracks propagated through the weak parts such as interfaces of fiber bundles and matrix during tensile test process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312441813">Figure 5(c) and (d)</xref>); and finally, the carbon fiber rods ruptured gradually until the failure of composites. The failure mode of the composites at elevated temperature was a visco-plastic fracture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312441813">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312441813">5(e)</xref>), which might be caused by the structure change of the carbon fibers at ultrahigh temperature. As a result, the composites exhibited higher tensile strength and rupture strain at elevated temperature.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0021998312441813"><title>Ablation of the composites</title>
<p>The ablation of materials is a synergistic effect of thermo-chemical ablation, thermo-physics ablation, and thermo-mechanical erosion. The C/C composites are composed of unitary carbon element with a melting temperature of ca 3727°C, which is higher than the ablation temperature of oxyacetylene flame (ca 3000°C). Hence, thermo-chemical ablation and mechanical erosion play major roles in the ablation behaviors of non-equilibrated 4D C/C composites.</p>
<p>Ablation rates of non-equilibrated 4D C/C composites under oxyacetylene flame environment are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312441813">Figure 6</xref>. Results show that the 4D C/C composites have excellent ablation properties: the mass and linear ablation rates after 120 s ablation are 2.04 × 10<sup>−3</sup> g/s and 3.92 × 10<sup>−3 </sup>mm/s, respectively, which are lower than the results reported by Lee and Joo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312441813">21</xref></sup> and Shameel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998312441813">25</xref></sup> A drop of both mass and linear ablation rates has been observed after an ablation time for 60 s at 3000°C. The ablation rate seems to be related with the changes of microstructures during the ablation process.

<p>The cracks and voids, structure of the matrix, carbon fibers, and fiber–matrix interfaces are the main factors which control the ablation behavior of C/C composites. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312441813">Figure 7</xref> shows the SEM micrographs of the pitch-based 4D C/C composites after ablation at 3000°C. The erosion morphology consisting of cracks, voids, and fiber–matrix interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312441813">Figure 7(a)</xref>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312441813">c</xref>), and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312441813">e</xref>)) indicates that grievous erosion has occurred at these points, and the sizes of cracks and voids are enlarged after ablation. The presence of cracks and voids could increase the inner surface in the composites, and they become active points in erosion process for the adsorption and reaction with oxygen. It is similar at fiber–matrix interface with weak bonding. On the other hand, it is deduced that some matrixes around the cracks, voids, and weak fiber–matrix interface are weak and loose, which are easy to be eroded under the comprehensive effect of gas erosion and the thermal stress in the samples when being rapidly heated to 3000°C. Moreover, this weak matrix is also easily eroded due to the thermal damage caused by the compressive stresses mentioned in the previous section. So, the ablation rate of the composite is higher at the first 30 s and has a little decrease after the initial denudation. It is concluded that the erosion behavior of 4D C/C composites is controlled by thermo-mechanical erosion at the beginning stage of ablation.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312441813">Figure 7(a)</xref>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312441813">b</xref>), and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312441813">d</xref>) shows the erosion microstructures of the carbon matrix. It seems that the ablation mechanisms of the two typical matrix structures are different. The matrix in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312441813">Figure 7(b)</xref> still maintains a mosaic structure and there is no hole on the erosion surface. The mosaic structure may dissipate the heat generated from oxyacetylene flame, resulting in only a small portion of the carbon matrix being removed mainly by thermo-chemical reaction. Inspection of the domain structure after ablation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312441813">Figure 7(d)</xref> indicates that the interspace between the layers seems to be widened and disrupted, and that voids are also formed at the edge of the domain structure. They are caused by the erosion and shear failure originated from the high-velocity and high-pressure gas flow. Hence, the lamellar structure of the domain matrix has been significantly changed after ablation. The above analysis suggests that thermo-chemical ablation plays a major role in the erosion of carbon matrix and the ablation rate of the mosaic structure is lower than that of the domain one. With further erosion of carbon matrix, there is an increase in ablation rate when ablation is more than 30 s, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312441813">Figure 6</xref>. From this moment, the ablation rate increases again because of a new mechanical erosion mechanism: the surface roughness has become larger, and protruding features may be removed mechanically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312441813">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>SEM micrographs of carbon fibers are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312441813">Figure 7(e) and (f)</xref>. It is clear that the erosion of carbon fiber rods is more serious than that of carbon fiber bundles due to their different orientations. The direction of carbon fiber rods is parallel to the flame, resulting in the direct exposure of cracks, voids, and fiber–fiber interface in fiber rods to the flame, and the formation of erosion holes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312441813">Figure 7(e)</xref>). The weak parts around the defects (such as voids, cracks, and interfaces) undergo localized failure by the compressive stress on the surface caused by temperature gradients at the beginning of ablation. Moreover, weak parts and as-formed damaged zones are easily eroded and blown away by the high-velocity and high-pressure gas flow. Hence, thermo-mechanical attack from the flame is more important for carbon fiber rods than thermo-chemical ablation. However, the direction of carbon fiber bundles is vertical to the flame; so, only the side face of the fiber bundles could be exposed to the flame. Hence, thermo-mechanical erosion to fiber bundles is poor and thermo-chemical ablation plays a major role. Fibers in bundles take a needle-like shape after ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312441813">Figure 7(f)</xref>).</p>

<p>The microstructure, ultrahigh temperature tensile properties, and erosion resistance of non-equilibrated 4D C/C composites, prepared using PAN-based carbon fibers as reinforcement and coal-tar pitch as matrix by hot isostatic pressing, have been comprehensively evaluated. Cracks and voids are widely distributed in the composites, and the carbon matrix is composed of mosaic and domain structures.</p>
<p>The composites retain superior mechanical properties in ultrahigh temperature environment. The tensile strength in carbon fiber rod direction is 47.93 MPa and the failure mode of the material at elevated temperature is visco-plastic fracture. SEM analysis suggests that the visco-plastic behavior is consistent with the observation of mixed microstructural changes, crack propagation and deflection, as well as fiber debonding at elevated temperature. The fiber content and orientation have a great influence on the mechanical behavior of the non-equilibrated 4D C/C composites.</p>
<p>Erosion results show that the non-equilibrated 4D C/C composites have excellent ablation properties: the mass and linear ablation rates after 120 s ablation is 2.04 × 10<sup>−3</sup> g/s and 3.92 × 10<sup>−3 </sup>mm/s, respectively. Microstructure analysis suggests that cracks, voids, and weak fiber–matrix interfaces are easy to be eroded. The ablation rate of mosaic structure is lower than that of the domain one. Erosion of carbon fiber rods is more serious than that of carbon fiber bundles due to their different orientations. Thermo-chemical ablation and mechanical erosion play major roles in the ablation behaviors of non-equilibrated 4D C/C composites.</p>
