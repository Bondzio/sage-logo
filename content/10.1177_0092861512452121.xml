            <p>This article outlines the importance of herbal dietary supplements regulation by providing a brief overview of history of supplement regulation in the US with emphasis placed on passage of the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) and post-DSHEA enforcement actions. This review also addresses international aspects of dietary supplement regulatory processes. The controversy surrounding the separation of structure/function claims from health claims is examined. Safety issues are summarized and the following proposals are offered to improve the herbal dietary supplements regulatory system. First, herbal dietary supplements should be subject to more strict regulation by the FDA, which means treating them more like pharmaceuticals and not like food. Only pre-market approval can guarantee consumer access to safe and effective product. Second, a suggested simplified procedure allows the registration of a traditional herbal dietary supplement. Third, due to the compositional diversity and complexity of botanical substances, every new submission of nontraditional herbal supplement must be processed on a case-by-case basis. Fourth, a mandatory post-marketing reporting system of all adverse events should be established rather than the current serious adverse event reporting scheme. And finally, legislative reform is needed to change the regulatory system of dietary supplements.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>In 1994 the US Congress enacted the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512452121">1</xref>
            </sup> The law created a new liberalized regulatory framework for the safety and labeling of dietary supplements and separated them from drugs and conventional foods. According to the DSHEA definition,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512452121">1</xref>
            </sup> a <italic>dietary supplement</italic> is “a product (other than tobacco) that is intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: a vitamin, a mineral, a herb or other botanical, an amino acid, a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing total daily intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract or combination of these ingredients.” Dietary supplements come in a variety of forms such as tablets, capsules, liquids, soft gels, or powders.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512452121">1</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>DSHEA places dietary supplements in a special intermediate product group “under the general umbrella of foods” rather than drugs and requires that every supplement be labeled as a dietary supplement so they are not confused with conventional food or food additives.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512452121">2</xref>
            </sup> Under the act’s classifications, all dietary supplements bypass the need to receive pre-market review and approval by FDA for use as food or food additives. Manufacturers of dietary supplements, unlike manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, are not required to provide evidence of safety and efficacy based on rigorous pre-market clinical testing. Nor are they required to register or obtain FDA approval before their products reach consumers. DSHEA places the burden on the FDA to prove that a “dietary supplement presents a significant or unreasonable risk or illness or injury” prior to any marketplace removal.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512452121">3</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>The only exception to this standard is that manufacturers of “new dietary ingredients” (those not marketed in US before October 15, 1994) must notify the FDA at least “75 days before being introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce.”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512452121">1</xref>
            </sup> Manufacturers must provide the agency with information that the dietary ingredient, when used under the recommended condition, is “reasonably expected to be safe.”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512452121">4</xref>
            </sup> This standard is not difficult as “manufacturers are only obligated to provide some evidence of safety,” which could include any citation from published articles. They are not required to show that a new ingredient is safe based on solid scientific evidence.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512452121">5</xref>
            </sup> This process is a notification provision only and it does not require, as with drugs, pre-market approval from FDA. Furthermore, the 75-day mechanism has minimal impact at protecting consumers as so few ingredients are subject to it. For example, in the last 16 years FDA received only 700 new dietary ingredient notifications compared to the ∼55,600 dietary supplement products currently available on the market.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512452121">4</xref>
            </sup> Identification of risk by the FDA relies primarily on post-market surveillance practices such as monitoring serious adverse event reports.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512452121">6</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>The passage of the Dietary Supplement and Non-Prescription Consumer Protection Act in 2006 made it mandatory for manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements to collect and report serious adverse events through the FDA’s MedWatch + program. Although FDA has received a greater number of adverse reports since the requirement went into effect on December 22, 2007, underreporting remains a concern. According to a US Government Accounting Office (GAO) report, the reason why underreporting occurs is because many consumers believe that all dietary supplements are safe, use those products without the supervision of medical professionals, fail to recognize possible cumulative toxic effects, are dissatisfied with the serious adverse event reporting system, or believe that FDA regulates supplements.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512452121">7</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>For the FDA to be aware of harmful effects from dietary supplements, however, large numbers of events need to be reported. More complete reporting is important because records on less serious events can be crucial in identifying long-term health-related effects or toxicity from repeated uncontrolled use of supplements that may not cause immediate serious effects. Since manufacturers do not have to register their product prior to marketing them, the FDA has limited information on the number and location of the manufacturers and distributors, the types of supplement currently available in the market, and information about moderate and mild adverse events.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512452121">8</xref>
            </sup> Routine monitoring of dietary supplements is among the lower priorities of the FDA, below that of other FDA-regulated products. According to Office of Inspector General,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512452121">9</xref>
            </sup> Department of Health and Human Services dietary supplements are subject to less regulation than drugs, food additives, biologics, or medical devices.</p>

            <title>Marketing an Herbal Product in the US</title>
            <p>In the US, herbal products can be a food, a dietary supplement, a drug, as well as a medical device (eg, gutta-perch) or a cosmetic depending on its labeling and intended use.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512452121">10</xref>
               </sup> Any herbal products ingested primarily for sustenance or taste, aroma, and nutritional values are regulated as foods (21 U.S.C. 312(f)(1)). An herbal product that is intended for use in “preventing, diagnosing, mitigating, treating, or curing disease” is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B). An herbal drug may be marketed in the US under an over-the-counter (OTC) drug monograph “if product has been marketed in the United States for a material time and to a material extent for a specific OTC drug indication,” or new drug application (NDA) “if evidence of safety and efficacy or the proposed indication would not be appropriate for OTC use,” or an approved abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) if it is a generic herbal drug.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512452121">10</xref>
               </sup> Finally, “if available information is not sufficient to support an NDA for a botanical drug,” an investigational new drug (IND) submission is required. The sponsor will need to demonstrate that it is reasonable to begin clinical tests of a new botanical drug on humans.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512452121">10</xref>
               </sup>
            </p>
            <p>“If the intended use of the herbal product is to affect body’s structure or function, it may be regulated either as a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of Act (21 U.S.C. 321(ff)) or as a drug, depending on the circumstances” and FDA’s interpretation of the statute.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512452121">10</xref>
               </sup>
            </p>
            <p>According to the law, if an herbal product is intended to reduce risk of a disease or health-related condition, it is also a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B), “except that a product that bears a health claim authorized in accordance with section 403(r) of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(3)) is not a drug solely because its labeling contains such a claim.”<sup>

         <title>Labeling Claims Under the DSHEA</title>
         <p>Labeling and promotional claims are one of the more controversial issues of the dietary supplement regulatory system. By law, manufacturers may make only three types of claims for dietary supplement products.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512452121">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512452121">11</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>The first type of label claim is nutrient content. This claim describes the level of a nutrient in dietary supplements. The second type of claim is a structure/function claim. This term describes “the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the body’s structure or function, including its overall effect on a person’s ‘general well-being.’” The third type of claim is a health claim. This claim shows a link between a food or substance and “reducing risk of a disease or health-related condition.”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512452121">11</xref>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512452121"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092861512452121">13</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>In contrast to nutrient content claims and disease/health claims, which must be preapproved by the FDA, structure/function claims do not require pre-market approval and, according to the law, must be accompanied by the following disclaimer: “This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512452121">1</xref>
            </sup> Supplement manufacturers that wish to make structure/function claims must only notify the FDA within 30 days of initial marketing. The DSHEA also requires that a manufacturer of a dietary supplement containing a statement of nutritional support on its label must have “substantiation that such statement is truthful and not misleading.”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512452121">1</xref>
            </sup> As a result, consumers are dependent on manufacturers to assure that structure/function statements are substantiated for efficacy. Actual practice, however, shows that some claims are supported by only inconclusive studies or little scientific evidence.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092861512452121">14</xref>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092861512452121"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092861512452121">16</xref>
            </sup> This raises serious issues of “having a product on the market that claims particular effects, but has the potential for being completely erroneous, yet will still fall completely within the bounds of DSHEA.”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092861512452121">17</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Much controversy has arisen when trying to distinguish structure/function claims, which do not require FDA premarket approval, from health claims, which are subject to review and marketing authorization by the agency. Companies have used this regulatory loophole to make structure/function claims for medicinal substances but sell them under a dietary supplements label. For example, Pharmanex’s cholesterol-lowering product Cholestin was sold as a dietary supplement. In May of 1996, the FDA declared Cholestin an unapproved new drug that was in violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&amp;C) Act.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092861512452121">18</xref>
            </sup> According to the FDA’s findings, a component of Cholestin, mevinolen, was the equivalent of lovastatin, the active ingredient of Merck’s prescription hypercholesterolemia drug, Mevacor. Moreover, the agency found that since mevinolen was not sold as a dietary supplement or food item before it approved Mevacor for sale as a drug, Cholestin may not be marketed under the DSHE Act of 1994.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092861512452121">18</xref>
            </sup> The matter was litigated in federal court in Utah. The district court ruled in favor of drug company, finding that “under the plain language of the law,” Cholestin fits the legal definition of dietary supplement. The judge rejected FDA’s contention that the product is a drug. In 2000, the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit upheld the FDA’s ban on Cholestin, agreeing with the agency’s argument that it was legally a drug rather than dietary supplement.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0092861512452121">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0092861512452121">20</xref>
            </sup> While the Cholestin case may be closed, the battleground has now moved to other dietary supplements.</p>
         <p>In 2011, FDA denied OVOS Natural Health Inc.’s new dietary ingredient (NDI) application for approval of the amino acid homotaurine as an ingredient in dietary supplements because it was not considered a dietary ingredient under section 201(ff)(1)(E) of the FD&amp;C Act. FDA concluded that “homotaurine is not an amino acid under Section 201(ff)(1)(D) because it is a gamma-amino sulfonic acid, and not an alpha-amino carboxylic acid or a constituent of proteins.”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092861512452121">21</xref>
            </sup> “Although homotaurine occurs naturally in some plants, OVOS’s homotaurine was not a botanical or extract thereof because it was made synthetically.”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092861512452121">21</xref>
            </sup> Interestingly, OVOS previously opened but discontinued an IND application for homotaurine after completing a 78-week clinical trial.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092861512452121">21</xref>
            </sup> They then decided to market it as a dietary supplement. Thus, “OVOS would have become the first company to have an ingredient officially switched from drug to dietary supplements” because they were not satisfied with the clinical trial results.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092861512452121">21</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>The problem is that structure/function claims that are available for dietary supplements are also available “as a matter of law for prescription drugs and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs.”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0092861512452121">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0092861512452121">23</xref>
            </sup> This idea should be clear by reviewing the legal definition of “drug.” Two (of four) definitions of drug include “(B) articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; and (C) articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0092861512452121">22</xref>
            </sup>

A large percentage of the US population uses dietary supplements on daily basis in an attempt to improve their quality of life or for their nutritional benefits. Some of the reasons include: to enhance personal appearance, to improve athletic performance, to make up for nutrients missing in the food, to avoid the harmful or unpleasant side effects associated with drugs and conventional treatment, and to lower risk for certain diseases or health conditions. Herbal dietary supplements, in particular, are taken for reasons other than nutrition. Some consumers take herbs and botanicals as an alternative to conventional medical therapies in an attempt to manage the symptoms of serious or chronic illnesses or treat and prevent age-related conditions.<sup>

         <p>The most problematic aspect of DSHEA regarding safety issues is its “reactive approach.” It limits the FDA’s ability to remove unsafe dietary supplements from the market before damage has been done.

            <title>Nontraditional Herbal Products Regulation</title>
            <p>The current FDA regulatory framework offers two pathways of pre-market safety submissions of dietary ingredients: NDI notification and Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) self-affirmation (notification). Under section 201(s) and 409 of the FD&amp;C Act, a food substance may have GRAS status either through the history of common use in foods before 1958 (under 21 CFR 170.30(c) and 170.3(f)) or “through scientific procedure” (under 21 CFR 170.30(b).<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0092861512452121">84</xref>
               </sup> NDI notification is necessary for each new ingredients formulated after October 1994.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0092861512452121">85</xref>
               </sup> In addition, according to FDA’s new Draft Guidance for Industry (if adopted) even pre-1994 (“grandfathered”) ingredients must receive new approvals from FDA if they are produced by changing their chemical composition or structure.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512452121">4</xref>
               </sup> Manufacturers must independently supply all the research and documentation required to support the safety and efficacy of new ingredient.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512452121">4</xref>
               </sup> In contrast to GRAS notification (self-affirmation), NDI notification is mandatory. Because of complexities and loopholes of voluntary GRAS notification process, a manufacturer can use GRAS pathway to market synthetic versions of herbal substance (which is not equivalent to the natural counterpart and not a dietary supplement under 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(1)(F)<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512452121">4</xref>
               </sup> to be exempt from the NDI notification). Moreover, any novel substances with no prior appearance or use in food may qualify for a GRAS status, which inevitably has raised safety concerns. Avoiding such precedents, nontraditional herbal dietary supplement must receive pre-market approval by FDA, which is an important preventive mechanism that guarantees consumer access to safe and effective product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092861512452121">Figure 1</xref>)</p>
            <p>Due to the compositional diversity and complexity of botanical substances, every new submission of nontraditional herbal supplement has to be processed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Dietary supplements are an intermediate class of products caught between conventional foods and drugs whose popularity continues to grow at an unprecedented pace. Although there are many benefits associated with the use of dietary supplements, we cannot be sure that the benefits outweigh the risks unless we know more about the safety, efficacy, and quality of these products. An examination of the regulation of food supplements around the world indicates that all countries have systems that require governmental approval for safety and efficacy prior to marketing. The blurred boundary between drugs and dietary supplements and permissive interpretation of health claims will inevitably trigger legal debates and enable the manufacturer to resist removal efforts by FDA, even if the dietary supplement may be harmful.</p>
         <p>This paper has discussed some suggestions that might be more feasible to all parties of DSHEA regulatory scheme—consumer, manufacturer, and FDA—to reach consensus. A suggested procedure allows the registration and approval of a traditional herbal dietary supplement without proving its safety and efficacy and it aims to remove the uncertainties about the legitimacy of health claims if a product goes through traditional regulatory submission. This approach would also help to achieve a compromise between the conflicting interests of consumer safety and consumer choice.</p>
