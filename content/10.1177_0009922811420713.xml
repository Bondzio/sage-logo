<p>This study evaluates the impact of coverage in ALL Kids, the Alabama Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP), by examining asthma-related utilization and outcomes among children continuously enrolled for 3 years (N = 1954)with persistent asthma at enrollment. Outcomes and costs were compared for the first, second, and third years of enrollment using repeated measures analysis of variance and controlling for age, gender, and year fixed-effects. Compared with subsequent years, first year enrollment utilization was higher for asthma-related hospitalizations (6% vs 2% vs 2%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) and emergency visits (10% vs 3% vs 2%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Also decreasing were asthma-related outpatient visits (1.46 vs 1.12 vs 0.94; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), quick-relief prescriptions (2.6 vs 2.2 vs 2.1; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), and long-term control prescriptions (5.8 vs 5.2 vs 4.4; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). As a result, significant declines in the mean costs per child were observed. Ongoing ALL Kids coverage is associated with improved disease-management and lower costs for persistent asthma.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Researchers and policy makers have long been interested in evaluating the impact of public insurance coverage. Many evaluative studies have focused on Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) populations. For example, the inception of CHIP was associated with a significant decrease in uninsured children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811420713">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811420713">2</xref></sup>; and among enrollees, a reduction in unmet health care needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811420713">3</xref></sup> Studies of either CHIP and/or Medicaid programs have found that enrollment was associated with increased utilization of physician services<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811420713">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811420713">5</xref></sup> and a sizable and significant reduction in child mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811420713">4</xref></sup> In light of the recent reauthorization and expansion of CHIP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811420713">6</xref></sup> evaluating the impact of various aspects of CHIP coverage becomes increasingly important.</p>
<p>Among studies examining the impact of Medicaid or CHIP, few studies have focused specifically on children with chronic conditions. Those that have, focused generally on a collective group of children with any chronic condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811420713">3</xref></sup> or special needs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811420713">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811420713">8</xref></sup>; or those with specific conditions such as a mental health disorder,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811420713">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811420713">10</xref></sup> or asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811420713">11</xref></sup> Asthma is particularly important to study for several reasons. First, it is among the most prevalent chronic disease of childhood affecting 6% of U.S. children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922811420713">12</xref></sup> Second, access to good care can significantly reduce complications of asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811420713">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811420713">14</xref></sup> Third, when complications occur, they increase costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811420713">15</xref></sup> and may severely affect parental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811420713">16</xref></sup> and child<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922811420713">17</xref></sup> quality of life as well as be disruptive to the educational development of children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922811420713">18</xref></sup> Szilagyi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811420713">11</xref></sup> evaluated the impact of the New York State CHIP on children with asthma and, based on self-reported data collected before and after enrollment, reported improved access to a usual source of care and fewer asthma complications. Despite the importance of studying the impact of CHIP coverage on children with asthma, no other recent studies have used alternative data sources representing other geographic locations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of ALL Kids (the Alabama CHIP) coverage on the outcomes of children with Asthma. We use robust longitudinal claims data to examine asthma-related outcomes, including costs and quality of care for children with persistent asthma. Successful management of asthma, in particular, requires ongoing and stable access to care. Thus, our study examines the impact of coverage on children enrolled for at least a 3-year period. Ultimately, our results shed light on the impact of a public insurance program on a particularly vulnerable population; low income children with a chronic disease living in a relatively poor state. As such, our findings will be of interest to policy makers, pediatricians, maternal child health advocates, and public insurance program directors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922811420713" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This is a retrospective cohort study using ALL Kids claims data representing 1998-2009 from the state of Alabama. We hypothesize that enrolling in CHIP results in improved access to care which over time, should help children with asthma avoid complications of their disease including costly hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits. Stable and ongoing health care coverage is a key component of the “medical home” concept, and thus should be considered when examining the impact of coverage on outcomes. Thus, we expect that compared to their first year of coverage, enrollees in the second and third years should have fewer asthma complications and costs. Below is a description of the population we study, our claims-based definition of asthma, the outcomes of interest, and the statistical analyses we employ.</p>
<p>Claims data represent all health care transactions for which the insurer (e.g., ALL Kids) was billed. This includes all inpatient and outpatient encounters, as well as pharmacy, medical equipment, ambulance, and other health care utilization. Starting with the universe of all Alabama CHIP enrollees (n = 252 381) who were covered from 1998 (the program’s inception) to 2009, we identified all children continuously enrolled for at least 3 years (n = 54 181). Next, we applied the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) definition for persistent asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811420713">19</xref></sup> Persistent asthma was defined as meeting at least 1 of the following criteria: (<italic>a</italic>) having at least 1 visit to the emergency department with a primary diagnosis of asthma, (<italic>b</italic>) having at least 1 hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of asthma, (<italic>c</italic>) having at least 4 outpatient visits with primary diagnoses of asthma and filled at least 2 prescriptions for asthma medication within a 1-year period, or (4) having filled at least 4 prescriptions for asthma medication within a 1-year period. Children with asthma were identified using ICD-9-CM codes: 493, 493.0, 493.00, 493.01, 493.1, 493.10, 493.11, 493.9, 493.90, 493.91. Consistent with the literature, children were excluded if they ever had a primary diagnosis code for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ICD-9-CM codes 496, 496.0, 496.00, 496.01, 493.2, 493.20, 493.21) or cystic fibrosis (ICD-9-CM codes 277, 277.0, 277.00, 277.01).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922811420713">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>A total of 1954 individuals were continuously enrolled for at least 3 years and met the definition for persistent asthma at enrollment. These enrollees made up the cohort of our analysis. For each of the 3 years of enrollment, we calculated the number (and costs) of inpatient, outpatient, and emergency visits for asthma. An asthma-related visit was any visit whose primary diagnosis was asthma as defined above. Moreover, we calculated the number (and costs) of asthma medications in 2 categories: quick-relief, and long-term control medications. Based on the National Drug Code (NDC) directory, quick-relief medications were primarily short-acting inhaled β-2 agonists. Long-term control medications were those medications fitting within the following broader classes based on mechanism: antibody inhibitors, inhaled corticosteroids/steroid combinations, leukotriene modifiers, long-acting β-2 agonists, and mast cell stabilizers. Depending on the delivery method and formulation, antiasthmatic combinations and methylxanthines were determined to be either quick-relief or long-term control medications.</p>
<p>Finally, in addition to asthma-related visits and costs, we calculated non-asthma costs associated with inpatient, outpatient, emergency, and drug utilization. Costs were defined as CHIP payments plus any required copayments. All cost data were inflation adjusted to constant 2008 dollars using the U.S. Department of Labor’s Consumer Price Index, All Items.</p>
<p>In an attempt to quantify any potential selection bias resulting from imposing the 3-year consecutive enrollment restriction, we compared the final analysis cohort with a cohort of children enrolled for only 2 years. There were no observable differences among demographic characteristics or outcome variables among these groups.</p>
<p>We began by analyzing the data, by year of enrollment, using repeated measures analysis of variance. Next, we constructed repeated measures regression models that allowed us to examine the difference in outcomes by year of enrollment (year 1 vs years 2 and 3) after controlling for enrollee age, gender, and calendar year of enrollment. Age was categorized as 0 to 4, 5 to 11 (the reference category), and 12 to 19 years of age to be consistent with the National Heart, Lung, Blood Institute recommendations for the management of asthma in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811420713">14</xref></sup> Calendar year included years inclusive of 1998 to 2008 and was incorporated in the model to control for unobserved characteristics that may be associated with trends in asthma utilization and costs over time. All data management and analysis was performed in SAS version 9.2. Statistical significance was considered at the <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 level. The protocol described received human subject’s approval from our university’s institutional review board.</p>

<p>Demographic and descriptive characteristics of the included sample are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922811420713">Table 1</xref>. A majority of the sample was male (60.5%), with an average age of 7.4 years at enrollment. The largest proportion of enrollees were between 5 and 12 years old at enrollment (60.8%). Consistent with the growth of the ALL Kids program, 2006 was the year with the largest number of children meeting the inclusion criteria. Finally, the predominant HEDIS criterion for which enrollees were included was having 4 medication claims for asthma; this criterion represented 88% of the children included.</p>

<p>Non-asthma-related costs, by year of enrollment, are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922811420713">Table 3</xref>. Non-asthma-related inpatient and outpatient costs were higher in year 1 for enrollees with persistent asthma. However, no differences existed for non-asthma-related emergency, “other,” and non-asthma medication costs. Overall, total non-asthma costs were significantly higher in the first year of enrollment for enrollees with persistent asthma ($2607 vs $2397 vs $2300; <italic>P</italic> = .023).</p>

<title>Findings Adjusted for Gender, Age, and Calendar Year</title>
<p>When controlling for gender, age, and calendar year of enrollment, differences in utilization and costs between year 1 and subsequent years largely remained significantly different (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0009922811420713">Table 4</xref>). For example, compared with year 1 of enrollment, the number of asthma-related inpatient stays in year 2 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and year 3 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) were significantly lower. The trends noted in unadjusted analyses remained in all cases except “other” asthma-related costs where the differences by year of enrollment were no longer significant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0009922811420713">Table 4</xref>). Additionally, in the case of outpatient visits only, the frequency for year 2 was significantly greater than that for year 3 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05). This suggests that the number of outpatient visits with a primary diagnosis of asthma declined with every additional year of enrollment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study was designed to examine the impact of CHIP enrollment on the outcomes and costs of care for children with asthma. By examining a cohort of individuals with persistent asthma on enrollment that were continuously enrolled for at least 3 years, we were able to examine how utilization and costs change with stable and ongoing coverage for children with this chronic disease.</p>
<p>The main findings of our study is that ALL Kids enrollment is beneficial to children with asthma in so much as stable ongoing coverage is associated with a reduction in asthma-related health care utilization; and a significant reduction in asthma related costs. Asthma-related hospitalizations and ED visits, both commonly considered outcomes of poor asthma management, were decreased significantly after the first year of ALL Kids enrollment in both adjusted and unadjusted models. Reducing hospitalizations and ED visits for asthma decrease the likelihood of mortality,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811420713">14</xref></sup> reduces family stress,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811420713">16</xref></sup> and can significantly improve the quality of life for children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922811420713">17</xref></sup> Thus, our data show that children in Alabama with persistent asthma greatly benefit from CHIP enrollment.</p>
<p>Commensurate with the reduction in hospitalizations and ED visits, we observed a significant reduction in inflation-adjusted asthma-related costs by year of coverage. Asthma-related costs for inpatient, outpatient, ED, medications, and “other,” all were significantly lower in the second and third years of ALL Kids coverage. Non-asthma inpatient and outpatient cost were also lower presumably because when enrollees access services for asthma-related purposes, they often receive care (and advice) on non-asthma issues as well. Not surprisingly though, non-asthma-related ED visits and non-asthma medication costs were not different by year of coverage for children with asthma.</p>
<p>In our study, asthma-related outpatient visits and “other” asthma-related health utilization also decreased (in terms of both number of visits and overall costs) after the first year of enrollment. In the case of outpatient visits, the significant trend continued into year 3. Previous research has found that CHIP enrollment increases access to a usual source of care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922811420713">21</xref></sup> Our study focused exclusively on continuously enrolled children and thus had access to a usual source of care. Our findings suggest that ongoing coverage and access to outpatient services may help educate individuals about their asthma and make them better able to self-manage their disease. As such, the reduction in the number outpatient visits and medication use for asthma is observed.</p>
<p>Despite the new information provided by the current study, several limitations are worth discussing. First, although the use of claims data provides for a longitudinal and comprehensive view of health care utilization, claims data by definition lack the clinical richness of medical chart data. Thus, our ability to identify children with persistent asthma, and their adverse outcomes, are limited by data available in the claims record. Claims data have known limitations, including coding errors, and may not always reflect exactly what occurred in the clinical setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811420713">22</xref></sup> Nevertheless, although the HEDIS definition for claims-based persistent asthma has known biases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922811420713">23</xref></sup>; researchers have found that the 4 or more medication dispensing events criterion (representing 88% of our data) minimizes bias in persistent asthma identification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922811420713">24</xref></sup> Restricting the analysis to children continuously enrolled in Alabama CHIP for at least 3 years could be a source of selection bias if children who maintain enrollment in the program differ than those enrolled for lesser periods of time. However, we were able to determine this not to be a source of bias between children enrolled for 2 years as compared with 3. As the scope of this study was to generalize only toward asthmatic children with stable, ongoing access to care, generalizations to children with noncontinuous enrollment in CHIP should be cautioned. Last, our study focuses on CHIP enrollees in Alabama only. In the state, CHIP is distinct from Medicaid in that CHIP is administered as a free-for-service plan in conjunction with the provider network and fee schedule of a private insurance company. As a result, children enrolled in Alabama CHIP may not be perceived by providers in the same way that those covered by Medicaid may be. Thus, the generalizability of these findings to other geographic locations and other populations, including Medicaid, must be done with caution.</p>
<p>Given the recent reauthorization and expansion of CHIP, increased evaluative attention on various aspects of the program will be ongoing. Given the findings of the current analysis, children with asthma who are eligible for CHIP should be encouraged to maintain coverage in order to reduce asthma-related costs and improve the quality of asthma care. Future research should examine if similar benefits are observed when CHIP enrollees maintain stable coverage for sustained periods of time but through different insurance carriers (e.g., Medicaid, private insurance).</p>
