<abstract>
<p>In response to Stueber’s “Varieties of Empathy, Neuroscience, and the Narrativist Challenge to the Contemporary Theory of Mind Debate,” I identify three areas for further discussion: the frame problem, diversity, and an altogether different variety of empathy.</p>

<p>Although I agree with a number of points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754073911421382">Stueber (2012)</xref> makes in his attempt to develop a non-Cartesian, simulationist account of empathy and social cognition, I disagree more generally with his simulationist approach. For the purposes of this short commentary, I highlight three areas where I think further debate would be beneficial.</p>
<p>First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754073911421382">Stueber (2012)</xref> rightly mentions that theory theory runs into a frame problem, or what I have called the “starting problem” of social cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754073911421382">Gallagher, in press</xref>). I agree wholeheartedly with his Aristotelian-Wittgensteinian observations on this point, but I note that simulation theory (ST) has the same starting problem. This is clear from the first step in the simulation process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754073911421382">Goldman (2005</xref>, pp. 80–81) characterizes it this way: “First, the attributor creates in herself pretend states intended to match those of the target.” Stueber’s characterization is similar: “<italic>A matching phase</italic> in which I imaginatively adopt your perspective of the world by entertaining your beliefs and desires …” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754073911421382">Stueber, 2012</xref>, p. 57). As a first step in the simulation process this seems rather tricky. How do I know what pretend belief or desire matches what <italic>you</italic> have in mind. Indeed, isn’t this what simulation is supposed to deliver? If I already know what state matches the target, then the problem of understanding others, as defined by ST, would already be solved.</p>
<p>Stueber acknowledges that to get the simulation off the ground in any particular situation, I have to draw on a rich store of narratives, and on the massive hermeneutical background that informs my understanding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1754073911421382">1</xref></sup> That is, I have a sense of how to understand others, in their particular situations, on the basis of a specific kind of narrative practice. ST doesn’t say much about this; it doesn’t explain how we get this background, what sort of thing it is, or how precisely it comes into play when we attempt to use e-imagination or simulation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073911421382">Stueber (2008)</xref> suggests that the importance of narrative is simply to provide “hints and clues” to enhance the empathetic reenactment process. I suggest that reliance on narrative competency actually reduces the need for simulation and displaces it as the primary explanation of everyday social cognition and empathy. The fact that narrative resources already provide a starting sense of what the other person is doing specifies our further understanding as a more hermeneutically enriched and nonsimulationist narrative practice.</p>
<p>Second, narrative solves another problem encountered by ST: the diversity problem. Simulation depends specifically on one’s own first-person experience. As Stueber puts it: “I can say something on their behalf only if I understand how I could say something on my behalf in their situation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754073911421382">Stueber, 2012</xref>, p. 60). According to ST, we depend on our own prior experience to have a sense of what the other person may be thinking in a particular situation. We start with our own experience and project some tentative empathic conception of what must be going on in the other’s mind. “In all cases, observing what other people do or feel is transformed into an inner representation of what we would do or feel in a similar, endogenously produced, situation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754073911421382">Keysers &amp; Gazzola, 2006</xref>, p. 394). But how does knowing what <italic>we</italic> would do help us know what someone else would do? Indeed, many times we are in a situation where we see what someone is doing, and know that we would do it differently, or perhaps not do it at all. Given the vast variety of actions, beliefs, experiences, and feelings, that people experience, it seems presumptuous to suggest that one’s own limited first-person experience is capable of capturing that diversity. Can our own experiences, no matter how extensive, ever meet the diversity of experiences had by the many others that we encounter, even in our own culture?</p>
<p>A narrative approach addresses the diversity question by suggesting that we understand others, even those who live in faraway lands and who are very different, only when we can frame their behavior in a narrative that informs us about their history or their situation. On this basis, we can even empathize with monsters or aliens from other planets, as portrayed in films. This is possible only when we know their stories. This also explains why we can more readily empathize with those who are close and similar to us. We already know the general lines of their stories. Narratives give us access to contexts that are broader than our own contexts and that allow us to understand a broad variety of situations.</p>
<p>Third, a problem that is both terminological and conceptual. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754073911421382">Stueber (2012)</xref> uses “empathy” as just another term for social cognition, even the most basic, default, and automatic resonance-based mode of social cognition. To associate it with mirror neuron activation, as Stueber and many others do, is to make empathy the automatic default mode of social cognition. On this view, if it is true that my mirror neurons activate whenever I see you engage in intentional action, and this generates some basic form of empathy, then, in effect, I cannot help but empathize with you—even in the case of seeing you engage in what I take to be an obnoxious action. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754073911421382">Stueber (2012)</xref> also considers high-level reenactive processes as a further variety of empathy. In either respect, however, there is no difference between empathy and ordinary, everyday understandings of others, or what some theorists call “mindreading.” Other theorists, including myself, however, and in some agreement with ordinary language, suggest that empathic behavior involves an other-directed feeling of concern or interest, distinct from both sympathy and mindreading. Is this not another variety of empathy to be considered?</p>

<p>This at least is part of the solution. I don’t have the space here to develop the full answer, which would also have to make reference to the embodied practices of primary and secondary intersubjectivity.</p>
