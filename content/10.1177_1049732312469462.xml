<abstract>
<p>Depression is highly prevalent among HIV-positive individuals and has been identified as an important predictor of suboptimal adherence to highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART). To date, however, researchers have not adequately examined how depression influences adherence among depressed HIV-positive patients. The aim of our study was to explore the process by which depression interacts with other factors relevant to medication adherence decision making to influence adherence to HAART. We used principles of grounded theory to guide our methods. We conducted interviews with 21 HIV-positive individuals diagnosed with comorbid depressive disorders. Results indicated that depression, HIV-related cues, and health and self-care beliefs combined to influence coping strategies. Coping strategies, in turn, predicted whether participants were able to adhere to HAART. These findings can be used by practitioners to broaden the scope of factors they consider when treating depressed patients who might be at risk for nonadherence.</p>

<body>
<p>People living with HIV/AIDS are twice as likely to be diagnosed with major depressive disorder compared to those who are HIV negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312469462">Ciesla &amp; Roberts, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, depression complicates an HIV-positive person’s ability to manage complex treatment regimens. In fact, the association between depression and nonadherence to highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) regimens has been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312469462">Kacanek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312469462">Lima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312469462">Reynolds et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312469462">Singh et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312469462">Turner, Laine, Cosler, &amp; Hauck, 2003</xref>). Consequences of nonadherence to HAART include decreased effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy by way of decreased drug potency and an increased likelihood of developing a drug-resistant viral strain. This could in turn reduce subsequent antiretroviral therapy success given that drug resistance can generalize to an entire class of antiretroviral drugs. Furthermore, nonadherence can contribute to increased rates of morbidity, hospitalizations, and mortality (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312469462">Detels et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312469462">Machtinger &amp; Bangsberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312469462">Murphy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312469462">Paterson et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The identification and treatment of depression among HIV-positive individuals is critical, given the consistent association between depression and nonadherence. To our knowledge, there have been no studies to date that have explored how depression contributes to medication nonadherence in a population of patients with comorbid HIV/AIDS and depression. Once we have identified the specific factors that influence medication adherence decision making among people with HIV/AIDS and depression, researchers and clinicians could use these findings to target specific contributing factors. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to explore mechanisms by which depression influences adherence to HAART through the use of in-depth qualitative interviewing methods.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1049732312469462">
<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>The informed consent and study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee in accordance with the American Psychological Association’s (APA) principles for ethical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312469462">APA, 2002</xref>). We targeted HIV-positive patients with depressive symptoms from a mid-sized Midwestern city for this study. We distributed study flyers and depression-screening-day advertisements to two local HIV/AIDS outpatient specialty clinics. To be eligible for the study, HIV-positive individuals needed to (a) be at least 18 years of age; (b) demonstrate mild or moderate depressive symptoms (i.e., have a score of 5 or above on the Beck Depression Inventory-Fast Screen; BDI-FS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312469462">Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 2000</xref>); (c) be a medical patient at the HIV/AIDS outpatient specialty clinics; and (d) have filled a prescription for HAART during the previous 6 months, regardless of level of adherence. Exclusion criteria included having significant cognitive impairment or psychotic or bipolar disorders.</p>
<p>We utilized purposeful sampling to obtain a sample of HIV-positive individuals with comorbid depression who were receiving medical care in one of two clinics (i.e., one was in an urban center and the other was in a suburban city) in an attempt to enroll participants who were diverse with respect to ethnic background, gender, sexual orientation, and severity of depression. We screened 51 HIV-positive individuals reporting depressed mood for participation in the study. Of those who consented to screening, 29 individuals qualified for the study and 21 of those individuals were interviewed. Reasons for ineligibility were logistical (e.g., not being a clinic patient) and disease related (e.g., comorbid psychotic or bipolar disorders; no current HAART prescription). Loss of eligible participants for interview was because of scheduling problems and death.</p>
<p>The first author, a clinical psychology doctoral student trained in qualitative methods, and another member of the research team who had similar training, conducted the screening. The first author conducted the clinical assessments and semistructured interviews. During the screening, individuals provided basic demographic information and completed the BDI-FS self-report measure of the existence and severity of cognitive and affective symptoms of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312469462">Beck et al., 2000</xref>). We did not assess somatic symptoms of depression because of potential overlap with HIV-related physical symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312469462">Kalichman, Rompa, &amp; Cage, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Once enrolled, the first author used the Mood Module of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312469462">Spitzer et al., 1994</xref>) to determine whether participants’ symptoms met full diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder according to the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Text Revision</italic> (DSM-IV-TR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312469462">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). Participants also completed a measure of basic HIV and depression treatment history. Finally, we asked participants in semistructured, open-ended, individual interviews about their experiences living with HIV and depression and coping with both conditions.</p>
<p>During the interviews, the first author asked participants questions that were specific to their experiences with taking medication and medication decision-making processes in the context of depression. For example, we asked questions such as, “What is it like for you to take your medication? What helps you take your medication? What gets in the way? When you are feeling better, i.e., are less depressed, what is it like for you to take your medications?” The first author also invited participants to discuss whatever aspects of their experiences were the most meaningful to them.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>We calculated descriptive statistics for quantitative data using SPSS 17.0. Qualitative interviews were first audiotaped and transcribed by a research assistant; a second research assistant then verified the transcriptions. The interviewer addressed any transcription inconsistencies. Next, we analyzed the data for emergent themes using NVivo 8 qualitative data management software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312469462">QSR International, 2010</xref>) in accordance with the principles of grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312469462">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312469462">1994</xref>). We conducted the qualitative analysis using a team approach. Members of the coding team included the two authors of this article and three advanced undergraduate research assistants who had been trained in the principles of qualitative data analysis and grounded theory in particular.</p>
<p>We initiated our analysis by reading all of the verified transcripts and making notes regarding preliminary topics, themes, or relationships. Next, we independently conducted open coding by reviewing the first transcript line by line for themes relevant to our research questions. This analytic strategy was conducted for the first three transcripts. We then reviewed our independent list of codes and developed a collaborative hierarchical coding structure. Once we determined the final structure, each member of the research team independently reviewed the interview transcripts and proceeded by coding using the finalized structure. We discussed the validity of the finalized coding structure and the coded data during weekly meetings. We reviewed discrepancies between coders, discussed discrepancies until consensus was met, and noted the decisions we made. Next, we conducted axial coding by reviewing the data to assess relationships that existed between and within the categories and concepts. Then, we went back to the transcripts to determine whether the proposed relationships were consistent with the data.</p>
<p>During all phases of the coding process, members of the coding team wrote memos documenting developing ideas in the coding scheme and overall analysis. We also used sketches or drawings of proposed relationships and processes to facilitate our understanding of the phenomenon under study. During coding meetings we discussed these notes and models. Finally, through theoretical coding, we identified a core category and we then coded the transcripts to the core category, assessing the fit of the data with the emergent theoretical model. We also reviewed each transcript to obtain a qualitative measurement of each participant’s pattern of medication adherence. For example, we reviewed transcripts to get a sense of participants’ perceived degree of difficulty taking medications when depressed, and experiences of taking HIV medication when depressed vs. when they were not depressed.</p>
<p>Throughout the analysis, we made a concerted effort to ensure rigor and trustworthiness of the research through establishing the credibility, transferability, dependability, and conformability of the findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312469462">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312469462">Patton, 2001</xref>). We sought feedback from participants about any relevant information that would help us better understand their experiences coping with HIV and depression. We also recruited participants from two different clinics, coded interview transcripts independently, maintained audit trails, and compared findings with existent literature. We sought feedback from peers and a qualitative expert in HIV research (P. Stevens, personal communication, December 3, 2010) on the development of the emergent theoretical model. Finally, we conducted negative case analysis and explored variability in the emergent theoretical model to gain a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon under study. The decision to end recruitment was made when we reached saturation of codes and no new themes were presented in participant interviews.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In the final sample (<italic>N</italic> = 21), participants varied in age from 33 to 60 years (<italic>M</italic> = 44.0, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.0). We interviewed 14 men (66%) and 7 women (33%). Participants identified as African American (76.2%), non-Hispanic White (19.0%), or Other (4.8%). Educational level varied among participants; 33% had completed some high school, 19% completed high school or the equivalent, 33.3% had completed some college, and 9.5% had obtained a bachelor’s degree. Most participants lived at or below the poverty level, with 85.7% of the sample reporting an income of less than $1,000/month, and 14.3% of participants reported receiving $1,000 to $1,499 per month. The average time since participants received their HIV diagnosis was 11 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 3), with years of diagnosis ranging from 1993 to 2005. Other quantitative data (e.g., stage of HIV disease, depressive symptom severity, current treatment, providers, and depression diagnoses) for study participants can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312469462">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Emergent Theory: Key Factors That Operate in the Context of Depression</title>
<p>In our qualitative data analysis, we identified factors that influence how depression affects adherence decision making among HIV-positive persons living with comorbid depression. We first present the emergent theory, which describes mechanisms that contributed to HAART adherence in the context of comorbid HIV and depression among the participants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312469462">Figure 1</xref>), and then give examples of these factors from our data. We present the theory in its entirety before each factor is reviewed to allow an examination of the connections between the factors and the processes operating in the context of depression and HAART adherence. The ways depression influenced medication adherence patterns in the sample can be described through relationships among HIV-related cues, health and self-care beliefs, and coping strategies. Depression accordingly threatens an individual’s ability to enact effective coping responses. Ineffective coping, in turn, puts a person at risk for missing single doses of medication or having extended treatment interruptions.</p>

<p>Navigating hazardous conditions: A grounded theory of medication adherence in the context of depression</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1049732312469462-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>It is as if adhering to HAART in the context of depression is analogous to navigating in hazardous conditions on a roadway: The driver might encounter a torrential rainstorm, putting himself at increased risk for getting into an accident. In this circumstance, the driver has two essential choices: to remain calm and navigate the conditions with a heightened awareness of the potential dangers, or to become panicked and lose control of the vehicle. Within this context, he might encounter an event outside of his control. For example, the wheels might lose traction and lock up, resulting in an uncontrollable skid. At such a point, he would need to regain his focus and adjust to the emergent crisis to avoid disaster. If he were able to react and get back on track, he could continue on his journey as before, but if his car were to start spinning out, he would inevitably crash.</p>
<p>Similarly, a depressed HIV-positive person who is navigating difficulties related to medication adherence might encounter HIV-related “storms” such as the cues that remind him of his HIV. These cues might be compounded by a sense of hopelessness with respect to his inability to manage his disease. Conversely, these cues might be countered by a confidence in his ability to adhere or by his beliefs that the medications will keep him healthy. This combination of factors (i.e., cues and beliefs) can affect his perceived coping abilities for maintaining adherence to treatment recommendations.</p>
<p>When depression becomes unbearable (i.e., going into a skid), he would be at a heightened risk for nonadherence. Instead of “steering with the skid,” which represents his ability to cope effectively in this circumstance, he might lose control over his medication-adherence goals. Of course, if he were to be unable to get back on track emotionally, he might experience a more extended lapse in treatment. Alternatively, having learned how to cope successfully within the context of this hazardous condition, he would be more likely to persist in adherence during future crises. We discuss each of the key components of the “navigating hazardous conditions” metaphor that will be used to explain our theory below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312469462">
<title>HIV-Related Cues</title>
<p>Participants encountered various HIV-related cues that functioned as triggers to depression in their everyday lives. Illness cues (e.g., intrusive HIV symptoms, functional limitations, and changes in appearance attributed to HIV), treatment cues (e.g., changes in appearance attributed to HIV medications, medication reminders, intrusive side effects, disappointing clinical results), and social cues (e.g., HIV-related stigma and discrimination) were most salient. Such cues markedly increased the risk for significant shifts in negative affect or the onset of depression, activating a state of high risk for nonadherence to HAART.</p>
<p>Encountering situations that participants perceived to be resulting from their HIV-positive status often triggered depression. Participants reported that their mood was affected by such HIV-related cues because they required that the participants consider what it meant to have a stigmatizing and life-threatening illness. One participant, for example, described the effects intrusive HIV-related symptoms had on his state of mind:
<disp-quote>
<p>Each time you get a cold or sick or whatever, “Is it because of HIV or is it just natural?” If it was HIV that was causing it, it would cause me to withdraw more. I would stop walking or stop doing some of the things I’m doing . . . and I wouldn’t want to be talking about it with people. I know that’s contradictory to probably getting better, but that’s just how I would do it. I would just isolate myself more and it would increase the depression, for sure.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, participants became depressed when HIV restricted their ability to function normally on a day-to-day basis. Respondents discussed how HIV had rendered them incapable of engaging in activities that would have brought them a sense of accomplishment or satisfaction, such as having a career and exercising:
<disp-quote>
<p>I wanted to go for a walk the other day. I couldn’t, ’cause my legs were just way too tired. And I get depressed about that. And it all stems from being HIV positive. [I tell myself], “If I wasn’t [HIV positive], I wouldn’t have neuropathy, I wouldn’t have this [problem],” and then I start to cry, and—just little things, I mean, a walk? Why would you get depressed about a walk? But I do.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants discussed the distress they experienced because of changes in their appearance associated with the HIV virus and their HIV medications. Noticing physical changes such as rashes or lipodystrophy, one participant stated, “puts me depressed because I notice physical changes in my body that wasn’t there before.” Likewise, a negative shift in mood often occurred after something as commonplace as encountering visual or mental reminders of HIV medications:
<disp-quote>
<p>Now when I sit back and think about what them pills are for, that’s gonna make me upset. If I don’t take my HIV medication, I can forget that I have HIV just for a day or two, but if I start taking it, it reminds me every day, “Oh Lord, here we go again with this HIV.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Taking medication as well as being reminded of medications triggered depression. Side effects, in particular, elicited negative interpretations and distress:
<disp-quote>
<p>But the side effects of the medication . . . it’s just that I know it’s affecting my system, and that makes me even more depressed. It gets me down ’cause I have to take it anyway. Knowing I wish I didn’t have to take it, but I have to take it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The quotation above illustrates the interactive relationship between cues, beliefs, and depression such that a person who is already struggling with depression might have a heightened sense of awareness of cues, such as side effects, and might tend toward more negative beliefs with respect to medication outcome expectancies. Within such a feedback loop, his or her depression subsequently intensifies. Participants had difficulty coping with intrusive side effects, especially in the context of trying to manage complex treatment protocols. In the words of one participant,
<disp-quote>
<p>The side effects was something that really kept me down, too, because if I had to take some medication, then I’m gonna have these side effects. I’m not gonna be able to deal with them. How can I deal with them? I’m dealing with my depression, I’m dealing with this medication—how is it gonna affect this medication? . . . It’s gonna affect my thinking. . . . If I can’t even handle what I’m dealing with now, how am I gonna deal with this?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants became depressed after receiving disappointing clinical test results at HIV-related medical appointments because of the implications the results had for their long-term health:
<disp-quote>
<p>Usually when I come from the doctor I’m depressed. They say, “Well this is up, and this is down, and you need to do this, and you need to do that,” and all of this crap. And when I leave the doctor’s office, I’m usually depressed for about the next day or two.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interpersonal stressors, stemming from HIV-related stigma and discrimination, were pervasive. Social consequences served as overt reminders about how being HIV positive meant more than simply having a life-threating condition. Such reminders prompted the onset of depressed mood:
<disp-quote>
<p>It penetrated me so deeply, not letting out part of who I was and how and when I could let something out. That was not even discussed, as it is today, out in the open like this today. And so after a while I just tossed and turned in it. Just sad. At one time, people [were] talking about how nasty I am, [saying] I ain’t no good, can’t make no kids. And I love kids. You can’t be around nobody, can’t touch nobody.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall, HIV-related contextual cues affected the degree to which participants struggled with medication adherence. For example, participants discussed how the most salient antecedents that triggered depressed mood were HIV related, compared to general life stressors. One woman explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>It all depends on what I’m depressed about. Like if it’s my whole HIV thing, then I’m like, “You know, I’m not taking them.” That’s when I get in that “give-up” mood. If I’m in that “give up” mood, then I won’t take them. But if I’m just depressed over general stuff that’s going on around me, I don’t have a problem taking them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312469462">Figure 1</xref> illustrates how HIV-related cues influenced depression and ultimately put participants at risk for nonadherence. Next, we discuss health and self-care beliefs and how depression influences such beliefs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312469462">
<title>Health and Self-Care Beliefs</title>
<p>Beliefs participants had about HIV, the degree of control they had over it vis-à-vis medication taking, and the degree to which they were hopeful about their future health had a strong impact on adherence decisions. Negative changes in these beliefs functioned as antecedents to adherence lapses, particularly when participants were in the midst of a debilitating depressive state. Specific examples of such health and self-care beliefs are described below.</p>
<sec id="section8-1049732312469462">
<title>Medication-related agency</title>
<p>Medication-related agency, or the sense of being confident and able to take medications successfully and control health outcomes because of personal adherence efforts, varied among participants. A participant with a strong sense of medication-related agency explained how she could see nothing getting in her way of adherence to her treatment:
<disp-quote>
<p>When it’s time for me to take [my HIV medications] I’m going to take them, sad or no sad—I’m going to take my meds [medications] anyway. When it’s time for me to take my meds, I ain’t missin’ my meds for nobody. I’m gonna take my meds. . . . I don’t let nobody stop me from taking my meds.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Conversely, some participants felt much less confident about their ability to adhere. One man explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>People have to remind me . . . some days if I’m not being reminded, I ain’t gonna take it. And this is something that should automatically come to me. But it don’t. And so I don’t know if I’m doing this on purpose.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants’ beliefs about the degree of control they had over their health and long-term outcomes varied. One man described how important his own behavior was for his survival:
<disp-quote>
<p>I know I have to [take my HIV medications]. Not because I want to—I have to. I don’t know exactly what they do, but they [are] doing something because my CD4 [helper T lymphocyte count; an indicator of immune system health] is up. I’m getting better, but I know I’ll always still have this disease. And it could possibly kill me if I don’t take care of myself and eat right. And that’s stuff you gotta do in order [to] stay alive. So be it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum were participants who believed that external forces played a more powerful part in their health than their own behaviors. One participant described how he perceived a loss of agency in the context of taking the medications:
<disp-quote>
<p>Medication is altering my perception of stuff and controlling a lot of stuff that I used to control myself, [such as] when I decide to eat, if I feel like eating. All of that [has] affected how I feel by taking my meds.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of power. It takes a lot from the person when something as mechanical as a pill is in control.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Beliefs such as having a lack of control over health outcomes contributed to a deepening of depression:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is the worst thing in the world. It’s absolutely the worst thing in the world when you realize that you’re being attacked from within, and it’s not something that you can fight yourself. The lifestyle change, from being a normal person to a person who’s dependent on medication and dependent on treatment and always monitoring your blood—it gets overwhelming.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732312469462">
<title>Medication outcome expectancies</title>
<p>Participants’ beliefs about medications informed and guided decisions to take HIV medications. Medication outcome expectancies, or the perceived short- and long-term consequences of taking HIV medications on HIV and depression outcomes, played a substantial role in participants’ decisions to take medications. Several participants spoke of their belief in the efficacy of their HIV medications, even given some negative consequences:
<disp-quote>
<p>I feel better when I don’t take it. I do—I feel better. But I know if I don’t take it, I’ll probably end up with AIDS. That’s why I have to keep [taking] it, ’cause it’s all these medications that [have] been keeping people alive for years. I feel better now because I know the viral load is down and the CD4 is up. So it lets me know the medication is working, but that’s all its doing is just working. It’s not making me feel no better.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, one woman had serious doubts about medication efficacy because her husband died from AIDS-related complications even though he had been taking antiretrovirals:
<disp-quote>
<p>If it was full-blown, what was the use of taking medication? Because he was devoted on his medication and if he died full-blown, that medication wasn’t working for him. And that gets me worried too. They tell you to take your medication and then you still messed up. I’m scared [that] even if I take my medication, something gonna happen to me anyway.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several participants endorsed beliefs that taking medications would not improve their momentary mood or physical state, or would instead worsen how they were feeling. For example, although one participant believed in the efficacy of his HIV medications, he discussed how he avoided taking them because he did not want his mood to suffer:
<disp-quote>
<p>Isn’t a medication about making you feel better? And the [HIV] medication I’m on now is not making me feel any better. The medication I think it makes me a little bit more depressed than anything. Some days I don’t take it on purpose, ’cause I wanna feel better, but I know I have to take it because I know that’s what’s keeping my viral load [controlled].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Being depressed affected participants’ perceived ability to cope with expected side effects. As one participant explained, when he felt depressed, the expectation of adverse side effects kept him from taking his medications:
<disp-quote>
<p>If I wake up in a [depressed] mood I’ll put off my meds because I don’t want to feel worse. I already feel like I don’t want to be bothered, and then I get myself a stomach ache, so I’ll put off taking it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section10-1049732312469462">
<title>Cognitive Shifts</title>
<p>Participants experienced cognitive changes such as a magnification of negative thinking, decreased confidence in their ability to take medication, decreased motivation to take medication, and fatalism when depressed. Participants’ thinking was often characterized by themes of rumination, hopelessness, fatalism, and low self-esteem. This biased, negative cognitive processing style served to filter participants’ beliefs about health and self-care in a negative manner. The following quotation illustrates how this negative thinking was detrimental in terms of patients’ self-care beliefs:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m not motivated to do the things that I’m supposed to do. I’m not motivated to want to do better for myself. I figure well, when I’m in that state, I just feel like, what’s the use? Why even put any effort forth? Why am I even going through the actions of doing whatever I’m trying to do? So, it just keeps me from doing what I need to do.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many participants described experiencing pill fatigue, or losing motivation to take life-preserving medications, when they were in the midst of a depressed state. Others described how hopeless they could become about HIV treatments when they were depressed; for example:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s not that often, but sometimes it’s like I don’t wanna shove another pill down my throat today; I’m just not in the mood. I think the longest I’ve went without taking my meds is maybe about four days, and I just didn’t care. I just had kinda lost all hope and I just didn’t care. I really didn’t. And I didn’t care what anybody thought. I didn’t care about my thoughts or any of that. It’s just like, “Oh, the hell with it.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such cognitive shifts left participants in a vulnerable position for coping with HIV-related cues and chronic depression. Not only did these shifts influence participants’ adherence decisions, but they also influenced participants’ efforts to persist with adherence in the face of psychological distress. We now turn to a discussion of the coping strategies that contributed to their ability to adhere.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732312469462">
<title>Coping Strategies</title>
<p>Coping with HIV- and depression-related stressors took the form of various cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses, which we describe in detail below. Many participants described significant changes in their ability to cope and persist in their medication adherence because of depression:
<disp-quote>
<p>Usually the depression takes away from the normality. . . . I’m not thinking about normal things, I’m thinking about all the depression and the stress and all of that. So [depression] kinda deters me away from [my routines], because there’s sometimes when I wake up that if I’m depressed, I won’t get out of bed and brush my teeth. I’ll just lay there . . . won’t take a shower, just will lay around . . . and that’s not a normal part of who I am. Like, that’s when I know that I am depressed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A participant described how coping with both diseases simultaneously was not usually possible:
<disp-quote>
<p>You really don’t know when your depression stage is gonna hit. It just so happens it could hit during the time that you’re [taking medication] or two or three or four hours in the course of your medication. And you’re having a depression episode and you’re getting sick at the same time—which one you gonna concentrate on most? The sickness, more so than the depression. So it’s hard to say dealing with the HIV and depression at the same time, how do you cope with it? Because one is gonna supersede the other. Either you’re gonna be sick, or you’re just gonna be so sick of being sick that you’re depressed. So the depression may come after you’re [done] being sick from your HIV.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This same participant described a typical decision-making process:
<disp-quote>
<p>So that’s another thing—do I take my medication? Or do I sit here and have my depression episode because I’m sick? What is more important? Do you deal with one episode before the next episode kicks in? Or do you just sit there and do nothing until everything fixes itself . . . until everything works out?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants reported using what would be considered approach-oriented and avoidant-oriented coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312469462">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>) to manage depression while persisting with their medication regimens. Participants who were able to cope effectively used primarily approach-oriented coping strategies. Specific types of strategies used included positive reinterpretation, acceptance strategies, seeking emotional social support, spirituality, and suppression of competing emotions/ cognitions. Participants used positive reinterpretation strategies such as reframing and “self-talk” to view medication-taking more favorably: “I just [think] to myself, ‘The least you can do is take your medicine.’ You know, that kind of gets it done.” One woman described her internal dialogue:
<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes . . . I can catch myself and I’ll think that, “Hey you’ve been here before! So how about still taking your meds?” Or, “It’s not always gonna be this way. This too shall pass, remember?” So I have to self-talk myself sometimes. Or someone else will talk to me and then start me back to thinking the right way.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other participants reported that accepting negative emotions proved to be helpful in coping with them. One participant said,
<disp-quote>
<p>It kind of takes some of the stress away. . . . It’s like that prayer says, you know? Accept the things I cannot change, and [have] the courage to change the things I can. So you just kind of deal with [depression].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even more, acceptance could be used as a strategy to momentarily overcome depressed mood. A participant explained, “By me being conscious of [depression], and being present in the moment of it, I’m accepting it, I’m dealing with it. And I’ve overcome it at that moment.” One man described how he relied on his spirituality to help him cope:
<disp-quote>
<p>A lot of times, [spirituality] is what kinda helps pull me out of the depression. You know. Doesn’t work always. . . . I think whatever or whomever you believe in, just kinda hold tight to that and it may not get better right away, but eventually it will pass. So that’s what kinda keeps me holding on.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several avoidant-oriented coping strategies were described, including restraint coping, mental disengagement, behavioral disengagement, and substance abuse. Participants who primarily used these strategies were less likely to cope effectively with depression, increasing the risk of nonadherence. Participants engaged in restraint coping when they made the decision to delay taking their medication until they were in a better mood or were feeling physically better:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I’m depressed or I don’t wanna take them and I’m in that “give-up” state, I’ll get up in the morning and I’ll just kinda wander around the house. Usually I take them at six-thirty in the morning, and when I’m in that funk, I just wait until like eight [or] nine and take them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One woman elaborated on some of the thoughts she had at that time by saying, “I’ll wait ‘til later; they’ll still be there. I’ll take them when I’m ready. I don’t feel like it right now.”</p>
<p>Participants used mental or behavioral disengagement strategies to withdraw emotionally or behaviorally from their goal of adherence:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s harder because you want to go to the cabinet, but you’re so depressed to where you don’t want to get up and move. You don’t want to make that course of action to grab your medicine, go to the refrigerator, fix you something to drink, doctor it up with some peaches or some applesauce. You know, you didn’t want to go through that course of your everyday routine, because you just don’t feel like it. It makes it harder for you to do the things that you would normally do when you’re feeling well.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another participant echoed these sentiments when she described her experience: “Sometimes I don’t think about my HIV [medications]. I be like, ‘I’m too tired. Forget it. I’m gonna die anyways. I’m just tired, I gotta sleep. My body’s tired.’” Other participants turned to using alcohol or other drugs as a way to avoid coping with depression, additionally jeopardizing their health:
<disp-quote>
<p>And once I use, you can close the book. Doesn’t nothing matter no more, ’cause now I’m believing that the only way that’s going to get me through this is drugs. I don’t want to feel this, I don’t want think this way no more. And the drugs is my escape.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some avoidant-oriented strategies were adaptive, such as when they enabled participants to suppress their negative emotions or thoughts and instead focus their attention on positive experiences:
<disp-quote>
<p>The reason why I end up feeling better is because I don’t think about the situation I’m in. The stuff that make me depressed, I don’t think about it. I turn the music on and listen to my spiritual singing and sing right along with it and stuff that keeps my mind occupied. Stop thinking about this kind of stuff. Or thinking about what tomorrow’s gonna bring. Thinking about, how long am I gonna be dealing with this? Thinking about, is a day ever coming where I don’t have to deal with this? Oh no.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section12-1049732312469462">
<title>Patterns of Adherence Behavior</title>
<p>Participants enacted both effective and ineffective coping strategies in response to depression. Those who were able to successfully cope with depression (e.g., by using approach-oriented coping strategies) reported arriving at the “brink” of nonadherence, at which point they considered not taking their medications. They were better able to cope with depression and the medication regimen by using approach-focused coping strategies such as becoming focused on the desire to live and on the medication’s efficacy. Conversely, participants delayed or lapsed in medication taking when they were unable to cope effectively with depression.</p>
<p>Following a single missed dose of medication (i.e., an adherence lapse), participants either experienced an extended treatment interruption (e.g., drug holiday) or a resumption of adherence. Skipped doses most often turned into extended treatment interruptions when participants were severely depressed, lacked confidence in their ability to resume pill taking, or when they feared not being able to return to good health because of the development of drug resistance. Indeed, after missing a dose of medication, some participants thought of adherence as being a “lost cause” and the lapse as an indication of failure. Rumination about the lapse created a feedback loop in which depression contributed to persistent nonadherence. The lapse, in turn, triggered this sort of response, characterized by guilt and perceptions of defeat:
<disp-quote>
<p>You start to beat yourself up, when you know you didn’t take your medication. . . . It’s just like, “I know this is gonna happen. I know I’m gonna get sick, but I know I should have took my medication. But I didn’t take my medication.” And, you feel worse all over again.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An alternative consequence of missing a dose was a renewed commitment to adherence. A resumption of pill taking that occurred after missing a dose was more likely to occur when participants were able to make important cognitive shifts, engage in specific adherence-supporting behaviors, and when their personal contexts enabled a renewed effort toward sustained adherence. For example, factors related to a resumption of adherence included reevaluating the positive and negative (i.e., emotional and physical) consequences of adherence (i.e., reappraisal). One man illustrated this well when he described a recent struggle with adherence, “On the fifth day, I got scared. I said, ‘Well, you didn’t care for four days, now suppose the meds don’t work.’ So I just push myself back on them.” For some participants, deferring to “doctor’s orders” helped them to get back on track with adherence. For others, taking medications designed to minimize side effects facilitated a return to adherence.</p>
<p>Regaining a positive outlook helped give some participants the strength to restart their regimens. As one woman explained, “After a couple days or so, or a week or so, I’d pick myself back up, you know, and then I’d start back taking it again.” Another woman discussed the process she went through in which she was able to “snap out” of nonadherence after a period of time:
<disp-quote>
<p>There’s been a couple times where I’m just like, “I’m not doing it,” and I’ll stop taking my meds for a couple days, and then I’ll snap out of it and go, “You know what, you can’t do that,” and then start taking them again.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Different patterns that represented adherence, persistence, lapse, relapse, and the resumption of adherence were evident in our data. Although the vast majority of participants reported increased difficulty taking medications when depressed, many were able to develop the ability to persist with adherence despite being depressed. The few who reported decreased difficulty taking their medications when depressed explained that depression either had a positive influence on adherence or had no influence with respect to the way they took their HIV medications. For instance, one man described how it was easier for him to take his HIV medication when he was depressed because he tended to stay home when depressed, and also had faith that the medications would bring him out of his depressive state:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s easier to take [HIV medications] when I’m feeling depressed, actually, because there’s a sense it may help me with my depression at that moment. It’s not that I think it will, it’s that I hope that it will. I know the medication doesn’t work that way, but hope has helped me through a lot of stuff. Because every time that I got into chronic depression I eventually come out of it, but I just never know when I’m gonna come out of it. So, when I take the medication I hope this helps me come out of [depression].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although depression usually affected treatment and long-term health expectancies, for a few participants depression appeared to have little effect on adherence. In these cases, adherence was not seen as a choice, but rather a requisite daily behavior. One man explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t think [my depression] affects it. I can be depressed . . . just next to tears . . . the pills have nothing to do with that. You take your pills, and then you go on with being depressed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He went on to explain,
<disp-quote>
<p>I have to take them, that’s all I know. ’Cause I don’t wanna get sick. And, taking them is nothing compared to getting sick. I mean a lot of these people today that have been HIV [positive] for the last few years, did not see what I saw. They didn’t have their friends dropping like flies. They just didn’t see that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As illustrated in the previous examples, persistent adherence stems from diverse factors, one of which is the depressed state itself. The diversity in adherence patterns illustrates how depression is just one of many factors that contribute to nonadherence.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In previous studies, researchers have found a consistent association between depression and nonadherence to HAART (Gonzalez, Batchelder, Psaros, &amp; Safren, 2011), yet we have had a limited understanding of how depression influences adherence. The purpose of the present study was, therefore, to explore the mechanisms by which depression contributes to HAART adherence among people living with HIV and depressive disorders. The theory generated from the data (i.e., navigating hazardous conditions) provides an initial understanding of how depression might influence adherence among HIV-positive people living with depression. Moreover, our theory encompasses the contextual and psychosocial factors that influence both depression and medication adherence. The theoretical model illustrates the adherence process in the context of living with HIV and depression.</p>
<p>Depression is a well-established predictor of medication nonadherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312469462">Kacanek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312469462">Lima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312469462">Reynolds et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312469462">Singh et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312469462">Turner et al., 2003</xref>), and appears to make HIV-positive persons vulnerable in how they appraise themselves, their treatment, and their long-term health. In a depressed state, participants were more vulnerable to risk factors for nonadherence, such as decreased medication-related agency, negative medication outcome expectancies, and self-defeating cognitive strategies (e.g., rumination about HIV, fatalism, denial, and self-blame). Being adherent, in turn, was difficult when they were feeling pessimistic about treatment outcomes. Whether lapses led to extended treatment interruptions or the resumption of adherence was dependent on participants’ ability to consistently enact effective coping responses in the context of depression.</p>
<p>Although the present study was exploratory in nature, the emergent model shares conceptual similarities with validated theories of relapse and relapse prevention in the substance-use-disorders literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312469462">Marlatt, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312469462">Witkiewitz &amp; Marlatt, 2004</xref>). According to Marlatt, individuals who are attempting to refrain from a problem behavior encounter high-risk situations that pose a threat to their sense of control and self-efficacy to maintain their behavior change (e.g., abstinence). If people do not have effective coping responses, their confidence in maintaining the behavior change weakens as they simultaneously focus in on the advantages of reverting to old behavior. A lapse, or slip, in abstinence is the likely result.</p>
<p>A lapse can turn into a relapse, or return to pretreatment behavior, when a person reacts emotionally to the lapse with feelings of guilt, self-blame, and hopelessness. This latter phenomenon has been referred to as a “goal violation effect,” or in the case of substance-use disorders, an “abstinence violation effect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312469462">Marlatt &amp; Blume, 2006</xref>, pg. 151). Alternatively, a person can get back on course or resume his or her goal behavior (e.g., abstinence from alcohol and other drugs, resuming adherence to medications) following a lapse, which is referred to as a prolapse.</p>
<p>Others have used the relapse prevention model to conceptualize the process of adhering to various healthy behaviors such as dieting and exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312469462">Marlatt &amp; Blume, 2006</xref>); they have not, however, applied the model to HAART adherence. We used qualitative methods to explore the possible mechanisms by which depression likely affects HAART medication taking. In so doing, we discovered complex and dynamic patterns of adherence practiced by participants in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312469462">Sankar, Golin, Simoni, Luborsky, &amp; Pearson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312469462">Stevens &amp; Hildebrandt, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>We found similarities between the relapse prevention model and our emergent theory with respect to how contextual factors precipitate the onset of a high-risk situation and how coping behavior predicts goal behaviors (e.g., abstinence; medication-taking behaviors), behavioral patterns (i.e., lapse, relapse, prolapse), and hopelessness about returning to the goal-directed behavior (e.g., abstinence/goal violation effect). Here too, we are compelled to note that the relapse prevention model is designed to explain how one comes to resume maladaptive behaviors. Such a focus contrasts with our model, in which we explain how one might struggle to continue taking life-saving medications. Thus, the factors in the model do not correspond perfectly.</p>
<p>Given that depression is associated with increased rates of progression to AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312469462">Ironson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312469462">Leserman et al., 1999</xref>) and increased mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312469462">Ickovics et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312469462">Lima et al., 2007</xref>), an understanding of the context of depression and its consequences is essential to improving HIV patient health care outcomes. Our findings contribute to an understanding of mechanisms by which depression influences HAART adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312469462">Bakken et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312469462">DiMatteo, Lepper, &amp; Croghan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312469462">Safren et al., 2004</xref>). We found that depression influenced attention to HIV-related cues and health and self-care beliefs. These factors in turn influenced coping strategies and, ultimately, adherence decision making.</p>
<p>We conceptualized interpersonal and structural factors as HIV-related cues. Our data suggest that these factors put participants at risk for depression, which in turn increased the risk of nonadherence to HAART. Others have suggested a potential relationship between interpersonal factors—such as social isolation or a poor patient–provider relationship—and adherence might exist (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312469462">Abel &amp; Painter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312469462">Bakken et al., 2000</xref>). Our findings suggest that in some cases, depression might mediate the relationship between such factors and nonadherence. That is to say, social isolation contributes to depression and depression, in turn, plays a major role in determining the likelihood of adherence. The methods we used in this study do not enable us to claim with certitude that depression has a stronger influence on adherence than other contextual factors such as social isolation.</p>
<p>Interpersonal aspects of the patient–provider relationship and structural factors related to the medical context might be relevant triggers for negative emotions in certain situations, as well, such as when attending medical appointments and when receiving poor test results. Taking medications to treat one’s HIV infection, ameliorate side effects, or treat opportunistic infections could trigger shifts in negative affect and, potentially, lapses in adherence. We should note that other structural factors known to influence decision making and treatment adherence (i.e., poverty, food insufficiency, limited utilization of mental health and/or medical care; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312469462">Mallinson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312469462">Mellins, Kang, Leu, Havens, &amp; Chesney, 2003</xref>) were not evident in these data. Their absence should not, however, be taken as evidence that they are not relevant. That they do not play a central role in our model might have less to do with their salience and more to do with participants’ decisions to focus on the internal mechanisms of depression.</p>
<p>Although findings from our study contribute to an understanding of the experience of living with both HIV and depression, we must acknowledge some important limitations. One limitation is that these data were gathered over the course of a single interview. Retrospective accounts of participants’ experiences could have been influenced by their current mood or their most recent experience coping with HIV and concurrent depression. The developmental trajectory of depression and challenges in relation to adherence are best understood through the use of longitudinal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312469462">Stevens &amp; Hildebrandt, 2009</xref>). Another limitation pertains to how we sampled. Were we to be entirely consistent with a grounded theory approach, we would have used our emerging theory to engage in more purposive sampling for subsequent participants. Although we used our field notes to query about emerging themes from one interview to the next and continued sampling until we achieved theoretical saturation, we did not target our recruitment efforts to address emergent themes per se.</p>
<p>We also cannot determine the degree to which the factors that we identified interact with one another to influence the experience patients have with negotiating their HIV treatment in the context of depression. Although the model we have presented is representative of how the participants described what happens during the process of medication adherence decision making, it should be considered tentative. We do not claim that it provides an exhaustive explanation of all relevant factors. Indeed, more research is needed to explore additional mechanisms that contribute to adherence or nonadherence. Additionally, participants were selected because they experienced depression, and they were asked to discuss their experiences with depression and adherence. Even though depression played an important role in their experiences with adherence, our focus on depression could have biased participants’ responses in such a way to suggest that it plays a more central role than perhaps it does. Given the stability of depression as a predictor of HAART nonadherence across research studies, however, this concern might not be warranted.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, we have shed light on numerous ways depression can act to influence medication adherence patterns. The emergent theory takes into account specific pathways that can influence medication adherence decision making. Our results also illustrate unanticipated nuances in the possible mechanisms by which depression influences adherence, such as how depression could, in at least some cases, facilitate better adherence. Although such a finding contradicts much of the research literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312469462">Berger-Greenstein et al. (2007)</xref> also found that those who reported more depressive symptoms had higher self-reported rates of HIV medication adherence than those who reported fewer symptoms. We would like to examine this phenomenon in future research to fully understand the experiences of those who are depressed and who adhere better to their medication regimens.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>The theory, “navigating hazardous conditions,” provides an explanation of the possible mechanisms by which depression influences medication adherence among patients with HIV/AIDS and comorbid depressive disorders. Although evidence for the quantitative association between depression and nonadherence is pervasive in the research literature, the question of how depression influences adherence had previously received little research attention. We have proposed a tentative theory of this process and argue that much more work is needed to understand other contextual factors that play a role.</p>
<p>Indeed, our results provide a point of entry toward understanding particular factors and processes operating in the context of depression and medication adherence, and an avenue for discussions on adherence lapse and relapse. For instance, clinicians might reference the metaphor we have generated to illustrate medication adherence difficulties others with depression have had. In so doing, clinicians could help patients examine adherence difficulties in a way that might seem less confrontational. For example, knowing that some HIV-positive people lose confidence in their abilities to take medications when in the midst of a “skid” or debilitating depressive episode might enable them to acknowledge these difficulties with their providers. Clinicians, in turn, could use this information to help their patients prepare for “hazardous conditions” they will inevitably encounter in the course of their daily lives.</p>
