<abstract>
<p>Male facial width-to-height ratio appears to correlate with antisocial tendencies, such as aggression, exploitation, cheating, and deception. We present evidence that male facial width-to-height ratio is also associated with a stereotypically male prosocial tendency: to increase cooperation with other in-group members during intergroup competition. We found that men who had wider faces, compared with men who had narrower faces, showed more self-sacrificing cooperation to help their group members when there was competition with another group. We propose that this finding makes sense given the evolutionary functions of social helpfulness and aggression.</p>

<p>To date, studies relating male facial width-to-height ratio to behavior have suggested an association with antisocial tendencies, such as male aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797611435133">Carré &amp; McCormick, 2008</xref>), exploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797611435133">Stirrat &amp; Perrett, 2010</xref>), and cheating and deception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797611435133">Haselhuhn &amp; Wong, 2012</xref>). Facial width-to-height ratio also relates to physical dominance as perceived by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797611435133">Carré, McCormick, &amp; Mondloch, 2009</xref>), and fighting ability can be accurately evaluated from faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797611435133">Sell, Cosmides, et al., 2009</xref>). People also use this facial cue to accurately predict lack of trustworthiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797611435133">Stirrat &amp; Perrett, 2010</xref>) and predisposition to aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797611435133">Carré et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797611435133">Sell, Tooby, and Cosmides (2009)</xref> argued that because stronger men are more able to inflict costs on other people in aggressive interactions, they are able to express anger with greater impunity. Thus, there are circumstances in which male facial width-to-height ratio is clearly associated with antisocial behavior.</p>
<p>Facial width-to-height ratio has been shown to be sexually dimorphic in some samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797611435133">Weston, Friday, Johnstone, &amp; Schrenk, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797611435133">Weston, Friday, &amp; Lio, 2007</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797611435133">Pound et al., 2010</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797611435133">Özener, 2011</xref>), and facial structure has been linked to effects of testosterone in adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797611435133">Verdonck, Gaethofs, Carels, &amp; de Zegher, 1999</xref>). High facial width-to-height ratio may work as a marker of “masculine” tendencies, as there are clear sex differences with regard to aggression. Men display more aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797611435133">MacCoby &amp; Jacklin, 1980</xref>) and commit more violent crimes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797611435133">Fox &amp; Zawitz, 2011</xref>) than do women. Although there is evidence that men and women are equally likely to display aggression within intimate relationships, men are much more likely to be aggressive in public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797611435133">Baumeister &amp; Sommer, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the home, women clearly do more housework and care more for children, older adults, and the sick than do men. However, men appear to be more helpful than women in public activities and are also more likely to engage in heroic and risky helping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797611435133">Eagly &amp; Crowley, 1986</xref>), especially when being observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797611435133">Eagly, 1987</xref>). Combining out-group aggression with in-group helping, men are also more likely than women to die for their perceived kin in the ultimate aggressive helpfulness of suicide terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797611435133">Atran, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, men appear to be both more helpful and more aggressive than women in public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797611435133">Baumeister &amp; Sommer, 1997</xref>) and more sensitive to whether they are being observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797611435133">Eagly, 1987</xref>). Explaining why men should be more oriented toward public displays in this way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797611435133">Van Vugt, De Cremer, and Janssen (2007)</xref> suggested that men have evolved to be competitively cooperative. Those researchers showed experimentally that although men may be less cooperative than women when in competition within a group, they become more self-sacrificingly cooperative in helping their group members when there is competition with another group. Van Vugt et al. suggested an explanation for the contingent nature of male cooperation: Men should be more intergroup oriented because direct reproductive benefits follow from group membership and defense. Supporting this latter idea are findings that in traditional societies, male warriors have more sexual partners than do other men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797611435133">Chagnon, 1988</xref>), and that in the United States, male street-gang members have more mating opportunities than do non-gang members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797611435133">Palmer &amp; Tilley, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, we reasoned that variation in male facial width-to-height ratio may relate to variation in both overtly masculine prosocial behavior and overtly masculine antisocial behavior: That is, the association with uncooperative, exploitative, and aggressive behavior reported in prior studies may be found when behavior is studied within a social group that is the only context. However, when competition with an external group is salient, male facial width-to-height ratio may also predict prosocial cooperation within the group. We tested this hypothesis in the following experiment.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0956797611435133">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 54 male students at the University of St Andrews. Analysis was restricted to the 32 White participants<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0956797611435133">1</xref></sup> who completed all parts of the experiment (mean age = 20.6 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.97 years, range = 18–27 years), including a public-goods game. Participants signed up for two sessions at least 3 days apart. As compensation, participants were given £5 per hour for their time and the monetary value of their outcomes in the public-goods game.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0956797611435133">
<title>Procedure</title>
<sec id="section4-0956797611435133">
<title>Session 1: photography and questionnaires</title>
<p>In the first session, the general outline of the experiment was explained, and each participant gave consent to participation. Participants were photographed while making a neutral facial expression, and each participant’s height and weight were measured. Afterward, participants answered demographic questionnaires and questionnaires on their attitudes toward leadership and identity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0956797611435133">
<title>Session 2: public-goods game</title>
<p>In the second session, participants played a public-goods game. For this game, participants were randomly assigned to 6-person groups. The game was played on computers, and group members did not actually meet one another. Participants started the game with a £3 endowment. They could keep this endowment to themselves or invest as much as they wished in the group. They had been told that if the group as a whole invested more than £12 (i.e., if the average investment was more than £2), then each participant would lose his investment but receive a £5 return on it. Otherwise, each would lose his investment without any return.</p>
<p>Before playing the game for real payoffs, participants read a complete description of the game, watched a computer simulation of three practice games, and then played a practice game (without payment or feedback). They read the description of the game for a second time and watched three more simulated games.</p>
<p>Participants were split into two conditions. Directly before the practice game and then directly before the real game, participants in one condition (<italic>within-group competition</italic>) were told the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>We are interested in comparing how well individuals perform in group cooperation tasks. The other five players for your game are St Andrews University students recruited in the same way as you have been and randomly allocated to your group.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Competition with an out-group was primed among participants in the second condition (<italic>between-groups competition</italic>) by telling them the following both directly before the practice game and directly before the real game:
<disp-quote>
<p>We are interested in how individuals perform in group cooperation tasks. We will be comparing the cooperative performance of student groups at the University of St Andrews with student groups at the University of Edinburgh. The other five players in your group for this game are St Andrews University students, recruited in the same way as you and randomly allocated to your group.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Then, for the real game, each participant decided how much of his endowment to invest in the public-goods game. Investment in this game was the measure of competitive cooperation.</p>

<sec id="section6-0956797611435133">
<title>Facial measures</title>
<p>Following the methodology of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797611435133">Carré and McCormick (2008)</xref>, we used the face photographs to measure each participant’s bizygomatic width (approximately the breadth across the cheekbones) and upper-face height (approximately the height from the upper lip to the eyebrow ridge) and then calculated his width-to-height ratio (<italic>M</italic> = 2.03, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.16, range = 1.8–2.3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0956797611435133">
<title>Overall-size measures</title>
<p>As aggression and group competitiveness may be related to overall size, we calculated the correlations between facial width-to-height ratio and both height and weight. Neither of these correlations was significant (height: <italic>n</italic> = 32, <italic>r</italic> = −.28, <italic>p</italic> = .13, <italic>p</italic><sub>rep</sub> = .78; weight: <italic>n</italic> = 32, <italic>r</italic> = .24, <italic>p</italic> = .19, <italic>p</italic><sub>rep</sub> = .72).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0956797611435133" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Participants’ mean investment in the public-goods game was £1.73 in the within-group condition (<italic>n</italic> = 17; <italic>SD</italic> = £0.75, range = £0–3) and £1.77 in the between-groups condition (<italic>n</italic> = 15; <italic>SD</italic> = £1.06, range = £0–3).</p>
<p>We tested the possibility that facial width-to-height ratio would interact with group-competition condition in predicting participants’ investment (cooperation) in the public-goods game. We used an analysis of covariance in which investment was the dependent variable, group-competition condition was a between-subjects factor, and facial width-to-height ratio was a covariate.</p>
<p>There was no main effect of facial width-to-height ratio on investment, <italic>F</italic>(1, 28) = 0.00, <italic>p</italic> = .99, <italic>p</italic><sub>rep</sub> = .04.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This experiment shows that more dominant males, identified by high facial width-to-height ratio, are significantly more self-sacrificing than less dominant males under conditions of group competition.</p>
<p>The facial width-to-height ratio of men has been reported to be associated with antisocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797611435133">Carré &amp; McCormick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797611435133">Haselhuhn &amp; Wong, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797611435133">Stirrat &amp; Perrett, 2010</xref>). Wider faces are perceived to be more untrustworthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797611435133">Stirrat &amp; Perrett, 2010</xref>) and more dominant and aggressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797611435133">Carré et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, facial masculinity, of which facial dominance is a component, is associated with perceived lack of warmth, perceived honesty, and perceived lack of cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797611435133">Perrett et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The present finding provides a more nuanced understanding of masculinity and male behavior. Compared with women, men appear to be more sensitive to intergroup relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797611435133">Van Vugt et al., 2007</xref>) and to whether they are being observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797611435133">Eagly, 1987</xref>), but this is true for both aggressive and cooperative behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797611435133">Baumeister &amp; Sommer, 1997</xref>). The results of this experiment suggest that those males who are more formidable and who are predisposed to displaying more aggressive antisocial behavior also are predisposed to be more intergroup oriented and are more likely to make sacrifices to support the groups to which they belong. In short, male variation in facial characteristics predicts both antisocial and prosocial behavior, depending on the context.</p>
<p>Human cooperation and altruism have very likely evolved within a long history of conflict between groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797611435133">Buss, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797611435133">Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797611435133">Wrangham, 1999</xref>). Therefore, one would expect people to have evolved either innate responses or innate learning abilities regarding aggression between groups. There are good evolutionary reasons for men to be especially intergroup oriented, because membership in groups (like social status within those groups) correlates positively with the number of mating opportunities for men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797611435133">Chagnon, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797611435133">Palmer &amp; Tilley, 1995</xref>). As men with wider faces are rated as physically less attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797611435133">Stirrat &amp; Perrett, 2010</xref>) and display more antisocial behavior that is likely to be unattractive as well, males with wider faces may adopt this stereotypically male strategy of intergroup orientation and within-group helping behavior (including aggressive defense) as a compensatory strategy for affirming their group membership and gaining prestige with both men and women in their group.</p>
<p>Some questions as to how people react to others’ facial width have not yet been answered. People use variation in facial width-to-height ratio as a cue to antisocial predispositions in dyadic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797611435133">Carré et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797611435133">Stirrat &amp; Perrett, 2010</xref>), but whether male facial width-to-height ratio is used as a cue to prosocial behavioral predispositions in group-competition contexts is a subject for future research. Researchers have also not addressed the question of whether this cue has evolved as a signal of dominance (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797611435133">Weston et al., 2004</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797611435133">Weston et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we offer here a more nuanced account of how male facial anatomy may relate to male behavior. Although traits evident in the face may indicate physical formidability, these traits do not necessarily predict antisocial tendencies. As demonstrated here, the same traits that predict selfish behavior in some contexts can predict generosity in a context of competition with other groups.</p>
<p>Understanding this contingent inter- and intragroup male behavior is crucial to interpreting the relation between appearance and behavior. For example, in a fascinating recent article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797611435133">Wong, Ormiston, and Haselhuhn (2011)</xref> indicated that the facial width-to-height ratio of chief executive officers (CEOs) predicted their firms’ financial performance. For Wong et al., the possible salient personal characteristics of the CEO that improve a firm’s performance are power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797611435133">Rule &amp; Ambady, 2008</xref>) and aggressive and exploitative behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797611435133">Carré &amp; McCormick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797611435133">Stirrat &amp; Perrett, 2010</xref>). Clearly, given the data in our study, it is possible that the correlation between CEOs’ facial width-to-height ratio and their firms’ financial performance is due not to CEOs’ aggressive tendencies, but to their tendencies toward self-sacrifice on behalf of their firms.</p>

<p>Of the original sample, 73% were White, and the rest were of various ethnicities (e.g., 13% were Chinese). We were concerned about ethnicity as a confound. In checking, we found that the mean facial width-to-height ratio of the White participants differed from the mean of the non-White participants (Whites: <italic>M</italic> = 2.03; non-Whites: <italic>M</italic> = 1.93), <italic>t</italic>(45) = −2.08, <italic>p</italic> = .043, <italic>p</italic><sub>rep</sub> = .89. Because we found no difference between these groups in game investment (Whites: <italic>M</italic> = £1.86; non-Whites: <italic>M</italic> = £2.06), <italic>t</italic>(46) = 0.83, <italic>p</italic> = .23, <italic>p</italic><sub>rep</sub> = .69, we assumed that the group differences in facial width-to-height ratio were introducing noise and so excluded the non-White participants from the analysis. There were not enough participants in any non-White groups for useful cross-ethnicity comparison, and running an analysis of covariance including all participants produced results similar to, but weaker than, the results reported in the main text: Facial width-to-height ratio did not have a significant main effect on investment in the public-goods game, <italic>F</italic>(1, 43) = 0.52, <italic>p</italic> = .47, <italic>p</italic><sub>rep</sub> = .52. There was a main effect of group-competition condition, <italic>F</italic>(1, 43) = 4.95, <italic>p</italic> = .031, <italic>p</italic><sub>rep</sub> = .91, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .10, and this effect interacted with facial width-to-height ratio, <italic>F</italic>(1, 43) = 5.24, <italic>p</italic> = .027, <italic>p</italic><sub>rep</sub> = .92, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .11. These results support our decision to focus on within-ethnicity variation to reduce noise in our analysis.</p>
