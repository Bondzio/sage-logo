<p>RC is a 39-year-old obese female with a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, type II. She was at home with her family when she experienced the sudden onset of right-sided hemiplegia and aphasia. She was transported to the hospital and thrombolytic therapy was initiated after a computed tomography (CT) scan showed no intracranial hemorrhage. She was diagnosed with a brain stem stroke and developed hydrocephalus. Despite maximal therapy, RC lapsed into a coma and ventilator management was required. Glasgow coma scale is currently 3 and has not changed for several days.</p>
<p>RC had a boyfriend with whom she lived for the last 12 years; they had no children.  The medical team feels that RC will not recover and will need a tracheostomy and feeding tube placed if the family wants to pursue aggressive management.  Although RC’s boyfriend feels that RC would not want her life prolonged under these circumstances, RC’s father (whom she saw 2-3 times a year and has a good relationship) does not want to “just give up.” He asserts his right as RC’s father to make medical decisions. A conflict between the father and the boyfriend regarding future care and scope of treatment has resulted in an ethics consult.  Who is the most appropriate surrogate?</p>

<title>Physician’s Perspective</title>

<p>Once loving family members may become bitter enemies as they engage in the process of determining who will be the person in charge of making medical decisions for someone not capable of doing that for themselves. Our increasingly diverse and aging population has brought this issue to the forefront of medical ethics. Although some legislative provisions exist for the appointment of surrogates for incompetent patients, there are still many gray areas, particularly when the incapacitated patient has chosen an alternative lifestyle where they may have a dedicated significant other yet are not formally or legally married In the case of a gay or lesbian person, a formal, legally binding marriage may not be available for them, depending on where she lives. Thus, this leaves health care professionals facing challenging situations in attempting to find the appropriate surrogate decision maker for incapacitated patients, as in our case here.</p>
<p>In my clinical experience, the ethical, legal, and administrative tangles faced in determining who is the appropriate surrogate decision maker are often murky. Specific problems, such as administrative ambiguities in applying regional laws and jurisdictions as well as the impracticalities of using any rigorous judicial process, can often delay the process of appointing surrogates, which can make the medical decisions even more delicate.  Here one might inquire as to whether there are any common law marriage aspects that apply to a couple who have cohabitated for 12 years, despite not being legally married. I would tend to favor using her boyfriend as the surrogate. I agree with the ethics team consult, and as a member of that team, my vote goes in favor of RC’s boyfriend.  The ultimate aim of the ethics consult team is to facilitate timely medical care while ensuring ethical practices that respect the patient’s dignity. Keeping her alive with mechanical ventilation and tube feeding just because her father does not want to just give up does not sound like respecting, or ultimately protecting, the patient’s dignity.</p>

<title>Nursing Perspective</title>
<p>
<italic>Submitted by</italic> Paige Mingle, RN, MSN, CEN, CCNS, APN</p>
<p>RC’s case highlights a difficult situation that is happening more in America’s hospitals, family members disagreeing about the care of a loved one. I believe this is happening more now for a few reasons. One, people are not choosing traditional relationships. Second, our medical advancements have allowed those who would have not survived certain conditions to now survive. Third, family members are still not telling each other their choices/wishes about end-of-life care. Fourth, due to poor health habits and noncompliance younger people are now becoming to be in situations where they are incapacitated. These types of disagreements/arguments will continue to take place as the law has not addressed yet nontraditional relationships in regard to legal decision maker for an incapacitated person. They will also continue as our medical advancements continue to save lives and society continues to have poor health habits.</p>
<p>It is sad when family members, who all love the patient, argue over the care and treatment the patient should have because the patient is now unable to state his or her wishes. Arguments between family members are difficult for nurses as they are at the bedside caring for the patient each moment of the day. Nurses want to provide the best care possible for their patients and for that care to be what the patient would want. Nurses have to many times rely on the family to share the patient’s wishes with them and when the family argues about that care/treatment, nurses are torn.</p>
<p>As a nurse in RC’s case, I would want to know the state laws on who can make health care decisions for an incapacitated patient. Since RC and her boyfriend had lived together for 12 years I would want to know whether the state recognized common law marriages. Both RC’s father and boyfriend need to be assessed for their understanding of RC’s condition and treatment options. Sometimes in very stressful events family members do not always understand what is truly happenings and what the outcomes will be from their decisions. If both the father and boyfriend have a true understanding and are still arguing then the ethics team needs to step in to facilitate medical care that respects the patient’s dignity and that would not cause her undue harm and suffering.</p>
<p>I would support allowing the boyfriend to be RC’s surrogate. RC’s boyfriend has lived with her for 12 years and her father only sees her 2 to 3 times a year. I see her boyfriend as her “spouse” and would know her likes, dislikes, her lifestyle, and her wishes for her medical treatment.</p>

<title>Ethics Perspective</title>
<p>
<italic>Submitted by</italic> Matt Stolick, PhD</p>
<p>This case shows 2 men who would most benefit from each other in this immediate situation by unloading a ton of emotional baggage and seek some sort of closure. Once this happens the decision for RC may be made in consensus by the 2. If the boyfriend has “been there” for RC and has actually made other medical decisions for her prior to the father coming around to see RC, then I think there is a strong argument citing precedent and his reliability and loyalty to RC to continue to recognize him as surrogate. Morally speaking, in light of the fact that a good surrogate decision is one that chooses as the incompetent person would have chosen were the latter competent, the fact that 39-year-old RC has lived with her boyfriend for the last 12 years is powerful. This is obviously the primary person we would want to talk to about what RC would have wanted. Employing the pure autonomy standard of surrogate decision making, we would look for her prior autonomous judgments about, ideally, this exact medical condition and prognosis. If the father did have such an exact statement, it would potentially nullify a boyfriend who could merely infer about what RC would have wanted. I do not see that as the situation here. Here the boyfriend seems to be inferring from other values and preferences of RC, not so clearly the father. If we have not what we could call clear and autonomous judgments about life-sustaining treatment in the event she was in the medical condition she is now in, we still with this boyfriend and father have enough to substitute a judgment for RC in this situation, given her previously expressed preferences and values. We really want to hear them decide with a clear, explicitly stated reason: because this is what RC would have wanted. The farther the reasons are from what RC would have wanted, the more we should call into question as legitimate such surrogate decisions. In this case, it seems that given the poor prognosis, the boyfriend has a better grip on the reality of this situation – this is the end of RC’s life. Legally, the father would still seem to be closer than a boyfriend, and values and preferences of RC were also known by the father from an earlier version of RC are legitimate and I think very important to acknowledge here. I envision the ideal scenario one where RC and this boyfriend talked and each expressed what RC meant to him in his life. This could be a powerful scene for both these men, a key moment in each of their lives. I think to handle this situation responsibly requires recognizing this fact. We are not going to disregard what either of these men has to say here because they are both surrogates in a sense. These 2 are heavily invested in RC. The father’s exact words are that he does not want to “just give up.” These words are not clearly an accurate portrayal of the boyfriend’s decision especially given the medical team does not think she will recover. It may be the father is shocked and stifled by this reality. Perhaps he has not given up on playing some part in his adult daughter's life, even if a limited one. Maybe he has regrets and was really banking on repairing their relationship, of saying or doing something, for his daughter.  It is in this deeper sense the father is not ready to just give up. Asking and compassionately listening to his response to therapeutic and caring questions as to what he has already gone through with his daughter, what kind of relationship he had with her, and giving him some space here to just respond are all I think appropriate, especially from a palliative, bereavement perspective. There is healthy closure to be found in this situation, and I think ethically it should be recognized as the delicate but ripe and timely thing it is, a chance to artfully provide the time and place for these 2 men to share with each other, to see things from the other’s perspective, and to ease into the reality of life without RC. So primarily a case for virtue ethics to resolve, citing discernment and compassion as especially important, with a Kantian respect for other persons, namely the father and boyfriend in this case, and utilitarian recognizes the greatest good for both these men and for the medical team involved. If we can foster a heartfelt discussion between these 2 men, and attain closure and consensus I think it would be a moral success.  </p>

<title>Chaplain Perspective</title>
<p>
<italic>Submitted by</italic> Karrie A. Oertli, DMin</p>
<p>I offer thanks to the Rev Rhonda Gilligan-Gillespie, Director, Pastoral Care and Education, Wesley Medical Center, Wichita, Kansas, for her consultation on this case. There are certain legal aspects regarding this question of surrogacy, and one would be whether or not RC and her boyfriend are considered to be married by common law.  This is something that a legal expert would have to determine, as it determines who would have primacy. We do not know in which state RC and her boyfriend reside, or even if they consider themselves married by common law.  It would be important to discover the meaning that RC’s boyfriend and her father have placed upon the meaning of RC’s and the boyfriend’s relationship.</p>
<p>The central relational dynamics seem to be between RC and her father and between the father and RC’s boyfriend.  It seems as though the good relationship between RC and her father is meaningful and that the relationship between RC’s boyfriend and the father is not as strong. This brings to focus the importance of discussing the tensions between these 2 men separately and then together.  </p>
<p>The professional chaplain would speak to each of these regarding their feelings about RC’s wishes. It could very well be that these 2 men are not that far apart in their intentions toward RC’s care: to provide “comfort measures only” and to not just give up may be closer than one might expect.  It may be that they are much farther apart in their regard—or disregard—for each other.  Until that can be clarified, however, their stories must be heard and their relationship untangled.  What is yet unknown from this story will impact the way they see each other and their responsibilities toward RC.</p>
<p>Did she have an advance directive? Did she designate one of them to be a surrogate? With both men, caregivers must engage the question of her wishes. The professional chaplain would want to discuss whether or not RC talked about the end of her life. Asking the question “Did RC ever tell you what she wanted if something like this happened?” could be a good way to broach the subject of her wishes. Unexpressed feelings of guilt, shame, disappointment, anger with RC or sadness about her health might be strong in either or both of these persons. RC’s boyfriend may not be willing to continue to support her with surmounting health needs such as tracheostomy or feeding tube care.  If the boyfriend is not, is the father willing to take on such responsibilities? Without an opportunity to express and explore those feelings, one or both of these men may continue to act through them to an impasse.</p>
<p>This case also highlights the importance of improving the understanding of palliative care.  Providing “comfort care only” is not an abdication of care for the person in need of it. It is not just giving up. The pervasive adage in health care that there is “nothing more that we can do” undermines the reality of palliative care, which is “focused on providing patients with relief from the symptoms, pain, and stress of a serious illness—whatever the diagnosis. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the family.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909112440565">1</xref></sup> Comfort care is an active practice of care in which health care providers attend to the person and their family members.  Both RC’s boyfriend and father can be involved in this act. Providing for them the options of comfort measures, including hospice care, could assist them both in knowing that they are caring for her together in her active dying just as they cared for her in her living.</p>
<p>Further, having these difficult conversations allows both RC’s father and boyfriend to have improved lives themselves from this point forward.  Many relationships are broken by such crisis experiences, and interventions can have powerful beneficial effects to both these men as they move forward from this time.</p>

<title>Social Work Perspective</title>
<p>
<italic>Submitted by</italic> Leslie Stilin Schmidt, MSSW, MA</p>
<p>This unfortunate case speaks to the importance of completing an advance directive. Those of us in health care encourage anyone over the age of 18 to complete one, but we put particular emphasis on those who have chronic or life-limiting illnesses.</p>
<p>The question posed by this situation is not necessarily an ethical one but rather a legal question. The laws of the particular state will dictate who is to be the legal decision maker. Each state has a specific guideline for deciding the next of kin. I will make an assumption here but in most cases the next of kin for an unmarried adult will be the living parent. I think it is safe to assume her father will be the legal decision maker.</p>
<p>What makes this case feel different is the emotional sympathy we feel for the both the father and the boyfriend.  Our emotions lead us to make assumptions that direct our thoughts about who should be the decision maker. We assume the boyfriend should be the decision maker because he has been in a relationship with her for 12 years. We assume that the relationship was a good and loving one, not an abusive or destructive one. We assume because her father saw her only a few times a year he does not know what she would want for her health care. Well, I think it noteworthy to remind ourselves that at no point did she make arrangements for either of them to be her decision maker. We have no way of knowing who she trusted or not. In addition, we have no evidence that she did in fact want either of them to be the decision maker.</p>
<p>We have 2 differing opinions: one, what type of care she would want. Last, I think in cases like this we “feel” for the long-term life partner; however, our feelings for their situation do not necessarily equate to the ability to act on behalf of the partner. Their relationship is clearly significant; however, the length of time long or short does not equate to his role as a decision maker.</p>
<p>The best case scenarios would include efforts to bring these 2 men, who we assume love her, closer together in their thinking about her further care. If that is not possible, it may be appropriate to support the boyfriend in coping with a situation that is beyond his control while still maintaining loving action toward her. The worst case scenario would be a distracting legal fight about who should be the decision maker, only driving the 2 people we believe she cares deeply for further and further apart.</p>

<title>Legal Perspective</title>
<p>
<italic>Submitted by</italic> Gerald M. Morris, JD, LLM</p>
<p>This case study again presents the difficulty that is created when patients do not have formal advance directives to identify a surrogate decision maker. Here, the patient RC is a relatively young woman who due to a myriad of medical circumstances is now in a coma and on a ventilator. The Glascow coma scale of 3 suggests that recovery is not possible.  The medical team indicates a tracheostomy and feeding tube will be needed.</p>
<p>Patient RC has lived with her boyfriend for 12 years. He feels that comfort measures alone are consistent with her wishes. However, RC’s father is also involved. Although the father and RC have a good relationship, they have only seen each other infrequently over the past few years.  Nevertheless, the father asserts that as a parent he has the legal right to make the decisions here and he is not willing to let go at this point.</p>
<p>The question posed is who the most appropriate surrogate. This is difficult to answer because both the boyfriend and the father care deeply about the patient. Each is struggling in their own ways to do the right thing.</p>
<p>If the measure of appropriateness is a long-standing close relationship which implies a special depth of understanding of the patient as a person—then between the father and the boyfriend it is the boyfriend who is the more appropriate. Yet from the legal perspective, and depending on the laws of the jurisdiction involved, it may be that the father is the most appropriate.</p>
<p>This is because most states have statutes that establish an order of decision-making priority in the absence of an advance directive appointing a surrogate. Typically, it is first the legal guardian, then the spouse, then adult child, parent, sibling, or other relative who has demonstrated special care and concern. In the absence of all of them, a “close person friend” may them serve.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, strict application of the law sometimes results in a decision maker who may have authority based on a legal priority, but who may not be the person who is best or in the closest position to know the patient’s current wishes. To overcome this difficulty, some states have adopted laws that acknowledge civil unions or domestic partnerships in a manner that provide a legal standing equivalent to that of spouse.</p>
<p>Here it seems that both the father and the boyfriend have sincere affection for the patient and respect for each other. Perhaps with the assistance of the ethics committee and others, common ground can be reached to allow them to deal with this tragic situation together.</p>
