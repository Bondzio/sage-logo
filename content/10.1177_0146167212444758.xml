<abstract>
<p>Believing that one can influence outcomes presumably fosters a psychological sense of control. So too, however, might adaptive ways of thinking known as secondary control (SC) processes that operate when outcomes are believed to be unattainable. Using a 5-year prospective design and a representative sample of adults (ages 79-98), folk beliefs (e.g., “negative experiences can be a blessing in disguise”) were used to assess SC processes. The authors expected SC Folk Beliefs would predict Sense of Control (Hypothesis 1) which, in turn, would predict self-rated health, hospital admissions, and survival (Hypothesis 2). An <italic>indirect</italic> relationship was hypothesized: SC Folk Beliefs were expected to predict outcomes through the Sense of Control (Hypothesis 3). Support was found for all hypotheses providing insights into the antecedents and consequences of a sense of control and about how SC beliefs and a sense of control function in the context of health.</p>

<body>
<p>The theme of control is often featured in literature, poetry, and song lyrics. In Frank Sinatra’s classic <italic>I Did It My Way</italic>, the exertion of control is portrayed as the foundation of a good life. In the more contemporary song, <italic>Control</italic>, songwriter Terry Lewis and James Harris depict control as a ubiquitous psychological state (“I’m in control”) that is highly desired (“I love it”) and coveted (“Don’t make me lose it”). This state that is quantifiable (“I’ve got lots of it”) is achieved by believing there are ways to personally influence life outcomes (by “what I say and what I do”).</p>
<p>This psychological state is referred to as <italic>perceived control</italic> in the research literature. Like the songwriters, researchers have envisioned this state as evolving when one appraises outcomes as being within one’s influence. In contrast, perceived control is presumably eroded when outcomes are appraised as uncontrollable. Given that challenge is a hallmark of later life, older adults represent an ideal target population in which to study the psychological state of control. Perceived control should clearly decline with advancing age as goals are increasingly thwarted and outcomes become less achievable. Paradoxically, however, even when faced with objectively uncontrollable outcomes, many older adults seem to remain psychologically “in control.” This <italic>control paradox</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167212444758">Chipperfield, Perry, &amp; Stewart, 2012</xref>) underscores the need for a comprehensive analysis of psychological control in later life that extends beyond the traditional view of control.</p>
<p>The present study provides such an analysis of a representative sample of older community-dwelling adults. We considered the viability of assessing an overarching psychological sense of control construct that we broadened to include the state existing regardless of whether influence <italic>is</italic> or <italic>is not</italic> thought possible. The main goals were to examine the antecedent beliefs that might foster this broad psychological sense of control and to assess its consequent effects on health and mortality.</p>
<sec id="section1-0146167212444758">
<title>Sense of Control</title>
<p>Past research has not examined an overarching sense of control comprising the psychological state that arises when outcomes are appraised as being under one’s control <italic>and</italic> a more obscured state arising when outcomes are regarded as uncontrollable. Because the literature is already overcrowded by multiple labels, we have chosen not to introduce a new label to depict this overarching psychological state. Instead, we retain the <italic>sense of control</italic> label, but use it in a specific way to capture the overarching or overall state that exists both when influence <italic>is</italic> and <italic>is not</italic> perceived possible. Notably, this use of the label departs from the past tradition that has applied it interchangeably with the labels such as perceived control, internal control, and so on.</p>
<p>Little is known about the psychological state of control that may exist even when outcomes cannot be influenced, as this seemingly counterintuitive state has largely been ignored. Some studies, however, imply it might encompass a sense of power bestowed by some external source or a sense of orderliness as opposed to phenomenological chaos. In particular, when people perceive they cannot influence outcomes, there is an enhanced tendency to believe in a God (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167212444758">Kay, Gaucher, McGregor, &amp; Nash, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167212444758">Kay, Gaucher, Napier, Callan, &amp; Laurin, 2008</xref>) and to find meaning in random visual scenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0146167212444758">Whitson &amp; Galinsky, 2008</xref>). This largely ignored psychological state has the potential to account for the <italic>control paradox</italic> wherein an individual can feel psychologically “in control” even when exposed to a barrage of outcomes that are objectively uncontrollable.</p>
<p>Thus, it seems essential to consider a broad overarching sense of control that includes this largely ignored psychological state. Given that perceived control has been described as a “cornerstone of successful aging” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212444758">Baltes &amp; Baltes, 1990</xref>), our broader sense of control construct might be even more pertinent to successful aging. Moreover, it has the potential to inform an ongoing scientific controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167212444758">Morling &amp; Evered, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0146167212444758">Skinner, 2007</xref>) regarding whether the psychological sense of control is fostered by adaptive ways of thinking referred to as secondary control (SC) in the <italic>Two-Process Model of Control</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167212444758">Rothbaum, Weisz, &amp; Snyder, 1982</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0146167212444758">
<title>SC Processes as Antecedents to a Sense of Control</title>
<p>A major premise in this model is that a psychological sense of control is fostered by two processes, primary control processes that involve beliefs about influencing outcomes and SC processes that come into play when influence is perceived as impossible. SC processes are conceived of as accommodative ways of thinking, allowing one to “go with the flow” by reinterpreting negative outcomes and adjusting goals and attributions. The premise that SC ways of thinking foster a psychological sense of control led to a major shift in thinking for some researchers, although it was rejected by others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0146167212444758">Skinner, 2007</xref>) who instead favored an alternative view of SC more recently introduced in the Life Span Theory of Control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167212444758">Heckhausen &amp; Schulz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167212444758">Schulz &amp; Heckhausen, 1996</xref>). Because this theory does not view the function of SC as fostering a psychological sense of control, it has not prompted examinations of this linkage.</p>
<p>The few existing studies that have examined the relationship between SC and the sense of control (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167212444758">Morling &amp; Evered’s 2006</xref> review) offer inadequate tests. They are inadequate because they rely on traditional definitions and measures of psychological control such as efficacy, internal locus, and tenacious goal pursuit. Further systematic empirical tests are needed to consider whether SC serves as an antecedent to a broad sense of control as it is herein defined.</p>

<title>Health Consequences of Sense of Control</title>
<p>Because prior research has not examined the psychological state that exists both when influence <italic>is</italic> and <italic>is not</italic> perceived as achievable, it is also critical to consider the health consequences of this broad overarching sense of control. It is likely that the consequences will be similar to those that have been found for traditional perceived control measures (e.g., locus of control, mastery, and self-efficacy). Perceived control is consistently shown to have health benefits for individuals across the life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167212444758">Schulz, Heckhausen, &amp; Locher, 1991</xref>), and the early experimental studies convincingly demonstrated its linkage to autonomic reactivity and catecholamine levels, suppressed tumor rejection, and increased tumor growth and gastric ulceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212444758">Bandura, Reese, &amp; Adams, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167212444758">Sklar &amp; Anisman, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0146167212444758">Tsuda &amp; Hirai, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0146167212444758">Visintainer, Volpicelli, &amp; Seligman, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>The detrimental consequences of low perceived control have been demonstrated more recently with regard to an increasing production of cytokine secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167212444758">Griffin &amp; Chen, 2006</xref>) and salivary cortisol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167212444758">Bollini, Walker, Hamann, &amp; Kestler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167212444758">Kern et al., 2008</xref>), and with regard to reductions in pulmonary functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167212444758">Griffin &amp; Chen, 2006</xref>) and brain glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167212444758">Kern et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, compelling evidence has shown that perceived control predicted survival in an early study notable for its large sample (<italic>n</italic> = 4,317) and 12-year follow-up period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167212444758">Chipperfield, 1993</xref>) and in subsequent studies based on smaller samples and/or shorter follow-up periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167212444758">Anstey, Luszcz, &amp; Andrews, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212444758">Fry &amp; Debats, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167212444758">Krause &amp; Shaw, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167212444758">Menec &amp; Chipperfield, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>The Present Study: Examining a Sense of Control in Late Life</title>
<p>The present study examined the viability of a broadly defined sense of control construct that combines two separate psychological states assessed by asking about perceptions of control that exist both when influence <italic>is</italic> and <italic>is not</italic> perceived possible. The major study objectives were (a) to examine the antecedent (SC) beliefs that foster this broad psychological sense of control and (b) to assess the potential consequences of a sense of control for older adults’ subsequent health and longevity. SC beliefs were assessed with folk expressions that contain crystallized wisdom regarding how to approach challenging everyday life situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212444758">Freund &amp; Baltes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167212444758">Mieder, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0146167212444758">Swift, Bailis, Chipperfield, Ruthig, &amp; Newall, 2008</xref>). These folk beliefs (e.g., seeing “blessings in disguise”) offer a useful way to operationalize SC in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212444758">Chipperfield, Perry, Volk, &amp; Hladkyj, 2003</xref>) because they permeate everyday language, are familiar, and avoid any explicit reference to control.</p>
<p>Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167212444758">Rothbaum et al.’s (1982)</xref> premise, we hypothesized that SC Folk Beliefs should be associated with Sense of Control (Hypothesis 1). Drawing on research using traditional perceived control measures, we further hypothesized that our Sense of Control measure would relate to health outcomes in much the same way. Sense of Control should prospectively predict health outcomes (Hypothesis 2); it should relate positively to self-rated health and inversely to hospital admissions as assessed 2 to 3 years later and to mortality as assessed 5 years later. Finally, SC Folk Beliefs were hypothesized to predict these outcomes <italic>indirectly</italic> by promoting a Sense of Control (Hypothesis 3). Confirmation of this meditational hypothesis would support the idea that SC processes foster the Sense of Control which, in turn, has health-related consequences.</p>
<p>In addition to testing the main hypotheses, two supplemental issues were considered. First, because the utility of our broad Sense of Control measure would be questionable if it failed to predict outcomes as well as a traditional measure, we compared the relative predictive utility of both measures. This provided a benchmark to prior studies that have used measures such as locus of control or mastery, and it allowed us to examine the potential added value of our Sense of Control measure over a traditional measure. Second, we considered whether SC Folk Beliefs promoted positive emotions. This allowed us to consider whether the function of SC is more to foster positive affect than to foster a sense of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167212444758">Morling &amp; Evered, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0146167212444758">Skinner, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants were community-living older adults who took part in the Aging in Manitoba (AIM) project (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167212444758">Chipperfield, Havens, &amp; Doig, 1997</xref>, for details). The structure and sampling strategy of the AIM are briefly outlined before describing the relevant subsample used in the present analyses. In 1971, a random sample of adults (stratified by place of residence and region) was drawn from the population-based Manitoba Health Registry (MHR; ages = 65+ years). Additional cross-sectional samples of individuals were subsequently selected in an identical way in 1976 and 1983, and several follow-up data collections occurred (1990, 1996, 2001, 2005, and 2006). Past analyses show that the initial 1971 sample was generally representative of the larger population of older Manitobans with regard to gender, marital status, and age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167212444758">Chipperfield et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167212444758">Mossey, Havens, Roos, &amp; Shapiro, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>The present analyses are based on a subset of AIM participants (<italic>n</italic> = 224) who also took part in the <italic>Successful Aging Study (SAS)</italic>, a satellite study designed to assess psychosocial aspects of aging and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167212444758">Chipperfield, Perry, &amp; Weiner, 2003</xref>). To be eligible for the SAS interview conducted in 2003, AIM respondents had to be cognitively competent, living in the community (i.e., not institutionalized), able to speak English, and able to complete the interview with little proxy assistance. For the present purposes, some analyses were restricted to participants who were interviewed in 2003 and again 3 years later (<italic>n</italic> = 121); others included participants who responded only to the 2003 interview (<italic>n</italic> = 224). For simplicity, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0146167212444758">Table 1</xref> reports descriptive statistics for the larger sample only (<italic>n</italic> = 224), although they are essentially identical for the smaller sample.</p>

<title>Independent (Baseline) Variables: 2001-2002</title>
<p>Baseline information on demographics and health status was available from the 2001 AIM interview. The majority of participants were female (62.0%, 1 = <italic>male</italic>, 2 = <italic>female</italic>), had an average age of approximately 85 years (range = 79-98), and had roughly 10.5 years of education. The baseline health-status indicators of self-rated health (2001) and hospital admissions (2001-2002) were measured in an identical way as the dependent measures that are described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0146167212444758">
<title>SC Folk Beliefs (2003)</title>
<p>The key independent variable, SC Folk Beliefs (2003), was based on five common folk beliefs that capture accommodative thinking (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0146167212444758">appendix</xref>). The expressions can be interpreted as being generally consistent with the original meaning of SC as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167212444758">Rothbaum et al. (1982)</xref> and as captured in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167212444758">Morling and Evered’s (2006)</xref> refined notion of <italic>fit-focused SC</italic> that includes two components: adjustment and acceptance. In particular, <italic>adjustment</italic> was implied in three items suggesting a reinterpretation of outcomes: “Negative experiences can often be a blessing in disguise,” “I often tell myself I should count my blessings,” “I’m a believer in the idea that every cloud has a silver lining,” <italic>r</italic>(224) = .30-.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. <italic>Acceptance</italic> was implied in two items, <italic>r</italic>(224) = .40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, that reflect an absence of desire to change the present (“Patience is a virtue”) and an acceptance of how things evolve without intervention (“Things will all work out in the end”). Our SC Folk Beliefs measure was the average over these five items that assessed agreement with each expression (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 6 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>).</p>
<p>Several psychometric indicators support the SC Folk Beliefs measure: It had good internal validity (α = .75); it correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) with an established positive reappraisal measure of SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0146167212444758">Wrosch, Heckhausen, &amp; Lachman, 2000</xref>) that was obtained later in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212444758">Newall, Chipperfield, Daniels, Hladkyj, &amp; Perry, 2009</xref>), and the items formed a single factor accounting for 52% of the total variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212444758">Newall et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Mediating Variable: Sense of Control (2003)</title>
<p>Sense of Control was assessed by three components derived from participants’ responses to items in the 2003 interview. The first two components tapped into perceptions of control in nine specific domains that are highly relevant to the rhythm of daily life in older adults: physical health; physical fitness; physical comfort or discomfort; the basic tasks that need to be done to look after yourself (e.g., bathing); the usual tasks that need to be done (e.g., housework); developing new friendships; things you can do for fun and enjoyment; who you spend time with; and where you live or will be living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212444758">Chipperfield et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The first perceived control (PC_1) component assessed participants’ beliefs about how much they could <italic>directly influence</italic> outcomes by the things they did or said. This measure that we have previously labeled perceived primary control is aligned with the traditional view of a psychological state arising from beliefs about one’s personal influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167212444758">Chipperfield, Campbell, &amp; Perry, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167212444758">Ruthig, Chipperfield, Bailis, &amp; Perry, 2008</xref>). A total PC_1 score was the mean influence rating (1 = <italic>almost no influence</italic>, 10 = <italic>total influence</italic>) calculated over the nine domains. As reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167212444758">Ruthig et al., 2008</xref>), when subjected to a confirmatory factor analysis, the items conformed to a single factor with item loadings between .72 and .86; the interitem correlations ranged from .42 to .79; and the alpha was .92.</p>
<p>The second perceived control (PC_2) component assessed respondents’ subjective reports of control when they were <italic>unable to influence</italic> outcomes in the same nine domains (1 = <italic>almost totally out of control</italic>, 10 = <italic>totally in control</italic>). Previously labeled perceived secondary control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167212444758">Chipperfield et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167212444758">Ruthig et al., 2008</xref>), the item wording might seem to contradict the common-sense notion of control perceptions. However, few study participants reported difficulty in understanding the intent of the items (<italic>n</italic> = 1) or in responding to them (<italic>n</italic> = 3 responded “don’t know”).</p>
<p>The total PC_2 score was the mean rating calculated over the nine domains. A confirmatory factor analysis of these items yielded a single factor with item loadings between .71 and .85; the interitem correlations ranged from .62 to .85; and the alpha was .96 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167212444758">Ruthig et al., 2008</xref>). Predictive validity was also demonstrated for this measure in our scenario study: For participants who were led to believe they had no influence, this measure (PC_2) predicted a positive outlook about future health risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167212444758">Ruthig et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to these two domain-specific components (PC_1, PC_2), a single item was used to assesses the third perceived control component (PC_3). Using the vernacular language, participants were simply asked to rate how they generally felt regarding their level of control in life (1 = <italic>almost totally out of control</italic>, 10 = <italic>totally in control</italic>). As in our past research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167212444758">Chipperfield &amp; Greenslade, 1999</xref>), we designed this item to intentionally avoid explicit reference to a particular domain or any implication about influence or the lack thereof. Thus, it provides a global indicator of one’s psychological state that does not attempt to specify the source of the psychological state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0146167212444758">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the three previously described components are uniquely different, they do share common variance. This is suggested by their intercorrelations: <italic>r</italic><sub>PC_1, PC_2</sub> = .27; <italic>r</italic><sub>PC_1, P_C3</sub> = .66; <italic>r</italic><sub>PC_2, PC_3</sub> = .34; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. When combined into a composite that was required for the subsequent analysis of mortality, the alpha was .92</p>

<title>Self-rated health (2006)</title>
<p>A subjective and global measure of self-rated health was assessed 3 years after the 2003 interview. This seemingly simple subjective health rating has been employed in hundreds of studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167212444758">Pinquart’s 2001</xref> meta-analysis) and has attained a preeminent status because it predicts mortality above and beyond objective health assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167212444758">Mossey &amp; Shapiro, 1982</xref>). Participants were simply asked to rate their general health for their age (1 = <italic>excellent</italic>, 2 = <italic>good</italic>, 3 = <italic>fair</italic>, 4 = <italic>poor</italic>, 5 = <italic>bad</italic>). Because few participants rated their health as “bad,” scores of 4 and 5 were collapsed before reverse coding so that higher scores reflected better health. An identical rating from 2001 was available as a measure of baseline self-rated health (<italic>M</italic> = 2.59, <italic>SD</italic> = .67) for use as a covariate in the analyses described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0146167212444758">
<title>Hospital admissions (2004-2005)</title>
<p>Counts of hospital admissions were derived from the MHR, an independent provincial registry maintained by the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy. The MHR documents each patient’s contact with the health care system for all residents covered under the universal health-insurance system. Physicians are motivated to accurately report contacts because this is the basis on which payment for services is rendered.</p>
<p>For our purposes, we obtained a count of hospital admissions occurring inclusively over 2 years (2004-2005) following the baseline interview (2003). Eight individuals who had died or moved into a personal-care home during this period were eliminated from the subsequent analysis. One or more admissions were documented for 38.8% (87/224) of participants during the follow-up (range = 0-6). Hospital admissions as determined during the year prior to the baseline interview were used as a covariate in the subsequent analyses. During this prebaseline period, 28.6% of the individuals had one or more hospital admissions (<italic>M</italic> =.46, <italic>SD</italic> = .93).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0146167212444758">
<title>Mortality (2008)</title>
<p>Mortality was determined from data in the provincial MHR and from obituary searches of the provincial newspaper that confirmed participants’ names, gender, and date of birth. From this, we created a mortality variable (0 = <italic>alive</italic>, 1 = <italic>deceased</italic>). In total, 28.6% (64/224) of the participants had passed away between 2003 and follow-up in 2008.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0146167212444758">
<title>Positive emotions (2003)</title>
<p>Positive emotions were assessed by having participants rate how often, in the past 2 days, they felt proud, happy, content, relieved, grateful, and hopeful (0 = <italic>never</italic>, 6 = <italic>almost always</italic>). As described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212444758">Chipperfield et al., 2003</xref>), a mean positive emotion score was calculated to assess each participants’ emotional well-being (α = .80).</p>

<title>SEM specification and fit</title>
<p>Included in the SEM models were baseline demographics (age, gender, education) and health status (self-rated health or hospital admissions) as exogenous (independent) variables, along with SC Folk Beliefs (2003). For theoretical and empirical reasons, the estimated coefficients were specified between the exogenous variables because, for example, gender could relate to both age and education in this population of older adults. Sense of Control (latent variable) as assessed in 2003 was included as a potential mediator of the relationship between SC Folk Beliefs and the endogenous variables of self-rated health and hospital admissions. Values were imputed in the very few cases where they were missing.</p>
<p>The model fit was assessed for each SEM model using the maximum likelihood method and three goodness of fit indexes: chi-square (χ<sup>2</sup>), comparative fit index (CFI), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167212444758">Bentler, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167212444758">Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1993</xref>). The CFI value that can range from 0 (<italic>poor fit</italic>) to 1.0 (<italic>perfect fit</italic>) compares the fit of the proposed model to a null model that assumes independence between all the variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167212444758">Byrne, 2001</xref>). Using criteria outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167212444758">Hu and Bentler (1999)</xref>, a CFI value of ≥.95 was interpreted as representing a well-fitting model, and a value of ≥.90 was interpreted as acceptable. The RMSEA index was used to assess the discrepancy between the proposed model and a hypothetical population covariance matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167212444758">Byrne, 2001</xref>), with a value of &lt;.06 being interpreted as reflecting a good fit and a value between .06 and .08 as a reasonable fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167212444758">Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1993</xref>). Based on these criteria, both SEM models were judged to have reasonable to good fit: χ<sup>2</sup> = 16.56, <italic>df</italic> = 12, <italic>p</italic> = .17, CFI = .97, RMSEA = .06 for <italic>self-rated health</italic>; χ<sup>2</sup> = 17.10, <italic>df</italic> = 12, <italic>p</italic> = .15, CFI = .98, RMSEA = .04 for <italic>hospital admissions</italic>).</p>

<p>Beginning with the SEM model for self-rated health (<italic>n</italic> = 121), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0146167212444758">Figure 1a</xref> shows support for the three hypotheses: SC Folk Beliefs predicted the latent Sense of Control (β = .35, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; Hypothesis 1), Sense of Control positively predicted self-rated health (β = .22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; Hypothesis 2), and mediation (Hypothesis 3) was confirmed using the <italic>bootstrap method</italic>.</p>
<p>The bootstrap method is preferred over the causal steps approach that MacKinnon and colleagues argue is overly stringent in its requirement of a significant correlation between the independent (SC Folk Beliefs) and the dependent (self-rated health) variables. Instead, using the unstandardized mean beta weights and associated standard errors as derived from 1,000 bootstrap samples, the bootstrap method calculates confidence intervals (CIs) for indirect effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167212444758">MacKinnon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167212444758">Mallinckrodt, Abraham, Wei, &amp; Russell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167212444758">Shrout &amp; Bolger, 2002</xref>), and significant mediation is confirmed when zero falls outside of the calculated CI. Our calculated 95% CI [.01 to .25] provided support for mediation, showing that SC Folk Beliefs related indirectly to self-rated health. This suggests that these SC beliefs are adaptive in fostering a psychological sense of control that in turn has positive health consequences.</p>

<title>SC Beliefs and Sense of Control Predicting Mortality</title>
<p>The analysis of mortality (<italic>n</italic> = 224) involved (a) ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regression (Hypothesis 1), (b) logistic regression (Hypothesis 2), and (c) the PRODCLIN program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167212444758">MacKinnon, Fairchild, &amp; Fritz, 2007</xref>) to test mediation (Hypothesis 3).

<p>The standardized coefficients (β) illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0146167212444758">Figure 1c</xref><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0146167212444758">4</xref></sup> confirm Hypothesis 1: SC Folk Beliefs significantly predicted Sense of Control (β = .32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), when controlling for baseline age, gender, education, and health status (prior hospital admissions). As predicted, Sense of Control also inversely related to mortality (Hypothesis 2; β = −.16, Wald = 4.80, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, OR = .78). Finally, Hypothesis 3 was supported (CI = [−.31 to −.02]), suggesting that SC Folk Beliefs foster a sense of control that in turn reduces the probability of mortality.</p>

<title>Effects of Baseline Variables</title>
<p>Several observations regarding the baseline variables 2001-2002 are notable in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0146167212444758">Table 2</xref> that presents the standardized coefficients (β) emerging in the previously outlined SEM and regression models. Education predicted sense of control in each analysis: self-rated health, hospital admissions, and mortality. Gender (being male) predicted the sense of control in the analysis of hospital admissions and mortality. Few baseline variables significantly predicted the outcomes (right column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0146167212444758">Table 2</xref>). Unsurprisingly however, gender (being male) and age predicted mortality.</p>
<p>It is instructive to examine the magnitude of the β effects for baseline variables. Notably, in the logistic regression analysis, the magnitude of the Sense of Control effect on mortality (β = −.16 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0146167212444758">Figure 1c</xref>) was similar to those shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0146167212444758">Table 2</xref> for other established demographic risk factors of age (β = .18) and gender (β = −.17).

<title>Function of SC beliefs</title>
<p>A supplemental SEM analysis was conducted to consider whether the function of SC is <italic>more</italic> about promoting positive emotions than about fostering a sense of control. This would lead to the expectation that SC Folk Beliefs should have a stronger effect on positive emotions than on Sense of Control. We tested a SEM model that included baseline background variables (age, gender, education) and SC Folk Beliefs as exogeneous variables to consider their relative predictive roles on the endogenous variables of Positive Emotions and Sense of Control. In this model that had adequate fit (χ<sup>2</sup> = 21.77, <italic>df</italic> = 11, <italic>p</italic> = .03; CFI = .95; RMSEA = .07), SC Folk Beliefs predicted both Positive Emotions (β = .37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and Sense of Control (β = .42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>This supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167212444758">Morling and Evered’s (2006)</xref> contention that SC processes promote affective well-being. However, if SC is <italic>more</italic> about promoting affective well-being than the psychological sense of control, the magnitude of the SC effect on positive emotions should have been larger (not relatively smaller) than its effect on a sense of control. In short, more research is needed to understand the motive(s) and/or functions of SC because they might extend beyond the sense of control to other states such as coherence, relatedness, or serenity as suggested by Morling and Evered.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study provides insights into the antecedents and consequences of a broad overarching sense of control. The findings inform a debate about the instrumental value of SC by suggesting that SC processes promote a sense of control that then fosters health and survival. They also underscore the long-term implications of a sense of control, not only for the well-being of older adults themselves, but also for the costs of the health care system and for the design of future interventions. These implications are discussed following a brief comment on the viability of our Sense of Control concept and measure that hinges on the plausibility individuals can report a psychological state of control in situations where influence is perceived to be unattainable.</p>
<p>Both our current and prior studies suggest that older adults can easily report this psychological state and that our measure has good psychometric properties, including internal, predictive, and construct validity. This reinforces the value of expanding the sense of control construct so that it includes this state that might have before been regarded as counterintuitive. Our supplemental analyses demonstrated the <italic>added value</italic> of such an overarching sense of control by showing that it was a better predictor of the outcomes than was the single more traditional perceived control component (PC_1). Not only is the broader sense of control concept viable, but it might also be instrumental for aging well and for explaining how older adults can avoid the detrimental feeling of being out of control, even when outcomes are viewed as unattainable.</p>
<sec id="section27-0146167212444758">
<title>SC Beliefs and a Sense of Control (Hypothesis 1)</title>
<p>To better understand how a psychological sense of control evolves, we examined SC belief systems as embedded in common folk wisdom. Consistent with the premise in the Two-Process Model of Control, SC Folk Beliefs were shown to predict a sense of control, perhaps suggesting an adaptive and protective role of SC beliefs in warding off helplessness and despair that can arise when facing life challenges. It is unlikely that the relationship we identified between SC Folk Beliefs and a Sense of Control was due to overlap in conceptualization and/or measurement, given the differences between the two.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0146167212444758">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>By empirically demonstrating support for a linkage between SC beliefs and an overall sense of control, this finding informs a larger conceptual and theoretical debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167212444758">Morling &amp; Evered, 2007</xref>) in which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0146167212444758">Skinner (2007)</xref> recommends replacing the SC label with <italic>accommodation</italic> so that it is “liberated from the domain of control” (p. 911). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167212444758">Morling and Evered (2007)</xref> agree that accommodation is central to SC, but they caution against divorcing SC from notions of control, speculating that this would “separate conceptual partners that still have much in common in practice, in literature, and in spirit” (pp. 918-919). Although, as they point out, SC might now be “poised to continue life under a new name,” our findings lead to the conclusion that it would be premature to abandon the SC label that was introduced over 25 years ago. Rather, we encourage more research to assess the reliability of a linkage between SC ways of thinking and an overarching psychological sense of control.</p>
<p>Our finding is not necessarily incompatible with the Life Span Theory of Control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167212444758">Heckhausen &amp; Schulz, 1995</xref>) that regards the function of SC, <italic>not</italic> as a catalyst for the psychological sense of control, but as a strategic motivator for continued control striving. It is conceivable that SC functions <italic>both</italic> to foster the motivation for control striving and to promote a sense of control. This would position the Life Span Theory of Control and the Two-Process Model as complementary rather than in opposition to one another.

<title>Consequences of Sense of Control for Health and Longevity (Hypothesis 2)</title>
<p>The present findings showed a sense of control predicted people’s perceptions of their health, hospital admissions, and even longevity. This corroborates past results that imply the traditional notion of perceived control has positive and robust consequences for outcomes such as functional independence, health care utilization, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167212444758">Anstey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167212444758">Bosma, Schrijvers, &amp; Mackenbach, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167212444758">Chipperfield, Campbell, &amp; Perry, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167212444758">Krause &amp; Shaw, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212444758">Menec, Chipperfield, &amp; Perry, 1999</xref>). However, the findings in our present study extend past research by suggesting that there are health consequences from a sense of control that is broadly defined to capture the psychological state existing when influence <italic>is</italic> and <italic>is not</italic> perceived to be possible.</p>
<p>Although an artificial self-report measurement bias could explain the linkage between a sense of control and self-rated health in our study, this possible criticism is offset by the time lag of 3 years between the measures. Moreover, this criticism cannot be levied against the findings that a sense of control related to the objectively assessed outcomes, hospital admissions, and mortality. This gives us confidence that the phenomenon we are reporting is a real one wherein a sense of control appears to help people stay well, avoid the need for health care, and survive into advanced old age.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the sense of control effect that emerged in the present study can be illustrated in several ways. First, the likelihood of dying within 5 years was shown to be over twice as high among those who experienced a weaker (vs. stronger) psychological sense of control (36% vs. 15%). Second, the sense of control effect was as strong as were those for age and gender that are commonly accepted demographic risk factors for mortality. Third, as previously mentioned, we demonstrated that the overall sense of control measure had <italic>added value</italic> over a traditional perceived control measure (PC_1) in predicting the health outcomes. That both measures predicted the health outcomes, however, suggests that they operate in similar ways and provides a benchmark to past research showing salutary effects of the traditional sense of control (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167212444758">Chipperfield et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167212444758">Chipperfield &amp; Greenslade, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Sense of Control as a Mediator of the SC–Health Link (Hypothesis 3)</title>
<p>Support for our meditational hypothesis emerged consistently across disparate subjective and objective measures of health and survival. Even after statistically adjusting for baseline background variables known to predict health and mortality (education, age, gender, and prior health status), sense of control mediated the role of SC Folk Beliefs in predicting health and survival. Thus, the sense of control offers a possible explanatory mechanism to account for the positive benefits of SC beliefs on health and well-being that have been demonstrated in a small body of literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167212444758">McQuillen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212444758">Newall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0146167212444758">Thompson et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section30-0146167212444758">
<title>Implications of sense of control as a meditator</title>
<p>These meditational findings also have financial implications as suggested by our crude estimates of hospital costs for individuals differing in their SC Folk Beliefs and sense of control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0146167212444758">6</xref></sup> We found that the average estimated hospital cost was more than double for individuals identified as being <italic>low</italic> on both SC Folk Beliefs and sense of control relative to those individuals <italic>high</italic> on both SC Folk Beliefs and sense of control (Canadian $5,013.08 vs. $2,130.56). This highlights the potential financial implications of these psychological constructs with respect to the burgeoning health care costs.</p>
<p>Our findings also have intervention implications if, unlike other predefined factors (e.g., age and gender), SC beliefs and the sense of control are potentially modifiable. Drawing on control-enhancing treatment interventions designed for use with young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167212444758">Haynes, Perry, Stupnisky, &amp; Daniels, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167212444758">Perry, Hall, &amp; Ruthig, 2005</xref>), older adults could be encouraged to reinterpret unattainable outcomes. For example, they could be encouraged to focus on finding benefit in the situation (adjustment) and on judging the situation as needing no change (acceptance). In light of our findings that even a small change in sense of control (i.e., 1 unit increase) was associated with a 22% reduction in the odds of death, such interventions may even have implications for longevity. Given that many predetermined factors (e.g., age, gender) predict mortality, there is promise in focusing on how to modify belief systems and the psychological sense of control through intervention.</p>
<p>Attempts to intervene, however, must recognize that the effectiveness might vary at different points in the life span. This is especially so if adaptive ways of thinking are more easily embraced by older adults and/or if younger adults, who are less familiar with uncontrollable outcomes, do not easily experience an unconventional sense of control. Likewise, the effectiveness of interventions may be culture specific if adaptive SC ways of thinking are more easily embraced by individuals from interdependent/collectivist cultures that encourage the yielding to others and the sublimation of personal goals for the good of the larger society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167212444758">Morling &amp; Evered, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Boundary Conditions in Measuring SC and Sense of Control</title>
<p>Boundaries imposed by culture must also be considered when developing measures of SC Folk Beliefs and sense of control. Folklore is unique to a particular culture, and the folk beliefs in our study are ingrained in the nuanced language of North American culture. Thus, the folk belief items we have used might not translate in a meaningful way for use in another culture. Attention to the roles of culture and age are also necessary when designing sense of control measures. As previously implied, it might be easiest to assess this broad sense of control in older adults who have had experience with unachievable outcomes. However, as the process of aging is not universal but rather is culturally shaped, even the oldest adults might have difficulty reporting this sense of control if their culture highly values autonomy and mastery of the environment.</p>

<sec id="section32-0146167212444758">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our findings suggest SC beliefs promote a psychological sense of control (as broadly defined) that in turn fosters health and longevity in later life. This finding emerged in a representative sample of community-dwelling older Canadians. Thus, it should generalize to the broader population of older adults in their eighth or ninth decade of life.</p>
<p>Our study helps to explain the control paradox wherein older adults retain a psychological sense of control even when they face a barrage of objectively uncontrollable events. If one can no longer directly influence outcomes, adaptive SC thinking might foster a psychological sense of control. Thus, it is not paradoxical, but rather, it is imminently reasonable that adaptive thinking can help to maintain a psychological state of control even when facing failure. In Charles Darwin’s (paraphrased) words, “It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but rather the ones most adaptable to change.” Adapting to change in late life might be the secret to longevity and the hallmark of successful aging.</p>

<p>The concept of SC Folk Beliefs (a way of thinking) differs from Sense of Control (a psychological state), and the measures are distinct both in their content and response format.

In contrast, the Sense of Control items required participants to explicitly rate the quantity of their control (1 = <italic>almost totally out of control</italic>, 10 = <italic>totally in control</italic>). Thus, the relationship we identified between SC Folk Beliefs and the Sense of Control is likely not due to conceptual and measurement overlap.</p>

<p>Four steps were taken to derive our estimated cost of hospitalization. <italic>Step 1</italic> involved calculating an <italic>estimate</italic> of the annual costs of hospitalizations for older adults in Manitoba that we determined based on the top six reasons for hospitalizations among people (age 70+) as outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167212444758">Finlayson, Reimer, Dahl, Stargardter, and McGowan (2009)</xref>. The mean cost (in Canadian dollars) across these six reasons ($6,266.35) provided our estimate of the average cost of a hospital admission for participants in our study. A notable limitation is our assumption that our study participants were hospitalized for these same reasons as outlined by Finlayson et al. However, we have no reason to expect that the reasons for hospitalizations in our sample would deviate from those found in the overall population by Finlayson et al. <italic>Step 2</italic> was to classify our study participants into two comparison groups: Using a median split procedure, we identified those with the highest scores on both SC Folk Beliefs and Sense of Control (<italic>n</italic> = 68) and those with the lowest scores on both (<italic>n</italic> = 66). <italic>Step 3</italic> involved calculating the mean number of hospital admissions for these two comparison groups. As would be expected, the groups differed in their mean number of hospital admissions: a significantly higher number of hospital admissions occurred for those having low scores (vs. high scores) on both SC Folk Beliefs and Sense of Control (<italic>M</italic>s = .34 vs. .80, <italic>F</italic> = 10.54, <italic>df</italic> = 132, <italic>p</italic> = .003). Finally, <italic>Step 4</italic> involved multiplying the estimated mean cost of hospitalizations from Step 1 ($6,266.35) by the mean number of hospital admissions for each comparison group as determined in Step 3: .34 × $6,266.35 for those with low scores on both SC Folk Beliefs and Sense of Control and .80 × $6,266.35 for those with high scores on both.</p>
