<abstract>
<p>This article presents an experimental study of the pulsating period of pool fires in a confined and ventilated compartment. Based on large-scale pool fire experiments, two modes of flame pulsation are identified. The first one is the common mode of flame puffing observed in an open atmosphere, and the second one is a perturbed pulsation mode induced by a hot vitiated environment. A description of these modes and their spectral analysis based on image processing are described. The second new mode differs from the common mode by a lower puffing frequency of the reacting gas phase. The effect of the pool diameter is analysed for the two modes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A confined and ventilated fire compartment is very common in industrial fire scenarios, which have been studied extensively in support of fire safety in the nuclear industry. When addressing fire safety assessment in well-confined enclosures, a key point is the understanding of the interaction between the burning rate and the surrounding environment. While for free atmosphere configurations, fuel burning rates are mostly known, in confined and ventilated fire compartments, fuel burning rates may have a complex dependency on the immediate environment. Indeed, two major effects that contribute to modifying the burning rate are the reduction of oxygen content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734904112462361">1</xref></sup> and the increase of the surrounding gas temperature. This study focuses on changes in the behaviour of the well-known periodic instabilities of buoyant pool fires when the fire is located in a confined and ventilated fire compartment.</p>
<p>In an open atmosphere, the periodic instabilities of pool fire flames are associated with the Rayleigh–Taylor instability due to density stratification in the region where the flow sharply necks just above the fuel surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734904112462361">2</xref></sup> This flow instability involves the formation of toroidal vortex structures, which are convected upstream periodically in the non-reactive plume. The major role of these oscillating motions on air entrainment into the plume and on the radiation field from fires has already been demonstrated in open atmospheres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734904112462361">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734904112462361"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734904112462361">5</xref></sup> Numerous investigations of these instabilities are available in the literature and flickering phenomena have received considerable attention over the last 20 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734904112462361">6</xref>

The non-dimensional numbers introduced to describe these flow instabilities are the Strouhal number (St = f × D/U), which is a dimensionless frequency parameter; the Froude number (Fr = gD/U<sup>2</sup>), which characterizes the ratio of buoyancy to inertia forces and the Richardson number (Ri = (1/Fr)·(ρ - ρ<sub>∞</sub>)/ρ<sub>∞</sub>), which is equal to the ratio of the dimensionless density difference (ρ - ρ<sub>∞</sub>)/ρ<sub>∞</sub> over the Froude number. The instability frequency is inversely proportional to the square root of the source characteristic length (usually the pool diameter). The effects of environmental conditions have been studied far less. Only small-scale experiments to evaluate the effect of increasing oxygen content in the atmosphere on the density difference have been reported for diffusion flames<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734904112462361">14</xref></sup> and a non-reacting helium plume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734904112462361">9</xref></sup> A decrease of the density difference tends to reduce the pulsation frequency. Recently, large-scale pool fire tests performed at Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire (IRSN) in a confined and ventilated compartment have shown specific modes of instabilities similar to the open atmosphere puffing mechanism, but with lower frequency and amplitude.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734904112462361">15</xref></sup> This particular puffing mechanism correlates well with a significant increase of the burning rate. This study aims at thoroughly describing this specific mode of instabilities, scantly reported in the literature; at expanding the theoretical description and at identifying the primary reason why the instabilities are linked to increases of the burning rate.</p>

<title>Fire experiments</title>
<p>The fire tests considered in this article are large-scale pool fire experiments performed in a well-confined and mechanically ventilated enclosure described in detail in Ref. 15 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734904112462361">Figure 1</xref>). The buoyant source is a liquid pool fire consisting of a circular steel pan filled with dodecane fuel type (hydrogenated tetra-propylene (TPH), C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>26</sub>). The pool fire is located at the centre of a 120 m<sup>3</sup> compartment (4 m in height). This room is mechanically ventilated with supply and return vents, both located in the upper part of the compartment. The fuel pan is positioned on a weighing device system that records the fuel mass, from which the mass loss rate (MLR) is derived. Several video cameras are set up inside the room to record the combustion process at a rate of 25 frames per second. In addition, thermocouple trees and a sampling tube connected to on-line gas analysers are located in the fire room to measure the thermal stratification and the vitiated atmosphere, respectively.</p>

The ventilation rate is defined as the ratio between ventilation airflow rates before ignition divided by the compartment volume. In addition, for the LK series (LK1, LK3 and LK4 tests), the vertical walls and the ceiling are thermally insulated with Rockwool panels, whereas for the D series (D1, D2 and D3 tests), only the ceiling is insulated.</p>

<title>Burning rate</title>
<p>Due to the comparatively low level of ventilation compared to the potential heat release rate (HRR), the experimental fires are under-ventilated. A modified global equivalence ratio (GER), defined as the ratio between the effective burning rate times the stoichiometric fuel-to-oxygen ratio (MLR·r) and the initial inflow of oxygen (Q · Ρ<sub>O</sub>Y<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub><sup>O</sup>) ventilation rate, is about 0.4. The value is lower than 1 because the effective burning rate is used in the calculation of the GER instead of the corresponding burning rate expected in open atmosphere for this type of fuel. Fire durations range between 10 and 20 min. The time variations of the burning rate of the fire are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734904112462361">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734904112462361">3</xref> for the D and LK series, respectively. The absolute uncertainty of the MLR is about 0.2 g s<sup>−1</sup>. For the D series, the burning rate increases progressively at the beginning of the combustion phase and then decreases to a level that corresponds to an equilibrium with the rate of oxygen supplied by the ventilation system. The test conditions are ventilation controlled. For the LK series, the behaviour is similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734904112462361">Figure 3</xref>). However, since the enclosure is largely thermally insulated, the steady burning rate is much higher. This series of fire tests demonstrates the influence of the external heat flux on the MLR and the effect of oxygen depletion on the burning rate.</p>

<p>Although the two series show different steady regimes, there is an initial transitory period that is very similar for all tests. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734904112462361">Figure 4(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734904112462361">(b)</xref> shows the burning rate and the oxygen concentration near the pool during this initial transitory period. This period can be split into three specific stages. The first stage, which lasts approximately 100 s, shows the burning rate increasing until a maximum value close to 20 g m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> is reached, followed by a slight decrease. The oxygen concentration near the pool surface is close to open atmosphere conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734904112462361">Figure 4</xref>). This behaviour is similar to that in open atmosphere with 21% oxygen. The second stage begins when the environmental conditions around the pool start to be affected by the vitiated hot upper layer, that is, when the oxygen concentration starts to decrease. This stage shows quasi-steady burning rates of 15 g m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and lasts about 100 s. This behaviour is closely related to smoke filling in the enclosure. Finally, the third stage exhibits a steep increase of the burning rate to approximately 30 g m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. While the first stage is similar to open atmosphere behaviour, the last two stages differ significantly and result from the changing external conditions. It is during the third stage that new flame instabilities are observed that seem to be related to the significant increase of the burning rate. While the decrease of burning rate is expected because of the oxygen depletion near the pool, there is also an unexpected periodic increase of the burning rate resulting in the observed puffing instabilities. The objective of this article is to describe the flame behaviour during this third stage and to discuss the similarities and differences with the well-known puffing instability observed for pool fires in open atmosphere. This very particular behaviour has been scantly reported in the literature. Then, after this unsteady period, very similar in all the tests, a steady regime of combustion is obtained during which the periodical phenomena observed during the unsteady phase vanish.</p>

<title>Flame structure</title>
<p>Image processing can provide detailed information of the flame structure during the three stages. An initial investigation is performed on mean images (average of 100 instantaneous consecutive images during a period of 4 s) computed during the first 5 min after ignition (example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734904112462361">Figure 5</xref> for test LK1). The three rows correspond to the three stages. During the second stage, the flame shape changes and becomes narrower and thinner compared to the first stage. There is no puffing unsteady behaviour and the flame remains turbulent but with less intensity than during the first stage. This behaviour is typical of combustion with low oxygen content. This reduction of the flame dimension is correlated with the reduction of the fuel MLR. During the third stage, flames are observed below the surface of the pool and the flame thickness increases again, especially at the base of the flame. From these images, the flame contour is determined based on a threshold intensity level and the flame dimensions (height and width) are then computed. Characteristic lengths are determined from a surface contour algorithm in IDL<sup>®</sup> software. The height was determined as the length of the flame centreline, and the width was defined as the length of a horizontal line crossing the flame area at a specified height (arbitrarily set at half the pool diameter). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734904112462361">Figure 6</xref> shows the time variation of the normalized flame height and flame width. The quantitative results of the calculations based on mean images are consistent with the qualitative observations discussed in the previous section. The second stage corresponds to a minimum flame width, whereas the last stage shows the largest width. The flame height is the highest at the end of the first stage and then decreases progressively.</p>

<title>Identification of periodic instabilities</title>
<p>When looking closely at the images, the first and the third stages are characterized by two modes of instabilities referred to as A and B, respectively. During the first stage, the ‘mode A’ instability corresponds to the well-known puffing mechanism due to Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities. An example of the sequence is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734904112462361">Figure 7</xref>. Toroidal vortex structures appear at the pool base and lead to the contraction and then expansion of the flame puff that is convected upstream in the plume. The time for vertical convection takes about 0.7 s. A spectral analysis of this phenomenon is performed on time variation of the instantaneous flame dimensions (height, width, area and perimeter) and the individual pixel intensity of each image. An example of the time variation of the flame width and the associated frequency spectrum are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734904112462361">Figure 8</xref>. The main frequency of the flow instabilities is 1.4 Hz (period of 0.7 s). The frequency spectrum analysis was performed on 500 points, corresponding to 20 s of signal with an acquisition frequency of 25 Hz. The frequency resolution therefore is 0.05 Hz (acquisition frequency, 25 Hz, divided by the number of points, 500) and the overall accuracy is estimated at 0.1 Hz (two times the frequency resolution).</p>

</fig>
<p>During the second phase, the flame remains very stable, the frequency spectrum is flat and no specific periodical instabilities were identified. Finally, the third stage is characterized by the appearance of a different type of instabilities referred to as ‘mode B’. First, locally and periodically, small flames appear outside the perimeter of the pool and propagate downwards along the edge of the pan. Later, this phenomenon is amplified and leads to a periodic fluctuation as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0734904112462361">Figure 9</xref>. At the edge of and all around the pan, the flame front moves outward. A fire ring can be observed, which expands radially and horizontally over time. The period of ring growth is about 0.4 s. This ring is then convected upstream by buoyancy forces as for mode A. The period for vertical rise is about 0.8 s. The total duration of the sequence is about 1.2 s. This sequence looks very similar to the puffing mechanisms observed for mode A. However, the difference is in the way the structure is created. For mode A, the structure is created rather rapidly above the pool, whereas for mode B, the structure is created around and below the pool and takes more time due to the horizontal motion of the flame front. The second mode also seems to correspond to Rayleigh–Taylor type instabilities but with a different process of initiation. The total duration of the periodic phenomena is therefore longer for mode B (1.2 s) than for mode A (0.8 s). Consequently, the pulsation frequency is lower for mode A. The difference in frequency is also evident from the spectral analysis of the time variation of the flame width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0734904112462361">Figure 10</xref>). Another difference is the size of the puff. As the time for creating the puff is longer for mode B, the amount of reacting gas and the size of the puff are larger. This could explain why this mode of instability results in a higher MLR. A larger flame area leads to a large amount of radiative feedback on the fuel surface and consequently a higher burning rate. In addition, the process of puff creation around the pan and not above contributes to favouring the amount of thermal radiation emitted by the flame towards the fuel surface.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The previous analysis of fire test results identifies two modes of instabilities for two pool diameters. For each test series and for the two modes, a mean frequency is computed and given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734904112462361">Table 1</xref>. First, the dependency between frequency and pool fire diameter is analysed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0734904112462361">Figure 13</xref>. For mode A, the experimental data are in satisfactory agreement with the diameter dependency f D<sup>−0.5</sup> proposed in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734904112462361">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734904112462361">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734904112462361">13</xref></sup> This comparison tends to confirm that mode A corresponds to the usual puffing phenomena of buoyant plumes in an open atmosphere. For mode B, as expected, the frequency is lower than for mode A for the same diameter, and the data are not consistent with the literature correlations. However, as for mode A and although only two pool diameters are considered, the frequency of mode B seems also to depend on the pool diameter with the same exponent (−0.5).</p>

</fig>
<p>The lower amplitude for mode B can possibly be explained by considering the effect of the variation of the outside air density ρ<sub>∞</sub> (and therefore the density difference Δρ = ρ − ρ<sub>∞</sub>, where ρ is the maximum density inside the buoyant plume). As mentioned by Cetegen and Dong,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734904112462361">16</xref></sup> the relations f D<sup>−0.5</sup> have been established for buoyant sources in an open atmosphere. As a change of the outside density affects the buoyancy force, it should also affect the pulsation frequency. As the density difference decreases, the buoyancy force decreases and the frequency increases: it takes a longer time for the ‘puff’ to be convected upstream. The influence of the density difference is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0734904112462361">Figure 14</xref> by plotting the normalized frequency f(D/g)<sup>0.5</sup> = St·Fr<sup>0.5</sup> versus the density difference normalized by the density of air at ambient temperature as proposed by Cetegen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734904112462361">16</xref></sup> For the present experiments, the gas densities are deduced from the measured gas temperature outside and inside the plume considering the perfect gas law. The temperature of the buoyant source is the maximum gas temperature along the vertical axis and the corresponding outside temperature is measured at the same height. The maximum density difference is obtained at about 0.5 m above the fuel surface, and the corresponding values are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734904112462361">Table 1</xref>. The density difference varies from 0.75 for test series D (first phase of the combustion mode) to 0.35 for test series LK (third phase of the combustion mode). For the two test series, the decrease of the density difference and frequency are correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0734904112462361">Figure 14</xref>) and a slope similar to that obtained by Cetegen is found.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734904112462361">16</xref></sup> However, considering each mode separately, a change of the density difference does not seem to affect the normalized frequency. For instance, for mode B, the normalized density difference varies significantly, whereas the normalized frequency remains nearly constant. A similar behaviour, but less pronounced, is observed for mode A. Consequently, the difference of the frequency between mode A and mode B cannot be explained solely by the progressive decrease of the density difference and other mechanisms must be involved.</p>

</fig>
<p>A second possible explanation is a negative density difference near the pool surface due to the high molecular weight of the fuel vapours (ρ<sub>TPH</sub> = 4.1 kg m<sup>−3</sup> at T = 220°C). As described previously, a mode B period involves a horizontal displacement of the flame front outside the pool as if the flame is spilling over the rim of the pan. The density difference Δρ = ρ − ρ<sub>∞</sub> between the gaseous fuel and the hot environment may be negative along a short but sufficient distance to reduce the vertical buoyancy force and cause the radial movement of the fuel vapours. Another fact that can promote this new pulsation mechanism is the impact of the vitiated upper layer with low level of oxygen concentration (17%vol–19%vol) near the pool surface that affects the combustion process. However, these two explanations cannot be validated with the limited number of large-scale experiments that were conducted, but need to be confirmed with a more detailed experimental and analytical approach.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Based on large-scale pool fire experiments in a confined and ventilated enclosure, a very particular pulsation mode of buoyant diffusion flames was observed. This mode is compared to the typical mode of puffing observed for fire and helium plumes in an open atmosphere reported by many authors. The new pulsation mode differs from the common mode as it has a longer period to generate the puff of reacting gas and larger reactive vortex structures. The latter are produced at the base of the pool by radial horizontal movement of the flame front. It is shown that the pulsation frequency decreases linearly with the square root of the pool diameter, as expected in an open atmosphere. However, for the same diameter, the pulsation frequency of the new mode is significantly lower than that of the common mode. The fact that the reduction of the density difference between the flame and the ambient environment weakens the buoyancy force and increases the period of vortex pulsations is explored as a possible cause. However, the analysis shows that this effect is not sufficient to explain the change of frequency and other effects need to be considered. The analysis explores two other possible effects: the high fuel vapour density and the oxygen depletion near the pool. Although this new pulsating mode of the combustion is relatively short in duration (only several minutes) compared to the total duration of the fire, it should not be considered as a minor phenomenon. This flame behaviour leads to a significant increase of the fire HRR and therefore can modify the subsequent steps of the fire scenario; for instance, extinction if a large amount of oxygen in the compartment has been consumed during this pulsating mode of combustion. In addition, this phenomenon can be a very challenging mechanism for the validation of a turbulent combustion model in numerical fire simulations.</p>
