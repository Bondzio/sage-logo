<abstract>
<p>This monograph examines television reporters’ perceptions of how sources both within and outside the media attempt to influence news content and coverage decisions and to what degree they are successful. Using structural equation modeling and original data from a national web survey of television reporters, this research explores how market size, extramedia, organizational, and within-media forces influence television news content from a comprehensive perspective. The study also attempts to advance theory with the development and expansion of agenda cutting, and by updating the literature for agenda building and frame building as well as the social control of the newsroom.</p>

<p>Americans spend more time using media than any other waking activity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1522637912444106">1</xref></sup> Data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Statistical Abstract indicate that, in 2012, Americans are expected to spend almost 1,600 hours watching television, which averages to more than four hours a day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1522637912444106">2</xref></sup> Television is also the most popular medium for obtaining the news of the day. A Pew Research Center Poll released in 2010 revealed that an average of 76 percent of adults reported watching local or broadcast news “sometimes” or “regularly.” The figure for cable news was only slightly lower with 70 percent, while network news acquired less interest with 55 percent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1522637912444106">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>With audiences devoting so much of their attention to television news, it is important to examine what is being aired on these broadcasts. Perhaps more significant, however, is how these news topics and stories came to be chosen, or not chosen, in the first place. What forces, both internal and external, were involved in the news-decision process? Did owners or top-level executives suggest a particular story to cover or emphasize? Did newsroom management influence a reporter’s decision of <italic>if</italic> and <italic>how</italic> he or she would cover that event? Or did advertisers exert pressure on the news organization to avoid covering a particular story because the coverage could be harmful to its company’s image or profits? All are important questions that should be asked regarding news coverage.</p>
<p>Ample evidence of attempts and successes of influencing the media abound, especially in the area of advertising. For instance, Camel cigarettes sponsored the “Camel News Caravan” on NBC in the 1950s (Weblink 1).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1522637912444106">4</xref></sup> As a part of the agreement, NBC was not permitted to film any newscasts with shots of cigars or where a “No Smoking” sign was visible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1522637912444106">5</xref></sup> According to former NBC News President Reuven Frank in his book <italic>Out of Thin Air</italic>, “What Camel wanted Camel got.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1522637912444106">6</xref></sup> Decades later, <italic>Mother Jones</italic>, a liberal magazine, published articles that linked cigarette smoking and cancer, although the staff thought it might lead to repercussions from their tobacco advertisers. Their concerns were well founded, as the companies pulled their ads from the magazine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1522637912444106">7</xref></sup> <italic>Ms.</italic> magazine suffered similar consequences from Clairol after publishing a report on congressional hearings concerning hair dyes and their chemicals being absorbed through the skin, which may be carcinogenic. The company eventually changed its formulas but also pulled ads from the publication as a result of the reports.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1522637912444106">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other anecdotal evidence illuminates possible cases of ownership influence as well. NBC’s <italic>Saturday Night Live</italic> ran a cartoon skit that criticized media ownership concentration and its effects on news content—including stories about General Electric (GE), the network’s parent company (Weblink 2). When NBC reran the episode months later, the cartoon segment was cut, reportedly because it lacked comedic value.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1522637912444106">9</xref></sup> According to an editorial in <italic>The Nation</italic>, however, a source from the network reported that both NBC’s president and GE executives were displeased with the material.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1522637912444106">10</xref></sup> Those writing and producing entertainment pieces may not be the only group under pressure from owners and top executives, as news workers may be feeling the heat as well. A 2000 survey conducted by Pew Research Center and <italic>Columbia Journalism Review</italic> (CJR) found that 51 percent of local journalists felt that corporate owners influence news organizations’ decisions about which stories to cover or emphasize “a great deal” or “a fair amount.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1522637912444106">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>While many empirical studies have centered on how media content may affect audiences, fewer have taken a step back to consider who or what is influencing the media’s decisions. Some researchers have pointed out that more knowledge is needed on how and by whom the media agenda is set.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1522637912444106">12</xref></sup> Others have called for more evidence to increase our understanding of how and through what forces media frames are constructed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1522637912444106">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, few researchers have delved into the area of how and why certain news items are simply kept off, or cut out of, the media agenda.</p>
<p>Thus, the purpose of this monograph is to examine through what forces and under what conditions the media are most likely to be influenced and to what effect on news content. That is, how and under what conditions do external and internal forces attempt to influence the media and their coverage, and to what effect are they successful at doing so?</p>
<p>Specifically, this research measures the potential outcomes of attempts at influencing coverage decisions and news content. Using aspects from Shoemaker and Reese’s hierarchical model of influences,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1522637912444106">14</xref></sup> along with research and examples from agenda-building and framing literature, a comprehensive model of media influences and outcomes is tested using a survey of TV reporters and structural equation modeling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1522637912444106">Figure 1</xref> for the basic theoretical model).</p>

<p>This study’s overall goal is to examine extramedia, organizational, and within-media forces that may influence news media content. As indicated in the Influences on Media Content (IOMC) model, this monograph proposes that extramedia (e.g., advertiser, public relations, and political pressures) and organizational (e.g., economic, owner/executive, and staff size pressures) influences on content decision effects/outcomes are mediated through within-media organization influences, such as direct and indirect management pressures. Specifically, the study evaluated extramedia and organizational influences with (1) each other, as indicated by the double-headed arrows; (2) within-media influences; and (3) influences/effects on content, such as levels of agenda building, frame building, and agenda cutting, as mediated through within-media influences.</p>
<sec id="section1-1522637912444106">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Shoemaker and Reese have pointed out that media content can be influenced on various levels. Researchers before them investigated the notion of gatekeeping and, within the realm of media studies, noted that gatekeepers exist at each level, allowing certain news items to pass through to the next stage toward broadcast or publication while others are filtered out of consideration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1522637912444106">15</xref></sup> With these studies of gatekeeping and the “control” of news flow in mind, Shoemaker and Reese developed the hierarchical model of influences. They argue that media choice of the presentation of news items operate on different levels, ranging from macro to micro, to influence the content that is eventually received by the audience. The levels of influence are ideological, extramedia, organizational, media routines, and individual.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1522637912444106">16</xref></sup> The current monograph and proposed model draw from particular levels of Shoemaker and Reese’s study, along with aspects from agenda building, framing, and agenda cutting. Only those influence levels and potential effects on content assessed in the current study are addressed in the review of literature that follows in order to provide justification for the specific goals of this project. The pressure sources included in this study are extramedia, organizational, and within-media influences. Although the “within-media” stage of influence is not explicitly outlined in Shoemaker and Reese’s hierarchical model, this construct draws upon ideas from the “media routines” level but offers more personalized newsroom information. The potential influences/outcomes on content are levels of agenda building, frame building, and agenda cutting. The following sections explain each of the influence levels and the possible effects on news media content.</p>
<sec id="section2-1522637912444106">
<title>Extramedia Influences</title>
<p>Potential extramedia levels of influence include advertisers, public relations efforts, government and political, and interest groups. Studies have relied on this level of analysis in an attempt to get to the first step in the gatekeeping and agenda-building processes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1522637912444106">17</xref></sup> Berkowitz argued that the relationship between journalists and news sources should be examined in addition to the practice of newsgathering when considering the agenda-building process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1522637912444106">18</xref></sup> The term “sources” not only refers to individuals associated with an event or issue, but may also include organization-based information. Gandy referred to these latter sources as “information subsidies” and stressed their importance in the agenda-building process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1522637912444106">19</xref></sup> To further examine extramedia influences, three specific sources of pressure are considered: advertiser, public relations, and political/government.</p>
<sec id="section3-1522637912444106">
<title>Advertiser Pressures</title>
<p>A number of examples concerning advertiser influences on the media have emerged over the years. A 1992 study found that more than 89 percent of the 150 newspaper editors surveyed said “advertisers had pulled ads or tried to influence stories,” with most of the pressure appearing to come from automobile dealers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1522637912444106">20</xref></sup> One year before, an <italic>American Journalism Review</italic> (AJR) article reported that angry auto dealers pulled television ads after the station aired stories concerning dangerous vehicles, an unhappy customer, and tips on saving money when buying a new car.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1522637912444106">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Advertisers may sometimes assume that they have special access to the news<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1522637912444106">22</xref></sup> or may lay out guidelines of what type of content that is to be run (or not run) in the same issue/segment of their advertisements<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1522637912444106">23</xref></sup> because they know the media are dependent upon them for revenues. Several examples have surfaced in the magazine industry. Gloria Steinem, editor of <italic>Ms.</italic> magazine, has said that Proctor &amp; Gamble, for example, insisted that its products’ advertisements should not run in “any issue that included any material on gun control, abortion, the occult, cults, or the disparagement of religion. Caution was also demanded in any issue covering sex or drugs, even for educational purposes.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1522637912444106">24</xref></sup> The Chrysler Corporation, according to Croteau and Hoynes, required magazines to provide a summary of the topics and articles of upcoming issues, and the company was to be notified in advance if an issue might cover any topics that could be taken as offensive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1522637912444106">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Media critics, such as Ben Bagdikian and Robert McChesney, argue that audiences are gathered not to be informed, but to be sold to advertisers. Therefore, Bagdikian contends, a few large corporations win while the public loses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1522637912444106">26</xref></sup> Baker also noted that news managers are faced with trying to satisfy several publics, including viewers, stockholders, and advertisers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1522637912444106">27</xref></sup> He contends that ultimately the favor typically goes to the public that (1) is the larger purchaser, (2) with the most knowledge as to how the media can serve its needs, and (3) the most sensitive to how the media can affects its interests. In other words, the influence tends to go to the advertiser—not the audience. As Altschull put it, “The press is the piper, and the tune the piper plays is composed by those who pay the piper.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1522637912444106">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to Croteau and Hoynes, advertisers have “substantial influence over what is and is not emphasized in the media,” but traditionally, this influence is “fairly subtle and indirect.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1522637912444106">29</xref></sup> The authors give examples of how the media alert entities, such as airlines and oil companies, if the news content could potentially present them in an unfavorable light. For instance, if there is an oil-spill story or an airplane crash, the companies may be offered the chance to reschedule ads.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1522637912444106">30</xref></sup> Pressure from advertisers may also be more direct, especially in recent years.</p>
<p>Research in the newspaper and magazine industries has also found evidence of advertiser influences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1522637912444106">31</xref></sup> For example, Hays and Reisner’s study of farm magazine writers found that 62 percent of those surveyed reported “receiving threats to withdraw advertising from advertisers displeased by editorial copy,” while 48 percent said that advertisers had actually withdrawn advertising from their publications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1522637912444106">32</xref></sup> Moreover, 65 percent claimed to have received phone calls from advertising and public relations representatives “pushing products or copy” and reported that they deemed such pressures as effective.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1522637912444106">33</xref></sup> Although the study is limited because it deals with niche publications from a controlled sample of American Agricultural Editors Association (AAEA) members, it still has merit because studies involving more generalist media have produced similar findings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1522637912444106">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to Shoemaker and Reese, broadcast media are more vulnerable to advertiser pressures than print media because they are more sensitive to profit needs and rely on advertising sources for revenue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1522637912444106">35</xref></sup> A study by the Project for Excellence in Journalism surveyed local television news directors and found that more than 30 percent reported “being pressured to kill negative stories or do positive ones about advertisers.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1522637912444106">36</xref></sup> Similarly, Just, Levine, and Regan found that 53 percent of the 118 local news directors surveyed alleged the exact same types of pressures and noted that their findings raise a red flag concerning journalistic autonomy in this medium.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1522637912444106">37</xref></sup> This figure reflects an increase from a smaller-scale survey the authors conducted just a year earlier, suggesting the problem may be getting worse. Tuchman made a similar point in 1978 when she asserted that news workers in the television industry occasionally link advertiser preferences to their own news judgments based on organizational directives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1522637912444106">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, a 1999 Pew survey found that more than 30 percent of the staff in local media was concerned with advertiser pressures a “great deal” or a “fair amount.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1522637912444106">39</xref></sup> A 2000 survey, however, showed an increase in concerns about advertisers, as 43 percent of local journalists thought that advertising concerns influenced news organizations’ decisions about what stories to cover or emphasize “a great deal” or “a fair amount.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1522637912444106">40</xref></sup> A 2007 Pew survey found a further increase, with 46 percent of responding journalists claiming advertiser pressures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1522637912444106">41</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1522637912444106">
<title>Public Relations Pressures</title>
<p>Another potential source of outside influence on the media is public relations pressures. One of the main goals of public relations practitioners is to create and maintain a positive image in the eyes of the public over time. To accomplish this goal, those in the field use the media to communicate their messages to the masses. If they are successful in getting their messages placed in the media, “they influence the media agenda, which can in turn influence public opinion and the public agenda.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1522637912444106">42</xref></sup> This process of influencing media choices is known as agenda building. The messages take the form of information subsidies and consist of communication pieces such as press releases, public service announcements (PSAs), broadcast news releases (BNRs), video news releases (VNRs), press conferences, and official proceedings, to name a few.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1522637912444106">43</xref></sup> Practitioners provide information subsidies to the media in an attempt to garner media coverage on behalf of their clients in order to reach their target audiences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1522637912444106">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Information subsidies from public relations practitioners are provided at no cost to the media. Typical news stories produced by news organizations involve expenses, including equipment costs and worker salaries. Thus, media entities facing budget cuts and bottom-line pressures, or simply those with a small number of staff, may be more willing to use these subsidies to fill their news holes at a low cost.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1522637912444106">45</xref></sup> Regardless, news organizations tend to use information subsidies, even if solely for generating story ideas.</p>
<p>Many studies have focused on public relations influences and information subsidy use in print media,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1522637912444106">46</xref></sup> but further evidence suggests that it may be even more prevalent in the television industry because of more severe economic constraints.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1522637912444106">47</xref></sup> In their 1989 study comparing decisions on news releases by television and newspaper gatekeepers, Abbott and Brassfield found that small television stations were more likely to use releases, with a 59 percent acceptance rate, while both small and large newspapers rejected the most (33.5 and 24 percent, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1522637912444106">48</xref></sup> This finding was somewhat surprising since, according to the authors, previous research indicated that newspaper gatekeepers were more likely to accept releases because of larger news holes. A year later, Berkowitz and Adams’s study involving one station found that fewer than 25 percent of the information subsidies were retained. Those that were used at this local station were mainly from nonprofit organizations and interest groups, despite the higher numbers received from government and business sources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1522637912444106">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although studies indicate that subsidies are indeed accepted, albeit at different rates, the literature suggests a strained relationship between public relations practitioners and journalists that may lead some news workers to exhibit reluctance at using pieces provided by these sources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1522637912444106">50</xref></sup> This relationship may be due to journalists’ suspicions of public relations professionals’ practices, as they may view them as simply trying to promote their own agendas by only presenting their client in a positive light while withholding other pertinent information. Strained journalist-practitioner relationships may be attributed, in part, to the controversial use and misuse of VNRs by media organizations. VNRs are typically created and provided by public relations firms, government or corporate agencies, or interest groups with the hopes of garnering media coverage and, thus, influencing the audience. In some instances, stations run them without revealing that the video segments are produced by outside sponsors, agencies, or corporations, which is against the ethical guidelines set forth by the Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1522637912444106">51</xref></sup> Thus, the public may not be able to distinguish between a VNR and a “real” news story put together by a station’s news team. Literature shows that broadcast public relations firms and other sources have been successful at getting their pieces run in the media. In fact, Farsetta and Price found that 77 stations under study aired the VNRs “as is” more than 30 percent of the time, and in 100 percent of the cases, the stations made the pieces appear like it was their own reporting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1522637912444106">52</xref></sup> Thus, the organizations that provided the information, and the clients that they represent, were reasonably successful in influencing the media’s news agenda.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1522637912444106">
<title>Political/Government Pressures</title>
<p>Besides public relations and advertising pressures, political influences on the media may also exist. In addition to the more blatant influence tactics such as campaign advertising, governmental communications specialists may also attempt to influence media content through information sources that Berkowitz has called “informal” channels:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1522637912444106">53</xref></sup> news leaks, off-the-record interviews, and backgrounders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1522637912444106">54</xref></sup> This somewhat hidden type of pressure may help explain the dearth of academic literature covering instances of politicians and government officials attempting to influence news coverage.</p>
<p>Like the public relations materials previously discussed, these sources are considered information subsidies. According to Shoemaker and Reese, these channels “can be used very effectively to set the agenda for the news media—something that U.S. presidents do not fail to attempt.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1522637912444106">55</xref></sup> For example, Ponder’s study of the first presidential press corps found that President William McKinley achieved favorable press coverage by holding press briefings on a regular basis and by providing reporters with advanced copies of his statements and speeches, thus making their work easier by subsidizing the information.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1522637912444106">56</xref></sup> Therefore, the president and the White House were able to build the media’s news agenda by simplifying the newsgathering process. Furthermore, they were more able to “easily win the framing contest”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1522637912444106">57</xref></sup> by making certain that the subsidies provided contained the main messages and frames that they wanted relayed to the public while leaving out and drawing attention away from those that they did not want brought to light.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1522637912444106">58</xref></sup> According to Pan and Kosicki, “framing an issue is more a strategic means to attract more supporters, to mobilize collections, to expand actors’ realm of influences, and to increase their chances of winning.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1522637912444106">59</xref></sup> This “winning” can be thought of as obtaining a desired amount, type, and frame of media coverage or winning either public support or support from others in government. Berkowitz provided further backing for McKinley’s type of strategy. He found that 71 percent of network and 75 percent of local news stories relied upon “routine news channels” such as press conferences, official proceedings, and press releases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1522637912444106">60</xref></sup> Moreover, television news used these types of channels more often than newspapers. Additional literature suggests that other levels of government are also successful at influencing media coverage, namely because journalists tend to rely on official sources and official government opinion for their news stories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1522637912444106">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although it may seem that the media actively seek out official government views, as indicated in the previous cases, the government and politicians seek to influence the press coverage as well. Gandy noted that “at every level of government, in every agency, there are information specialists whose responsibility it is to ensure that the nation’s public media carry the desired message forward.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1522637912444106">62</xref></sup> In many cases, those working for politicians and government officials use prepackaged news such as VNRs and print releases, the same communication tools used by public relations practitioners. In fact, political figures and the specialized departments in government typically have their own public affairs units or information officers to ensure that their messages are relayed to the public via the media. For instance, a <italic>New York Times</italic> article reported that “the Bush administration spent $254 million in its first term on public relations contracts, nearly double what the last Clinton administration spent.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1522637912444106">63</xref></sup> Thus, political figures’ use of prepackaged news can be a more covert process that is not as easily recognizable by the public because of the indirect means by which they deliver their messages. The same <italic>Times</italic> article reported that “at least 20 federal agencies, including the Defense Department and the Census Bureau, have made and distributed hundreds of television news segments” from about 2001 to 2005.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-1522637912444106">64</xref></sup> As found with Farsetta and Price’s study, however, many of these prepackaged news items were broadcast throughout the country without stations acknowledging the government’s production role.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-1522637912444106">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>As with any other successful communication strategy, the government knows to create a specific message and distribute it when it will have the most impact. This was the case when the U.S. government had a VNR created dealing with Medicare. The “interview” with a health and human services secretary was scripted and included a suggested lead-in stating that President Bush had just signed the first prescription drug plan for people using Medicare. Strategically, the report was “distributed in January 2004, not long before Mr. Bush hit the campaign trail and cited the drug benefit as one of his major accomplishments,” according to the <italic>New York Times</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-1522637912444106">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>Instead of simply creating and distributing prepackaged news programs, the U.S. government has also garnered favorable discussion of its policies and issues through other means. In approximately one month’s time in 2005, three syndicated conservative columnists were paid thousands of dollars to promote the Bush administration’s agendas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-1522637912444106">67</xref></sup> Administrations have also reportedly worked their way into primetime programming as far back as the 1980s when Nancy Reagan promoted her “Just Say No” campaign on <italic>Diff’rent Strokes</italic> and <italic>Punky Brewster</italic> (Weblink 3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-1522637912444106">68</xref></sup></p>

<title>Organizational Influences</title>
<p>In addition to external forces, pressures on the media can also come from people and factors at the organizational level. Influences at the organizational level seem to largely depend on the structure, size, staff, and ownership of the media entity. Economic pressures can also derive from this level of influence and often result from increased bottom-line worries. These economic concerns can constrain work in the media organization and may, in turn, influence decisions about content.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-1522637912444106">69</xref></sup> Constraints and pressures at the organizational level are largely communicated by owners and top executives. Thus, economic and owner/executive pressures and their possible effects on content are first discussed, followed by staff size pressures.</p>
<sec id="section7-1522637912444106">
<title>Economic Pressures</title>
<p>Since many media organizations are publicly traded companies, frontline management and journalists are not only accountable to higher executives, but to stockholders as well. In discussing market-driven journalism, McManus noted that media organizations are a part of a “market-based economy,” and they compete in four different markets: investors, advertisers, sources of news, and consumers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-1522637912444106">70</xref></sup> He argued that these investors are the most influential in the production of news because they are a part of the corporate structure while the other three markets—advertisers, consumers, and sources—must exert their influence from outside the corporation. Since the investors, or owners, appear to have the strongest influence in media organizations, according to McManus’s model, news workers may feel economic and bottom-line pressures from them or from top-level executives who are likely relaying the messages. Research suggests that they are indeed noticing the effects of these economic concerns in both the newspaper and television industries.</p>
<p>In the newspaper industry, nonindependent entities are often perceived as forcing profit-driven material or as placing profits and financial expectations above journalistic quality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-1522637912444106">71</xref></sup> At least one study supports the notion that they are only interested in “all the news that makes a profit.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-1522637912444106">72</xref></sup> This view suggests that corporate executives act as a sieve, allowing only profit-driven news items to seep through. That is, they are serving as gatekeepers controlling the flow of information received by the audience with a motive primarily of financial self-interest.</p>
<p>In 2004, <italic>Quill</italic> reported that a survey of journalists conducted by four major media-workers unions, including television and newspapers, found that 83 percent of the respondents cited “too much emphasis on the bottom line” as the media industry’s most serious problem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-1522637912444106">73</xref></sup> The same article referred to a separate survey that found 57 percent of journalists in local newsrooms and 66 percent in national newsrooms felt that “bottom-line pressure is seriously hurting the quality of news coverage.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-1522637912444106">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>Shoemaker and Reese hypothesized that radio and TV are more sensitive to the need to make a profit than print media because nearly all of their income originates from advertising.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-1522637912444106">75</xref></sup> And “unlike most daily newspapers, television stations compete head to head with comparable organizations offering a very similar product. The inflexible time within which to program commercials translates every programming decision into an economic trade-off.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-1522637912444106">76</xref></sup> Findings from the Pew Research Center show support for these claims. A 2007 Pew survey found that 65 percent of national and 62 percent of local television journalists believed that bottom-line pressures were seriously hurting the quality of news coverage. These findings represent a 13 (national) and a 16 (local) percentage-point increase from those who were surveyed in 1999 about the same issue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-1522637912444106">77</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section8-1522637912444106">
<title>Owner/Executive Pressures</title>
<p>As mentioned, constraints and pressures at the organizational level are largely communicated by top executives and owners. The owners or the head executives, according to Shoemaker and Reese, are the ultimate authority figures in determining the goals and policies of the media organization. Thus, all people working in the organization must answer to them and follow their guidelines if they expect to keep their jobs. They argue that “media owners have an unmistakable impact on media content because they [establish] policy for the entire organization.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-1522637912444106">78</xref></sup> As media organizations grow larger and become more complex as a result of ownership concentration, top-level executives become more connected to outside organizations. And as McManus points out, “management has a legal responsibility to serve the economic interest of owners.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-1522637912444106">79</xref></sup> As a result, top-level executives may exert demands on journalists to uphold these economic interests, as well as others. Evidence in literature supports these assertions of executive and owner pressures and influences on content.</p>
<p>Scholars have studied manager and owner pressures regarding profit goals<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-1522637912444106">80</xref></sup> and coverage bias<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-1522637912444106">81</xref></sup> in the newspaper industry, while other researchers have focused their attention on television. Price examined influences on news content and pressures at the ownership level in her survey of national television news correspondents. She found that approximately 21 percent of those surveyed said that they had felt pressured to report a story because of their owners, while almost the same percentage, 20.6 percent, reported owner pressure <italic>not</italic> to report a story.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-1522637912444106">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pew studies have reported even more instances of owner pressures. A 2000 survey found that 51 percent of local journalists felt that corporate owners influence news organizations’ decisions about which stories to cover or emphasize “a great deal” or “a fair amount.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-1522637912444106">83</xref></sup> The same question was asked in 2004 and yielded similar results, although responses were also segmented by medium in this survey. Results indicated that 48 percent of local journalists felt the same influence from owners. The responses were comparable within both the print and broadcast industries, but the pressure was especially clear in the latter, as 40 percent of local TV and radio journalists reported “a great deal” or “a fair amount” owner influence on content decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-1522637912444106">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>Gilens and Hertzman examined newspaper coverage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 in relation to corporate ownership. They found that newspapers that stood to gain from the loosening of television ownership rules, those with television holdings, offered more favorable coverage, while those that were not likely to gain, those without holdings, provided “overwhelmingly unfavorable” coverage of the act.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-1522637912444106">85</xref></sup> Colistra’s<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-1522637912444106">86</xref></sup> and Snider and Page’s<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-1522637912444106">87</xref></sup> research on news coverage of similar FCC policy issues provided further support for the notion of financial interests of owners influencing content.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Price’s 1998 study of network news coverage of the Telecommunications Act found that only 16 percent of the big three networks’ broadcasts over a three-year period dealt with the act’s potential role in increasing ownership concentration in the television news industry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-1522637912444106">88</xref></sup> The lack of coverage came as no surprise to one politician. The now-defunct <italic>Brill’s Content</italic>, a media watchdog magazine, reported that John McCain spoke about the issue in the Senate, claiming, “You will not see this story on any television or hear it on any radio broadcast because it affects them.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-1522637912444106">89</xref></sup> These findings suggest that media organizations that stand to benefit from policy issues may not necessarily like to bring attention to themselves, while those that do not stand to benefit not only provide more coverage, in most cases, but more negative coverage as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-1522637912444106">90</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section9-1522637912444106">
<title>Staff Size Pressure</title>
<p>The size of a media organization’s staff has been linked to studies regarding ownership,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-1522637912444106">91</xref></sup> competition,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-1522637912444106">92</xref></sup> news quality,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-1522637912444106">93</xref></sup> and overall industry performance,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-1522637912444106">94</xref></sup> to name a few. Although the research focuses on different media and areas, findings typically indicate that a larger staff size is most desirable. For example, Underwood and Stamm examined staff size, among other factors, in their study of newsroom management policies at twelve West Coast newspapers. They found that changes in staff size, which were generally reductions, most often occurred at smaller, family-owned newspapers. During the on-site interviews, the researchers also found that respondents commonly associated a decline in quality with changes in coverage and cutbacks. Thus, a reduction in staff size was viewed as a negative change, while an increase in staff size was viewed positively by the staff members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-1522637912444106">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>Research also suggests that staff size is related to industry factors other than employee opinions of the issue. In his 1978 study of ownership, CATV, and local television news quality, Busterna found that the control variables for the study—penetration of cable television, household income, UHF/VHF, and number of television stations and households in the market under study—were all related to staff size. Two other main variables in the study, both ownership variables, were not found to affect the size of the news staff.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-1522637912444106">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a separate project ten years later, Busterna pointed out that a larger news budget and a larger staff size should generally correspond to the quality of local television news programming.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-1522637912444106">97</xref></sup> The same appeared to be true for newspapers, as Lacy, Fico, and Simon found that industry performance was positively correlated with the size of the news staff.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-1522637912444106">98</xref></sup> Still, the positive implications of a larger staff may not be enough to encourage those in the industry to implement research findings, as evidenced by the subsequent examples.</p>
<p>Bernstein and colleagues’ examination of geographic coverage of local television news found that larger stations devoted a smaller percentage of news space to local news than smaller stations, despite the fact that newscasts were lengthier. The authors proposed that “stations expanding their newscast length do not increase their staff enough to fill the added space with an equivalent amount of local news.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-1522637912444106">99</xref></sup> In a later study, Powers examined ratings, competition, and conduct in local television news. She found that news programs added more news time per day when they were in intense competition. This competition, however, did not directly affect staff size, which led Powers to argue that “increasing hours of news may initially be seen as a less expensive means of competition than adding staff members.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-1522637912444106">100</xref></sup></p>
<p>With empirical evidence connecting staff size to performance and quality programming, it seems that media owners and executives would want to increase, or at least maintain, the size of their staffs, despite economic hardships and increased bottom-line pressures that have faced the industry. But how have the number of staffers fared in recent years? According to a 2007 Pew survey, 28 percent of local TV journalists reported that newsroom staff size has decreased over the past three years, while 47 percent said it has stayed the same.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-1522637912444106">101</xref></sup></p>

<title>Influences within the Media Organization</title>
<p>Along with external forces and broader organizational pressures, influences on media content may also derive from the very place in which it is created: the media organization itself. While Shoemaker and Reese did not specifically name this “within-media organization” level of influence in their onion diagram, they did refer to two other related sources, individual and media routines. As it is conceptualized and explained here, within-media influences incorporate facets from the two aforementioned levels from the hierarchical model. What is different, however, is that the “within-media organization” factor focuses more on forces within the news entity that may affect how journalists produce content and cover (or not cover) certain topics. That is, it centers on possible pressure from management, such as assignment editors or other superiors, working within the news organization.</p>
<sec id="section11-1522637912444106">
<title>Direct and Indirect Management Pressures</title>
<p>Demands from superiors who work in the news organization on a day-to-day basis can be either direct or indirect. Direct pressures are more obvious and may consist of a manager specifically telling a journalist not to cover a story. Or they may provide clear instructions about what topics to cover (or not cover) and how to cover them. A 2000 Pew survey asked print and broadcast journalists about whether journalists sometimes purposely avoid covering certain stories that they believe are truly newsworthy. While 57 percent answered no, 42 percent reported that journalists do sometimes avoid stories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-1522637912444106">102</xref></sup> Although this figure shows that less than half of the journalists surveyed thought this was a problem, it is large enough to rouse concern. Of those who believed that journalists sometime purposely avoid newsworthy stories, an average of 30 percent (28 percent national and 31 percent local) answered that news workers get signals from their bosses to avoid them. Furthermore, 35 percent (33 percent national and 37 percent local) reported direct signals, such as their superiors’ specifically telling them not to cover it, clear instructions about what types of stories were acceptable/unacceptable, or that it was simply “pretty clear.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-1522637912444106">103</xref></sup></p>
<p>As Warren Breed noted in the classic study “Social Control in the Newsroom,” management direction is not typically overt or directly stated. Instead, pressure from superiors is usually relayed in a more subtle, indirect manner. As one staffer in the study put it, news routines and policies about what to cover (or not cover) and how to cover it are learned “by osmosis.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-1522637912444106">104</xref></sup> That is, journalists are socialized over time by methods such as reprimand or editing to learn what types of stories are acceptable. This socialization is also learned through indirect signals, such as “a nod of the head, as if to say, ‘Please don’t rock the boat.’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-1522637912444106">105</xref></sup> The previously mentioned Pew survey addressed these unspoken, hidden norms and indirect signals. Of those journalists who believed that news workers sometimes purposely avoid newsworthy stories, an average of 24 percent (35 percent national and 17 percent local) said that journalists decide to avoid these stories based on how they believe their bosses would respond.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-1522637912444106">106</xref></sup> This is an example of newsroom routines and socialization within the news organization. Of those 30 percent of journalists who said they avoid stories because they get signals from their superiors, 32 percent claimed that this was a result of “indirect” signals, such as yawning at or poking fun of a story idea, or showing a lack of interest by simply not airing or publishing the story once it is created. If this is repeated over time, journalists learn, or become socialized, to avoid these stories on their own if they want to get rewarded by their superiors. Breed contended that a journalist eventually “learns to anticipate what is expected of him so as to win rewards and avoid punishments.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-1522637912444106">107</xref></sup></p>
<p>While these hidden norms and routines appear to be powerful in the newsroom culture, they are not afforded as much attention as more direct means of communicating policy. This inattention may be because they are more difficult to define, measure, and analyze. In discussing journalism ethics and codes, newspaperman and media scholar Philip Meyer suggested that, instead of the written formal ethics codes that are found in newsrooms throughout the country, unwritten codes are more often involved in ethical decision making in the newsroom. He explained that these rules become so “deeply embedded in the newsroom culture that they need never be made explicit to be enforced, but can exist simply as a set of reflexes.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-1522637912444106">108</xref></sup> These “reflexes” are the equivalent of the socialization process in the newsroom to which Breed referred. Perhaps partly because these unspoken codes and “proper” behavior are more difficult to analyze, more direct forms of management communication, such as spoken or written policy, have been more prevalent in scholarship.</p>

<title>Influences on Media Content: Different Theoretical Approaches</title>
<p>Extramedia, organizational, and within-media forces may attempt to influence news content, and they aim to do so through different means for various reasons. These sources may shape coverage by (1) affecting/influencing the topics, stories, or issues the media actually cover (building the media’s agenda); (2) influencing the way a story, issue, or topic is covered–that is, the angle or tone taken when discussing the topic (building the media’s frames); or (3) convincing the media to give an issue, story, or topic little attention or to not cover it at all (cutting the item from the media’s agenda). For this monograph, special attention is paid to the elucidation of agenda cutting, the third type of influence mentioned, as it is a largely ignored phenomenon that has been afforded little attention by researchers. Thus, this project aims to develop and expand this potentially important area of media scholarship.</p>
<sec id="section13-1522637912444106">
<title>Agenda Building</title>
<p>The mass media’s influence on audiences has been a common area of study ever since the advent of the magic bullet theory in the 1920s and 1930s. Years later, McCombs and Shaw made significant strides in media effects and public opinion research. Their initial agenda-setting study of undecided voters in the 1968 election found that the objects that are emphasized most in the media come to be deemed as most important by the public.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-1522637912444106">109</xref></sup> This led them to cite Cohen’s claim that the press “may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think <italic>about</italic>.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-1522637912444106">110</xref></sup> Since then, media effects research, particularly agenda setting, has exploded in interest.</p>
<p>While many studies have focused on how media content influences audience cognition, attitudes, and opinion, research concerning how the <italic>media</italic> are influenced in the first place has been afforded somewhat less attention. Although Rogers, Dearing, and Bregman referred to this process as <italic>media agenda setting</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-1522637912444106">111</xref></sup> it is more generally known as <italic>agenda building</italic>, a term that helps distinguish its application from the media-effects approach of agenda setting. Essentially, while agenda-setting theory suggests that the media tell <italic>people</italic> “what to think about,” the agenda-building process focuses on the internal and external forces that tell the <italic>media</italic> what to think (and write) about.</p>
<p>The importance of such research of who or what is building the media’s agenda was noted in the late 1940s by Lazarsfeld and Merton. The authors argued that the media are controlled by powerful businesses and organizations and suggested that these groups set the agenda for the media, and in turn the audience, by influencing the content relayed to the public.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-1522637912444106">112</xref></sup> Cobb and Elder defined agenda building in the political arena as the study “concerned with the identification and specification of the types of issue conflicts that receive the attention and action of governmental decision-makers.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-1522637912444106">113</xref></sup> In other words, they were “concerned with how issues are created and why some controversies or . . . issues come to command the attention . . . of decision makers, while others fail.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-1522637912444106">114</xref></sup> Years later, Gandy stressed the role of information subsidies as potential agenda-building mechanisms and sparked a greater interest in this line of scholarship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-1522637912444106">115</xref></sup> By 1991, Shoemaker and Reese had developed their hierarchical model of influences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-1522637912444106">116</xref></sup> This “onion diagram” depicts the levels through which media content can be influenced prior to reaching the audience and, thus, has been an essential tool for scholars interested in agenda building. However, while the diagram allows for an easier classification system of where these influences are coming from, it does not provide a comprehensive model that can actually test the pressures and potential effects on the media and news content. Furthermore, as previously noted, few researchers have examined how the media agenda is developed or “set.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn117-1522637912444106">117</xref></sup> In fact, in a 1993 article, Rogers, Dearing, and Bregman uncovered only fifteen publications specifically dealing with building the media’s agenda.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn118-1522637912444106">118</xref></sup> Even though there have been many more studies since then, research in this area still warrants further investigation because, according to the authors, “we need to better understand how the media agenda is set, and by whom.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn119-1522637912444106">119</xref></sup></p>

<title>Frame Building</title>
<p>In addition to building the media’s agenda, external and internal sources may also attempt to control or influence the <italic>way</italic> a story is covered. That is, they may attempt to frame a story in a light that is more favorable or beneficial to their company, organization, or boss. This process is frame building, and it suggests that internal and external forces tell the media <italic>how</italic> to think (or write) about an issue, story, or topic. Frames, as Neuman, Just, and Crigler pointed out, involve how the media “spin” the story and should take “into account their organizational and modality constraints, professional judgments, and certain judgments about the audience.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn120-1522637912444106">120</xref></sup> According to Maher, framing focuses on environments and relationships. Specifically, framing research not only emphasizes the <italic>relationships</italic> of frames, words, and sentences within a given text, but it also calls attention to the <italic>environments</italic> in which they were conceived, such as the source of the frame (e.g., an advertiser) and the intentions of the communicator (e.g., to talk about the positives of a product while downplaying undesirable reviews).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn121-1522637912444106">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>As some researchers have noted, framing is difficult to study and measure because of vague definitions and the misuse of terms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn122-1522637912444106">122</xref></sup> Scheufele has attempted to clarify certain aspects and processes of the approach to aid scholars in this important area of media studies. He has argued that concepts of framing need to be specified “because frames have to be considered schemes for both presenting and comprehending the news.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn123-1522637912444106">123</xref></sup> The two types of frames are <italic>media frames</italic> and <italic>audience frames</italic>, and it is important for researchers to distinguish between them to determine the best methods and measures for examination in different types of studies. A <italic>media frame</italic> has been defined by Gamson and Modigliani as “a central organizing idea or story line that provides meaning to an unfolding strip of events. . . . The frame suggests what the controversy is about, the essence of the issue.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn124-1522637912444106">124</xref></sup> The conceptualization of media frames can also consist of the inadvertent or deliberate intentions of the internal or external source sending the message.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn125-1522637912444106">125</xref></sup> The second type of frame, the <italic>audience frame</italic>, Scheufele notes, is defined by Entman as “mentally stored clusters of ideas that guide an individuals’ processing of information.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn126-1522637912444106">126</xref></sup> That is, this type of frame focuses on the individual level of the process. According to Entman, framing not only assigns importance to an issue, but it also presents the issue in such a way as to communicate a certain type of message.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn127-1522637912444106">127</xref></sup> The media may frame a message in a particular way, based on extramedia, organizational, or within-media sources.</p>
<p>In addition to distinguishing between the types of frames, Scheufele also explained that frames need to be classified by <italic>independent</italic> and <italic>dependent</italic> variables.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn128-1522637912444106">128</xref></sup> When frames are considered <italic>independent</italic> variables in media research, the study is concerned with framing effects. For example, a researcher might be interested in how frames presented in the media (media frames) influence how the audience understands an issue (audience frame). When the media frame is the <italic>dependent</italic> variable, the study is concerned with extramedia, organizational, and within-media sources that attempt to influence the way the media frame an issue, topic, or story. Regarding frame building, Scheufele remarked, “No evidence has yet been systematically collected about how various [intrinsic and extrinsic] factors impact the structural qualities of news in terms of framing.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn129-1522637912444106">129</xref></sup> Therefore, this somewhat ignored area of scholarship warrants further investigation. This particular classification of framing research is the focus of this monograph.</p>

<title>Agenda Cutting</title>
<p>While the idea of placing an idea on the news agenda by giving it more salience has been studied for many years, it is interesting that the reverse phenomenon, keeping an item <italic>off</italic> the agenda, has largely been ignored in scholarly research. This concept is known as agenda cutting.</p>
<p>Although not specifically discussing this phenomenon, McCombs and Shaw alluded to the process in 1984 when explaining that newspaper items are “not treated equally when presented to the audience. Some are used at length, some are severely cut.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn130-1522637912444106">130</xref></sup> Still, Wober and Gunter made perhaps the first mention of the term <italic>agenda cutting</italic> in their 1988 book, <italic>Television and Social Control</italic>. In relation to agenda setting, they described agenda cutting as a “process whereby problems or issues have attention directed away from them by receiving little or no media coverage.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn131-1522637912444106">131</xref></sup> Thus, it is proposed that agenda cutting may occur in three ways: (1) by placing an item low on the news agenda (burying it), (2) by removing it from agenda once it is there, or (3) by completely ignoring it by never placing it on the agenda in the first place.</p>
<p>The process of agenda cutting has been mentioned by few scholars and researched by even fewer, which, according to Wober, is largely due to its lack of identification and documentation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn132-1522637912444106">132</xref></sup> He provided a notable American example that took place in 1864 when General Meade humiliated a news reporter. In return, the northern press apparently ignored (cut) all stories about Meade except those associated with defeat. Surely stories about the general were deemed newsworthy by the press. But because of his harsh action against the reporter, they cut complimentary stories about him out of the public’s attention. As a result, Wober suggested, Meade was reduced to a “non-person.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn133-1522637912444106">133</xref></sup></p>
<p>Project Censored, a media group based out of Sonoma State University, has investigated instances of “news stories of social significance” that did not run in the mainstream media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn134-1522637912444106">134</xref></sup> Each year, the organization compiles a list of twenty-five stories obtained from independent news sources that were ignored, for the most part, by national media. Although the Project does not explicitly examine possible reasons why these items were cut or the effects on audience cognition, it does provide useful examples on which to base agenda-cutting scholarship.</p>
<p>Media Tenor has been perhaps the only organization specifically researching the area of agenda cutting. The international institute specializes in detailed and continuous content analysis of the media, mainly examining agenda setting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn135-1522637912444106">135</xref></sup> In 2003, Media Tenor published a study examining the agenda-setting and agenda-cutting effects of German television news coverage of mad cow disease from 1997 to 2002. The first official case of the disease was announced in late 2000 and received substantial television coverage. During this time, the broadcast media appeared to set the agenda, as 73 percent of respondents in an unaffiliated opinion poll “felt threatened” by the disease, while 58 percent altered their consumption of beef.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn136-1522637912444106">136</xref></sup> The extensive coverage also coincided with a sharp dip in German beef consumption figures.</p>
<p>According to the study, the media had substantially decreased the amount of mad-cow coverage by 2001, which coincided with a 26 percentage-point decrease in the number of polled German respondents feeling endangered by the disease. By 2002, however, television coverage was placed so low on the news agenda that it was almost nonexistent. To test the cutting effects, Media Tenor correlated the scant television coverage with German beef consumption. The organization found that a decrease in news about the disease correlated with a slow increase in consumption, despite the fact there were nearly as many confirmed cases (106) as when the first official case was confirmed in 2001 (125).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn137-1522637912444106">137</xref></sup> As this example illustrates, cutting an important item from the news agenda may lead to an uninformed public.</p>
<p>Although Wober began mentioning agenda cutting in the late 1980s, he did not discuss it in much detail until 2001. While he did not actually test the phenomenon, he did provide several examples that suggested agenda cutting does exist. More importantly, he proposed three main reasons why agenda cutting may occur, which essentially deal with logistical constraints, journalists’ own prejudices, and internal and external influences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn138-1522637912444106">138</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section16-1522637912444106">
<title>Logistical constraints</title>
<p>Agenda cutting may occur because of logistical constraints, such as the size of the news hole and reporting staff. First, news organizations can only report on a certain number of topics at a time, which results in the elimination of others. Selecting topics, however, may not be a deliberate process. In discussing agenda setting, McCombs argued that the selection of objects usually occurs fortuitously, at least for media in democratic cultures. He explained that “because agenda-setting is an inadvertent outcome of reporting the news, this is a role that cannot be abdicated or sidestepped.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn139-1522637912444106">139</xref></sup> The same is likely true for agenda cutting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1522637912444106">
<title>Journalists’ prejudices</title>
<p>Wober claimed that agenda cutting may also occur because of prejudices of journalists and news organizations. This reasoning falls in line with White’s 1950 gatekeeping study in which he suggested that “Mr. Gates” used subjective judgment, including his own personal prejudices, when deciding what stories to omit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn140-1522637912444106">140</xref></sup> It is important to note, however, that this type of cutting by journalists may be unintentional.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1522637912444106">
<title>Internal and external influences</title>
<p>Finally, agenda cutting may occur when people within or outside the news organization “do their best to hide or camouflage stories.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn141-1522637912444106">141</xref></sup> This possible reason is the focus of this monograph. Wober gave an example of an internal e-mail that was circulated by an executive for the British Transport Ministry immediately following the 9/11 New York terrorist attacks. The message read, “It’s now a very good day to get out anything we want to bury. Councillors’ expenses?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn142-1522637912444106">142</xref></sup> The story was leaked to the press nearly a month later, when it was confirmed that the department in question had, in fact, released the unfavorable information on September 12.</p>
<p>Although not specifically examining agenda cutting, separate studies by Snider and Page,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn143-1522637912444106">143</xref></sup> Price,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn144-1522637912444106">144</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn145-1522637912444106">145</xref></sup> have shown some evidence that organizational-level sources have cut issues from the media agenda by affording topics little attention or failing to cover them at all. For example, in her 1998 study of network news coverage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Price found that only 16 percent of the big three networks’ broadcasts over a three-year period dealt with the act’s potential role in increasing ownership concentration in the television news industry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn146-1522637912444106">146</xref></sup> Colistra’s pilot study, which specifically examined a policy issue through the agenda-cutting lens, provides additional support.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn147-1522637912444106">147</xref></sup> This research investigated the FCC’s digital spectrum “loan” to broadcasters examined coverage from the three major networks, CNN, and two national newspapers. Colistra found strong evidence for her agenda-cutting hypothesis, as the media entities that stood to gain from the giveaway, the network television stations, ignored the issue over the nine-year period of study, while the newspapers placed it low on their agendas and CNN only ran one relevant broadcast. She also found that when the newspapers covered the issue, more than 44 percent of their hard news coverage was either “negative” or “very negative,” compared to only 4 percent of “positive” coverage. These findings suggest that media organizations that stand to benefit from policy issues may not necessarily like to bring attention to themselves, while those that do not stand to benefit may not only provide more coverage but more negative coverage as well. The two examples illustrate how forces from the organizational level or within the media (e.g., owners/executives or managers who make editorial decisions) and external sources (e.g., government legislation involving the media) may lead to instances of agenda cutting.</p>
<p>In short, agenda cutting may occur by (1) placing an item low on the news agenda, (2) removing it from the agenda once it is there, or (3) completely ignoring it by never putting it on the agenda in the first place. Because the concept of agenda cutting has been examined by few researchers, this monograph attempts to further develop and expand the approach. As mentioned, one aspect of the current research specifically focuses on how often and under what conditions agenda cutting is most like to occur. As with the other potential influences on content just discussed, attention is concentrated on internal and external sources that may help cause this phenomenon. By beginning with the potential causes of agenda cutting, scholars will be better able to understand this approach and begin to form research questions regarding motives behind “cutting” certain topics, stories, and issues from the media agenda; its effects on news coverage; and its possible outcomes on audience cognition.</p>

<title>Study Justification</title>
<p>While numerous studies have focused on how the media set the audience agenda, fewer have taken a step back to get to the root of matter: how the media’s agenda is influenced in the first place. Although some research has examined these different forces and their potential effects separately (e.g., public relations or advertising pressures effects on building the media’s agenda or frames), no known research has studied how various influences may simultaneously affect news coverage or content decisions. Likewise, little research has concentrated on the much-ignored, but important, phenomenon of agenda cutting. Although Wober coined the term and established the baseline knowledge for this type of research, there have been no known comprehensive efforts to further develop, explain, or test this concept. Each of the previously mentioned areas needs to be explored to determine how internal and external forces attempt to affect news content and coverage decisions. This type of research is especially pertinent in the current media landscape where news workers are faced with multiple competing loyalties, which are at least partially due to increased economic constraints and bottom-line pressures.</p>

<title>Hypothesized Model</title>
<p>Using aspects from Shoemaker and Reese’s hierarchical model of influences, along with research and examples from agenda-building and framing literature and media surveys, a comprehensive model of media influences and outcomes was tested using structural equation modeling and a national web survey of television reporters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1522637912444106">Figure 2</xref>). This analysis examined the overall picture and assessed possible pressures on media content decisions and potential outcomes of these influences, based on reporters’ perceptions. Specifically, the overall model evaluated within-media organization influences as mediating the relationships between extramedia and organizational influences and the proposed content outcomes. This systematic and comprehensive approach helps to improve our understanding of the different types of pressures media organizations face every day. This model also helps to advance our knowledge of agenda building, frame building, and agenda cutting in the news industry.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section22-1522637912444106">
<title>Data-Gathering Process</title>
<p>Data were obtained through a web-based survey of television reporters. It is clearly understood that news directors, assignment editors, and other executives—not reporters—make the final content decisions in the newsroom and interact with some of the outside forces under study. However, television news reporters are an important group to question regarding attempted influences and effects on content decisions for several reasons. First, reporters are a better group to survey on these particular issues than managers, directors, and executives because they are more likely to give candid responses as they are further removed from the business side of news operations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn148-1522637912444106">148</xref></sup> Second, the transient nature of television reporters increases the likelihood that they will not supply answers that show loyalty to and/or protection for their current news organization. Therefore, they are likely to offer more candid responses. Finally, they are less likely to suffer from survey fatigue,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn149-1522637912444106">149</xref></sup> as many studies involving broadcast workers focus on surveys of news directors or producers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn150-1522637912444106">150</xref></sup> Thus, this group provides an untapped source to study regarding <italic>their perceptions</italic> of pressures in the news industry. Studying this group is important, among other reasons, because if reporters perceive their organizations as bowing to pressure, it may lower morale, affect their own journalistic styles of reporting, and serve as a form of social control of the newsroom, which was examined by Breed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn151-1522637912444106">151</xref></sup> This monograph speaks of “perceived,” rather than “actual,” influences because a survey was used to gauge opinions—not content analysis to track the influences.</p>
<p>Because structural equation modeling (SEM) is a large-sample technique, an adequate list of potential respondents was required. Furthermore, an even larger sample size was needed for the current study because a model-building SEM approach was used. Briefly, this method requires randomly splitting the data file to use the first half of the data for a more exploratory approach while saving the second half of the data for confirming the modifications made during the first phase.</p>
<sec id="section23-1522637912444106">
<title>Sampling Process</title>
<p>Reporters for the survey were chosen by a two-stage process. To identify potential participants, a list of U.S. television stations was compiled from Bacon’s MediaSource (now Cision) online.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn152-1522637912444106">152</xref></sup> Several categories of stations were omitted from this list, including Spanish-language channels, PBS, stations without news departments or a news team, and other specialized channels such as religious and home-shopping formats. Some stations listed on the Bacon’s site had news departments, but no reporters were listed. To reduce coverage error, these stations’ websites were consulted and general assignment reporters’ contact information, when listed, was recorded for inclusion in the survey.</p>
<p>Second, all general reporters (i.e., those not listed as specific types of reporters) from each station were considered. Only those with specific e-mail addresses (e.g., <email>j.doe@wxyz.com</email> and not <email>news@wxyz.com</email>) were eligible for participation in the study. The final list resulted in 2,074 potential respondents. After the completed list was obtained, contact information was gathered from the Bacon’s site. A prenotification letter that included an invitation and a survey link was then sent by mail.</p>
<p>Qualtrics web-based survey software was used to implement the project. Each reporter obtained from the selection process was automatically assigned a different link to access the survey by the Qualtrics program. This feature allowed the researcher to track responses and data. It also helped to prevent those who had already responded to the survey from receiving additional e-mail reminders. Access codes and passwords were not required, so it was easier for respondents to access the survey.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1522637912444106">
<title>Implementation Procedures: Recruiting Participants</title>
<p>Many of the techniques suggested by Dillman were used in this study to solicit participants and to improve response rates, including a mailed prenotification letter printed on university letterhead with first-class stamp postage; personally addressed correspondence; wording that individuals were specifically chosen to participate; a post script indicating that they also had the option to complete the survey by mail or by telephone; and an offer for a nonmonetary incentive, an executive summary of the results, regardless of participation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn153-1522637912444106">153</xref></sup> The targeted response rate was 30 percent, which is comparable to that achieved by Pew Research Center’s surveys of similar groups.</p>
<p>To solicit participants, a prenotification letter was sent via postal mail on Friday, February 9, 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn154-1522637912444106">154</xref></sup> Six days after the prenotification/invitation letter was sent by mail, the official e-mail invitation with the much of the same information was sent to the work e-mail addresses obtained from the sampling frame.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn155-1522637912444106">155</xref></sup> The official e-mail invitation included a respondent-specific link, generated by Qualtrics, to the survey’s consent page and the actual survey. Three reminder messages were sent for a total of five contacts. Recipients who had not yet completed the survey were sent the first reminder message seven days after the initial e-mail contact. A second reminder was sent to nonresponders approximately one week later, and the third e-mail reminder was distributed six days after that. All communication with the respondents was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1522637912444106">
<title>Survey Instrument and Operationalization of Variables</title>
<p>The web survey consisted of seventy questions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn156-1522637912444106">156</xref></sup> A pretest of academics with television experience was conducted to check for ambiguities in questioning, word choice, and other issues that may deter respondents from completing the survey, and minor adjustments in wording were made.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn157-1522637912444106">157</xref></sup> Of the 2,074 mailed prenotification letters, six were returned as undeliverable, resulting in a total possible sample of 2,068. Eleven people requested a mail survey, which was sent with a postage-paid return envelope, and a total of seven were completed for inclusion in the analysis. Additionally, two reporters requested to take the survey by phone.</p>
<p>Of the total sample of 2,068, the data file contained 618 usable responses, resulting in a 30 percent response rate. It is important to note that the beginning of the Web survey took place during a hectic time for those in the television industry—a sweeps period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn158-1522637912444106">158</xref></sup> Despite this potential drawback, the targeted response rate was still met, suggesting that the topic was of importance to many reporters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn159-1522637912444106">159</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section26-1522637912444106">
<title>About the Respondents</title>
<p>From the usable sample (<italic>n</italic> = 618), participants were 51 percent male and 47 percent female; 2 percent declined to answer. Reporters in the 25- to 34-year-old age group made up the majority of respondents with 51 percent, followed by those 35 to 44 years of age with 21.3 percent. Twelve and a half percent of the participants were between 45 and 55 years old, and younger reporters aged 18 to 24 (9.3 percent) and those 55 or older (6 percent) represented the fewest number of respondents. The average respondent had worked in the television industry for approximately 13 years (mean = 12.76, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.04). Years of industry experience for the majority group, those 51 percent who were 25 to 34 years old, was approximately eight years. A majority of the participants were from the larger Designated Market Areas (DMAs), as 69 percent worked for stations in the 1 to 25 markets and 11 percent in the 26 to 50 markets. The remaining 20 percent of participating reporters served stations in the smaller DMAs (51+). Survey participants also tended to work in larger newsrooms, with 73 percent reporting that their stations’ news department consisted of 31 or more people. Most of the respondents (61 percent) worked for publicly owned media entities, and 83 percent worked for groups owning five or more stations. Furthermore, 65 percent of the participating reporters claimed that their stations’ owners also owned other types of media. Thus, the demographic information suggests that the majority of respondents worked for more concentrated media entities.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, it is important to point out the differences between the sample (the survey respondents) and the population (the list of reporters to whom the survey was sent). The only demographic-type of data provided by Bacon’s MediaSource (now Cisco), the sampling frame, were gender (assessed by using the listed salutation) and DMA. The gender makeup was similar for the sample (51/47 male-female split) and the population (55/45 split). The DMAs, on the other hand, showed more marked differences between the population and the sample. The list consisted of 40 percent of reporters representing the largest, 1 to 25, markets, as compared to 69 percent of the survey participants. Smaller disparities surfaced in the other DMA groups, with a 17 percentage point difference within the 51+ DMAs (37 percent in population list versus 20 percent of the respondents) and a 11.5 percentage point difference in the 26 to 50 DMA spots (22.5 percent for the population list and 11 percent of the respondents). As previously discussed, this study used a model-building approach that required a large sample. Since there are only a given number of “general” reporters, all those listed in the sampling frame meeting the specified criteria were considered for survey participation. Therefore, stratifying based on the population was not possible, and this discrepancy is listed as a potential limitation for the study. Furthermore, AMOS, the statistical software used, does not allow for computation of weighted cases. Thus, weighting by DMA to correct this possible issue was not an option.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1522637912444106">
<title>Operationalization of Variables</title>
<p>The survey consisted of two main scale measures (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>/<italic>strongly agree</italic> and <italic>almost never</italic>/<italic>very often</italic>), both of which used a 7-point Likert-type format. In most instances, the questions were ordered so scale items did not appear continuously. Some items were also reverse-ordered to help prevent response bias. Survey items were worded to assess respondents’ perceptions of situations in typical television newsrooms—not just their own. This general approach was used to encourage more candid responses, and it is a technique often used by large-scale research outfits, such as Pew Research Center. Each of the latent construct’s indicators was assessed for internal consistency and reliability using Cronbach’s alpha.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn160-1522637912444106">160</xref></sup> The latent variables in the survey and model are as follows: (1) extramedia influences, (2) organizational influences, (3) within-media influences, and (4) content influence/outcome.</p>
<sec id="section28-1522637912444106">
<title>Extramedia influences</title>
<p>A total of 12 questions were used to measure extramedia influences, which is one of the independent variables in the study. The observed indicators (measures) used to measure different components of this latent construct are (1) advertising pressures, (2) public relations pressure, and (3) political/governmental pressures. Each of these observed variables were measured using a series of questions related to each potential influence area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-1522637912444106">
<title>Advertising pressures</title>
<p>Four questions were used to evaluate instances of advertiser pressures (α = .87, <italic>M</italic> = 14.01, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.77). Previous research has suggested that advertisers, in at least some instances, attempt to influence content in various ways, including trying to influence (1) the media to cover or emphasize certain stories, (2) the manner in which a story or topic is covered, or (3) the media to not cover a story or topic. The survey questions were used to assess these pressures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-1522637912444106">
<title>Public relations pressures</title>
<p>Three questions were used to assess instances of public relations pressures (α = .81, <italic>M</italic> = 14.86, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.25).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn161-1522637912444106">161</xref></sup> Practitioners may attempt to influence content in similar ways as advertisers. Thus, similar survey questions represent public relations pressures. Previous research also suggests that public relations professionals may be able to influence the media by distributing information subsidies, such as news releases and VNRs. The receipt and use of these materials were also evaluated in the survey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-1522637912444106">
<title>Political/governmental pressures</title>
<p>Five questions evaluated pressures from politicians and government officials (α = .82, <italic>M</italic> = 22.70, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.64).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn162-1522637912444106">162</xref></sup> As with the advertising and public relations pressure measures, several questions were posed to assess just how these sources attempt to influence news content and coverage decisions. The literature also suggests that these sources may also try to influence the media by providing stations with leaks, prepackaged news, and off-the-record interviews. These areas have largely been ignored other than anecdotal examples. Thus, they were explored in the survey.</p>

<title>Staff size pressure measure</title>
<p>Previous research concerning staff size suggests that it is linked to quality of coverage and industry performance. Some studies have found that an inadequate staff size may have detrimental effects on news content. Many media organizations, however, have been forced to cut staff because of bottom-line pressures. Not surprisingly, journalists tend to view inadequate staff size, which is typically due to staffing cuts, in a negative light. Two survey items were used to measure journalists’ opinions on particular staffing statements (α = .68, <italic>M</italic> = 12.42, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.84).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn163-1522637912444106">163</xref></sup></p>

<title>Owner/executive pressures</title>
<p>Research indicates that owners and top-level executives try, and are successful at, influencing content decisions at some news organizations. As with the measures of extramedia influences, these owner/executives may attempt to influence the types of stories that are covered/not covered, or the angles taken on certain topics or issues. Three questions assessed this source of influence (α = .94, <italic>M</italic> = 8.86, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.56).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn164-1522637912444106">164</xref></sup></p>

<p>Five survey questions evaluated the levels of economic pressures faced by journalists (α = .78, <italic>M</italic> = 19.76, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.21).

<title>Direct and Indirect Management Pressures</title>
<p>Six questions measured reporters’ feelings concerning their perceptions about direct and indirect management pressures. Three questions evaluated instances of direct forms of management pressures, such as a superior directly instructing a journalist to cover a story from a certain angle (α = .72, <italic>M</italic> = 12.01, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.53). Three questions asked respondents how often indirect forms of manager pressures occur in typical newsrooms (α = .83, <italic>M</italic> = 11.80, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.04). This type of pressure may include indirect signals such as showing no interest in a story idea, not running it, or poking fun at it.</p>

<p>In the television industry, stations are categorized into DMAs, which are classified by number.

<title>Content influences/outcomes</title>
<p>A total of 27 survey items assessed how content is influenced as a result of the various types of internal and external pressures just discussed. Nine questions evaluated the outcome of <italic>agenda building</italic> (α <italic>=</italic> .80, <italic>M</italic> = 30.01, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.43). As mentioned, agenda building involves who or what is trying to influence the media’s news agenda. Survey items specifically evaluated how often external and internal sources are successful at influencing media decisions of what stories to cover or emphasize.</p>
<p>A second type of outcome, <italic>frame building</italic>, consists of instances in which the aforementioned sources influence the manner in which a story, topic, issue, or event is covered (e.g., the stance of an issue or the angle of a topic). Eight questions assessed this specific form of influence on media content (α = .80, <italic>M</italic> = 27.06, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.38).</p>
<p>Finally, media content may also be influenced by internal and external forces attempting to convince news workers to <italic>not</italic> cover a particular story, topic, issue, or event. This process is known as <italic>agenda cutting</italic>, and it may occur by (1) keeping an item off the news agenda, (2) having it removed once it is there, or (3) affording it little attention (burying it). Ten survey items assessed this content outcome (α = .84, <italic>M</italic> = 28.68, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.19).</p>

<title>Data Analysis Procedures</title>
<p>As mentioned, this study incorporated SEM to examine through which internal and external forces and under what conditions the media are most likely to be influenced and to what potential effect on news content. SEM is a multivariate technique and can be considered a combination and/or extension of multiple regression, path analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn166-1522637912444106">166</xref></sup></p>
<p>To use SEM, a proposed model must be sufficiently identified, which, according to Kline, means it is theoretically testable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn167-1522637912444106">167</xref></sup> There must be a sufficient amount of variance and covariance information available from the observed variables to estimate the unknown information. This stipulation indicates that the number of parameters to be estimated (the unknowns) must be less than or equal to the number of sample variances and covariances (the knowns), and it is a necessary condition for model identification. The hypothesized IOMC model for this study had 12 observed measures (known sample variances and covariances), which translate into 78 sample moments, and 26 parameters to estimate (unknowns). Because the number of knowns (78) exceeds the number of unknowns (26), the model was overidentified, indicating there was sufficient information available for identification purposes. Model identification was also ensured by setting a metric (scale) for every latent construct by fixing one path (regression coefficient), depicted by the arrows, from the latent construct to the observed variable to 1, which means that the metric of the unobserved variable (oval) will be the same as that particular observed variable (square/rectangle). The model also satisfies another sufficient condition for identification since it contains two or more indicators per latent variable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn168-1522637912444106">168</xref></sup> In addition, it has been noted that if the model is recursive (i.e., it does not contain feedback loops between the constructs or correlated error or disturbance terms), it is identified.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn169-1522637912444106">169</xref></sup> Since the current model met this criterion, it was considered recursive. In addition to model identification, the current study followed the two-step modeling approach for examining structural regression models, the type of model proposed in this project, as suggested by Kline<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn170-1522637912444106">170</xref></sup> and Anderson and Gerbing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn171-1522637912444106">171</xref></sup> This process involves first validating the measurement portion of the model by first respecifying it as a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model and then assessing it to determine whether it fits the sample data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn172-1522637912444106">172</xref></sup> Once an acceptable measurement model has been found, the full model is evaluated.</p>
<sec id="section41-1522637912444106">
<title>Missing Values and Data Screening</title>
<p>Before moving to the data-screening phase and estimation of the hypothesized model, it was necessary to assess the data file for missing values and possible nonresponse patterns. A total of 696 reporters officially started the survey;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn173-1522637912444106">173</xref></sup> however, only cases that had complete values for nine of the measured variables in the study were retained. This restriction led to the deletion of 78 cases missing values (responses) on more than 30 percent of the variables under study, resulting in 618 usable cases.</p>
<p>A general rule of thumb for SEM and CFA is to have approximately ten cases per parameters to estimate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn174-1522637912444106">174</xref></sup> The hypothesized model had 26 parameters to estimate, so a sample size of 260 was needed. This study, however, used a model-development approach in which the data file was split into two subfiles (one for estimating the hypothesized model and making modifications and the other for confirming the modified model/changes). Therefore, a larger sample size of 520 was required. Since there were a total of 618 usable cases, the sample size was large enough to proceed without caution.</p>
<p>After close inspection of the file, the data were considered missing at random (MAR), as no particular data-loss patterns were detected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn175-1522637912444106">175</xref></sup> Since the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation technique used in the study assumes that none of the data are missing, which is unlikely for survey research, missing values were imputed using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in EQS 6.1.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn176-1522637912444106">176</xref></sup></p>
<p>After imputing missing values, the data were screened to ensure that assumptions associated with SEM were met. The means and standard deviation values appeared reasonable, the minimum and maximum values were within appropriate range, and the data showed sufficiently linear relationships between the variables. Further inspection revealed five cases with large Mahalanobis distance values, and they were removed from the data file. To further check for normality issues, Mardia’s coefficient for multivariate kurtosis was examined in AMOS 7.0. Mardia’s coefficient was slightly inflated, and an inspection of the Mahalanobis values revealed that one additional case showed a jump in value.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn177-1522637912444106">177</xref></sup> The case was removed from and the data file was rerun to check for normality. In all, six cases were removed, which resulted in a final data file of 612 cases (618 – 6 = 612).

<title>Model Assessment Procedures</title>
<p>Since a systematic model of content influences and outcomes has neither been proposed nor tested prior to this project, this study used a model-development approach. The data file of 612 cases was separated into two subfiles using a random number generator in SPSS 15.0. All SEM analyses were conducted in AMOS 7.0. The first subfile (<italic>n</italic> = 306) was used for <italic>exploratory</italic> analyses, including initial model testing and model trimming and building based on modification indices obtained in the AMOS output as well as previous research and theory. The second subfile (<italic>n</italic> = 306) was used to validate the adjustments that manifested from exploration of the first file. Finally, the full data file was used to substantiate the modifications and model fit results of the two subfiles. Therefore, the second subfile and the full data file were used for <italic>confirmatory</italic> analyses.</p>
<p>Several indices were used to assess model fit. The model chi-squared statistic was first obtained. Kline notes that it “is actually a ‘badness-of-fit’ index because the higher its value, the worse the model’s correspondence to the data.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn179-1522637912444106">179</xref></sup> Contrary to most statistical tests, a nonsignficant value is desired here. Although there are some problems with the chi-squared statistic in SEM analyses, such as its high sensitivity to sample size that often leads to the rejection of well-fitting models, it is still widely reported in SEM research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn180-1522637912444106">180</xref></sup> Other fit indices suggested by Hu and Bentler<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn181-1522637912444106">181</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn182-1522637912444106">182</xref></sup> were also used to assess the proposed model: CFI (comparative fit index), TLI (Tucker Lewis index), SRMR (standardized root mean squared residuals), and RMSEA (root mean square error of approximation) with <italic>p</italic>-close value. The traditional rules of thumb were used to assess reasonable model fit, and include a nonsignificant χ<sup>2</sup> (which seldom occurs with larger sample sizes), SRMR &lt; .10, and CFI and TLI ≥ .90.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn183-1522637912444106">183</xref></sup> Furthermore, researchers have noted that RMSEA values of ≤ .05 suggest close fit, while values of .05 to .08 indicate reasonable error of approximation; RMSEA values ≥ .10 signify poor model fit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn184-1522637912444106">184</xref></sup> <italic>P</italic>-close values associated with the RMSEA should be nonsignificant (&gt;.05).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn185-1522637912444106">185</xref></sup> Kline has also suggested reporting the 90 percent confidence intervals for the RMSEA.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn186-1522637912444106">186</xref></sup></p>

<title>Validating and Exploring the Measurement Model</title>
<p>Following Kline’s suggestion for two-step modeling, the proposed structural model was respecified as a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) measurement model in which all of the factors (ovals) were allowed to correlate, as opposed to the direct paths presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1522637912444106">Figure 2</xref>. Market size was omitted from this process because it is an observed (measured) variable. The CFA was then analyzed to determine if it fit the data. Once a satisfactory model is found, it is appropriate to assess the full hypothesized structural regression model. The measurement model was assessed using data from subfile 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 306), the exploratory file. The initial analysis indicated that the four-factor CFA model was a poor fit to the exploratory data file based on the values of many of the selected indices, χ<sup>2</sup>(48) = 230.830, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; CFI = .91; TLI = .87; SRMR = .0794; RMSEA = .11, <italic>p</italic>-close &lt; .001, with the 90 percent confidence interval .098 to .126.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn187-1522637912444106">187</xref></sup></p>
<p>The modification indices (MIs) suggested some notable changes in the measurement model to improve fit. Only those changes that were facially valid and made sense based on theory and previous research were implemented. Three suggested changes were particularly noteworthy, and each involved the correlation of error terms. The recommended changes were correlated errors between (1) the <italic>Staff Size Pressure</italic> measure and <italic>Economic Pressure</italic>; (2) <italic>Political Pressure</italic> and <italic>PR Pressure</italic>; (3) and the <italic>Level of Agenda Building</italic> and the <italic>Level of Agenda Cutting</italic> measures. First, the correlation between the <italic>Staff Size Pressure</italic> measure and <italic>Economic Pressure</italic> errors was likely due to a measurement artifact, as both were measured on a <italic>strongly disagree</italic>/<italic>strongly agree</italic> scale; all other indicators were measured on an <italic>almost never</italic>/<italic>very often</italic> scale.</p>
<p>Second, the correlated error terms of the <italic>Political</italic> and <italic>PR Pressure</italic> measures, both of which are indicators of Extramedia Influences, are logical because both are forms of information subsidies. That is, both sources provide free information (e.g., press releases, BNRs, VNRs, and press conferences) to the media. The third indicator of the factor, however, <italic>Advertiser Pressures</italic>, does not. Instead, pressures from advertisers are financially related. Thus, the relationship between pressures from political/governmental officials and public relations practitioners is evident, as both provide information to the media free of charge without financial incentives/payments, as with advertisers.</p>
<p>Finally, the MIs also suggested that the measurement errors between the <italic>Agenda Building</italic> and <italic>Agenda Cutting</italic> measures were strongly related. This recommendation is facially valid and is likely the result of opposite question wording in the survey. For example, the first indicator, <italic>Agenda Building</italic>, was measured by asking questions about covering or emphasizing particular stories/topics (putting an item <italic>on</italic> the news agenda). The <italic>Agenda-Cutting</italic> measure, however, assessed just the opposite by asking questions about keeping stories/topics out of the news or <italic>off</italic> the news agenda. Therefore, a negative correlation between the items makes sense because both used the same type of questions but assessed opposing outcomes (i.e., cover vs. not cover).</p>
<p>Based upon the results and the suggested modifications from the initial run, the measurement model was respecified so the error terms between (1) the <italic>Staff Size Pressure Measure</italic> and <italic>Economic Pressure</italic>, (2) <italic>Political</italic> and <italic>PR Pressure</italic>, and (3) the <italic>Level of Agenda Building</italic> and the <italic>Level of Agenda Cutting</italic> were correlated.</p>
<p>The respecified measurement model showed major improvements over the initial model, χ<sup>2</sup>(35) = 107.199, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; CFI = .96; TLI = .94; SRMR = .0539; RMSEA = .08, <italic>p</italic>-close = .002, with the 90 percent confidence interval .065 to .100. Given the adequate fit of the measurement model, it was appropriate to proceed to the second stage of the two-step modeling process—evaluation of the full structural model.</p>

<title>Initial Model Testing: Evaluating the Modified Hypothesized Model</title>
<p>The hypothesized model was modified by implementing the suggested changes that surfaced in the measurement portion of the two-step modeling approach. This modified hypothesized model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1522637912444106">Figure 3</xref>. As with the measurement model, the revised hypothesized model was examined using the first subfile (<italic>n</italic> = 306), the exploratory data.

<title>Exploration and modification</title>
<p>Upon examination of the overall model’s output, it was clear that a few areas could be modified to improve model fit and explanation of the main dependent variable, Content Influence/Outcome. Two observations, in particular, stood out from the others in the output: the relationship between Extramedia Influences and Within-Media Influences and the location of Market Size within the model. All paths within the structural portion of the model were significant except for those between (1) Extramedia Influences and Within-Media Influences and (2) Market Size and Content Influence/Outcome. First, forces from outside the media (e.g., advertisers, public relations professionals, and political/governmental officials) do not appear to have a significant amount of <italic>direct</italic> influence over newsroom managers within media organizations, at least within the scope of the current study. Instead, it appears that Extramedia Influences does <italic>eventually</italic> affect influences within the media, but this relationship is first mediated by influences at the organizational level. As noted throughout the study, all references to influences at each level are based on reporters’ perceptions.</p>
<p>The second notable observation that emerged from the analysis involved the effect of Market Size on perceptions of influences on media content. As just mentioned, the path from Market Size to Content Influence/Outcome was nonsignificant, suggesting that the size of the market apparently does not have a <italic>direct</italic> effect on reporters’ perceptions of influences on media content—at least with this particular population. One option was to remove the Market Size variable from the model altogether. However, it did not seem likely that the size of the market would not have some sort of effect on reporters’ perceptions of content influences. Instead of removing the variable from the model, an alternative hypothesis was posed suggesting that Market Size would first have a direct effect on sources of influence outside the media (Extramedia Influences). That is, instead of Market Size having a <italic>direct</italic> influence on the dependent variable, the new hypothesis posited that it would directly affect reports of Extramedia Influences, thus having an <italic>indirect</italic> effect on Content Influence/Outcome. Specifically, it was expected that reporters working in larger markets would report overall fewer instances of attempted influences from extramedia sources. That is, a negative relationship between Market Size and Extramedia Influences was proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn188-1522637912444106">188</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two additional changes seemed logical as a result of the observations just mentioned. The first change involved the relationship between Extramedia and Organizational Influences. In the hypothesized model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1522637912444106">Figure 3</xref>), it was proposed that the influences at the extramedia and organizational levels (both independent variables before changes) would covary. In other words, no direct effects between the two variables were proposed. After moving the Market Size variable, however, this relationship was reconsidered—especially given that Extramedia Influences was no longer an exogenous variable. Thus, given the posited direct relationship between Market Size and Extramedia Influences, it made more sense to expect that those sources of Extramedia Influences would also have a direct effect on Organizational Influences. Rather than simply predicting that the variables changed together (covaried), a stronger hypothesis predicting a direct relationship was examined.</p>
<p>A second change was posited concerning the relationship between Organizational Influences and Content Influence/Outcome. Originally, influences at the organizational level were only proposed to affect reporters’ perceptions of influences on content indirectly (i.e., after “filtering through” influences within the media organization). After reconsideration of influences at the organizational level, it seemed logical that each of the measures (economic pressures, pressures from owners and top-level executives, and staff size pressures) could also <italic>directly</italic> affect reporters’ perceptions of content influences. Specifically, it was proposed that organizational influences could not only <italic>indirectly</italic> affect content by first influencing newsroom managers within the media organization, but they could also affect reporters’ perceptions of influences on content <italic>directly</italic>. Although it was not specifically suggested in the analysis output, the modification makes sound theoretical sense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn189-1522637912444106">189</xref></sup> For example, reporters may feel that station workers could easily avoid covering a particular story because of an inadequate staff size (staff size pressure), or because it may offend a company with economic clout over their station (economic pressure) or the general manager (owner/executive pressure). In other words, they do not necessarily have to wait for their news directors to tell them to do so. Instead, they may feel the pressure themselves and act accordingly.</p>
<p>Based on empirical modifications suggested from the analysis output and on theoretical and face validity justifications, the model was respecified so that (1) the path from Extramedia Influences to Within-Media Influences was omitted, (2) Market Size was hypothesized to have a direct effect on Extramedia Influences rather than Content Influence/Outcome, (3) the covariance from Extramedia Influences to Organizational Influences was changed to a direct path, and (4) Organizational Influences was hypothesized to have a direct effect on Content Influence/Outcome (not just Within-Media Influences).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn190-1522637912444106">190</xref></sup> The revised model showed improvement over the initial run of modified hypothesized model and indicated a fairly reasonable fit to the data, χ<sup>2</sup>(47) = 133.082, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; CFI = .96; TLI = .94; SRMR = .0575; RMSEA = .077, <italic>p</italic>-close = .002, with the 90 percent confidence interval .062 to .093. Although the chi-squared test statistic was significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(47) = 133.082, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, other fit indices suggested reasonable model fit (CFI = .96; TLI = .94; SRMR = .0575). Furthermore, the RMSEA value was within range of reasonable error of approximation, based on the traditional rules of thumb (RMSEA = .077),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn191-1522637912444106">191</xref></sup> even though its associated <italic>p</italic>-close statistic was significant (<italic>p</italic>-close =. 002).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn192-1522637912444106">192</xref></sup> Moreover, all standardized regression weights were significant, and the revised model accounted for 92 percent of the variance in the dependent variable, Content Influence/Outcome, thus providing additional support for the strength and validity of the model. Given that the interrelationships depicted in the model have not before been tested from the current, broader-range perspective, the model fit indices coupled with the total variance explained provide further validation that the model and the conceptualization of the variables and factors in this study represent a promising line of scholarship.</p>

<title>Final Model Assessment</title>
<p>Since the model was deemed to be an acceptable fit with the data in the exploratory subfile, it was re-evaluated using data from the remaining subfile (<italic>n</italic> = 306) that was withheld for the confirmatory portion of the analysis. Results indicated that the model was a fair representation of the withheld subfile, thus confirming the findings of the previous analysis, χ<sup>2</sup>(47) = 159.357, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; CFI = .94; TLI = .92; SRMR = .0679; RMSEA = .089, <italic>p</italic>-close &lt; .001, with the 90 percent confidence interval .074 to .104.</p>
<p>To provide additional validation, the model was retested using the full sample of 612 cases. The results from this analysis further confirmed that the model was an acceptable representation of the data, χ<sup>2</sup>(47) = 243.457, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; CFI = .95; TLI = .93; SRMR = .0572; RMSEA = .08, <italic>p</italic>-close &lt; .001, with the 90 percent confidence interval .073 to .093, based on many of the traditional rules of thumb for model fit.

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>This study examined television reporters’ perceptions of how sources both within and outside the media attempt to influence news content and coverage decisions. Specifically, how, how often, and under what conditions do external and internal forces attempt to influence television media and their coverage, and to what effect are they successful at doing so? To answer this question, this research used SEM to examine how market size, extramedia, organizational, and within-media forces influence television news content and coverage decisions using original data from a national web survey of television reporters. The influence outcomes considered in the study are the levels of agenda building, frame building, and agenda cutting. Specifically, the survey assessed reporters’ perceptions of the types and instances of influences faced by TV stations across the country, as well as their views of how these sources of pressure actually succeed in influencing news content.</p>
<sec id="section49-1522637912444106">
<title>Implications of the Influences on Media Content (IOMC) Model</title>
<p>In the 1990s, Shoemaker and Reese proposed their hierarchical model of influences depicting how the media’s content may be influenced on different levels, ranging from micro to macro, from forces both within and outside of news organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn193-1522637912444106">193</xref></sup> Some research has explored these different influence sources individually; however, no known research has studied how various influences may simultaneously affect news content decisions (i.e., from a panoramic perspective). Although Shoemaker and Reese’s diagram is a good basis on which to guide this type of scholarship, it is not a testable model. Furthermore, while much research has centered on how media content may affect audiences, fewer studies have taken a step back to consider who or what is influencing the media’s decisions—especially with regard to concurrently examining the three main influence outcomes considered in the current study (i.e., agenda building, frame building, and agenda cutting). As a result, some researchers have pointed out that more knowledge is needed about how and by whom the media agenda is set;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn194-1522637912444106">194</xref></sup> how and through what forces media frames are constructed;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn195-1522637912444106">195</xref></sup> and how and why certain news items are simply kept off, or cut out of, the media agenda.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn196-1522637912444106">196</xref></sup> Using the television industry as the foundation, this study addressed these gaps in the literature by offering a possible explanation of how news content and coverage decisions may be influenced by forces from both within and outside media organizations. The current research offers a unique perspective, as it considers how different potential forces of influence interact to ultimately affect news coverage. Specifically, the IOMC model illustrates how extramedia, organizational, and within-media influences interrelate to build, frame, and cut items on the news agenda, based on reporters’ perceptions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1522637912444106">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section50-1522637912444106">
<title>Market Size as a Moderating Influence</title>
<p>Market size was defined by reverse-coding the respondents’ designated market areas (DMAs). As previously mentioned, the television industry categorizes stations into DMAs, which are based on the size of the media markets in which they are located. These DMAs are classified by numbers—the largest-market stations hold the 1 to 25 spots, while the smaller-market stations are generally from 76 to more than 200. For clarity, this variable was reverse-coded so that larger DMA ranks represent larger (rather than smaller) markets, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The hypothesized model originally proposed that Market Size would have a direct effect on Influences on Content and Coverage Decisions, the main dependent variable of the study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1522637912444106">Figure 2</xref>). That is, it was initially presented as a control variable in the overall structural model. The particular placement in the model was based on previous research suggesting that smaller-market media may be more susceptible to influences on content because of poorer resources or smaller staff sizes with which to produce news, more pronounced economic constraints, or greater pressure from advertisers and other outside sources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn197-1522637912444106">197</xref></sup> Therefore, a negative effect was predicted, indicating that respondents from smaller-market stations would report more instances of influences on content. Exploratory model testing, however, indicated that this proposed relationship was nonsignificant, and it was suggested that size of the respondents’ market had a stronger, more direct negative influence on the Extramedia Influences construct.</p>
<p>Simply put, reporters from smaller DMAs perceived more instances of pressures from outside sources, which, for the purposes of the current study, are advertisers, public relations, and political pressures. Market size did ultimately influence reporters’ perceptions of overall influences on news content and coverage decisions, but it did so <italic>indirectly</italic>. That is, it first affected reporters’ perceptions of influence at the Extramedia level, followed by additional negative relationships at the Organizational and Within-Media Influences levels. In other words, reporters from <italic>smaller</italic> markets perceived <italic>more</italic> instances of pressures from Extramedia sources, as well as <italic>more</italic> accounts of Organizational and Within-Media pressures. These relationships ultimately resulted in <italic>more</italic> instances of overall influences on content, based on reporters’ perceptions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1522637912444106">Table 4</xref>). This finding is logical, especially given evidence from previous research regarding advertiser pressures in small markets. For instance, An and Bergen surveyed advertising directors at daily newspapers and presented them with four ethical scenarios regarding demands from advertisers. They found that directors from the smaller papers were more likely to bow to advertiser pressure and favor content that presented these advertisers in a positive light, thereby avoiding the possibility of offending these revenue generators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn198-1522637912444106">198</xref></sup> Similarly, Soley and Craig found that, although there was no disparity between small versus large circulation papers in terms of <italic>amounts of advertiser pressures</italic>, advertisers were more likely <italic>to succeed in influencing</italic> content at the smaller papers. Editors at the smaller papers also reported significantly more instances of in-house pressures to produce content to please advertisers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn199-1522637912444106">199</xref></sup> In short, market size eventually affected reporters’ perceptions of overall influences on content, but this relationship was first mediated by all other constructs in the model.</p>

<p>Note: The table shows the direct, indirect, and total effects that the first variable in a row has on the other variable in the same row. The numbers in the table are interpreted as path coefficients. Direct effects represent how one variable <italic>directly</italic> affects another variable in the model. For example, the direct effect of Organizational Influences (ninth row) on Content Influence/Outcome is .447. Organizational Influences also has an indirect (mediating) effect on Content Influence/Outcome. That is, it also first affects Within-Media Influences and then affects Content Influence/Outcome. Thus, it has a mediating effect of .399. Indirect effects are estimated as the product of the direct effects that include them. In this case, Organizational → Within-Media = .679 and Within-Media → Content Influence/Outcome = .587, so .679 × .587 = .399. The total effects column represents the sum of all direct and indirect effects of one variable on another in each of the rows listed in the table. Therefore, the total effect of Organizational Influences on Content Influence/Outcome is .846. The result indicates that Content Influence/Outcome is expected to increase by .846 for each standard deviation change in Organizational Influences via all direct and indirect causal paths between these variables (.447 direct effect + .399 indirect effect = .846 total effect).</p>

<title>The Relationship between Extramedia Influences and Within-Media Influences</title>
<p>The original hypothesized model proposed that Extramedia Influences would directly affect influences within the media organization (Within-Media), which are measured by direct and indirect pressures from newsroom management (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1522637912444106">Figure 2</xref>). Although Shoemaker and Reese’s hierarchical model did not specifically incorporate a “Within-Media Influences” level, which was created for the current study using some of the authors’ concepts, it was expected that the construct would exhibit similar process behavior as suggested by the concurrent influence flow among the levels in the “onion” diagram. In other words, it was speculated that the pressure flow from the Extramedia to the Within-Media level would not be a strictly linear one—that is, from Extramedia to Organizational and, finally, to Within-Media. Instead, it was posited that influences at the Extramedia level would also have a <italic>direct</italic> effect on influences within the media organization.</p>
<p>Exploratory model testing suggested that Extramedia Influences did <italic>eventually</italic> affect influences within the media, but the relationship was first mediated by pressures at the Organizational level. That is, forces from outside the media (e.g., advertisers, public relations professionals, and political/governmental officials) do not appear to have a significant amount of <italic>direct</italic> influence over newsroom managers within media organizations, at least within the scope of the current study. Instead, it seems that influences from the Extramedia level are first mediated by forces at the Organizational level and then passed on to managers within the news organization itself. These findings suggest that more pressures from forces outside the media organization correspond with greater pressures at the Organizational level, which are then passed on to Within-Media Influences and eventually to content decisions.</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that lack of a direct link between the Extramedia and Within-Media levels does not mean that those working outside the media should head straight to top-level executives and owners at the Organizational level to get their particular messages across. For example, a public relations practitioner does not necessarily need to phone and send his or her broadcast news release (BNR) to a TV station <italic>owner</italic> in an attempt to earn coverage. Strictly evaluating the results in this manner is a consequence of looking at only one small piece of a larger structure. <italic>Public relations pressure</italic> is only one measure of Extramedia Influence, and it should be interpreted as such. Instead, the findings indicate that pressures at the Extramedia level are more strongly, and significantly, related to increased influences at the Organizational level. In other words, they exhibit a stronger association to reporters’ perceptions of increased economic pressures, views that inadequate staff size would have a detrimental effect on the news, and more accounts of pressures from owners and top-level executives. Recall that influences within the media is represented by two measures, direct and indirect newsroom management pressures. Consequently, the nonsignificant relationship between the Extramedia and Within-Media Influences constructs merely suggests that forces outside the media do not have a notable direct influence on <italic>newsroom managers</italic>, within the scope of the current study.</p>
<p>A likely explanation for the lack of a direct relationship between the two previously mentioned constructs stems from the fact that influences and actions from the reporters themselves were not considered as a measure for pressures within the media organization. Including such a measure might have allowed for a direct relationship; however, it was not included in this project for sound reasons. Since the survey contained somewhat sensitive information regarding the profession and the industry, this study went to great lengths to obtain candid responses with which to assess influences and outcomes on content. Reporters were specifically chosen, as opposed to news directors, because they were viewed as more likely to give candid responses since they are further removed from the business side of news operations. Moreover, reporters’ transient nature was expected to increase the likelihood that they would not cater their answers to protect the views of their current news organization, which were likely to seep into their perceptions of the industry as a whole. Asking sensitive information concerning their fellow frontline journalists—not simply about advertisers, owners and top-level executives, newsroom managers, or “TV stations in general”—had the potential to offend these respondents and, in turn, alter their answers to the survey questions. Therefore, asking these questions was not worth the risk—at least for this project, as it was partially used to build a strong base on which to build future studies. Future research, however, should consider including this measure to determine if it has a significant direct effect on the relationship between Extramedia and Within-Media Influences.</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence and scholarly literature support both the Extramedia Influences level’s indirect relationship with influences within the news organization (Within-Media), as well as its direct link with pressures at the Organizational level. Further discussion of the direct link between Extramedia and Organizationl Influences, which was originally represented as a simple covariance, is provided in the subsection that follows.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section52-1522637912444106">
<title>The Relationship between Extramedia and Organizational Influences</title>
<p>For the current study, Organizational Influences was represented by three measures: economic, owner/executive, and staff size pressures. Initially, the hypothesized model proposed that there would simply be some kind of relationship between the Extramedia and Organizational Influences constructs—that the two constructs would covary (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1522637912444106">Figure 2</xref>). In other words, more instances of pressures from forces outside the media would correspond with more pressures from organizational sources, and vice versa. As discussed, exploratory model testing suggested a stronger relationship indicating a <italic>direct</italic> relationship from influences at the Extramedia level to increased pressures at the Organizational level, rather than a simple covariance. This change was incorporated based on the computer output during the exploratory phase, as well as the logical assumption that increases in the amount of Extramedia Influences (advertiser, public relations, and political pressures) would lead to greater levels of Organizational Influences—increased perceptions of economic pressures, views that inadequate staff size would have a detrimental effect on the news, and more accounts of pressures from owners and top-level executives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn200-1522637912444106">200</xref></sup> The direct connection between the two constructs is, perhaps, best explained by discussing the relationship in terms of the constructs’ respective measures.</p>
<p>The finding that the Extramedia Influences construct has a direct effect on those pressures at the Organizational level is a logical one, and it is especially evident when the relationship is delineated with regard to the constructs’ measures. One rationalization involves economic pressure, a measure of Organizational Influences. Reporters’ perceptions of more pressures from Extramedia Influences correspond with perceptions of more economic pressure. For example, pressures from advertisers likely lead to more instances of financial and economic pressures, based on reporters’ perceptions. Furthermore, reporters who perceive more instances of Extramedia Influences also seem to identify more detrimental effects resulting from reduced or inadequate staff size (staff size pressure). For instance, respondents who report more instances of PR and political pressures, both measures of Extramedia Influences, also appear to view inadequate staff size as being a negative for news organizations. In other words, this explanation indicates a positive relationship because more instances of Extramedia pressures lead to more reporters agreeing that reduced or an inadequate staff size is a negative characteristic for stations. This reasoning falls in line with previous research that suggests that a smaller staff size typically corresponds with using more information subsidies, which are generally provided by public relations practitioners and public affairs offices for government officials.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn201-1522637912444106">201</xref></sup> In addition to logical reasoning that supports the stronger direct link, evidence in the literature also helps to validate this finding.</p>
<p>Top media executives are often board members of other major companies on which their news organizations rely for advertising. Therefore, they are likely subjected to a certain amount of pressure, especially if their news organization is running a controversial story about these other institutions of which they are members. As a result of these pressures, the executive might exert her or his authoritative power down the ranks to kill a story. Shoemaker and Reese offer an example of a related incident at ABC News where a reporting team uncovered “scandalous conditions at nursing homes owned by Charles Wick, a friend of President Reagan.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn202-1522637912444106">202</xref></sup> Ultimately the story did not air because the producers were told it was not newsworthy. It appears, although not clearly proved in this case, that forces outside news organizations can influence executive decision making and, therefore, influence media content. This particular example provides anecdotal support for the direct relationship between forces at the Extramedia and Organizational levels, as well as the more elaborate connection between all constructs/sources of influence in the model (i.e., Extramedia → Organizational → Within-Media → Content Influence/Outcome).</p>
<p>Another example, this time involving NBC, provides relative support for the finding that forces outside the media affect those at the Organizational level. During the opening ceremony of the 1996 Olympics, NBC’s Bob Costas referred to U.S.-China tensions, including China’s “problems with human rights” and “property rights disputes.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn203-1522637912444106">203</xref></sup> China’s governmental officials and state-run news media voiced their displeasure for the remarks, and NBC promptly issued an apology. The news organization is owned by General Electric Company, which, according to a <italic>New York Times</italic> article, is “one of the largest foreign industrial enterprises in China, with hundreds of millions of dollars invested in areas such as lighting, plastics and medical equipment.” When an NBC Sports vice president was questioned about these corporate interests and their involvement in the decision to issue the apology, he claimed that they were not considered, “not as far as I was concerned.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn204-1522637912444106">204</xref></sup> This example provides at least some tangential support for the finding that forces outside the media—in this cases political/governmental officials—may have a direct affect on those at the Organizational level—here, owners and top-level executives.</p>
<p>In summary, although a covariance relationship was originally proposed and supported, face validity and exploratory model testing confirmed an even stronger <italic>direct</italic> relationship between the Extramedia and Organizational Influences constructs, thus providing both an improved explanation of the overall model and a better foundation with which to build future research. Future research should further examine this relationship, as well as a possible inverse relationship between the two (i.e., the possibility that Organizational Influences may also directly affect forces at the Extramedia level).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section53-1522637912444106">
<title>The Relationship between Organizational and Within-Media Influences</title>
<p>The hypothesized IOMC model proposed that Organizational Influences would have a direct influence on sources of influences within the media organization. Model testing confirmed this relationship, suggesting that the greater instances of pressures at the Organizational level lead to increased amounts of influence at the Within-Media level, which is measured by direct and indirect pressures from newsroom management.</p>
<p>This finding provides evidence for the argument that forces at the Organizational level—owner/executive, economic, and opinions on staff size pressures—exhibit a direct influence over sources of influence within the news organization (newsroom managers). Thus, the significant link supports prior contentions long held by media critics such as Ben Bagdikian and Robert McChesney that media owners have an influence on news organizations and, in turn, media content.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn205-1522637912444106">205</xref></sup> Likewise, it provides further credence to Shoemaker and Reese’s claim that “media owners have an unmistakable impact on media content because they [establish] policy for the entire organization.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn206-1522637912444106">206</xref></sup> McManus also alluded to the relationship between the Organizational and Within-Media levels. He contended “management has a legal responsibility to serve the economic interest of owners.” Therefore, newsroom managers may exert pressure on journalists to uphold these interests. The direct relationship also falls in line with previous research suggesting that the financial interests of owners can affect the amount of news coverage, as well as the tone of both hard-news coverage<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn207-1522637912444106">207</xref></sup> and editorials.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn208-1522637912444106">208</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although owner and executive pressure is just one measure of influence at the Organizational level, other literature dealing with reporters’ perceptions of economic pressure further substantiates the direct link between the Organizational and Within-Media Influences constructs. For example, McManus called attention to economic pressures in his explanation of market-driven journalism, in which he remarked that media organizations are a part of a “market-based economy” competing in four different markets—investors, advertisers, sources of news, and consumers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn209-1522637912444106">209</xref></sup> He argued that these investors, or owners, are the most influential in the production of news because they are a part of the corporate structure, while the other three markets must externally exert their influence. Since the investors appear to have the strongest influence in media organizations, according to McManus’s model, news workers, including newsroom managers within the news organization itself, may feel economic and bottom-line pressures from these owners or from the top-level executives who are relaying the messages. Thus, more instances of pressures at the Organizational level lead to greater pressures and influences within the media organization. Testing additional measures would only serve to further elucidate our current understanding of influences at the Organizational and Within-Media levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section54-1522637912444106">
<title>The Relationship between Within-Media Influences and Overall Content Influence</title>
<p>As indicated in the IOMC model, Within-Media Influences was the main mediator of the IOMC model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1522637912444106">Figure 4</xref>). More simply put, it was the construct that all other influences in the model passed through before reaching Influences and Outcomes on Content and Coverage Decisions, the main dependent variable of the study. A central implication for the study is that higher levels of Extramedia and Organizational pressures have a significant influence, whether direct or indirect, on forces within the news organization (Within-Media). The IOMC model also suggests that these Within-Media Influences are then directly related to reporters’ perceptions of Influences on News Content and Coverage Decisions, which is measured by the level of (1) agenda building, (2) frame building, and (3) agenda cutting. That is, more reports of influences and pressures within the media organization lead to more instances of influences on news content, based on reporters’ perceptions.</p>
<p>From a professional perspective, this finding could serve as the starting point for creating innovative newsroom policy and guidelines of how to deal with such situations of attempted influence when they arise. At the very least, implications from this portion of the IOMC model could provide a basis on which to facilitate newsroom dialogue about these issues. Potential influences on news workers have brought newsroom ethics to the front line of debates, especially with regard to how news content is affected. Since news people are continually faced with competing loyalties, they potentially deal with such issues on a regular basis. Therefore, these discussions are especially important today with even more concern over the bottom line, which seems particularly pronounced in the television industry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn210-1522637912444106">210</xref></sup></p>
<p>From another professional standpoint, the finding should be of use to those making management hiring decisions for news organizations. Since, as the results show, newsroom managers have a direct influence on news content and coverage decisions, they should exercise this influence with the public interest in mind. Therefore, the study illuminates the need to assess and hire potential management candidates based on journalistic training, previous journalistic experience, and their track record with regard to running a newsroom and, perhaps, abiding by journalistic ethical standards. In turn, the managers might be less likely to bow to unfavorable pressures from forces at the Extramedia and Organizational levels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn211-1522637912444106">211</xref></sup></p>
<p>The role of an ombudsman or public editor might also be considered. Instead of sources of attempted influences going straight to newsroom management or reporters, these “mediators” could be experiencing the brunt of these pressures. Future research should consider people serving in this position as possible sources of qualitative information on the subject of influences and outcomes on news content. Furthermore, the role of an ombudsman is also important to investigate, as they can also use their position to inform the public about the means by which their respective newsrooms deal with attempted pressures from forces such as advertisers, owners, and government officials. Doing so could help news organizations rebuild and maintain trust with the public and possibly attract more readers and viewers.</p>
<p>The finding also offers important implications with regard to media theory, explicitly concerning its relevance to Social Control of the Newsroom studies. As discussed, Within-Media Influences was measured by direct and indirect management pressures. Briefly, direct management pressures were assessed through survey questions asking reporters how often they believed newsroom managers/superiors within a TV station provide clear instructions or directly tell reporters what to cover, how to cover it, or what <italic>not</italic> to cover. Indirect management pressures, on the other hand, involve suggesting particular story topics or angles through more subtle means, such as yawning at or making fun of a story idea, or showing disinterest by not airing a reporters’ story. According to Breed’s argument, if these actions are repeated over time, journalists become socialized to cover (or not cover) a story in the manner suggested by their superiors, but they do so at their own discretion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn212-1522637912444106">212</xref></sup> Although Breed observed that the hidden norms and routines (the <italic>indirect</italic> form of management pressures) seem to be the more powerful force in the newsroom, they are not afforded as much attention in scholarship as <italic>direct</italic> means of communicating. This inattention is likely due to the difficulty in defining, measuring, and analyzing these covert influence signals.</p>
<p>This monograph, however, provides both the measures and results by which to better explain this important area of newsroom culture. Although this research examines these direct and indirect forms of control through the larger lens of an overall model of content influences and outcomes, it provides a rich source of information for future studies examining this particular area in more detail. Specifically, the information and results gathered in the study have the potential to make a significant contribution to media scholarship by providing a much-needed update of the prior Social Control of the Newsroom studies, particularly with regard to the indirect, or hidden, areas of socialization.</p>

<sec id="section55-1522637912444106">
<title>The Link between Organizational Influences and Overall Content Influences</title>
<p>Originally, the hypothesized model posited that influences at the Organizational level were only expected to affect reporters’ perceptions of influences on content indirectly. That is, after they “filtered through” influences within the media organization (Within-Media Influences). After initial exploratory model testing, this notion was reconsidered, as it seemed logical that each of the measures (economic pressures, pressures from owners and top-level executives, and staff size pressures) could <italic>directly</italic> affect reporters’ perceptions of content influences. Specifically, it was proposed that Organizational Influences could not only <italic>indirectly</italic> affect content by first influencing newsroom managers within the media organization, but they could also affect reporters’ perceptions of influences on content <italic>directly</italic>. Although it was not specifically suggested in the analysis output, the modification makes sound theoretical and logical sense. For example, reporters may feel that station workers could easily avoid covering a particular story because of an inadequate staff size (staff size pressure), or because it may offend a company with economic clout over their station (economic pressure) or the station manager (owner/executive pressure). In other words, news workers do not necessarily have to wait for their news directors to tell them to do so. Instead, they may feel the pressure themselves and act accordingly. Simply put, they may have been socialized to accept that responsibility and self-edit.</p>
<p>Previous survey results provide additional support for the direct relationship. For example, a 2000 survey by Pew Research Center found that 42 percent of local journalists and 25 percent of those working for national stations believed that journalists sometimes purposely avoid covering certain stories that they believe are truly newsworthy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn213-1522637912444106">213</xref></sup> Of those respondents, an average of 21 percent (16 percent national and 26 percent local) answered that these journalists typically decide to avoid these stories on their own. That is, the decision is made without basing their decision on (1) how they believe their bosses would respond, (2) signals from their bosses, or (3) some other reason. In particular, these two survey questions inadvertently concern one of the Content Influence/Outcome measures of the present study: the level of agenda cutting. Still, the Pew survey responses have broader implications, indicating that news workers do not necessarily wait for their newsroom managers/superiors to tell them to cover or emphasize a particular topic, cover it from a particular angle, or avoid covering a topic altogether.</p>
<p>In the same survey, journalists were also asked their opinions as to what extent corporate owners influence news organizations’ decisions about which stories to cover or emphasize. Notice the question deals with one of the Organizational Influence measures considered in this monograph (i.e., owner pressures) as well as one of the Content Influence/Outcome indicators (i.e., agenda building). One-third of the national journalists and half of the local journalists surveyed reported that corporate owners influence news outlets’ decisions of the stories to cover or emphasize “a great deal” or “a fair amount.” Thus, these results provide additional backing for the direct link between the Organizational and Content Influence/Outcome constructs, as influences from newsroom managers within the organization are not considered.</p>
<p>One final illustration from the same Pew Research Center survey offers added validation for the direct link. Respondents were provided a series of reasons for purposely avoiding truly newsworthy stories, and they were asked how often they thought journalists they know avoid stories based on the reasons given. Forty-four percent of the journalists working for local stations said that journalists they know would “commonly” or “sometimes” avoid stories if it would be embarrassing or damaging to the financial interests of a news organization’s owners or parent company.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn214-1522637912444106">214</xref></sup> Furthermore, more than one-third of the local journalists reported that journalists they know would “commonly” or “sometimes” avoid stories that would be embarrassing or damaging to friends or associates of a news organization’s owners. These particular questions involve two measures of Organizational Influences that were used in the current study (i.e., economic pressures and pressures concerning owners), and they also assess how journalists would make coverage decisions on their own accord (i.e., without direction from newsroom superiors). Thus, these Pew survey results also provide support for the Organizational Influences’ direct relationship with news organizations’ Influences on News Content and Coverage Decisions.</p>

<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>One of the most important contributions of the IOMC model and this monograph is that it provides a higher-level, overall perspective of how forces both within and outside the media may attempt to, and succeed at, influencing news content and coverage decisions. This type of research is especially pertinent in the current media landscape where news workers are faced with multiple competing loyalties, which are at least partially due to increased economic constraints and bottom-line pressures. In the television industry, which was the current project’s focus, news content and coverage decisions appear to be influenced by forces outside the media, those at the organizational level, and sources within the news organization itself. Market size also played a role in the overall model; however, it did not directly affect the level of influences on news content. Instead, it was more strongly related to reporters’ perceptions of the amount of extramedia influences. The final validated model clarifies how all of the influence levels interrelate to eventually affect media content and coverage decisions. First, it suggests that forces outside the media (Extramedia Influences) directly affect influences at the Organizational level. These organizational forces, in turn, directly influence sources within the media organization (Within-Media Influences) and, finally, news content itself, based on reporters’ perceptions. Forces at the Organizational level also exhibit a direct influence on content and coverage decisions. That is, they are not always just mediated by (or filtered through) influences from newsroom managers, which are a source of measure at the Within-Media level. Findings from the final validation on the full data set (<italic>n</italic> = 612) suggested that the IOMC model explained 90 percent of variance of the dependent variable, Influences on News Content and Coverage Decisions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1522637912444106">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the most important contributions of this study is its inclusion of and support for agenda cutting as a theoretical approach. Briefly, agenda cutting may occur when an item is (1) placed low on the news agenda (buried), (2) removed from the agenda once it is there, or (3) ignored because it was never put on the news agenda in the first place. The process is proposed to occur because of logistical constraints, external and internal influences, and/or journalists’ own prejudices. The current research found that the process was most likely to occur because of external and internal influences. As indicated by the significance of all the paths in the model (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1522637912444106">Table 2</xref>), particularly by the significant path and high regression weight (.89) and error variance (.79) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1522637912444106">Figure 4</xref>, this study provides strong support for the existence of agenda cutting, as well as validation for its use as a theoretical approach in media scholarship and beyond. Inclusion of agenda cutting as a pertinent area of research only serves to deepen our understanding of influences and outcomes on content.</p>
<p>Specifically, agenda cutting could be thought of as a branch of agenda building and agenda setting. It is important to point out, however, that it is not simply <italic>the opposite of agenda setting</italic>. Instead, it appears that the reasons for its occurrence are different and perhaps even more complex because the involved forces may have a different motives and intentions for keeping an item out of the news. This area shows promise for several areas, including the business sector, but it should be of particular interest to those studying advertising, public relations and strategic communication, media economics, media ownership, political communication, and censorship.</p>
<p>Examining agenda cutting from a media-effects perspective is also an important area to consider for future researchers. If an item is not covered or is placed low on the news agenda, the public may be unaware of important societal issues. In turn, this cutting function may affect how people view and participate in their social structures. Thus, future research should also examine the role audiences and how they are affected. Measuring audience effects on an issue that the researcher may not know is being cut at the time of study, however, presents a possible problem—unless the researcher has a predesigned survey on hand to be sent out with the cut topic inserted at last minute. As a result, the best way for audience effects to be assessed is likely through experimental research in which participants are presented with altered media products (e.g., print, broadcast, and web) and then given a questionnaire with knowledge items.</p>
<p>Another notable implication of the model is that the influence process may be more linear than previously suggested by Shoemaker and Reese, at least within the scope of the present study. This claim is illustrated by the simple, nondivergent paths among most of the constructs in the model (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1522637912444106">Figure 4</xref>). The only relationship that breaks away from this linear process in the IOMC model is the direct link between the Organizational Influences and Content Influence/Outcome constructs. More simply put, this relationship was the only one in the model that did not travel down the chain of influences (i.e., from Extramedia to Organizational to Within-Media and finally to Influence/Outcome on Content). Future studies should further examine the process to determine whether these relationships hold true.</p>
<p>As discussed, Extramedia Influences was found to have a direct effect on influences at the Organizational level during model testing. Future research should also examine if the inverse might also be true—Organizational Influences affecting influences at the Extramedia level. Previous research provides some related support for examining this possible relationship in a future project. For example, Hasen stated his case in the <italic>Texas Law Review</italic> opposing the media exception to campaign finance laws, which provides support for the reciprocal relationship between the extramedia and organizational levels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn215-1522637912444106">215</xref></sup> In one part of the argument, he used a public choice/egalitarian pluralist model to speculate that media owners use their company’s political endorsements to secure access to public officials and further influence their own interests. Hasen further suggested that political influence may be a strong motivator to own media organizations and that those owners could use the companies to influence public opinion for their own self-interests. Such self-interests could include political favors, gaining or maintaining access to candidates, or influencing principled decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn216-1522637912444106">216</xref></sup> Hasen’s argument, then, implies that media owners are susceptible to outside pressures that could, in turn, affect content. Supporting this implication, Shoemaker and Reese have suggested that even though top-level media executives may not often attempt to influence specific news stories, “they may do so under pressure from leaders of other powerful institutions.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn217-1522637912444106">217</xref></sup> Conversely, Hasen’s argument also implies that media owners may exert pressure on outside organizations, including political institutions, by donating money to support campaigns to further their own interests.</p>
<p>One potential drawback to this study’s overall findings is the fact the sample more heavily represented reporters from larger markets. Although respondents were not specifically questioned regarding their <italic>own</italic> stations, which would be situated in these markets, there is a chance that their responses might be based on views of their own news organizations. Since a fairly large number of cases was required as this project used a model-building approach, stratification was not possible because a 30 percent response rate was required to attain the appropriate number of cases needed for the analysis. AMOS does not allow for weighted cases, so that attempt of correcting for disparate market sizes was not permitted. Since researchers now have a tested model on which to base their research, they should be able to stratify to provide a more balanced market area that better matches the population under study.</p>
<p>Although the IOMC model appears to be an accurate representation of the data collected for the study, it is important to point out that there may also be other models that that describe these news content influences and outcomes. In other words, the validated model is not necessarily the final word when it comes to explaining the processes outlined in the study. There may also be competing models that provide an equally appropriate, or a stronger, explanation. To be sure, future research should further examine this area, as well as evaluate the current model with regard to other media, such as the newspaper industry or online news media. Yet even with the possible limitations just discussed, there is no reason to refute the IOMC model or its findings, especially since it was perhaps the first attempt at testing content influences and outcomes from a panoramic perspective, and because it serves as a base model for future scholarship.</p>
<p>Future researchers are particularly challenged to examine social media, including Twitter, YouTube, blogs, and Facebook, to determine the influence these sources have on traditional media content. It is expected that these sources play an integral part in building and framing, and potentially cutting, the media’s agenda. Although not included in the current study because these sources were not as widely used at the time, including this type of influence as another construct in the model in future studies is imperative because of their popularity and wide use today. Doing so will fill in more pieces to the influence model to help us better understand the forces at play when constructing the news. In addition to examining these intermedia agenda-setting effects of new media, future should also consider prominent national media as another possible influence source.</p>
<p>Beyond the implications from the analysis, this study also has strengths and weaknesses with regard to the data-analysis techniques and the use of survey data. As mentioned, SEM is a powerful multivariate technique that can be considered a combination and/or extension of multiple regression, path analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis. It is more useful and powerful than conventional statistical approaches because it can (1) assess or correct for measurement error;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn218-1522637912444106">218</xref></sup> (2) incorporate both observed variables and latent (factors) variables, the latter of which is measured by observed indicators;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn219-1522637912444106">219</xref></sup> and (3) consider modeling of correlated errors, interrelations, and interactions/mediation effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn220-1522637912444106">220</xref></sup> SEM is also an <italic>a priori</italic> approach, which means that the hypotheses of the project must be specified beforehand based on previous research and/or theory. Therefore, the technique can be used to test theory. Yet despite its strengths, the method cannot necessarily establish true cause and effect because it is based on correlational data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn221-1522637912444106">221</xref></sup></p>
<p>The web survey in the study presents its own advantages and drawbacks. One advantage of conducting a survey via the Web is that it allows for a quick response. This fast-paced form of answering questions is especially important for television journalists working in busy newsrooms. This method also allowed for more privacy than other survey techniques, such as phone questionnaires, because it could be taken from any available computer, not just one used at work. Another advantage of the survey used in the present study is that it was sent to reporters—the frontline news people—rather than managers or executives. As mentioned, reporters were chosen for several reasons, including their likelihood of giving more candid responses because (1) they are further removed from the business side of news operations<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn222-1522637912444106">222</xref></sup> and (2) the transient nature of the profession increases the chances that they will not cater their answers to show loyalty to and/or protection for their current news organization. Furthermore, reporters are also less likely to be bombarded by surveys and are less likely to suffer from survey fatigue than news directors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn223-1522637912444106">223</xref></sup> Still, this survey is not without its disadvantages, as it only provides cross-sectional data. In other words, it only offers a snapshot of reporters’ perceptions of the television industry at the time it was administered. Since much of the survey research in the social sciences is based on cross-sectional data, future researchers would be wise to gather consistent data over time as well (i.e., a longitudinal approach).</p>
<p>Overall, the findings from this study should also be valuable to those working in public relations, advertising, and the government because they shed light on how, how often, and under what conditions these professionals’ communications strategies are most effective. As a result, this research may help professionals in these areas alter these strategies accordingly to ensure that they are using their resources most efficiently.</p>
<p>The findings from this project also provide valuable information for policy makers who deal with such issues as ownership (de)regulation, political involvement, and advertising. With the major deregulation from the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the more current debates surrounding media ownership, a comprehensive model of potential influences on media content may be useful in making decisions about industry guidelines with regards to these issues. This study has strong theoretical implications for academics, as it provides information to advance theory with regard to agenda- and frame-building research, social control of the newsroom studies, as well as the development of agenda cutting. The advancement of these areas should also be useful to professionals, especially those in public relations and advertising, because the theories apply to strategic communication.</p>

<p>Sweeps periods, which occur four times per year, measure ratings simultaneously in all 210 local television markets in the nation. The data from the ratings surveys are used to set local advertising rates, among other things. Thus, during this time stations often air dramatic themes or events in their sitcoms or focus on titillating news stories, such as investigative pieces, to attract more viewers. For 2007, February sweeps ran from February 1 through February 28. As mentioned earlier, the survey was launched on February 15 and was closed on March 14.</p>

<p>Originally, five questions were posed to assess instances of pressures from public relations practitioners. Two questions, however, were found to reduce the reliability and internal consistency of the scale. After careful review of all scale questions, the two questions were found inappropriate to group with the other scale items because one was used to measure the station’s actual <italic>use</italic> of VNRs and the other was used to measure how often the stations <italic>received</italic> them.

<p>Seven questions were originally used to assess political/governmental official pressures. Two of the questions found to reduce the slightly reduce reliability and internal consistency of the scale because they seemed to be assessing different aspects of political pressures (seven-item alpha = .784). After further review of the questions, the researcher decided to remove these items from the scale to improve reliability, especially because the squared multiple correlations were much lower than the others. They were, however, retained for use in future studies. Another scale item, question 25, had a lower squared multiple correlation than the other four items in the revised scale, but it was retained because (1) reliability was still high with its inclusion and, more importantly, (2) it measured a different aspect of political/governmental pressures than the other items.

After closer inspection, this item was found to be different from the others in that it was more of a general, sweeping question. In contrast, the others assessed more specific instances of owner/executive pressures. Given this information, the item was omitted from the scale.</p>

<p>Past literature has suggested that smaller-market media may be more susceptible to advertising influences. For example, see Soley and Craig, “Advertising Pressures on Newspapers”; and Hays and Reisner, “Feeling the Heat from Advertisers.” On the other hand, larger-market media may be more likely to face political pressures. This is because as a media organization becomes more concentrated, which is typically associated with larger markets, the owners or executives may become have stronger social ties with some outside company, as noted by Shoemaker and Reese. Connections with politicians and governmental officials may also be included. Still, these types of potential influences have not been closely examined.</p>

<p>The measurement model consists of the latent constructs and their respective indicators, basically CFAs, while the structural portion is made up of the paths among the latent constructs. Assessing the model after it is respecified as CFAs is done by (1) examining the factor loadings to ensure that all paths (from the latent constructs to the measured indicators) are significant, (2) reviewing the covariance coefficients, and (3) assessing model fit using the same type of goodness-of-fit indices and measures that are used to evaluate the proposed model. If the measurement model is found to be a poor fit to the data, it should be respecified using the same procedures implemented when modifying a full model (i.e., modification indices, theory, and previous research).</p>

<p>Mardi’s coefficient can be interpreted as a <italic>z</italic>-score, which means that the current data set is approximately 7 standard deviations from the mean (as opposed to the traditional cutoff of 3 for outliers and extreme values). Larger data sets, however, can actually inflate the magnitude of this value.

<p>Originally, there was another measured indicator that was included in the model, a Level of Concentration Index that was one of the measures of Organizational Influence, and the Staff Size Pressure measure was an indicator of Within-Media Influence. Inspection of the measurement portion of the model found a few problems with these classifications. First, the loading of the <italic>Level of Concentration Index</italic> onto the Organizational Influences factor was low (.08) and nonsignificant (<italic>p</italic> = .224). Since this particular index was not tested or suggested in previous research and the correlation residuals of this indicator with those of other factors were not substantial, it was decided to omit the measure from the model. Second, it was found that, although significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), the <italic>Staff Size Pressure Measure</italic> loading onto the Within-Media Influences factor was fairly low (.19). Although it seemed facially valid to associate this indicator with influences within the media organization, previous researchers (e.g., Shoemaker and Reese; and Fico and Cote) have considered measures associated with staff size as organizational-level constraints. Therefore, instead of associating the <italic>Staff Size Pressure Measure</italic> with Within-Media Influences, as originally proposed, it was posited that it would be more strongly associated with Organizational Influences, as indicated in previous research. Another run of the measurement model confirmed this change, as the indicator loaded higher on the Organizational Influences factor (.22). This information is not included in the body of the monograph due to space limitations. All changes were made with the first subfile that was used for exploration of the model. For example, see Shoemaker and Reese, <italic>Mediating the Message</italic>, 139–73; Frederick Fico and William Cote, “Partisan and Structural Balance of Election Stories on the 1998 Governor’s Race in Michigan,” <italic>Mass Communication &amp; Society</italic> 5, no. 2 (spring 2002): 165–82.</p>

<p>Recall that Market Size is measured by Designated Market Areas (DMAs). With DMAs, the smaller the number the larger the media market (e.g., the 1–25 markets are the largest). For the current study, however, DMAs were reverse-coded so the larger numbers would correspond with the larger media markets, and vice versa. This approach was taken to avoid confusion for both the researcher and the reader.</p>

<p>For example, Shoemaker and Reese have long indicated that the influence process is not a linear one. That is, influences do not have to move straight down the hierarchy (e.g., from ideological to extramedia to organizational to media routines to individual). Instead, gatekeepers at the different levels of the hierarchical model, the diagram on which the current model is partially based, have the ability to affect many different areas/levels simultaneously—not just those down the chain, so to speak.</p>

<p>The significance here, however, is due to the lower bound of the 90 percent confidence interval falling above .05; the appropriate range is ≤ .05 for the lower bound and ≤ .10 for the upper bound.

<p>The term “unfavorable” is used here because not all pressures to run content are necessarily harmful attempts at slanting the news. For example, information from a public relations professional working for a nonprofit could be useful for both the news outlet and the nonprofit organization. The PR practitioner provides information about a particular service by the organization, and the news outlet could then relay this useful information to its audience. Therefore, all parties benefit from this exchange of information. That is, the nonprofit succeeds because information about its services are relayed to a potentially needy audience, and the news outlet is benefited because it fills a spot in its news hole by providing important information to its viewers/readers.</p>
