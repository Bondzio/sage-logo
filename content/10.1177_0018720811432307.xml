<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Team communication analysis is an effective method for understanding the nuanced dynamics of team performance in technologically complex work environments. Among the research conducted now on team cognition in stressful environments, this work is unique in that it separates out the effects of mood from the effects of stress, resulting in deeper insights into how mood and stress individually and jointly affect the effectiveness of team communication. This study employed a simulated crisis management task environment to explore the relationship between communication behaviors and team awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720811432307">Gutwin &amp; Greenberg, 2001</xref>), a social aspect of teamwork that proves critical to successful team cognition.</p>
<p>Team cognition is more than the simple aggregation of individual cognitive activities of team members. As cognition describes the information processing activities of an individual, team cognition describes the information processing activities of a team. One critical distinction is that in team cognition, the interplay between cognitive processes happens socially, rather than solely within the mind of an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018720811432307">Kiekel, Cooke, Foltz, &amp; Shope, 2001</xref>). Communication analysis is therefore an ideal approach to examine team cognition.</p>
<p>The high psychological and physical stress found in time-pressured and hazardous work environments is often blamed for disastrous operator errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018720811432307">Perrow, 1984</xref>). Further complications arise when teams are distributed and using computer-mediated communication rather than face-to-face interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720811432307">Fiore, Salas, Cuevas, &amp; Bowers, 2003</xref>). Emerging research in human–computer interaction (HCI) suggests that these accidents may be attributed not just to human error during the incident but to errors in system design, particularly those features that fail to account for psychological states such as frustration, anxiety, fear, and boredom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720811432307">Ahn &amp; Picard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720811432307">Hudlicka, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018720811432307">Kapoor, Burleson, &amp; Picard, 2007</xref>). Recent research in computer-supported cooperative work has explored social and emotional engagement in teams (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018720811432307">Mentis, Reddy, &amp; Rosson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018720811432307">Nardi, 2005</xref>), but generally focusing on the role of emotions in the social environment rather than their effects on team cognition.</p>
<p>Emotion is acknowledged to have a significant and supportive role in cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018720811432307">Isen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018720811432307">Simon, 1990</xref>). It is increasingly explored in the field of HCI (e.g., affective computing; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018720811432307">Picard, 1997</xref>), yet it remains relatively underexplored within team cognition in technologically complex environments. This dismissal of emotional factors can be attributed to a number of biases, including simply viewing emotions as a symptom or indicator of stress, rather than a precipitating influence on individual and team cognition. Furthermore, many organizational cultures, military ones in particular, which are often the subject of these team cognition studies, often suppress the expression or discussion of emotion among operators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720811432307">Delahaij, Gaillard, &amp; Soeters, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720811432307">Harper, 2006</xref>). However, an abundance of individual-level research into stress and emotion reveals evidence that we should not consider one without the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018720811432307">Lazarus, 1999</xref>). It follows that there is value in exploring the unique role of <italic>team</italic> mood in stressful collaborative processes. Computer-mediated communication often compromises personal interaction via emotional cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018720811432307">Riva, 2002</xref>), making this issue especially salient for distributed teams. The study presented here, rather than examining the content of messages for emotional cues, instead analyzes the effect of mood and stress manipulations on the quantity and proportion of specific types of chat messages among dyads working in a fast-paced crisis management simulation.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section9-0018720811432307">
<title>Defining Stress</title>
<p>This study focuses on short-term or situational stress, as opposed to long-term or life stress. The definition of stress used here descends from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018720811432307">Lazarus and Folkman’s (1984)</xref> transactional model, wherein stress is regarded as the relationship between the perceived demands of a given situation and the individual’s appraisal of his or her resources to respond. When those demands appear to overwhelm the individual’s ability to cope, that individual experiences stress.</p>
<p>Stress is not a simple high or low variable, but rather a construct composed of multiple dependent processes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720811432307">Matthews et al. (2002)</xref> provided a three-factor framework to distinguish stressors in a manner consistent with the process of appraisal described by Lazarus. These factors are <italic>worry</italic>, a cognitive factor involving self-monitoring, self-esteem, and distraction; <italic>distress</italic>, a cognitive and affective dimension of tension and unhappiness; and <italic>task engagement</italic>, which is cognitive, affective, and motivational, describing the enthusiasm or apathy of the individual’s response. Their instrument, the Dundee Stress State Questionnaire (DSSQ, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018720811432307">Matthews et al., 1999</xref>), identified unique stress profiles in tasks such as reading, card sorting, and visual and auditory vigilance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720811432307">Matthews et al., 2002</xref>). This model surpasses vague attributions of errors to stress, as though it were a black box. Rather, we may specifically say that stressors bearing <italic>these particular characteristics</italic> cause <italic>these particular responses</italic>.</p>
<p>Though there are emotional facets of stress, stress is not a mood but a cognitive process. Too often stress is referred to interchangeably with mood states, such as anxiety and fear, so it is essential to further explicate the conceptual differences between the two.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0018720811432307">
<title>Defining Mood</title>
<p>Discussions of emotion often suffer from terminological ambiguity with the terms <italic>affect, mood, emotion</italic>, and <italic>feeling</italic> used interchangeably. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018720811432307">Russell (2003)</xref> proposed a taxonomy that distinguishes emotional episodes, which are oriented toward a specific event (such as feeling joyful at receiving a gift), from moods, which are defined as a prolonged affective state with no object, such as simply feeling sad without any cognitive or reflective activity surrounding that feeling. It is Russell’s definition of mood that is employed here.</p>
<p>However, rather than using Russell’s popular model of positive and negative affect as a single bipolar construct, the study presented here employed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018720811432307">Watson and Tellegen’s (1985)</xref> two-factor model, in which positive and negative affect are orthogonal constructs. Contrary to Russell’s model, in which positive and negative affect are inversely correlated, researchers have found many instances of little to no correlation between the two (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720811432307">Cropanzano, Weiss, Hale, &amp; Reb, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018720811432307">Matthews et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018720811432307">Watson &amp; Clark, 1997</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0018720811432307">
<title>Disentangling Stress and Mood</title>
<p>Distinguishing between the cognitive impacts of stress and mood is critical, conceptually as well as operationally. Stress is often conflated with negative emotional experiences, such as fear or anxiety, which are sometimes referred to ambiguously as “stressful moods.” However, it is misleading to focus entirely on the negative connotations of stress. Many team contexts, including emergency medicine, military operations, and professional sports, rely on the stimulating effect of stress to motivate participants to high levels of performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018720811432307">Lazarus, 2000</xref>) and report positive emotional states such as excitement or eagerness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018720811432307">Morris, Hancock, &amp; Shirkey, 2004</xref>), even within organizational cultures that discourage the expression of emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720811432307">Delahaij et al., 2006</xref>). These findings provide motivation to pursue a factorial research design where stress and mood are independently controlled, to tease out their individual effects on team cognition and illuminate any mediating or moderating relationships existing between the two.</p>
<p>Overlapping findings in the stress and emotion literature suggest multiple possible interactions between mood and stress states in terms of their joint impact on individual cognitive performance and, by extension, team cognition. Of particular interest here are effects on communication behaviors that may change team members’ mutual awareness of each other.</p>
<p>One frequently cited cognitive impact of stress is attentional tunneling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018720811432307">Wickens, 1996</xref>), in which individuals under stress maintain their ability to attend to their primary task but lose the capacity to manage peripheral or less threatening activities. This occurs in extreme environments, such as with fighter pilots under stress, when one aspect of the situation engages their entire attention, causing them to lose overall situation awareness. For example, the stressed pilot may lose control of the aircraft by attending solely to the target while neglecting dangerous changes in altitude.</p>
<p>A similar narrowing effect is also observed in response to negative mood states such as anxiety, concentrating an individual’s focus and biasing attention toward the most threatening features of the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720811432307">Hudlicka, 2003</xref>). Numerous studies on mood and visual processing reveal how different mood states cause an individual’s awareness of the environment to become broad or narrow. According to the affect-as-information perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018720811432307">Schwarz &amp; Clore, 1996</xref>), affect will influence task performance when it seems to provide task-relevant information. A happy mood, for example, provides the information that the task is proceeding well, whereas a sad mood indicates there are problems and caution is recommended. That message of caution can result in more rigid thinking, fixation on local rather than global features, and a more cautious approach in decision making. Those experiencing a happy mood, however, are more likely to employ novel approaches to problem solving and be aware of global features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720811432307">Gasper &amp; Clore, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0018720811432307">
<title>Team Awareness</title>
<p>The narrowing of individual attention could lead to a loss of team awareness, whether by failing to attend to the needs of other team members or neglecting opportunities to ask for information or assistance. In the context of collaborative systems, successful team cognition depends on high levels of awareness of fellow team members, the status of their tasks, and the events happening within the shared workspace. These factors combine to create <italic>workspace awareness</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720811432307">Gutwin &amp; Greenberg, 2001</xref>). The team awareness component under investigation in the present study relates to simplifying communication and managing how tightly or loosely partners are working together from moment to moment.</p>
<p>In fast-paced, stressful, and complex work environments, executing the current task and planning the next one require rapid and smooth transitions in team interactions—knowing who you should be helping or who should be helping you. Peripheral monitoring of teammate activities supports team cognition by identifying appropriate opportunities to collaborate and reducing inappropriate and frustrating interruptions. Indicators of these monitoring behaviors supporting team awareness should be evident in the communications between team members.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720811432307">Driskell, Salas, and Johnston (1999)</xref> defined a similar concept, team perspective, as the combination of perceived team interdependency and the shared mental model of the team’s present task. They noted that broader team perspective was found among teams that had to complete a task collaboratively, compared to teams that worked independently. However, high stress conditions diminished team perspective among even those working collaboratively, echoing the tunnel vision effect described above, but at a teamwork level—changing the individual’s perspective from a group-focus to a self-focus. Furthermore, their analysis revealed the impact of stress on performance was in fact being mediated by team perspective. This serves as a valuable example that in stressful situations, it is not stress alone that affects outcomes.</p>

<sec id="section13-0018720811432307">
<title>Study Rationale</title>
<p>The following dyadic communication data are a subset of a larger study examining multiple dimensions of team collaboration and performance in NeoCITIES, a computer-mediated simulated task environment based on crisis management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018720811432307">Pfaff, 2008</xref>). In that study, hypotheses were developed regarding the effects of mood and stress on team task performance, but no specific a priori hypotheses were developed for the communication measures. Their role in the larger study was primarily to reveal underlying reasons for changes in team performance resulting from mood and stress. There were no direct mappings between specific message categories in the chosen coding scheme and the trends related to team awareness described previously. Rather, the intention of the chat analysis was to see what aggregate picture appeared from the relative changes and trade-offs in communication behaviors.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section15-0018720811432307">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>In exchange for course credit, 42 students (<italic>N</italic> = 21 dyads) in a junior-level undergraduate HCI course took part in this study. Participants ranged from 19 to 30 years old (<italic>M</italic> = 21.1 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.98). In all, 38 were men and 4 were women.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0018720811432307">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were quasi-randomly assigned to teams of six for the duration of two experiments conducted in five sessions over a period of six weeks (only the first experiment is reported here). Within each team, participants were randomly assigned to one of three dyads—Police, Fire/EMS, or Hazardous Materials (Hazmat)—and within each dyad were assigned the role of either information manager (IM) or resource manager (RM). Each dyad faced an equal workload.</p>
<p>The first session of the experiment was dedicated to training on the NeoCITIES simulation. NeoCITIES is a six-person online video game based on a 911 dispatch center. Participants were isolated at individual computer terminals with an interface including a map of the town with icons showing the location and status of each event, a text-based chat window, an event tracker showing the description and status of ongoing events, and additional tabbed pages for activity logs and other information. For complete details of the construction and game play of NeoCITIES, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018720811432307">McNeese et al. (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018720811432307">Jones (2006)</xref>.</p>
<p>Over the course of each scenario, emergencies were presented at predetermined intervals simultaneously to the three IMs, who could freely communicate with each other. When an IM determined that his or her dyad should take action, the IM passed that event along to the RM, who had exclusive control of the dyad’s emergency resources. RMs could communicate only with their own IMs. Communication was via a text-based chat module in the game interface. Only the within-dyad communications (between IM and RM) are presented here.</p>
<p>Following the training session, participants returned each week at the same time for two more sessions. The experiment used a 2 (stress: none, high) × 2 (mood: sad, happy) within-subjects full-factorial design. Groups completed two conditions per session with a 10-min break in between conditions (the mood and stress conditions were counter-balanced to avoid ordering effects). The stress level remained constant in each session, with the mood level alternating from the first trial to the second. For each trial, participants would watch a movie clip (the mood manipulation), complete a survey that included both the mood manipulation check and the stress pretest, play the NeoCITIES simulation for 10 min with their team, and finally complete a final questionnaire, including the stress posttest.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0018720811432307">
<title>Manipulations and Measures</title>
<p>The time pressure manipulation had participants addressing either 18 or 30 events over a 10-min session in the NeoCITIES simulation. The mood manipulations in both experiments used pretested happy and sad clips from popular movies, a mood induction procedure that has worked effectively in several studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720811432307">Cavallo &amp; Pinto, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018720811432307">Wang, LaBar, &amp; McCarthy, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The 24-item Short Stress State Questionnaire (SSSQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720811432307">Helton &amp; Garland, 2006</xref>), based on the 90-question DSSQ, provided a rapid and reliable assessment of the three primary stress dimensions: task engagement (Cronbach’s α = .77), distress (Cronbach’s α = .75), and worry (Cronbach’s α = .72). The mood manipulations were checked immediately after watching the video clips using items from the Positive and Negative Affectivity Scales (PANAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018720811432307">Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988</xref>) and Short-Form State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018720811432307">Marteau &amp; Bekker, 1992</xref>). As the SSSQ, PANAS, and STAI measure related concepts and even share some questions, factor analysis provided a two-factor solution for the mood measures: PA/Engaged (“I feel active,” “I feel enthusiastic,” “I feel determined”; Cronbach’s α = .79) and NA/Anxious (“I feel upset,” “I am worried,” “I feel dissatisfied,” “I feel distressed”; Cronbach’s α = .72).</p>
<p>Quantitative task performance measures alone (e.g., a team’s score) are insufficient for a holistic assessment of team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720811432307">Cooke, Salas, Kiekel, &amp; Bell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018720811432307">MacMillan, Entin, &amp; Serfaty, 2004</xref>). Team communication has been identified as an important process variable in teamwork at the input, throughput, and output stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720811432307">Dickinson &amp; McIntyre, 1997</xref>). Consequently, effective metrics have been developed according to various taxonomies that identify message types and link them to specific components of collaborative team functions.</p>
<p>Approaches available for coding and analyzing communications each have their advantages and constraints. These range from fast but simple quantitative methods to complex and rich qualitative methods. Striking a balance in the middle is the approach of developing a well-defined and comprehensive set of coding categories that captures both the meaning <italic>and</italic> quantity of relevant types of messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720811432307">Entin &amp; Entin, 2001</xref>). This approach is a good fit when the primary interest is to observe proportional shifts between various types of statements under different conditions, as was the case in this study, rather than a more sophisticated conversation analysis that evaluates and models group conversation behaviors, as might be done using sequential analysis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018720811432307">Jeong, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Several criteria led to the selection of a balanced method as the most appropriate for this study. The nature of verbal exchanges in the NeoCITIES task is limited in its depth and complexity (typically 5–15 statements total per 10-min trial). Statements were simple and to the point. For example, a typical exchange between an IM-RM pair would be, “IM: Send some fire trucks to #4; RM: OK.” The next exchange a few moments later concerns another event entirely. An exchange on one issue rarely exceeded three lines; hence, it is a stretch to consider these as “conversations.” However, there is still much value in analyzing individual statements. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018720811432307">Orasanu and Fischer (2008)</xref> note how stress may decrease explicitness in communication, such as the choice between saying “OK” and “I sent two fire trucks.” This can be investigated for mood as well. In addition, the ratios between requests and responses can quantify how well team members anticipated each other’s needs.</p>
<p>The chat data in this study were coded using a scheme adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720811432307">Entin and Entin (2001)</xref> developed for the Adaptive Architectures for Command and Control. This coding scheme identifies both transfers and requests in three categories—information (regarding the status of events), action (referring to ground-level activities), and coordination (delegating or accepting responsibility to act)—in addition to acknowledgments like “OK.” The definitions of these messages were tailored for the activities within the NeoCITIES task, and an additional category was added to account for off-task messages, for a total of eight unique message types (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0018720811432307">appendix</xref>). The coding scheme also included ratios of anticipation, computed by dividing the number of transfers by the number of requests in a given category. For example, teams that transfer information frequently without first being prompted with many requests will have an information anticipation ratio greater than 1.0, whereas teams that respond only to frequent and repeated prompting will have a lower ratio. Team members anticipating the needs of others and taking the initiative to transfer information demonstrate higher team awareness than members requiring one or more prompts to communicate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018720811432307">Serfaty, Entin, and Johnston (1998)</xref> utilized this approach to validate the efficacy of a team adaptation and coordination intervention, finding increases in the anticipation ratios that indicated significantly greater communication efficiency. Applied to the NeoCITIES task, however, the focus was not on efficiency, but rather on how mood and stress influenced the team’s communication style, as revealed by the relative proportions of these different types of messages.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Manipulation checks verified that the mood and stress conditions were effective. The measures of self-reported stress and mood states were averaged across both members of each dyad and analyzed using within-subjects ANOVAs (because of the small sample, the level of significance was relaxed to α = .10). Participants reported higher positive affect in the happy condition (<italic>M</italic> = 1.80, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.12) than in the sad condition (<italic>M</italic> = 1.14, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.12), <italic>F</italic>(1, 56.98) = 45.53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Participants also reported higher negative affect in the sad condition (<italic>M</italic> = 0.81, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.07) than in the happy condition (<italic>M</italic> = 0.19, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.07), <italic>F</italic>(1, 57.14) = 91.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The differences between the post- and pretask measurements of the three dimensions of the SSSQ were tested for the effect of the stress manipulation. Stressed participants reported lower <italic>engagement</italic> (<italic>M</italic> = 0.83, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.13) than did nonstressed participants (<italic>M</italic> = 1.10, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.13), <italic>F</italic>(1, 58.77) = 3.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10. Stressed participants reported more <italic>worry</italic> (<italic>M</italic> = 0.19, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.08) than did nonstressed participants (<italic>M</italic> = −0.03, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.08), <italic>F</italic>(1, 58.92) = 4.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. No significant effect was found for <italic>distress</italic>.</p>
<p>Chat logs for each dyad were analyzed by two coders. The coder’s ratings were highly correlated, <italic>r</italic>(894) = .97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Each line of chat was treated as a single statement and assigned the most appropriate code. Compound statements, though rare, were split onto two lines before coding. Fortunately, the brevity and focus of the chat statements led to little ambiguity in coding (as evidenced by a very high interrater reliability).</p>
<p>All message proportions and anticipation ratios were tested using 2 (stress: none, high) × 2 (mood: sad, happy) factorial repeated-measures ANOVAs. One dyad was excluded from all conditions for not following the experimenter’s directions, and one dyad missed a session. Coordination requests and transfers are common between IMs but were very rare in the chat between IM and RM and were not analyzed. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720811432307">Table 1</xref> summarizes the ANOVAs for all of the measures, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720811432307">Table 2</xref> reports the means and standard errors for the significant results.</p>

<p><italic>Note</italic>. A square-root transformation of all measures was made for normal distributions. Back-transformed means appear in parentheses after the results.

<p>Total messages per trial increased under the time pressure stressor compared to the normal condition. Specifically, the percentages of information transfers and information requests significantly increased under time pressure. A full discussion of task performance is beyond the scope of this article, but it is worth noting that the percentage of information requests was negatively correlated with task score, <italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic> = −.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. The overall anticipation ratio increased under time pressure as well.</p>
<p>Action anticipation was higher in the happy mood than in the sad mood. Dyads sent more action transfer messages (“I sent two fire trucks”) than requests (“Will you send more fire trucks?”) in the happy condition than the sad condition. Last, the percentage of acknowledgment messages was higher in the sad condition than in the happy condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0018720811432307" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several findings revealed different reactions to stress in light of the mood state. Time pressure could be considered a standard exemplar from Lazarus’s transactional model of stress: In the high-stress condition, participants perceived the amount of work to exceed their ability to respond. Participants perceived this manipulation as stressful according to the motivational (less engaged) and cognitive (more worried) dimensions of the SSSQ instrument but not the affective dimension (distress). For the type of tasks involved in the NeoCITIES simulation, the increased worry is expected. Participants would be increasingly concerned about their ability to keep up as events accumulated faster than they could resolve. The loss of engagement under the time pressure condition may result from the fact that compensation (course credit) was not tied to task performance. Once the task got too hard, participants may have lost interest in investing energy into a task when no reward was at stake.</p>
<p>In the flurry of activity created by time pressure, it is not surprising to see increased communication within dyads. It is especially encouraging to see dyads engage preemptively under stress, as evidenced by the increased overall anticipation ratio. The increase in action anticipation in the happy condition suggests that positive mood enhanced team awareness, whereas the sad mood reduced it: “He’ll do his job, and I’ll do mine.” This result parallels the cognitive impacts of negative moods focusing attention on local details rather than the big picture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720811432307">Gasper &amp; Clore, 2002</xref>). The trend of increased acknowledgments in the sad mood condition, in conjunction with the previous finding on action anticipation, suggests a trade-off in which participants in the sad mood tended to opt for simple acknowledgments of action requests (e.g., “OK”) rather than making the effort for an explicit action transfer statement (e.g., “I’m sending a fire truck”).</p>
<p>The increase in the proportion of information requests under time pressure helps identify cognitive processes affected by the stress manipulation, specifically memory and attention. The negative correlation between information requests and task score reveals that dyads that found themselves making information requests more frequently ultimately did worse on the task. Information requests fall into two general categories. Many are retrospective and analytical: “What did you do about event number 5?” or “Do you know why we failed on that car crash event?” Others seek information necessary to make the correct choice: “How many people can we transport in an ambulance?” A high proportion of information requests suggests that the dyad was engaging in higher amounts of sense-making behavior, indicating difficulty in attending to the details of multiple events and holding them in memory. In the stress condition, participants had to repeatedly shift their attention from the current task to incoming events, changes in status for ongoing events, or chat messages from their partner. These interruptions interfere with memory formation by limiting the amount of attention allotted to each event and interrupting the processes of consolidating and storing information after an event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018720811432307">Mendl, 1999</xref>). Interruptions also lead toward frustrated emotional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018720811432307">Mentis, 2007</xref>), providing a partial explanation for how the effect of stress on performance was mediated by mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018720811432307">Pfaff &amp; McNeese, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section20-0018720811432307">
<title>Practical Implications</title>
<p>Mitigating the task conditions that make work stressful and emotionally charged is difficult, yet systems can be designed to better support communication between operators under such conditions. The communication structure in NeoCITIES is deliberately restricted to closely observe information moving between players, but this problem affects any situation where multiple teams must develop and sustain a common operational picture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018720811432307">McNeese et al., 2006</xref>). Decentralization and lack of communication system standards affect the interoperability of local emergency services (e.g., police and fire) as much as multinational forces in a peacekeeping operation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018720811432307">Solomon (1997)</xref>, analyzing the social elements of information behavior in sense making, stresses the criticality of integrating information and communication systems into unified and seamless task processes. Designers are advised to recognize the effect of mood on how teammates interact with each other as sources of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720811432307">Dervin &amp; Reinhard, 2007</xref>). Special attention must be taken to avoid design flaws leading to negative emotional experiences, such as frustration resulting from repeated interruptions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720811432307">Hellar (2010)</xref> implemented one practical intervention in the NeoCITIES interface to address some of the impacts of mood and stress on team awareness. Specifically, he added an interface element to monitor teammates’ resources and task loads. This successfully reduced the need for explicit requests for assistance, an action known to be inhibited under time pressure or, more specifically, by the negative mood induced by that stressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018720811432307">Pfaff &amp; McNeese, 2010</xref>). Implicitly sharing that information in the interface subsequently improved team task performance and enhanced team awareness.</p>
<p>A frequent problem with text-based communication is the unclear deictic reference. Although “this one” and “here” are efficient shorthand for referring to an object or place, distributed team members can easily misunderstand each other without accurate shared reference points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720811432307">Gutwin &amp; Greenberg, 2001</xref>). Therefore, systems supporting an over-the-shoulder view of a partner’s workspace, or a virtual “pointing finger” taking the place of a real finger in face-to-face collaboration, will help overcome the omission of details in the terse and abbreviated communication patterns observed in sad moods.</p>
<p>Last, automated stylometric text analysis techniques can identify emotional cues in blogs and chat data, in some cases as well as humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018720811432307">Mishne &amp; De Rijke, 2006</xref>). Real-time monitoring of communications using these methods could automatically initiate appropriate interventions on behalf of a team member in distress.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0018720811432307">
<title>Limitations and Future Work</title>
<p>An obvious limitation of the work was the convenience sample of college students as participants, particularly with the overwhelming number of men in the sample. Of the 21 dyads, four were mixed gender, whereas the rest were all male. Though the data are insufficient for a valid analysis, the mixed-gender dyads performed noticeably worse than the all-male dyads. Possible explanations may be drawn from other studies showing how college-age men value and trust other men more than women in technological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018720811432307">Joshi &amp; Schmidt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018720811432307">Williams, Ogletree, Woodburn, &amp; Raffeld, 1993</xref>) and act more competitively than cooperatively in mixed-gender pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018720811432307">Valenzuela &amp; Raghubir, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the many advantages of using simulated task environments like NeoCITIES is the capacity to capture volumes of quantitative and qualitative data in real time for multiple simultaneous research objectives. Future plans include analyzing the between-dyad communication data and correlating communication behaviors with performance. The latter work intends to identify whether certain communication patterns act as coping mechanisms under stressful conditions. Further research plans to extend this work with additional stressors salient to the domain of team cognition, including task ambiguity and dynamic team structures.</p>
