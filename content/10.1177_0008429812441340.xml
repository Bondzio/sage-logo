<abstract><p>The references to children and the child–parent relationship in the New Testament household codes (Col 3:20–21; Eph 6:1–4) have received little attention from scholars. Yet recent, cross-disciplinary interest in the study of children and childhood invites us to consider these exhortations afresh. In particular, current research in Roman Family Studies has led to greater appreciation of the multifaceted circumstances of children, raising new questions about the children who were addressed directly in the household codes of Colossians and Ephesians. Two themes are especially important to consider: (1) overlapping categories of identity tied especially to the complex structures of a slave-holding society; and (2) the household as a locus for education throughout the life course. Informed by current research on children and childhood, the household codes appear to be even more significant than was previously thought for understanding the place of house churches in the Roman imperial world.</p>

<body>
<p>Perhaps to a greater extent than any other type of New Testament scholarship, studies on the New Testament household codes (e.g., Col 3:18–4:1; Eph 5:21–6:9) reflect a keen awareness of the impact of biblical interpretation across centuries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0008429812441340">Meeks, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0008429812441340">Mollenkott, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0008429812441340">Harrill, 2006</xref>). The legacy of domination which is fundamentally tied to the household codes has also meant that the work of New Testament scholars on the background and function of these codes has been of significant interest to theologians, ethicists, and historians. Feminist analysis, and, more recently, postcolonial analysis have led to increased understanding of the function of these exhortations within their original settings, but have also rendered the task of interpretation more complex – often calling for consideration of overlapping levels of ideologies, both modern and ancient. Discussions to date, however, have focused especially on women and slaves. The purpose of this essay is to begin to explore the ramifications of moving children and childhood to the centre of interpretation of household code traditions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0008429812441340">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Colossians and Ephesians offer the first indisputable evidence of children being singled out for exhortation in assemblies where Pauline letters were read aloud, as well as providing evidence for the high value placed on the child–parent relationship (Col 3:20–21; Eph 6:1–4) in some early church groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0008429812441340">2</xref>
</sup> But, with a few notable exceptions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008429812441340">Balla, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0008429812441340">MacDonald, 2008</xref>), the exhortations concerning children and the child–parent relationship in the household codes have been of little interest to scholars. This might be partially explained by the brevity of the exhortations calling for children to obey their parents and for fathers not to be overbearing with their children. At first glance, these exhortations seem to do little more than to reiterate conventional norms of parental and filial duties, even if they have more in common with more moderate than severe ancient voices on issues of physical discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0008429812441340">MacDonald, 2008</xref>: 281–285, 294–295). Yet scholarly interest in the study of children and childhood, which cuts across disciplines and is at the heart of the new interdisciplinary field of Childhood Studies, invites us to consider these exhortations afresh. When the household codes are read with an understanding of the complex circumstances of children, new questions and perspectives arise. Two themes which have surfaced in new cross-disciplinary work on children and families are particularly significant for understanding the household codes: (1) overlapping categories of identity; and (2) education and the life course.</p>
<sec id="section1-0008429812441340">
<title>Overlapping Categories of Identity</title>
<p>Recent research on ancient slavery suggests that the household codes need to be read in terms of overlapping categories of identity. These overlapping categories have to do with the complex structures of a slave-holding society, involving both the nature of the master–slave relationship and the division and sharing of a family’s living space. In an important essay examining inscriptional evidence from Asia Minor, probably dating from the second and third centuries CE, Dale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0008429812441340">Martin (2003</xref>) challenged the rigid divide between legitimate children and slaves that is represented in many ancient sources. This rigid divide often forms the basis of scholars’ assumptions about the presence of slaves in early Christian circles. Inscriptional evidence suggests, however, that some slaves seem to have acted in a quasi-servile role as a type of adopted child, perhaps with lower status than the freeborn children of the household. Yet, it is difficult to detect any secondary status in an early second-century inscription from Rome discussed by family historian Beryl Rawson, whose conclusions corroborate those of Martin: “To the departed spirits of Nico, her sweet son, who lived 11 months and 8 days, and Eutyches, her home-born slave, who lived for 1 year, 5 months and 10 days; dedicated by Publicia Glypte.” Rawson offers the following description:<disp-quote>
<p>Above the inscription are sculpted two figures of the little boys in togas, each holding a scroll, with a scroll-box between them at their feet. The togas and the appurtenances of schooling are clearly prospective, foreshadowing the boys’ futures (now cut off) as well-educated citizens. The representation of Eutyches is especially optimistic, as a slave would not normally look forward to a liberal education or wear a toga; but Glypte advertises what had been her intention – to give Eutyches his freedom and to raise him as a citizen and as a foster-brother to Nico. The sculpture and the pediment of stone appear to be of Telephus, suckled by a hind, thus alluding to a fostering relationship. Glypte has raised the two boys almost as twins. Eutyches may already have been a surrogate son during Glypte’s pregnancy, and she could have looked forward to having him as playmate and companion for her natural son, perhaps also to be suckled by the same nurse. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0008429812441340">Rawson, 2003</xref>: 260–261)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0008429812441340">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This inscription clashes with much evidence, especially from ancient writers, that points to the ever-widening gap between slave and free as children grew into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008429812441340">MacDonald, 2007</xref>: 107), but it nevertheless reminds us that sometimes boundaries of status and identity could be transgressed when it came to a parent’s aspirations for the children of the household.</p>
<p>An even stronger indication of overlapping categories of identity comes in the form of an inscription from near ancient Philippi which appears to refer to the case of a slave whose father, Gaius Lavus Faustus, is both master and father – the slave is the progeny of his master and a household slave.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0008429812441340">4</xref>
</sup> Pointing to the possibility of slaves acting out multiple identities and highlighting complex experiences of family, Martin asks the following perceptive questions: “How do we imagine Vitalis experienced his slavery in such a case? How did persons experience their identities when their owners were also their parents?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0008429812441340">Martin, 2003</xref>: 207–208). Martin’s questions about dual identity call to mind the situation to which some household code traditions directly refer: believing women and slaves, who live in houses headed by non-believers (1 Tim 6:1–2; 1 Peter 3:1–6).</p>
<p>Although it is often mistakenly presumed when non-belief is not explicitly mentioned (such as in the case of Colossians) that all named people were therefore Christian, it is important to recognize that the codes do not state that members belonging to the various pairs of relationships are all Christians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0008429812441340">Aletti, 1993</xref>: 250; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0008429812441340">Seim, 1996</xref>: 167–181). Moreover, the situation of the believing slaves of believing masters created its own type of dilemmas and conflicting identities, as the warning to believing masters to be just and not overbearing and to remember their own “heavenly” master no doubt reveals (Col 4:1; Eph 6:1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008429812441340">Barclay, 1991</xref>). While children are rarely mentioned by scholars who discuss the presence, in church groups, of subordinate members of households headed by believers and non-believers alike, children are presumed by the categories even when they are not singled out explicitly. This is because children were, naturally, members of the category of slaves of believing and non-believing masters. Moreover, believing mothers (free, freed, and enslaved) who had non-believing partners must often have brought their children to meetings (see further, below). The children of believing slaves no doubt shared in service to believing masters with one or both of their parents. So, to echo Martin’s language: How did believing slave children experience their identities when their masters and perhaps even one of their parents were non-believers? How did slave children experience their identities when they had pseudo-siblings in the Lord who were the freeborn children of their masters? If we allow the presence of the subordinate members of non-believing households in church groups to inform the already complex picture of multiple identities lived out by family members in the ancient world, we certainly “complicate the way we imagine slavery, family, household, and their relationship to one another in early Christianity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0008429812441340">Martin, 2003</xref>: 230).</p>
<p>The very circumstances of house-church meetings also complicate our vision. In choosing domestic space as their primary gathering space, early church groups created a world where unity in the Lord was proclaimed in shared living space. In the absence of undisputed archaeological evidence for particular house churches from the first century, scholars continue to debate what kind of housing would have been typically used by the Pauline Christians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0008429812441340">White, 1996–1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0008429812441340">Riesner, 2007</xref>). For ancient Corinth, for example, scholarly opinion ranges from an expansive Roman villa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0008429812441340">Murphy-O’Connor, 2002</xref>), to simple rooms above shops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0008429812441340">Horrell, 2004</xref>). Some scholars have opted for a range of possibilities, from crowded apartment houses to peristyled <italic>domus</italic>, influenced especially by evidence from Pompeii which reveals ownership of some spacious houses by freedpersons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0008429812441340">Osiek and MacDonald, 2006</xref>: 9). For our purposes, the type of housing used by the first believers is of limited importance, as children were constantly present in every type of domestic setting, no matter how grand or humble. While we might expect greater seclusion of children among the elite, Quintilian’s arguments (<italic>The Orator’s Education</italic> 1.2.8) in favour of sending children out to school rather than their being tutored at home remind us that this was likely not the case. His arguments are no doubt made to emphasize the corruption that children could experience at home – he speaks of children witnessing mistresses, boy lovers and rowdy dinner parties – but his remarks nevertheless point to the architectural openness of ancient houses and the mobility of children within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0008429812441340">Osiek and MacDonald, 2006</xref>: 93; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0008429812441340">Rawson, 2003</xref>: 214). Paul’s remarks about tongues reflect a similar lack of privacy, even though the dangers of misunderstanding are not typically viewed as involving impressionable young people, although this perhaps should be given consideration (1 Cor 14:23–25).</p>
<p>With respect to overlapping categories of identity, studies of ancient Ephesus and Pompeii have revealed very little evidence for separate slave quarters. Slaves and slave children probably slept wherever they happened to be working or attending to the needs of their masters, such as in kitchens, storerooms, or on the floor of their masters’ bedrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0008429812441340">George, 2004</xref>). Slave children would often have spent their days with free children under the supervision of the slave caregivers, essentially becoming temporary members of the slave <italic>familia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0008429812441340">Rawson, 2003</xref>: 215). Ancient sources also speak of free and slave children attending banquets and celebrations such as weddings, with slave children sometimes working as servers, readers, and entertainers (Nepos, <italic>Atticus</italic> 13; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0008429812441340">Rawson, 2003</xref>: 154–156, 187–191). The frequent presence of children at banquets and celebrations forms the backdrop for the anti-Christian polemic of Marcus Cornelius Fronto, who makes use of their visibility to stress the participation of children in the immoral practices and rituals of the Christians (<italic>Octavius</italic> 8–9).</p>
<p>A thorough understanding of how individuals were subject to overlapping categories of identity and how they, especially as slaves, could live out multiple identities, can help us to appreciate the nature of household code discourse as highly idealized discourse. The household codes of Colossians and Ephesians in particular appear to present clear-cut categories, but this should not be read as straightforward social description. As has long been recognized (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0008429812441340">Balch, 1981</xref>), household codes reflect the thematic discussions of household management which can be traced to Aristotle’s <italic>Politics</italic> 1.1253b–1260b26 and are found in abundance in Greco-Roman and Jewish literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0008429812441340">Balch, 1981</xref>). That being said, these codes speak to an audience experiencing complex identities and circumstances including the sometimes delicate manoeuvres required simply to attend a gathering. The instructions subsume groups without breaking down categories; but sometimes slaves are also parents; sometimes children are also slaves. We might consider, for example, the challenges faced by slave women who brought their children to meetings especially if their non-believing “husbands” were the domestic slaves of non-believers of high social status.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0008429812441340">5</xref>
</sup> It would be difficult enough for free mothers involved in mixed marriage to bring children to gatherings if they feared reprisal, perhaps divorce, and potentially loss of access to their children, who remained in law automatically under the authority of their fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0008429812441340">Osiek and MacDonald, 2006</xref>: 21); but slave women, who could be separated from their children on whim, must have contemplated the cruel and violent consequences which might await them should their activities be brought to the attention of a disapproving <italic>paterfamilias</italic>.</p>
<p>New research on slavery in the ancient world can also help us to appreciate the vulnerability of the children addressed in the household codes, often living in circumstances that substantially differed from the ideal propounded by the balanced exhortations to the various pairs of relationships. One might ask: Should the child whose father is a non-believer really have to obey him in <italic>all </italic>things? (Col 3:20). One key aspect of the vulnerability of children in the Roman world was their sexual vulnerability. The general acceptance of the use of slaves as sexual outlets has caused scholars to rethink the implications of Pauline sexual ethics and the curious silence on the matter in the New Testament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0008429812441340">Glancy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0008429812441340">Brooten, 2010</xref>). The potential overlap between the categories of child and slave in the New Testament household codes should lead us to consider the issue of the sexual use of children, especially child slaves, who were sometimes adopted as “pet” children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0008429812441340">Laes, 2006</xref>). One might argue that the New Testament silence on the sexual use of slaves suggests that this expectation was not questioned, but there are some indirect indications that the treatment of slaves in early church communities may have included respect for their families and resistance to sexual violation (though it is highly unlikely that the sexual use of slaves was eliminated). I have examined this issue at length elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008429812441340">MacDonald, 2007</xref>), but briefly, the promise of inheritance to slaves in Colossians 3:24, for example, is especially striking, perhaps revealing that slaves and free persons ultimately are worthy of honour as brothers and sisters in the Lord; under Roman Law, slaves stood outside the realm of inheritance altogether. Recently, some scholars have suggested that this reference to inheritance in the Colossians code implies that the recipients of the letter heard messages of liberation that are barely detectable to modern readers. Influenced especially by the political theories of James C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0008429812441340">Scott (1990</xref>), some commentators have described the Colossian code as a type of “hidden transcript,” innocuous to outsiders, but ultimately undermining the dominant categories of the slave–master relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0008429812441340">Walsh and Keesmaat, 2004</xref>: 209; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0008429812441340">Sumney, 2008</xref>: 237, 250). The notion of a “hidden transcript” raises the possibility of intriguing correlations between early Christian teaching on sexual morality, slavery, and children which merit further exploration.</p>
<p>The applicability of the theories of James C. Scott to the context of Early Christianity is still a matter of debate among scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008429812441340">Horsley, 2004</xref>) and whether they will ultimately be accepted as a useful lens for understanding the shape and intent of household code discourse remains to be seen. But an earlier tendency to view the codes – especially the Colossians code – as virtually disconnected from the remainder of the letters and as representing a mere insertion of traditional ethics is being left behind in recent scholarship, which seeks to understand the rhetorical function of the codes within the letters as a whole and their relationship to other aspects of the works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0008429812441340">Osiek and MacDonald, 2006</xref>: 118–143). For example, the household codes of Colossians and Ephesians are both preceded by ethical discourse which exhibits considerable interest in sexual ethics more broadly. This structural feature combined with the fact that concern with holiness and purity shapes the metaphorical treatment of marriage in Ephesians 5:22–33, suggests that an interest in sexual ethics is closely related to the treatment of household relations in the codes. Such overlapping interests are very much in keeping with comparative Jewish teaching, where links between household management themes, sexuality and the treatment of children are more explicit. In addition to displaying a concern for familial relations more generally, Philo of Alexandria (<italic>Special Laws</italic> 3.110–119), for example, treats exposure, infanticide, abortion and abandonment – topics that appear in the ethical instruction of the Apostolic Fathers (e.g., <italic>Barnabas</italic> 19.5; <italic>Didache</italic> 2.2), which are very close in date to the New Testament texts and which include household code traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0008429812441340">Reinhartz, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0008429812441340">1993</xref>).</p>

<title>Education and the Life Course</title>
<p>In Colossians and Ephesians, the child–parent relationship is usually understood as referring to young children who still live with their parents, as opposed to adult children. That the household codes of Colossians and Ephesians primarily refer to relations between adult children and parents has remained a minority position among scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441340">Gärtner, 1985</xref>: 36–37), but new research on the life course in the Roman world suggests that the exhortations should be viewed as having at least some bearing on such relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0008429812441340">Harlow and Laurence, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0008429812441340">2007</xref>). First, it is important to note that the beginning of adulthood was a flexible concept among Romans, with no rigid age demarcation such as the modern right to vote or to take a test to acquire a driver’s licence at a certain age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0008429812441340">Rawson, 2003</xref>: 134–145). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0008429812441340">Rawson (2003</xref>: 142) notes the flexibility and parental discretion concerning the age of a boy undergoing the coming-of-age ceremony, the <italic>toga uirilis</italic>, where the boy exchanged his boyhood garb for that of adulthood (ages range from 13 to 18). No coming-of-age ceremony existed for girls; instead, marriage acted as the most visible sign of adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0008429812441340">Rawson, 2003</xref>: 145). But here again we must think in terms of flexibility and fluid transitions, especially since girls (by our standards) married very young, typically between the ages of 12 and 16, often to significantly older men. Household observances seem to have been designed to urge on a transformation which in reality must often have been slow to occur. On the eve of her wedding celebration, the bride would typically offer her dolls and toys to the household gods or to Venus.</p>
<p>Household code traditions in the Pastoral Epistles reflect an awareness of the need to educate young women beyond marriage and into the early childbearing years. The Pastoral Paul makes explicit use of these age categories in Titus 2:3–5, in the plea for women to be model wives. Older women are to train younger women to love their husbands and children, as if they need this education to progress from childhood to adulthood. Despite the prohibition against women engaging in public teaching in 1 Timothy 2:12, it is striking that in Titus 2:3–5 the author employs the recognized word for teacher (<italic>didaskalos</italic>) to refer to the training efforts of the older women. In 1 Timothy 5:2–16 there is a somewhat baffling array of categories of widows, including those who are over sixty years of age. The example of older women is nevertheless clearly central to this text and there is an explicit expectation that women will assist other women (1 Tim 5:16). The Pastoral Paul would have the younger widows marry and take up the task of household management (1 Tim 5:14) and there is good reason to suspect that what is being envisioned here is the instruction and correction of women by other women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0008429812441340">LaFosse, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Influenced by research on the life course in Roman Family Studies, New Testament scholars are beginning to consider how ages and stages of life may have influenced how early Christianity was experienced and may even have been at the heart of certain early church conflicts (cf. 1 Clem 1.3; 3.3; 21.6; 47.6). Old age has only been of interest to New Testament interpreters very recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0008429812441340">Campbell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0008429812441340">Barclay, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0008429812441340">LaFosse, 2011</xref>), but may in fact have some bearing on Ephesians 6:1–4. Ephesians 6:2 calls for children to honour their parents, alluding to the commandment from the Decalogue (LXX Exod 20:12; Deut 5:16). The reference to ancient scriptural traditions reinforces a respectful attitude that begins in childhood, but should continue into adulthood with the ongoing care of parents into old age (Exod 21:15, 17; Prov 19:26; 20:20; 28:24; Mark 7:9–13; Matt 15:4–6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0008429812441340">MacDonald, 2008</xref>: 283). But such a life-course approach may also be at the heart of the often overlooked reference in the Ephesians household code to the education of children (Eph 6:4). This text is the first of several from the late first century and early second century which explicitly refer to the Christian education/socialization of children (2 Tim 1:5; 3:15; <italic>1 Clement</italic> 21.6, 8; <italic>Didache</italic> 4.9; Polycarp, <italic>Philippians</italic> 4.2; cf. <italic>Shepherd of Hermas</italic>, <italic>Visions</italic>, 2.4.3). While in the case of the Ephesians it is the father who is the educator, in both the Pastorals and Polycarp’s letter to the Philippians, education is entrusted to women – mothers and grandmothers.</p>
<p>The influence of mothers on the education of children (including sons) is well documented in Greco-Roman literature, not only with respect to curriculum, but also with respect to progress in speech and rhetorical style and in the development of character (e.g., Plutarch, <italic>The Education of Children</italic> 14b–c; <italic>Life of Tiberius Gracchus</italic> 1.6–7; Cicero, <italic>Brutus</italic> 211; Quintilian, <italic>Training in Oratory</italic> 1.1.6–7). Praise for the educational influence and dedication of Cornelia, the mother of the Gracchi, is associated with her taking over the affairs of the household and children upon the death of her husband (Plutarch, <italic>Life of Tiberius Gracchus</italic> 1.6–7). Especially in widowhood, Roman women could manage the affairs of their children quite autonomously, but even when their husbands were living, wives could extend considerable influence in mapping out futures for their children in education and marriage, and in acting as their advocates in various circumstances well into adulthood (Aulus Gellius, <italic>Attic Nights</italic> 12.1.1–5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0008429812441340">MacDonald, 2008</xref>: 295–296). While literary evidence speaks of the lives of the elite and largely reflects conventional notions of motherly influence, one cannot help but wonder whether the influence of the grandmother Lois and the mother Eunice in 2 Timothy 1:5 on Timothy’s formation may resonate with an audience aware of too many absent fathers – absent perhaps not so much because of death as on account of mothers entering church groups without their partners. By the time of the composition of the Pastoral Epistles, mixed marriages involving believing women were social irritants in the relations between church and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0008429812441340">MacDonald, 1996</xref>). There are hints of this irritation in the cautious advice given to wives married to unbelievers in 1 Peter (1 Peter 3:1–2). One must be aware of broader agendas at play in the works of later church authors such as Justin Martyr (<italic>Second Apology</italic> 2) and Tertullian (Tertullian, <italic>To His Wife</italic> 2.4), who described the circumstances of women involved in mixed marriage, or in the graphic descriptions of violence directed at women and apostles by family members and husbands/fiancés by the authors of the Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles. Yet, there is enough consistency in the evidence that we are safe in concluding that the marriages between church women and pagan men were an important factor in early Christianity’s visibility as a suspicious movement worthy of persecution.</p>
<p>An exploration of the relationship between education, the life course, and household code traditions should also take account of significant comparative Jewish material. The Dead Sea Scrolls contain fascinating material concerning the education of children presented within the framework of the life course. As noted by Cecilia Wassen, the Damascus Document and the Rule of the Congregation (1QSa) reveal the existence of married communities and include several instructions concerning children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0008429812441340">Wassen, 2005</xref>: 164–168). For example, the Damascus Document bars children from communal gatherings (4Q 266 8 i 6–9 [cf. 1QM VII 3–6]), but it also describes a type of process of transition from childhood to adulthood (CD XV 5–10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0008429812441340">Wassen, 2005</xref>: 133–136). The Rule of the Congregation (1QSa I 6–8) explicitly describes the life course, beginning with childhood, when the child is introduced to studies in the Torah while being gradually introduced to deeper insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0008429812441340">Schiffman, 1989</xref>: 14–16). There is also an account of a special gathering – probably the Renewal of Covenant Ceremony – in which children’s presence is highlighted (1QSa I 4–5; cf. Col 3:20–21; Eph 6:1–2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0008429812441340">Wassen, 2005</xref>: 136–138). This emphasis on training and transitions fits with the focus on the education and treatment of children as a key aspect of Jewish identity in Josephus’ apologetic work (<italic>Against Apion</italic> 1.60; 2.202–204; 2.173–174, 178). As is also the case with the household management themes echoed in the New Testament household codes, Josephus’ appeal to family structures in <italic>Against Apion</italic> is typically understood to be apologetic; the treatment of children by Jews becomes part of the agenda to convince his audience that Jewish family values are compatible with imperial values. But one cannot help but notice the emphasis on the training of children, also typical of the Pastoral Epistles, which must have had some basis in reality in communities rooted in scriptural traditions. In Josephus’ thought, the Law is the primary educator and guide from the period of infancy (<italic>Against Apion</italic> 2.173, 178). There are ongoing efforts to educate children that follow the life course from infancy to adulthood, including learning to read and being trained in the laws and the traditions of the forefathers (<italic>Against Apion</italic> 2.204; cf. Philo, <italic>Hypothetica</italic> 7.14). Likewise, 2 Timothy 3:5 describes education from infancy (<italic>brephos</italic>) in the sacred writings (<italic>hiera grammata</italic>) – the term widely employed by Greek-speaking Jews to refer to the Scriptures, here described as making Timothy wise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0008429812441340">Johnson, 2001</xref>: 419). A second reference to Scripture (<italic>graphē</italic>) occurs in the final verses of 2 Timothy 3:16–17 and once again the focus is on teaching, but not specifically the teaching of children (though by no means ruling it out).</p>
<p>Ephesians 6:4 instructs fathers to raise their children in the discipline (<italic>paideia</italic>) and instruction (<italic>nouthesia</italic>) of the Lord. Comparison of this verse with Jewish texts and related household management texts from the Pastoral Epistles can help us to appreciate the focus on education and the life course. The Greek term <italic>paideia</italic> (discipline or training) employed in Ephesians 6:4 should not be taken only to mean the upbringing of a child in a strict sense, for it can also refer to the formation of an adult. It is best to envision the instruction delivered by fathers, like training in the Law, as a type of life-long learning (to use a modern phrase) which is in keeping with the flexible approach to the end of childhood among Roman families described above. <italic>Paideia</italic> also occurs in 2 Timothy 3:16, which presents “training (<italic>paideia</italic>) in righteousness” as one of the purposes of Scripture. The emphasis is on the practical function of Scripture for teaching (<italic>didaskalia</italic>), reproof (<italic>elegmon</italic>), and correction (<italic>epanorthōsis</italic>). The association of this terminology with practical instructions suggests that we may have paid too little attention to the house church as a locus for education. In fact, the direct address to children in the household codes may be rooted in the school atmosphere of certain house-church meetings.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>When informed by current research on children and childhood in the Roman world, the New Testament household codes emerge in a new light, pointing to several areas for exploration. We must seek to understand the impact of the household codes with an appreciation of the actual shape of living spaces and neighbourhoods in the Roman world and of the mingling of free and slave children, as well as the association of free and slave children with slave caregivers. The familial audiences who heard the codes were no less complex than our own families. To appreciate ancient familial complexity, it is especially important to remember that when the codes refer to parents, slaves and children, these categories are not static, but actually overlap in a variety of ways. To add to the complexity, we must also keep in mind that the codes reflect idealizations of believing families when in actual fact the audiences would most likely have included some slave, child, and female members who were under the authority of a non-believing household head. Believers who heard the household codes would by necessity often be living out multiple identities.</p>
<p>In seeking to understand the Pauline churches, scholars have drawn upon a variety of models from the environment, including the household, the voluntary association and the philosophical school. If we bring children to the centre of interpretation of the household codes, however, we are challenged to rethink the relationship between the <italic>ekklesia </italic>and these models. The educational features of the Pauline churches, for example, with their focus on instruction and exhortation, have especially called to mind the philosophical school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0008429812441340">Meeks, 1983</xref>: 81–84). But the direct address to children in the household codes of Colossians and Ephesians reminds us that education can often mean the highly practical education of children. Moreover, an understanding of the life course in the Roman world suggests that we need to think not only of young children, but also of the progress and training from childhood into adulthood. Household code traditions have frequently been understood as apologetic in outlook, but scholars have yet to really explore how the educational motives of church communities intersected with those of the dominant society, the Roman imperial world. Children need to move from the outer margins of discussions of the relationship between church and society, to the heart of discussions about family, house churches, and the nature of early church allegiance and the recruitment of new members.</p>

<p>Some scholars have understood Colossians 3:18–4:1 and Ephesians 5:21–6:9 as offering the only true examples of the household code genre because of the symmetry of the exhortations including all three pairs of relationships. But the significance of the presence of all three pairs of relationships should not be exaggerated, as 1 Peter 2:18–3:7 and the Pastoral Epistles (e.g., 1 Tim 2:8–15; 3:4–5; 6:1–2; Tit 2:1–10; 3:1) appeal to household code traditions, even if more flexibly. The writings of the Apostolic Fathers also reflect such traditions: Ignatius, <italic>Letter to Polycarp</italic> 4.1–5.1; Polycarp, <italic>Letter to the Philippians</italic> 4.2–6.1.</p>

<p>There are many references to children in the undisputed letters to Paul, but they are almost without exception metaphorical. 1 Corinthians 7:14 is arguably the only reference to real children (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429812441340">MacDonald and Vaage, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0008429812441340">Aasgaard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0008429812441340">Gaventa, 2008</xref>). There are also many references to children in the Gospels, but traditions with respect to the child–parent relationship and the family are complex and somewhat ambivalent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0008429812441340">Carroll, 2008</xref>).</p>
