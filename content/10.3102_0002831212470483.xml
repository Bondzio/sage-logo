<abstract>
<p>This study examines the effects of affirmative action bans in four states (California, Florida, Texas, and Washington) on the enrollment of underrepresented students of color within six different graduate fields of study: the natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, business, education, and humanities. Findings show that affirmative action bans have led to the greatest reductions in science-related fields of engineering, the natural sciences, and the social sciences. These declines pose serious long-term consequences for the United States since these fields provide specialized training critical to the nation’s ability to compete effectively in a global market and for ensuring continued scientific and technological advancement.</p>

<p>The consideration of race as an affirmative factor in higher education admissions decisions remains the target of legal challenges and public debate. A new challenge to the constitutionality of the practice is now being considered by the U.S. Supreme Court in <italic>Fisher v. University of Texas, Austin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002831212470483">2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002831212470483">1</xref></sup> In addition, eight states currently ban the consideration of race in admissions at public institutions of higher education. Of these, six (Arizona, California, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Washington) implemented the bans through voter-approved initiatives or referenda;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002831212470483">2</xref></sup> two others (Florida and New Hampshire) banned the practice, respectively, by executive decision or legislative vote. These bans have been enacted despite the 2003 U.S. Supreme Court decision in <italic>Grutter v. Bollinger—</italic>which allows institutions to practice affirmative action under strict limits—because states can amend their respective constitutions (through state ballot measures, initiatives, or legislation) to prohibit practices that may be permitted under the federal constitution or federal law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0002831212470483">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In <italic>Grutter</italic>, the Court emphasized that institutions could consider race in a limited way to obtain the educational benefits of a racially and ethnically diverse student body, “in a society, like our own, in which race unfortunately still maters” (<italic>Grutter</italic>, 539 U.S. at 333). The educational benefits of racial and ethnic diversity are especially important in graduate training, where a diversity of perspectives can foster the innovation necessary to tackle complex research problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002831212470483">Page, 2007</xref>), advance scientific inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831212470483">Espinosa, 2011</xref>), and maintain America’s ability to compete effectively in a global market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002831212470483">Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy, 2011</xref>; Council of Graduate Schools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831212470483">[CGS], 2010</xref>). In its decision, the Court also acknowledged the broader implications of diversity for our democracy, emphasizing the role of universities and professional schools in providing “the training ground for a large number of our Nation’s leaders” (<italic>Grutter</italic>, 539 U.S. at 332). The Court stressed the need for these institutions to be inclusive of individuals of all races and ethnicities so that members of our society can have “confidence in the openness and integrity of the educational institutions that provide this training” (<italic>Grutter</italic>, 539 U.S. at 332). In this way, the Court recognized the important role graduate training plays in sustaining the health of our democracy by having a student body that more closely reflects the racial/ethnic diversity of the United States (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002831212470483">Bowen, Kurzweil, Tobin, &amp; Pichler, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>After bans on affirmative action were implemented in California, Florida, Texas, and Washington, selective undergraduate universities experienced a decline in the enrollment of underrepresented students of color (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002831212470483">Backes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002831212470483">Hinrichs, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0002831212470483">Tienda, Leicht, Sullivan, Maltese, &amp; Lloyd, 2003</xref>). Studies also documented declines in racial and ethnic student body diversity in the professional fields of law and medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002831212470483">Karabel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831212470483">Kidder, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002831212470483">in press</xref>). A more recent study, upon which this study builds, documented a decline in the representation of students of color across all graduate studies, outside the fields of law and medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002831212470483">Garces, 2012</xref>). These declines in graduate students of color are troubling given the already low representation of students of color, relative to their representation in the United States, across graduate fields of study. Sixteen percent of the U.S. population is Latino and 12% is African American, but in 2008, each group made up only about 4% of all the students enrolled in the natural sciences and only about 3% of all students enrolled in the field of engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002831212470483">National Science Foundation, National Center for Engineering Statistics, 2011</xref>). Of all the graduate students enrolled in the social sciences, African American and Latino students comprised only about 1% and 7%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002831212470483">National Science Foundation, National Center for Engineering Statistics, 2011</xref>). Disparities also persist in non–science-related fields, such as the humanities and education. Of all the doctoral degrees that were awarded in the humanities in 2009, only about 3% and 5%, respectively, were granted to African Americans and Latinos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002831212470483">National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2010</xref>). And Latinos made up only about 6% of all doctoral recipients in education in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002831212470483">National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0002831212470483">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our understanding of the impact of affirmative action bans at the graduate schools level, however, remains limited. Unlike colleges or universities, graduate admissions practices and requirements can differ substantially by field of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831212470483">Nettles &amp; Millett, 2006</xref>). Thus, the effect of affirmative action bans on the enrollment of students of color may not be the same across all graduate programs. Specialization in a field of study also defines the doctoral experience of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831212470483">Nettles &amp; Millett, 2006</xref>). For these reasons, the consequences of any declines in student of color enrollment may be unique by field of study. In light of national concerns over the underrepresentation of students of color in the fields of science and engineering, and their underrepresentation in non–science-related fields such as humanities and education, we need a more nuanced understanding of the impact of these policies within specific graduate fields of study. This more nuanced understanding should also help inform the ongoing legal and public debate around race-based affirmative action policies.</p>
<p>To this end, this study examines the impact of affirmative action bans on the enrollment of students of color in six fields of graduate study: natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, business, education, and humanities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0002831212470483">5</xref></sup> These fields represent the majority of all graduate students who were enrolled in 2009 (about 92%) and are a cross-section of graduate academic disciplines that allow for comparisons of the impact of the bans among science and non–science-related fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002831212470483">CGS, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002831212470483">Table 1</xref> outlines the various majors, within field of study, included in the study. As noted in the table, the only field in the survey that is not included in the study is the field designated as “other.” Specifically, I examine the bans on affirmative action in Texas (during <italic>Hopwood v. State of Texas</italic>, 1996), California (with Proposition 209), Washington (with Initiative 200), and Florida (with One Florida Initiative) and utilize a quasi-experimental analytic strategy—the difference-in-differences approach—to estimate the causal impact of affirmative action bans in these states on the enrollment rates of students of color within each discipline.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0002831212470483">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>In this analysis, the outcome is the proportion (as opposed to the number) of first-year graduate students who are underrepresented students of color because the overall enrollment of graduate students changes over time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002831212470483">Hinrichs, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002831212470483">Howell, 2010</xref>). The definition of underrepresented students of color includes students whose self-reported race or ethnicity is African American, Latino, and/or Native Americans/Alaska Natives and who are not considered international students because the determination of “race or ethnicity” as a factor in admissions presumably does not apply to international students. Moreover, the admissions and enrollment considerations for international students are different than those for domestic students. I do not include Asian American/Pacific Islanders students in my definition of “underrepresented” students of color because the category is too broadly defined to allow me to capture the educational disparities that exist within the various subgroups included in the category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002831212470483">CARE, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002831212470483">Teranishi, 2010</xref>). With enrollment as my outcome, I capture the overall impact of the affirmative action bans on applications, admissions, and enrollment, which may also reflect changes in financial aid support.</p>
<p>In the sections that follow, I first outline the literature to which this study contributes. Next, I describe my research design and findings, which show that the bans on affirmative action have led to the greatest reductions in the proportion of enrolled graduate students who are students of color in science-related fields of engineering, the natural sciences, and the social sciences. These findings suggest that affirmative action bans are undermining national goals to increase access and persistence for students of color in critical fields like science and engineering; institutions in states with affirmative action bans may need to reevaluate their admissions policies and implement innovative outreach and recruitment efforts if they are to address and reverse the impact of these policies. Though the effect is not as great, I also find a decline in student of color enrollment in the humanities. There appears to be no impact of affirmative action bans on the proportion of graduate students of color who are enrolled in the field of business. I conclude by outlining the policy implications of this work and outlining areas for future research.</p>

<title>Background and Context</title>
<sec id="section2-0002831212470483">
<title>Studies on the Effect of Affirmative Action Bans in Graduate Education</title>
<p>Most of the research examining the effect of affirmative action bans in higher education has focused at the undergraduate level, documenting declines at selective colleges and universities (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002831212470483">Backes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002831212470483">Hinrichs, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0002831212470483">Tienda et al., 2003</xref>). The few studies that examine the impact of affirmative action bans in graduate studies have also documented declines in the enrollment rates of students of color. In a study of the enrollment rates at five selective law schools in California, Texas, and Washington, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831212470483">Kidder (2003)</xref> documented a drop of about 4 percentage points, or nearly two-thirds, in the small enrollment rates of African Americans (from 6.5% to 2.25%) and more than a third for Latinos (from 11.8% to 7.4%) after the implementation of affirmative action bans in these states. The study compared the enrollment rates 5 years after the bans in California and Texas to enrollment rates 4 years before and enrollment rates 3 years after the ban in Washington to enrollment rates 3 years before (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002831212470483">Kidder, in press</xref>). In a comparison of Black and Chicano students who were admitted at the University of California medical schools between 1996 and 1997, when Proposition 209 banned affirmative action in California, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002831212470483">Karabel (1998)</xref> showed that the numbers enrolled dropped by 38% and 29%, respectively. These studies followed prior simulation studies that had predicted declines in enrollment among students of color when race or ethnicity ceased to be considered in admissions decisions in graduate studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831212470483">Cross &amp; Slater, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002831212470483">Dugan, Baydar, Grady, &amp; Johnson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0002831212470483">Wightman, 1997</xref>). These studies, however, are primarily descriptive and do not support causal inference because they do not account for other trends in enrollment.</p>
<p>A more recent study on the impact of the bans across graduate studies was able to support causal inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002831212470483">Garces, 2012</xref>). That study found that outside professional fields of law or medicine, affirmative action bans in Texas, California, Florida, and Washington have reduced the average proportion of graduate students who are students of color by about 12.2% (from 9.9% to 8.7%). This study extends this prior work by focusing on the impact of bans within specific fields of study, as opposed to across all graduate fields. Unlike colleges or universities, admissions requirements and processes at the graduate school level can differ substantially by field of study, with some fields emphasizing standardized test scores more than other factors like past work experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831212470483">Nettles &amp; Millet, 2006</xref>). Because the consequences of banning the consideration of race in admissions may differ based on the relative weight that is given to standardized test scores and other factors in admissions processes by field, the impact of the bans may not be the same across all graduate programs. Understanding the impact of affirmative action bans within specific fields of study will thus provide a more nuanced understanding of the impact of these policies at the graduate school level.</p>

<sec id="section3-0002831212470483">
<title>Graduate Admissions in Various Fields of Study and Hypotheses</title>
<p>Although literature documenting specific admissions practices in graduate studies is scant, studies have documented the consideration of race or ethnicity for historically underrepresented groups in higher education as a substantial factor in admissions practices across various graduate fields of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002831212470483">Attiyeh &amp; Attiyeh, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002831212470483">Dugan et al., 1996</xref>). As is the case in undergraduate admissions, standardized test scores are also a main criteria that faculty rely upon to make decisions about graduate admissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002831212470483">Attiyeh &amp; Attiyeh, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0002831212470483">Posselt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002831212470483">Sternberg &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0002831212470483">Willingham, 1974</xref>). This traditional measure of academic achievement can disadvantage African American and Latino students, who, as a group, are generally underrepresented at higher score percentiles on standardized tests and overrepresented at lower percentiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002831212470483">Bowen &amp; Bok, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002831212470483">Diaz, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831212470483">Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1998</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0002831212470483">7</xref></sup> For these reasons, one would anticipate that prohibiting the consideration of race as a plus factor in admissions may lead to fewer students of color being admitted, with a potentially worse impact in fields where the average standardized test scores of enrolled students is higher than other fields.</p>
<p>Findings from a 2006 survey of the background and experiences of doctoral students suggest that science-related fields of engineering, physical sciences, and social sciences tend to have student bodies with higher standardized test scores than those in the humanities or education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831212470483">Nettles and Millett (2006)</xref> found that for the 9,036 students who participated in the study and were representative of the graduate student body in the nation, the overall mean quantitative GRE score was highest in engineering (757), “followed by those in sciences and mathematics (731), social sciences (656), humanities (614), and education (567)” (p. 62). The average GRE analytic scores reflected a similar ordering, with the highest mean in science and mathematics (679), followed by engineering (677), social sciences (646), humanities (645), and education (571). Profile information for the fall 2010 entering classes in the fields of engineering and education at the University of California, Berkeley, supports this contrast, with the average quantitative GRE score in engineering at 773, compared to 624 in education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0002831212470483">U.S. News and World Report, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0002831212470483">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The effect of affirmative action bans may also differ depending on what additional factors are considered in admissions decisions by faculty or in the decisions of students to apply for admissions in specific fields. The characteristics of the graduate students in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831212470483">Nettles and Millet (2006)</xref> study show that in less technically focused fields of education (and similarly humanities and business), past work experience may be an important factor that plays into students’ decisions to apply to these fields or in faculty’s admissions decisions. For the sample of students in the study, the longest time lapse between undergraduate and doctoral degrees was in the field of education (an average of nearly 12 years), followed by engineering, humanities and social sciences (an average of 3.5 to 4.5 years), and science and mathematics (an average of 2 years). Moreover, on average, the youngest students (an average of 25 years old) were in sciences and mathematics, and the oldest students (an average of about 35 years old) were in education. A focus on work experience may balance the salience that is placed on standardized test scores and, consequently, mitigate the negative impact of affirmative action bans in these fields. For these reasons, as a result of affirmative action bans, I anticipate a greater decline in the enrollment of underrepresented students of color in science-related fields of engineering, physical sciences, and social sciences than in the humanities, education, or business.</p>

<title>The Affirmative Action Bans Considered in This Study</title>
<p>In this study, I examine the impact of the affirmative action ban that was implemented in Texas in 1997 as a result of the <italic>Hopwood</italic> court opinion and that remained in place until 2003, when <italic>Grutter</italic> overruled the decision. In 1997, the Texas Attorney General interpreted the decision to apply to both public and private institutions in the state and to extend to admissions decisions, financial aid, scholarships, and recruitment and retention practices. In this study, however, I do not consider the impact of affirmative action bans on private institutions in Texas because the affirmative action bans in the other states considered in this study (California, Washington, and Florida) only applied to public institutions. Including private institutions in Texas may thus bias the results because the characteristics of private institutions differ from those of the public institutions that make up the rest of the sample.</p>
<p>I also investigate the impact of the affirmative action bans on the enrollment of graduate students of color in California (with Proposition 209), Washington (with Initiative 200), and Florida (with the One Florida Initiative). These bans were implemented, respectively, in 1998, 1999, and 2000. Although Proposition 209 in California did not take effect until the entering class of 1998, because of the public discussion and attention to the issue during the time it was being litigated, it arguably affected graduate applications and enrollment decisions as early as fall 1997. For this reason, in my main analysis, I anticipate the impact of the ban in California to have started in 1997. Results, however, are robust to the choice of either year. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002831212470483">Table 2</xref>, I display the years the policy took effect in each state and the main analytic window I use in the study, 1994 to 2003. This analytic window covers 3 years before the first ban in Texas and California took effect and 3 years after the last ban in Florida was implemented. The year the ban went into effect in each state is based on the first cycle of admissions and enrollment decisions for which the ban on the consideration of race would have applied for fall semester enrollment.</p>

<p>Following the passage of affirmative action bans, each state adopted alternative strategies that sought to mitigate potential declines in the enrollment of students of color. These strategies included various versions of percentage plans that granted high school seniors automatic admissions to state universities. These policies, however, applied to undergraduate students, not those in graduate programs. Based on the timing of these alternative strategies and the time period in this study, my analysis may capture a lag effect of the percentage plan in Texas. That is, my analysis may include underrepresented students of color who may have been admitted to a college in Texas under the Top Ten Percent Plan in 1998, graduated within 4 years, and subsequently enrolled in a graduate field of study by 2003. It is also possible that faculty or administrators in various fields of study may have engaged in efforts to mitigate the potential decline in the enrollment of students of color after the bans. These possibilities would attenuate the estimated impact of the bans.</p>

<title>Conceptual analytic strategy: Difference-in-differences</title>
<p>In my analyses, I used a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, which employs a “before” and “after” comparison to estimate the effect of the affirmative action bans (the first difference), adjusting for secular changes in enrollment that could have taken place over the same periods irrespective of the bans through comparisons to similar institutions in states not affected by the bans (the second difference). This estimation strategy has been used in a number of important research studies to document the impact of policy changes on education outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002831212470483">Dynarski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002831212470483">Flores, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002831212470483">Kane, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002831212470483">Long, 2004</xref>) and is well suited for estimating the impact of the affirmative action bans on the enrollment rate of students of color in graduate programs. As a quasi-experimental method, however, this analytic strategy is nevertheless limited in its ability to support causal claims, and plausible alternative explanations for the findings must be considered and ruled out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002831212470483">Shadish, Cook, &amp; Campbell, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0002831212470483">9</xref></sup> As I explain in the following, I implemented the difference-in-differences estimation strategy in a Tobit multilevel regression framework to account for anomalies in the distribution of my outcome and address the hierarchical nature of the data (observations nested within institutions over time, nested within states).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0002831212470483">
<title>Data Sets</title>
<p>I analyzed data that had been aggregated, before I received them, up to the level of academic major from the CGS/GRE Survey of Graduate Enrollment and Degrees, a national survey cosponsored by the Council of Graduate Schools and Graduate Record Examinations Board. The CGS/GRE Survey includes responses from graduate-level institutions that are representative of all the graduate programs in the United States, outside the professional fields of medicine or law; participating institutions grant approximately 90% of the doctorates awarded each year in the United States and 75% of the nation’s master’s degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002831212470483">CGS, 2009</xref>). It is also the only annual survey that collects enrollment information by race and ethnicity across 51 distinct fields of study in graduate school; thus, it presents an informative data set for addressing this important policy question across a broad range of fields. Among other variables, these data also describe whether the institution was public or private, its total enrollment size, its Carnegie classification (based on the 200 Carnegie classification system), and the state where the institution was located. I merged these data with information on state demographics and labor market conditions from the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0002831212470483">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study is contextualized by important limitations of the data. First, the terms under which I was granted access to CGS/GRE Survey require the anonymity of the institutions. The removal of the names of the institutions presented limitations for my analysis because I was unable to include, and control for, additional specific institutional-level characteristics that may have influenced enrollment (e.g., school selectivity, average GRE scores, average tuition, and financial aid) and could have increased the precision of my estimates. The institutional-level (Carnegie classification) and state-level (demographics and socioeconomic characteristics) control variables included in the analysis, however, helped capture some information that overlapped with those characteristics, including school selectivity, which is arguably captured in part by Carnegie Classification. Second, the aggregate nature of the available data makes it more difficult to estimate the levels of the outcome with the same precision as with student-level information. As I explain in the following, I used a type of weight to account for the varying levels of precision with which I could estimate the outcome. Finally, student-level data—particularly at the application, admission, and enrollment stage—would allow for a more fine-grain and throughout disentangling of the impact of the bans in each of these stages. Such data across the broad range of graduate fields of study covered in this study, however, are not available.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0002831212470483">10</xref></sup> The outcome measure of enrollment nevertheless captures a policy-relevant impact of affirmative action bans because it allows us to understand how these policies are affecting the overall representation of students of color in graduate fields of study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0002831212470483">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>From all of the institutions that responded to the CGS/GRE Survey, I limited my sample to public institutions. I also excluded those that were classified as Historically Black Colleges and Universities; although these institutions have important graduate programs, they may not have responded to bans on affirmative action in a manner comparable to other institutions in the sample because they generally enroll high percentages of students of color. From that subset, I excluded institutions whose reported first-time enrollment values in a particular major were missing for students of all races across all years of the analytic window (1994–2003) or across a pre-ban or post-ban period for a respective state. In these cases, I assumed that the institution did not offer the major. Because the original survey instrument that each institution received listed all possible majors within a field of study, institutions that did not offer the major may have left enrollment figures in these majors blank. When institutions reported an enrollment number of zero for a certain race but not for other races or ethnicities, I assumed the institution offered the major but did not have students of that particular race or ethnicity enrolled in the program. Finally, I excluded institutions whose total enrollment numbers were not disaggregated by major; these institutions only reported enrollment totals across all majors and fields of study offered at the institution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0002831212470483">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>After imposing these limitations, I was left with 118 graduate institutions in the sample: 33 graduate institutions in the four target states that provided estimates of the first difference (Texas, California, Washington, and Florida) and 85 institutions in the comparison group that provided the required second difference. For this latter “comparison” group, I chose 17 states (Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Virginia) where the breadth of graduate programs, demographic characteristics, levels of educational attainment, and labor markets were comparable to those in my target states. Of the states that I considered including in my comparison group, I excluded 7 Southern states (Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, and South Carolina) because the public institutions in these states faced desegregation litigation during the period of investigation and therefore may not provide an untainted view of general underlying trends in enrollment. I also did not include the state of Michigan because of the ongoing litigation on affirmative action in the state during 2000 to 2003, which may have led individuals or institutions to respond in a manner that would not reflect general trends in the enrollment of students of color in graduate school. As I note in the following, my findings are robust to different compositions of the comparison group.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0002831212470483">Table 3</xref>, I present descriptive statistics on selected institutional and state characteristics for my sample. First, in the left columns, I provide the number of public institutions, in total and by Carnegie Classification (i.e., whether the institution is “research extensive,” “research intensive,” or “master’s”/“specialized”). As I show in the table, public institutions that are “research extensive” and “master’s/specialized” are represented across all the states with an affirmative action ban and most states in the comparison group, whereas institutions that are “research intensive” are underrepresented in the sample, limiting my ability to generalize findings to these institutions. In the right columns, I present summary statistics on selected state characteristics. Overall, the states are fairly comparable across these measures, with some exceptions where the percentage of the Latino population is substantially lower (Arkansas, Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, and Pennsylvania) or the percentage of the Native American population is substantially higher (New Mexico and Oklahoma) than the respective Latino or Native American population in the target states. However, in my statistical analyses, I included covariates that controlled for these demographic differences.</p>

<p>To model the impact of the affirmative action bans on the enrollment of students of color, I employed Tobit regression analysis. I chose this technique because exploratory analyses confirmed that the distributional properties of my outcome did not satisfy the usual normal-theory assumptions required by ordinary least squares (OLS) regression methods. For instance, the values of my outcome had a positively skewed distribution and were truncated in the lower tail at a value of zero while retaining a disproportionate number of zero values. It was not surprising that the outcome distribution contained many zero values as students of color are highly underrepresented in these graduate programs. In many cases, the distribution of a skewed variable can be rendered more symmetric by a <italic>log</italic> or <italic>logit</italic> transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0002831212470483">Ramsey &amp; Schafer, 2002</xref>). In my case, however, such transformations did not succeed because they could not separate from each other the many zero values that existed at the low end of the distribution.</p>
<p>To model outcomes with these distributional properties, researchers have used Tobit regression analysis (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002831212470483">Grogan-Kaylor &amp; Otis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002831212470483">Jacobs &amp; O’Brien, 1998</xref>). The approach, developed originally by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0002831212470483">Tobin (1958)</xref>, is a hybrid of Probit and OLS regression analysis. In the higher education context, for instance, the method has been used to analyze the determinants of out-of-state enrollments, where the outcome, percentage of enrollment, was also truncated in the lower tail at values of zero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831212470483">Mixon &amp; Hsing, 1994</xref>). For comparison purposes, I also replicate my main results using OLS regression analysis, though these estimates should be considered biased because any differences in the enrollment rates of students of color in fields where student of color enrollment can be higher or lower are averaged with differences in fields where enrollment can only remain at zero or be larger.</p>

<title>Statistical Model Specification</title>
<p>What is the impact of the statewide affirmative action bans in Texas, California, Washington, and Florida on the enrollment of underrepresented students of color within any of six selected fields of study—the natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, business, education, and humanities—at public institutions in these states? To address this question, I fitted the following multilevel Tobit regression model:</p>

<title>Weighting</title>
<p>I incorporated two types of weights into my Tobit regression analyses. The first were a set of inverse variance-based weights to account for differences in the level of precision with which the values of my outcome, which were proportions, were known.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0002831212470483">15</xref></sup> This had the effect of ensuring that observations whose proportions were known more precisely counted more heavily in the estimation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002831212470483">Afifi, Clark, &amp; May, 2004</xref>). I also used a second type of weight to account for the fact that my data were aggregated to the level of academic major and that graduate enrollment differed at various institutions. This second type of sampling weights ensured that institutions with a larger number of first-time enrolled students within a field of study were weighted more heavily in the model-fitting than those with a smaller number of first-time enrolled students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0002831212470483">16</xref></sup> I then multiplied the two types of weights together prior to including them in the analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0002831212470483">
<title>Sensitivity Analyses</title>
<p>In each phase of my analyses, I also conducted sensitivity analyses. First, I examined whether my main findings were robust to the use of a different year for ban implementation in California, using 1998 instead of 1997. Although the affirmative action ban implemented in California did not take effect until the class of 1998 entered graduate school, because of the public discussion and attention to the issue during the time it was being litigated, I anticipated the ban to have affected applications and enrollment decisions as early as the fall of 1997. Thus, it was important to consider whether my findings were robust to the choice of implementation year.</p>
<p>In a second set of sensitivity analyses, I modified the analytic window around the year of the bans, within which I fitted my statistical models (1994–2003). For a narrow analytic window, I selected the years 1996 to 2002 to allow for at least 1 year before the implementation of the first affirmative action ban in Texas and California and 1 year after the implementation of the last affirmative action ban in Florida. These sensitivity analyses helped me to determine whether the impact of the ban may have been more immediate than anticipated under my main analytic window. I also selected a broader analytic window, 1992 to 2005, allowing for 5 years before the implementation of the first ban in Texas and California and 5 years after the last ban in Florida. This analysis allowed me to determine whether the impact of the bans on student of color enrollment continued or was larger in magnitude than under my main analytic window.</p>
<p>In a third and final set of sensitivity analyses, I tested whether my results were robust to different compositions of the comparison group of states by refitting my principal statistical models with both a broader and a narrower selection of comparison states. In the broader group, I included all the states in the United States, with the exception of the 8 states that I excluded from all analyses because of the ongoing litigation related to desegregation or affirmative action at the time. My choice of this broader group of comparison states allowed me to see whether trends in the selected group of comparison states did reflect national trends in enrollment. My choice of the narrower sample of comparison states was based on the possibility that state-to-state student mobility into neighboring states may have influenced enrollment in the chosen group of comparison states. That is, it is possible that because of an affirmative action ban in a particular state, students may have chosen to enroll at institutions in nearby states without a ban, thereby elevating enrollments artificially in the chosen comparison group. If so, I assumed that students may have chosen to enroll in states that were close in geographic proximity. Thus, I selected a subset of the 17 comparison states in the main analysis—including only 10 states—that were closest in terms of breadth of graduate programs as well as other demographic and educational attainment characteristics, but not as close in geographic proximity as those in the main comparison group (Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia).</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Overall, I estimated that the percentage of students of color enrolled declined after the bans on affirmative action by about 2 percentage points in each of four of fields of study—natural sciences (1.5 percentage points), engineering (1.6 percentage points), and social sciences (1.9 percentage points)—and by about 1 percentage point in the humanities (1.2 percentage points). The impact in education (2 percentage points) is only marginally statistically significant, while consistently across models, there appears to be no impact in the field of business. In all my analyses, the results using Tobit and OLS regression methods were similar in magnitude and consistent in direction. Thus, for the sake of simplicity, I report only the Tobit results in all subsequent tables. In the following, I discuss how I arrived at these final estimates, which I then convert into overall percentage declines to better convey the magnitude of the declines in each field.</p>
<p>To obtain the estimates of the average effect of the affirmative action bans on the enrollment rates of graduate students of color by field of study, I fitted a taxonomy of models, which I present in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0002831212470483">Table 4</xref>. In Panel A, I present the results of fitting the statistical model in Equation 1, my basic model specification, without a state-specific year trend. In Panel A(1), I present the unweighted results, while in Panel A(2), I show the weighted results. Here, similar to the findings in the analysis for all fields, in the weighted analysis, the enrollment rates drop in magnitude in the fields of the natural sciences and engineering, suggesting that in these fields of study larger institutions may have experienced a lower drop in the enrollment of students of color than did smaller institutions. By contrast, it appears that in the humanities, larger institutions may have experienced a larger decline in the enrollment rates of students of color than smaller ones since in the weighted analysis the negative effect of the bans is larger in magnitude and becomes statistically significant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0002831212470483">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>Final model selected from results of goodness-of-fit tests comparing the change in −2LL between fitted models in Panel A(2) and those in Panel B(2). All models include state fixed effects and a full set of institutional- and state-level covariates; institutional-level covariates include whether the institution is research extensive (vs. research intensive or master’s/specialized); state-level covariates include percentage of population by race (White, Black, Native American, Latino, Asian), percentage of population with a bachelor’s degree, and percentage of 25- to 34-year-olds unemployed. Models without a state-specific year trend include year fixed effects; models with state-specific year trend do not include year fixed effects to avoid collinearity. All models account for the clustering of observations within institution over time (with institutional random effects) and within state (with state fixed effects). The 17 comparison states include Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.</p>

<p>In Panel B, I show the results of fitting the statistical model in Equation 2, my augmented model with a state-specific year trend, and compare the findings from the unweighted and weighted analyses, respectively. By allowing the year trend to differ by state (assuming a linear trend), the negative impact of the bans on the enrollment rates of students of color is larger in magnitude in three of the six fields: the natural sciences, engineering, and humanities (compare Panels A[1] and B[1] and Panels A[2] and B[2]). The estimates drop in magnitude once the results are weighted in the natural sciences, engineering, and education, suggesting, again, that—in these fields—larger institutions may have experienced a lower decline in the enrollment of students of color than did smaller institutions. Finally, a statistically significant impact in the social sciences emerges once I weight the analyses and allow the year trend to differ by state.</p>
<p>Because of the importance of adjusting for the varying levels of precision with which I can estimate enrollment rates, and for the size of the enrollment in each field, I prefer the estimates of the impact of the ban on the enrollment of students of color from the fitted models in Panels A(2) and B(2) rather than Panels A(1) and B(1). To select the most parsimonious model, I conducted goodness-of-fit tests that compared the change in negative 2 likelihood (–2LL) deviance statistic in the weighted models that included a state-specific time trends and those that did not. The results of these tests indicated that inclusion of the state-specific year trend improved the prediction of the impact of the bans in all the fields of study, except in the humanities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0002831212470483">18</xref></sup></p>

<p>In Panel C, I display the results for different analytic windows: (1) a narrow analytic window, 1996 to 2002, which covered at least 1 year before the first affirmative action bans took effect in Texas and California and 1 year after the last ban in Florida, and (2) a broad window, 1992 to 2005, which included 5 years before the implementation of the first ban in Texas and California and 5 years after the last ban in Florida. With a narrow analytic window, the estimated effect of the bans on the enrollment of students of color remains negative and of relatively similar magnitude as that in the main analysis in the natural sciences, engineering, and social sciences, though not in the fields of education and the humanities, where it loses its statistical significance. This change may be expected when analyses are conducted in a narrower analytic window, which reduces my statistical power to detect the effect of the bans automatically. These results also indicate that it may have taken longer for the bans on affirmative action to have had an impact in the fields of education and the humanities. With a broad analytic window, the estimated effect also remains negative and of similar magnitude across fields, with a slightly larger negative effect in the field of social sciences, an additional 1 percentage point drop.</p>
<p>My main results are also robust to the different compositions of the comparison group: (1) a broader sample of all states in the United States with the 8 excluded states and (2) a subset of the selected group of comparison states. As I show in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0002831212470483">Table 5</xref>, the results in Panels D(1) and D(2) are about the same as those in Panel A. The consistency of my findings with the different compositions of the comparison states suggests that the selected 17 states in the main analysis reflected national trends in graduate enrollment. With a narrow sample of comparison states, the negative impact of the bans is slightly larger in magnitude in all fields except the natural sciences and engineering. These results support the possibility that students in non–science-related fields may have chosen to enroll in geographically close-by states without a ban.</p>

<sec id="section18-0002831212470483">
<title>Understanding the Magnitude of These Declines</title>
<p>To better understand the magnitude of these results and allow for comparisons across fields, I convert the estimated percentage point declines discussed previously into an overall percentage decline in each field.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0002831212470483">19</xref></sup> For instance, in engineering, the average percentage of all graduate students enrolled who were students of color across all target states in the sample—before affirmative action bans were implemented—was about 6.2%. The estimated 1.6 percentage point drop from my analyses thus represents a drop in student of color enrollment to about 4.6%. Expressed as a fraction of the initial value, this represents a 26% (or over a fourth) decline in student of color enrollment in engineering.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0002831212470483">20</xref></sup> Similarly, the decline in the natural sciences is about 19% (from 7.8% to 6.3%). In the social sciences, the decline is about 15.7% (from 12.1% to 10.2%) and in the humanities is about 11.8% (from 10.2% to 9%). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0002831212470483">Figure 1</xref> illustrates these findings.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.3102_0002831212470483-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In terms of individual students, these declines confirm an average of 12 fewer underrepresented students of color in engineering in total across these states, an average of about 21 fewer students of color in the natural sciences, an average of 10 fewer students of color in the social sciences, and an average of 8 fewer students of color in the humanities. These numbers reflect the low representation of underrepresented students of color in most of these fields. Before affirmative action bans, for example, of all the students enrolled across all four states in the field of engineering (about 648), only about 40 students were underrepresented students of color. Of all the students enrolled in the natural sciences (about 1,270), only about 100 students were underrepresented students of color. Given the already minimal representation of students of color in these fields, even a small numerical decline can have important consequences for the educational experiences of all students in these programs.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Implications</title>
<p>Past studies have shown that the enrollment rates of students of color at selective undergraduate institutions, in the professions of law and medicine, and across graduate studies, have declined following the implementation of affirmative action bans. This study builds on this work by examining the impact of the affirmative action bans in Texas, California, Florida, and Washington within various graduate fields of study. Results show that after the implementation of affirmative action bans, the greatest declines in the proportion of enrolled graduate students who are students of color took place in the fields of engineering (26%), natural sciences (19%), and the social sciences (15.2%)—fields where students of color are already the most underrepresented—with a slightly lower decline in the humanities (11.8%). There is no impact of the bans on the enrollment rates of underrepresented students of color in the field of business and education, where the impact was only marginally statistically significant.</p>
<sec id="section20-0002831212470483">
<title>Do These Reductions Matter?</title>
<p>These results represent meaningful reductions in graduate fields of study, particularly in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, where a difference of a few graduate students of color in the classroom can have important consequences for the experiences of all students. The social and cultural climate in science-related fields like STEM is one of the leading barriers to the persistence of women of color in STEM career trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002831212470483">Ong, Wright, Espinosa, &amp; Orfield, 2011</xref>). A large survey study of women of color in STEM graduate programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002831212470483">Brown, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002831212470483">2000</xref>) revealed that isolation, racism, and being racially/ethnically identifiable, among other climate factors, present more difficulty for the persistence of women of color than structural factors, such as financial aid or the composition of the faculty. Thus, a decline of a few students of color in a field like engineering can make it remarkably more challenging for students of color to persist through their program.</p>
<p>Racial and ethnic diversity in the student body has educational value for all students. Thus, a less racially and ethnically diverse student body deprives students across all races and ethnicities of these benefits, such as enhanced critical and complex thinking skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002831212470483">Gurin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831212470483">Gurin, Dey, Hurtado, &amp; Gurin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0002831212470483">Pascarella, Bohr, Nora, &amp; Terenzini, 1996</xref>), improved cross-racial understanding and cultural awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002831212470483">Milem, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831212470483">1994</xref>), civic engagement (Bowen &amp; Bok, 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002831212470483">Chang, Astin, &amp; Kim, 2004</xref>), and cross-cultural workforce competencies and leadership skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002831212470483">Jayakumar, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0002831212470483">21</xref></sup> In many graduate fields of study, these benefits are critical for understanding the issues being researched, preparing individuals for effective professional practice in multiracial settings, and fostering creativity and innovation through the embrace of multiple perspectives (see e.g., Harvey &amp; Allard, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002831212470483">Page 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>These are also meaningful declines for institutional outreach, recruitment, and support efforts. In graduate studies, the racial and ethnic characteristics of the student body can play an important role in the decisions of students of color to apply or enroll in a field of study. This is because the presence of students of color can help other students of color feel more welcome at an institution; and if none or only a few students of color are enrolled, students risk the possibility of being “tokenized” in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002831212470483">Chang, Eagan, Lin, &amp; Hurtado, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0002831212470483">Steele, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0002831212470483">Taylor &amp; Antony, 2000</xref>). Thus, in science-related fields, where students of color are already severely underrepresented, a drop of one or two students of color can have negative long-term consequences on the decision of other students of color to apply or enroll in these fields. These challenges can make institutional efforts that attempt to mitigate the negative impact of not being able to consider race in admissions, through their outreach and recruitment efforts, more difficult.</p>
<p>These declines can also have long-term effects on faculty diversity in these fields since doctoral training and graduate degree acquisition feed into faculty positions. In STEM fields, faculty play a critical role in influencing the decisions of students to attend graduate school, choose a particular program, and pursue a STEM career (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002831212470483">Gasman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0002831212470483">Ong, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0002831212470483">Sader, 2007</xref>). Faculty perspectives and research trajectories also have long-lasting effects on the scientific inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831212470483">Espinosa, 2011</xref>). Declines in the number of students of color who can become future faculty members in science-related fields thus have long-term consequences for the learning experiences of students and the types of research studies that are conducted.</p>

<title>Differences by Field of Study and Implications for Institutions and Future Research</title>
<p>Given that students of color are generally underrepresented at higher score percentiles on standardized tests and generally overrepresented at lower percentiles (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002831212470483">Bowen &amp; Bok, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002831212470483">Diaz, 1990</xref>), it is not surprising that the impact of affirmative action bans is greater in science-related fields like engineering (26%), natural sciences (17%), and social sciences (15.2%), compared to the humanities (11.8%) or education (where the impact is not statistically significant). This is because the overall mean score for standardized tests like the GRE, particularly in the quantitative portion of the test, is generally higher in these fields than in the humanities and education fields. Moreover, as I noted in the hypothesis section, the general characteristics of graduate students in less technically focused fields of education (and similarly humanities) suggest that past work experience may be an important factor that plays into students’ decisions to pursue study in these fields or in faculty’s admissions decisions. These other factors may thus balance the negative impact of affirmative action bans in these fields.</p>
<p>The higher mean standardized test scores in science-related fields are the result of a combination of factors, including the characteristics of students who self-select into these fields (in the application or enrollment stage) as well as the factors that faculty may consider in admissions processes. Although the outcome measure of enrollment allows us to understand how these policies are affecting the overall representation of students of color in various graduate fields of study, the available data do not allow me to disentangle the impact at these various stages. Future research may consider the impact of affirmative action bans on these series of events and provide a more thorough understanding of the effect of these policies on the decisions of students to apply to and, if admitted, enroll in a particular program as well as in the admissions decisions by faculty, administrators, or other institutional actors.</p>
<p>The decline in the field of engineering, over a fourth, is almost as large as the declines in the enrollment of students of color in the professional field of law as a result of affirmative action bans (nearly two-thirds for African Americans and a third for Latinos) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831212470483">Kidder, 2003</xref>). As in the field of law, which provides the training for many of the future leaders of our nation, these fields provide students with specialized training critical to the nation’s ability to compete in a globalized market and for ensuring continued scientific and technological advancement. Declines in racial and ethnic student body diversity in science-related fields like engineering and the natural sciences pose serious long-term consequences for our nation. Future studies should examine how changes in the social climate as a result of these declines, or as a result of the implementation of affirmative action bans, affect the persistence of students of color in these fields, as well as institutional outreach, recruitment, and support efforts. We also need a better understanding of the long-term consequences of these declines for faculty diversity in STEM fields, where mentorship and role models, including faculty, serve as a vital element in the persistence of students of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002831212470483">Brown, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002831212470483">2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Banning race as a plus-factor in admissions in graduate fields of study also has consequences that should motivate educators to reconsider their admissions practices and consider additional factors that would contribute to a racially and ethnically diverse student body, such as diverse experiences, potential to contribute to research, community involvement or service, research activity on and off campus, and creativity in problem solving. Moreover, standardized test scores should be considered in light of family circumstances (parental educational levels and socioeconomic status) or other contextual factors (existing community resources, geographic location) that have been shown to be highly correlated with performance on standardized tests like the GRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002831212470483">Educational Testing Service, 2011</xref>). In fact, given the limited predictive validity of the GRE, the Educational Testing Service discourages use of a GRE score as the sole or best indicator of achievement and academic ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002831212470483">Educational Testing Service, 2011</xref>). Graduate programs should revise their practices to follow these recommendations by placing little emphasis on—or altogether eliminate—GRE scores, not only as a factor in admissions, but also in determining research assistantships and other forms of financial support.</p>
<p>As institutions struggle to increase the representation of students of color in graduate programs, particularly in STEM fields, the findings from this study suggest that bans on affirmative action are inhibiting these efforts, causing declines in the enrollment of students of color in fields that are critical to the economic competitiveness of the United States and where students of color are already severely underrepresented. Graduate education programs will need to rise to the challenge and adopt innovative outreach and recruitment practices and adopt admissions criteria to help reverse this trend.</p>

<p>These differences are not necessarily indicative of innate intelligence or potential for achievement. As research by the Educational Testing Service (ETS), which created the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), has shown, GRE performance is strongly correlated with family income and background (Pennock-Roman &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0002831212470483">Educational Testing Service, 1994</xref>). The predictive validity of the GRE for graduate student success is also limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002831212470483">ETS, 2011</xref>).

<p>By contrast, the highest verbal GRE score mean was in the humanities (669), followed by social sciences (601), sciences and mathematics (575), engineering (562), and education (556).

<p>An ideal project would collect student-level information at each of these three stages directly from all of the institutions considered in this study. However, the feasibility of collecting such information is questionable, particularly given the controversial political climate surrounding affirmative action in which institutions face the threat of litigation with the mere appearance that they are considering race in their admissions policies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002831212470483">Miksch, 2008</xref>). Collecting the information is also particularly challenging in the context of graduate studies because admissions processes are not centralized across different fields of studies and programs, as they may be in undergraduate studies.</p>

<p>Before any sample restrictions, my beginning sample size in the four target states and selected comparison group included a total of 374 institutions: 91 in my four target states and 283 in the comparison group. By excluding private institutions and those that were classified as Historically Black Colleges and Universities, I eliminated a total of 188 institutions: 41 in my four target states and 147 in the comparison group. From the remaining 186 institutions, I eliminated a total of 38 institutions (6 in my target states and 32 in the comparison group) by excluding institutions whose reported first-time enrollment values in a particular major were missing for students of all races across all years of the analytic window or across a pre-ban or post-ban period for a respective state. From the remaining 148 institutions, I excluded a total of 30 institutions (11 in my target states and 19 in the comparison states) whose reported first-time enrollment values were not disaggregated by major or field of study. These institutions do not differ from those included in the study on important characteristics.</p>

<p>This specification of the multilevel model uses a combination of fixed and random effects to account for the nesting of observations at the state and institutional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002831212470483">Murnane &amp; Willett, 2010</xref>).

<p>Because of the aggregate-level nature of my data—where each observation is a combination of different observations, such as different underlying number of majors and number of students who make up a particular field of study at an institution—each observation had a different level of precision, or variability. The variance-based weights were inversely proportional to the variance of each observation (w = 1/y × (1 − y)).</p>

<p>The difference in −2LL in the field of natural sciences (52.94), engineering (26.08), the social sciences (36.12), business (80.82), and education (48.02) were all greater than the respective critical value from a chi-square distribution at an alpha level of 5% and the respective degrees of freedom. Thus, I rejected the null hypotheses that the parameters associated with the state-specific year trend were simultaneously zero in the population. The difference in −2LL in the humanities (−5.91) was less than the critical value from a chi-square distribution at an alpha level of 5% and 41 degrees of freedom (56.95); thus, in this case, I could not reject the null hypothesis and concluded that the state-specific year trend did not help better predict the effect of affirmative action bans in this field.</p>

<p>To obtain the overall percentage decline, I first estimated the proportion of underrepresented students of color who were enrolled within each field across all the target states in the sample before any of the bans were implemented in each target state (1994–1996 in Texas and California, 1994–1998 in Washington, and 1994–2000 in Florida). I did not include years when the bans on affirmative action were in effect because enrollment in those years would presumably already reflect the negative impact of the bans and, as such, would bias the overall average. From this figure, I then subtracted the estimated impact of the ban.</p>

<p>A drop from 6.2% to 4.6% can be expressed in two ways: (1) as a drop of 1.6 percentage points or (2) as a drop of about 26%. The first approach expresses the change as a stand-alone unit that denotes the arithmetic difference between the two percentages. The second approach expresses the change as a fraction of the initial value—that is, a drop to 4.6% from an initial value of 6.2 is a drop by a fraction of .046/.062 = .742; expressed as a percentage, this is a drop of about 26%. In this study, I adopt the latter approach to express the change because it allows for better comparisons of the impact of the bans across fields as the baseline percentage of student of color enrollment is different in each field.</p>
