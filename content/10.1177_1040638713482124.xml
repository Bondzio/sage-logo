<p>Histology is often underutilized in aquatic animal disease screening and diagnostics. The agreement between histological classifications of infection and results using diagnostic testing from the American Fisheries Society’s Blue Book was conducted with 4 common salmon pathogens: <italic>Aeromonas salmonicida, Renibacterium salmoninarum, Ceratomyxa shasta</italic>, and <italic>Nanophyetus salmincola</italic>. Adult Chinook salmon (<italic>Oncorhynchus tshawytsch</italic>a) in Oregon were evaluated, and agreement between tests was calculated. Live and dead (both pre- and postspawning) salmon were collected from the Willamette River, Oregon, its tributaries, the Willamette Hatchery, and after holding in cool, pathogen-free water during maturation at Oregon State University. Sensitivity and specificity of histology compared to Blue Book methods for all fish, live fish only, and dead (pre- and postspawned combined) fish only were, respectively, as follows: <italic>A. salmonicida</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 105): specificity 87.5%, 87.5%, 87.5% and sensitivity 38.6%, 14.8%, 60.0%; <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 111): specificity 91.9%, 85.7%, 97.7% and sensitivity 16.0%, 7.1%, 27.2%; <italic>C. shasta</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 136): specificity 56.0%, 63.3%, 28.6% and sensitivity 83.3%, 86.2%, 71.4%; <italic>N. salmincola</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 228): specificity 68.2%, 66.7%, not possible to calculate for dead fish and sensitivity 83.5%, 80.5%, 87.3%. The specificity was good for bacterial pathogens. This was not the case for <italic>C. shasta</italic>, likely due to detection of presporogenic forms only by histology. Sensitivity of histology for bacterial pathogens was low with the exception of dead fish with <italic>A. salmonicida</italic>. Kappa analysis for agreement between Blue Book and histology methods was poor to moderate. However, histological observations revealed the presence of other pathogens that would not be detected by other methods.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Histology is often used for disease investigation in terrestrial animals but is less frequently used with investigations that involve fishes, particularly salmonids in public hatcheries in the United States. This is because the pathogens of captive salmonids are well recognized, and morbidity events are usually investigated with wet mount preparations of tissues for parasites and a variety of microbiological diagnostic tests that target specific known pathogens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638713482124">1</xref></sup> Histology, however, has the advantage of identifying a wide variety of expected and unknown pathogens, as well as lesions. Therefore, this method provides a powerful tool for establishing the cause of morbidity at a tissue and organ level.</p>
<p>Given that other diagnostic tests, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture, are generally more sensitive and specific than histology for detecting pathogens in tissues, the latter is less frequently used for surveys for specific pathogens in large populations of clinically normal animals. Nevertheless, a few studies have used histology as a primary method for screening populations of fish for a wide variety of pathogens and lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638713482124">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1040638713482124">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1040638713482124">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1040638713482124">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1040638713482124">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1040638713482124">45</xref></sup> or when toxicopathic changes are a target endpoint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1040638713482124">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1040638713482124">48</xref></sup> Successful studies using histology to survey for pathogens and associated lesions in salmonids have been reported in the Pacific Northwest of the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638713482124">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1040638713482124">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1040638713482124">44</xref></sup> and in British Columbia, Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1040638713482124">45</xref></sup> Histological changes were also an endpoint in a recent investigation of cause of mortality in coho salmon (<italic>Oncorhynchus kisutch</italic>),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1040638713482124">46</xref></sup> and a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638713482124">8</xref></sup> used histology to describe lesions in sockeye salmon (<italic>Oncorhynchus nerka</italic>) associated with prespawn mortality (PSM). For the past decade, PSM of adult Chinook salmon in the Willamette River system, Oregon, has been extremely elevated (≤90% in some cases).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1040638713482124">26</xref></sup> Therefore, an ongoing multiyear study investigating PSM using histology to compare lesions and pathogens in PSM fish to asymptomatic prespawn and postspawn salmon was implemented. The sampling provided an opportunity to compare histology with other diagnostic tests.</p>
<p>Diagnostic methods described in the American Fisheries Society Fish Health Section (AFS-FHS) Blue Book<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638713482124">1</xref></sup> (henceforth referred to as the Blue Book) represent a collection of recommended protocols used by most fish health laboratories in the United States for identification of the most serious pathogens found in salmonid and other food fishes. The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of histology to Blue Book methods for detection of 4 common pathogens of salmon: <italic>Aeromonas salmonicida, Renibacterium salmoninarum, Ceratomyxa shasta</italic>, and <italic>Nanophyetus salmincola</italic>.</p>

<title>Samples and diagnostic methods</title>
<p>A range of clinical and subclinical Chinook salmon from the Willamette River system, Oregon, was used to compare histological findings to the traditional Blue Book protocols. These protocols are contained in 2 sections on diagnostics, Diagnostic Procedures for Finfish and Shellfish Pathogens and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services/AFS-FHS Standard Procedures for the Aquatic Animal Health Inspections,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638713482124">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1040638713482124">50</xref></sup> and are consistent with the presumptive and confirmatory diagnostic tests set forth by other countries and organizations, including the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1040638713482124">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Adult Chinook salmon were collected from the Willamette River, its tributaries, and the Willamette Hatchery on this watershed between May and September 2010 and 2011. Samples included dead fish (prespawn mortalities and, rarely, postspawn mortalities), healthy fish collected midsummer, and postspawn fish collected in September. Dead fish were collected from the rivers by staff from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) or colleagues from Idaho State University, Moscow, Idaho. Healthy fish were collected from fish traps at either the Willamette Falls or Dexter fish facilities on the Willamette River, and postspawned fish were collected from either the river or the Willamette Hatchery. Also included were samples of adult Chinook that were collected from the river early in the summer and held at the Fish Performance and Genetics Laboratory (FPGL; Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon) until death before spawning or euthanasia after spawning. For the “dead fish,” only fish that were deemed to be relatively fresh (i.e., recently died) by the presence of red color in the gill were included in the study. Following collection, fish from all locations were placed in individual plastic bags, on ice, and then transported to Oregon State University for necropsy, which was performed on all fish within 24 hr of collection.</p>

<title>Histology</title>
<p>Heart, brain, gills, liver, spleen, kidney, pyloric caeca, and lower intestine samples were preserved in 10% buffered formalin. Tissues were then processed using standard histological methods and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Four slides were prepared from tissues of each fish to assure adequate amounts of tissue for analysis as follows: 1) posterior kidney, liver, spleen, heart ventricle; 2) cross-sections of several pyloric cecae and lower intestine; 3) 3–5 gill filaments including the base; and 4) brain. Special stains, such as periodic acid–Schiff and Gram stain, often allow for visualization of <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic> in tissue sections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1040638713482124">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1040638713482124">27</xref></sup> Previous observations by the authors have found that this bacterium is inconsistently positive with these stains in sections, and thus special stains were not employed in the present study.</p>

<sec id="section5-1040638713482124">
<title>Diagnostic criteria for traditional tests and histology</title>
<p>Traditional microbiological tests were performed in collaboration with staff at the Fish Health Services (ODFW; Corvallis, Oregon), using the laboratory’s routine conducted Blue Book methods. Specific tests for each pathogen are described in the following.</p>
<sec id="section6-1040638713482124">
<title>Aeromonas salmonicida</title>
<p>For the traditional test, inocula from excretory kidneys were obtained and streaked on tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates incubated at 18°C for 5 to 7 days. A sample was considered positive when brown, diffuse pigment was associated with colonies that tested oxidase positive. Infections by <italic>A. salmonicida</italic> at the histological level presented with a distinct pattern of bacterial colonies compared to most other Gram-negative bacterial infections of fish. Small bacilli bacterial colonies can occur in several organs (spleen, liver, kidney, gill, heart, and intestine) and are characterized by a distinct lack of inflammatory response and minimal or no associated necrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638713482124">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1040638713482124">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1040638713482124">24</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1040638713482124">
<title>Renibacterium salmoninarum</title>
<p>The Blue Book lists the direct fluorescent antibody test (DFAT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), PCR, and culture as confirmatory tests, while section 2 of the Blue Book<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1040638713482124">50</xref></sup> restricts confirmatory diagnosis to the DFAT. The ELISA p57 antigen test, using a polyclonal antibody, was used as the traditional test for <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic> following the protocol as described in the Blue Book<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638713482124">1</xref></sup> and was conducted by ODFW Fish Health Services laboratory as they have an ongoing project that entails ELISA testing on fish from the Willamette Hatchery, Oregon. The tests were conducted with frozen kidney samples from the samples collected from the river system or the FPGL. As this is a quantitative test, 4 categories of antigen based on optical density were designated as follows: negative = &lt;0.100; low = 0.100–0.199, medium = 0.200–0.499, high = &gt;0.5000.</p>
<p>Several fish were diagnosed as ELISA positive and histology negative, or vice versa. Therefore, kidneys of 24 fish were examined by the DFAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638713482124">4</xref></sup> in an attempt to elucidate the cause of the discrepancy. Previously frozen kidney tissue was homogenized with a stomacher in plastic bags, and 10 µl of the resulting fluid was spread thinly on a slide. Slides were processed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638713482124">4</xref></sup> and read with a fluorescent microscope by ODFW staff, with no prior knowledge of histology or ELISA results. Slides were scored based on numbers of fluorescing bacteria observed per field at 1,000× (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1040638713482124">Table 3</xref>). For the categorization of infections using the DFAT, all fish with any evidence of bacteria were considered positive when they had a score <underline>≤</underline>1+. Subsequently, the kappa analysis was re-run using a different positive cutoff where only the fish that had a score &gt;1+ were categorized as positive.</p>
<p>Bacterial kidney disease (BKD), caused by <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic>, is characterized at the histological level by multifocal, chronic, granulomatous inflammation, particularly in the kidney. Diagnosis of <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic> infection (i.e., BKD) was made when focal or locally extensive chronic inflammation or granulomas were observed in the kidney, liver, or spleen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1040638713482124">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1040638713482124">38</xref></sup> For histology therefore, tissues scored as positive were those with nonencapsulated granulomatous lesions in the kidney, spleen, or liver in the absence of parasites.</p>

<sec id="section8-1040638713482124">
<title>Ceratomyxa shasta</title>
<p>This pathogenic myxozoan targets the gastrointestinal tract, where it is associated with severe damage to the pyloric cecae, stomach, and lower intestine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638713482124">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1040638713482124">23</xref></sup> The lesions are associated with presporogenic forms and myxospores, and severe infections extend through all layers of the gut and progress to extraintestinal organs. Presumptive diagnosis of <italic>C. shasta</italic> in the Blue Book is based on detection of myxospores in wet mount preparations of the intestine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638713482124">5</xref></sup> The confirmatory diagnosis is obtained on observing myxospores of the appropriate size and morphology. Confirmatory diagnosis can also be obtained by a monoclonal antibody test or PCR tests, which are described in the Blue Book.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638713482124">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1040638713482124">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>For the present study, wet mount examinations of lower intestine for the presence of <italic>C. shasta</italic> were performed using standard procedures in concordance with the Blue Book,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638713482124">5</xref></sup> and the preparation was examined for 2 min at 200× magnification before it was designated as negative. For histology, the parasite had to be identified in the intestinal epithelium as basophilic, spherical, multicellular organisms with small nuclei, typical of myxozoan presporogenic stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638713482124">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638713482124">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1040638713482124">23</xref></sup></p>

<p>The metacercarial stage of <italic>N. salmincola</italic> is a common parasite of salmonid fishes in western Oregon, Washington, and northern California.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638713482124">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1040638713482124">34</xref></sup> The infection is contracted in freshwater areas where the intermediate snail host <italic>Juga plicifera</italic> is present.

<title>Diagnostic test comparisons</title>
<p>Histology was compared to the Blue Book<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638713482124">1</xref></sup> diagnostic procedure because such procedures are the traditional tests used to screen subclinical populations. The tests are used by most governmental fish health laboratories in the United States, and section 2 of the Blue Book is comprised of the specific protocols for these tests that U.S. Fish and Wildlife laboratories are required to follow. Considering the wide acceptance of the Blue Book protocols, particularly by regulatory agencies, such protocols were designated as the gold standard in the present study. The kappa statistic (test for overall agreement) for histology and the Blue Book–approved test for each pathogen of interest were initially calculated separately using GraphPad QuickCalcs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/Kappa2.cfm">http://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/Kappa2.cfm</ext-link>). Due to the generally poor agreement between tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1040638713482124">Table 2</xref>), the agreement for infected (sensitivity) and uninfected (specificity) fish between histology and the Blue Book–preferred test was assessed for each pathogen separately. This was performed by dividing the number of infected or uninfected fish found by histology by the total number of infected or uninfected fish as determined by the Blue Book–preferred test; the calculation researchers used to identify where the disagreement between tests was occurring. The 95% confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity of histology based on the results of the standard tests described in the Blue Book were determined for each pathogen using the Clinical Calculator 1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vassarstats.net/clin1.html">http://www.vassarstats.net/clin1.html</ext-link>). In addition to calculating the overall agreement for infected and uninfected fish when all samples were included in the analysis, these measures were also calculated for fish that were found dead (clinical population) and for healthy fish separately. The sensitivity and specificity of histology for clinical and subclinical populations were found by comparing the 95% confidence intervals.</p>
<p>In addition, for <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic>, because 2 tests are approved in the Blue Book, the agreement between histology and both of these tests (DFAT and ELISA) were calculated separately. Further, the overall agreement was calculated using a kappa statistic between the 2 approved Blue Book tests.</p>

<p>Infections by this bacterium were diagnosed in several live and dead fish by culture, and less frequently in live fish by histology (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1040638713482124">Table 1</xref>). The overall kappa statistic showed poor agreement but was improved when only dead fish were evaluated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1040638713482124">Table 2</xref>). The ability of histology to detect fish that tested positive by culture was relatively poor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1040638713482124">Table 2</xref>), as 35 of 57 (61.4%) culture-positive fish were negative by histology.

<p>A total of 111 fish were available that had both complete histology and ELISA values, including both live and dead fish (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1040638713482124">Table 1</xref>). The overall agreement between histology and the 2 approved screening tests for <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic> was low (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1040638713482124">Table 2</xref>). The agreement between test results when fish were classified as positive by ELISA was very low (sensitivity = 16%); however, most of the ELISA-positive fish that tested negative by histology only had low ELISA optical density (OD) readings (0.100–0.2000). Shifting the positive cutoff threshold to increase the OD reading for positives improved the sensitivity of histology slightly to 23.5%. The ability of histology to detect <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic> lesions was slightly better when results were compared to those of the DFAT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1040638713482124">Table 2</xref>), but the 95% confidence intervals overlapped, suggesting the difference was not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there was very poor agreement (kappa = 0.290) between the ELISA and DFAT on the subgroup of samples evaluated using these 2 approved tests. Agreement was improved (kappa = 0.615) when light DFAT infections (&lt;1 bacteria per 1,000× field) were reclassified as negative because the disagreement between the tests was mostly due to samples that tested low positive on DFAT and negative on the ELISA. Despite the stricter DFAT cutoff, 4 out of 18 negative ELISA tests were still positive on DFAT. The DFAT results for fish that were histology positive and ELISA negative was of particular interest. Here, 2 of the 6 fish were also negative by DFAT. Both fish were diagnosed as positive for <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic> based on observation of granulomas in the liver, which were absent in the kidney and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1040638713482124">Fig. 1e</xref>).

Extraintestinal infections were also observed in a few fish with intestinal infections, which were characterized by focal infections, usually in the liver, in which numerous trophozoites and spores were associated with severe necrosis and chronic inflammation.

<title>Selected diagnostic examples</title>
<p>With a total of 259 fish that were evaluated in the current study, it is beyond the scope of this article to describe diagnostic results for each fish. However, the following are examples demonstrating the possibility of misdiagnoses of disease if histology was not employed. One moribund fish was negative for <italic>C. shasta</italic> and positive for <italic>A. salmonicida</italic> using traditional tests, but histological examination revealed severe, invasive ceratomyxosis of the intestine and pyloric cecae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1040638713482124">Fig. 1d</xref>) and no bacterial colonies in the tissues. Hence, without histology, coinfection with <italic>C. shasta</italic> would not have been detected. Another fish was <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic> positive by the ELISA (OD = 0.1355) and negative for <italic>C. shasta</italic> in wet mounts. Histology revealed no granulomatous lesions consistent with <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic> and profound intestinal infection by <italic>C. shasta</italic>. If histology had not been employed, the primary diagnosis would have been BKD (<italic>R. salmoninarum</italic> infection), and ceratomyxosis would have gone undetected. Bacterial kidney disease in this case was most likely secondary to <italic>C. shasta</italic> based on the pathology. In addition, histological examinations revealed infections by <italic>Parvicapsula minibicornis</italic> in the kidney and <italic>Myxobolus</italic> sp. in the hind brain in many fish. Occasional infections by anisakine nematode larvae in the mesenteries, adult tapeworms (probably <italic>Eubothrium</italic> sp.) in the gut lumen, <italic>Myxidium</italic> sp. in the kidney, <italic>Loma salmonae</italic> in the heart, and <italic>Ichthyophthirius multifiliis</italic> and gill copepods (<italic>Salmincola californiensis</italic>) were also observed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Histology is commonly used in terrestrial animals to aid in the diagnosis of disease. This technique is particularly appropriate when the etiology of a disease is initially unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1040638713482124">44</xref></sup> or to differentiate between primary and secondary causes of death. In the present study, the use of histology resulted in a different primary diagnosis than what would have been achieved using only the traditional Blue Book tests for a few fish examined. However, data generated from the current study suggest histology will miss subclinical infections with at least 2 common bacterial pathogens found in the Pacific Northwest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1040638713482124">Table 2</xref>). In general, the ability of histology to identify infected animals was improved when only dead fish were evaluated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1040638713482124">Table 2</xref>). In these cases, histology also had the benefit of detecting other pathogens and pathology associated with noninfectious agents.</p>
<p>Covert infections with <italic>A. salmonicida</italic> in salmonids have been recognized since the pathogen was described approximately 100 years ago.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1040638713482124">24</xref></sup> In the present study, the bacterium was cultured from many of the apparently healthy fish in which it was not easily visualized by histology. It would be expected that culture would be better at detecting <italic>A. salmonicida</italic> infections than histology, as this bacterium grows well on TSA medium, resulting in exponential amplification of the agent. Therefore, the finding that not all fish with a positive culture tested positive by histology was not surprising. Assuming culture was properly identifying infected fish, removing “live fish,” which likely had light infections, from the analysis improved the sensitivity of histology, but approximately 40% of the infections were still missed.</p>
<p>A challenge that many fish health professionals face is the rapid decomposition of tissues after death. It is well recognized that culture of pathogenic bacteria from dead fish may be compromised by postmortem colonization of organs by rapidly growing, saprophytic bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract or water.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1040638713482124">35</xref></sup> Postmortem colonization of organs by bacteria was of particular concern for diagnosis of <italic>A. salmonicida</italic> by culture because TSA is not a selective medium and thus saprophytes from tissues of dead fish could easily overgrow the culture plates. Conversely, confusion of saprophytic bacteria that had colonized organs postmortem with <italic>A. salmonicida</italic> in histological sections was also a concern. A criterion used to identify postmortem bacteria colonization is the absence of an inflammatory response,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1040638713482124">35</xref></sup> and this is precisely the histological presentation of <italic>A. salmonicida</italic> in live fish.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1040638713482124">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1040638713482124">24</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the results indicate that postmortem problems did not compromise the ability to properly detect <italic>A. salmonicida</italic> colonies in tissues, and only 6 of 28 histology-positive fish were culture negative. If postmortem saprophytic bacteria were misidentified as <italic>A. salmonicida</italic>, then a decrease in agreement between histology and culture in the dead fish that tested negative on culture would have been expected, but this group actually showed both higher kappa scores and sensitivity (ability of the test to properly classify infected fish; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1040638713482124">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Histology was also poor at detecting <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic> infections compared to the other 2 approved Blue Book tests, particularly when infections occurred in live subclinical fish. <italic>Renibacterium salmoninarum</italic> often presents as a chronic disease, and subclinical infections are prevalent in Chinook salmon throughout the fish’s lifecycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638713482124">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1040638713482124">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1040638713482124">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1040638713482124">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1040638713482124">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1040638713482124">52</xref></sup> Therefore, it would be expected that many infected Chinook salmon are asymptomatic and that many of these fish would not exhibit lesions at a histological level. There are 2 studies comparing histology to other tests for <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic> infections. A laboratory transmission study with Chinook salmon showed excellent agreement between DFAT and histology on kidneys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1040638713482124">36</xref></sup> Another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638713482124">9</xref></sup> compared various tests for the bacterium, including ELISA, indirect FAT, Gram stain kidney imprints, histology, and PCR from Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic>) and rainbow trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) from 3 farms. More fish were diagnosed by ELISA and FATs than histology, but results were still comparable. In the present study, agreement between ELISA results and histology was rather poor. Disagreement between histology and ELISA occurred for both positive and negative ELISA results but was particularly poor for ELISA-positive fish (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1040638713482124">Table 2</xref>). The main purpose of ELISA is to screen healthy fish for subclinical infections, providing a ranking of level of infection based on the presence of the p57 bacterial protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1040638713482124">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1040638713482124"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1040638713482124">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1040638713482124">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1040638713482124"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1040638713482124">42</xref></sup> The ELISA is now used extensively in salmon hatcheries in western Canada and the United States to identify brood stock with the least risk for maternal transmission of the bacterium.</p>
<p>Analysis of kidney with the DFAT for <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic> was added to a subset of samples in an attempt to resolve the discrepancies in results between ELISA and histology. When the ELISA and DFAT (both Blue Book–recommended tests for <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic>) were compared, they did not agree very strongly (kappa = 0.29–0.615). Several of the fish that were histology negative but ELISA positive were also positive by DFAT, indicating that for detection of the bacterium, the 2 Blue Book tests are better at detecting infections than histology. Other researchers have found that ELISA is usually more sensitive than DFAT for <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1040638713482124">33</xref></sup> but the 2 tests are correlated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1040638713482124">39</xref></sup> In the current study, bacteria consistent with <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic> were observed in kidney smears stained with DFAT in several fish that were ELISA negative. Moreover, a few fish that were positive by histology and negative by ELISA were also negative by DFAT. Such conflicting results can be explained by the diagnostic endpoints of each test and by the nature of the infection and the associated lesions. Whereas the name of the disease caused by <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic> infection, BKD, refers to an infection primarily in the kidney, fish may exhibit the infection and lesions in other organs, such as the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638713482124">9</xref></sup> or brain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1040638713482124">47</xref></sup> without obvious kidney lesions. In the present study, granulomatous lesions were confined to the liver in both fish that were positive by histology but negative by the 2 other tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1040638713482124">Table 3</xref>). The findings of the present study continue to support several other studies comparing different diagnostic tests for this chronic, sometimes organ-specific, infection. Discrepancies in test results are likely due largely to different diagnostic criteria; ELISA evaluates the presence of a soluble antigen distributed throughout the fish, which may persist in recovered fish,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1040638713482124">41</xref></sup> DFAT directly visualizes intact bacteria in kidney tissue, and histology identifies the pathological effects of the infection in whichever organ is examined. The current study indicates that none of the tests evaluated were consistent at identifying <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic> infections, so screening with any of them will probably result in misclassification of some positive animals. Which of the tests is more accurate could not be determined in the current study. In recent years, researchers have relied more on PCR tests for surveys of <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638713482124">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1040638713482124">43</xref></sup> which may be more sensitive than any of the 3 methods used in the present study.</p>

<p>Despite histology not being as efficient at detecting subclinical bacterial infections with <italic>R. salmoninarum</italic> and <italic>A. salmonicida</italic>, it may be more effective than wet mounts at detecting parasitic infections with <italic>C. shasta</italic> and <italic>N. salmonicida</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1040638713482124">Table 2</xref>). Usually direct examination of wet tissues is more sensitive than histology for detecting myxozoans,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638713482124">22</xref></sup> but this was not the case in the current study. For <italic>C. shasta</italic>, the presence of spores is usually required for detection by the wet mount method because presporogenic stages are difficult to visualize. Exposure studies conducted with juvenile fish showed that progression of infection of <italic>C. shasta</italic> and associated morbidity is temperature dependent,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1040638713482124">23</xref></sup> and spores can be seen as soon as 2 weeks after infection at 18°C, while 55 days may be required at 12°C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1040638713482124">49</xref></sup> Hence, at least with juvenile fish, detection of spores should correlate with significant infections after a few weeks during the summer months in the Willamette River system. Many fish were negative for <italic>C. shasta</italic> by wet mount but positive by histology, and some of these fish had severe intestinal infections. Close examination of the histological slides from these fish usually revealed very few or no spores, which may explain the discrepancy between the test results. The absence of spores in heavily infected fish was observed in fish collected in both the summer and fall, indicating that these fish were likely exposed to the infectious stage of the parasite over many months. Perhaps the progression of the infection in adult salmon differs from juveniles, with massive proliferation occurring for many weeks without significant sporulation.</p>
<p>Sensitivity of histology compared to wet mounts for <italic>N. salmincola</italic> was greater than 70%. When histology failed to detect infected fish as determined by wet mount, it was almost always with light infections. Metacercariae most often cause disease in fish only in heavy infections,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1040638713482124">37</xref></sup> and mortality associated with <italic>N. salmincola</italic> in salmon is correlated with intensity of infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1040638713482124">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1040638713482124">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1040638713482124">25</xref></sup> It would therefore be unlikely that missing these light infections by histology would have compromised diagnoses for cause of morbidity. Although some light infections appeared to only be detected by wet mount, several infections were detected by histology and not this method. It is very unlikely that the infection by histology was misdiagnosed because the metacercariae of <italic>N. salmincola</italic> have a very distinct morphology and have been well characterized by wet mounts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1040638713482124">21</xref></sup> and histology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638713482124">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638713482124">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1040638713482124">44</xref></sup> Interestingly, 5 of the 7 fish that were histology positive and wet mount negative exhibited infections only in the gills, which were not evaluated by wet mount. Whereas the posterior kidney is a primary site of infection by this parasite, metacercariae of <italic>N. salmincola</italic> are found in essentially every organ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1040638713482124">44</xref></sup> Perhaps the distribution of the infection is reflected by route of entry, as cercariae enter the body via the gills, skin, or even the gut if infected snails are eaten.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1040638713482124">17</xref></sup> If gill wet mounts were not included in a diagnostic evaluation, then fish infected with these localized infections would be misdiagnosed.</p>
<p>In the case of both parasites evaluated herein, it appears that some parasite infections were not detected with the standard wet mount evaluation. This suggests that replacing organ wet mounts with histology may be more accurate for detecting these types of infections, even when the animals are not clinically diseased. Although some light infections would be missed by histology, results of the current study suggest that wet mounts miss more infections.</p>
<p>Histology also has the advantage in that it detects the presence and relative abundance of numerous parasites not screened for by the Blue Book methods approach, and several other parasites were detected in the current study with this method. Of these, <italic>P. minibicornis</italic> would not have been readily detected by wet mounts as its spores are very small and many infections are characterized by presporogenic forms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1040638713482124">29</xref></sup> This parasite was seen in the renal glomeruli and tubules of many fish and has been associated with PSM in sockeye salmon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638713482124">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, although not all positive animals were detected by histology for any of the pathogens that were examined (agreement was never 100%), histology may actually detect some parasitic infections better than the Blue Book–recommended methods. Furthermore, other parasites and lesions were observed that would only be detected by histology. Because it appears that the level of a pathogen in the host needs to be relatively high before histology is considered sensitive (as apparent in the differences between the ability of histology to detect pathogens in dead vs. live fish), replacing the Blue Book standard tests with histology is not recommended, but rather it should be added to the screening program. Histology continues to be the primary diagnostic method in the study of PSM in the Willamette system. Adding histology as a diagnostic tool in screening programs and interpreting the results in parallel (positive on either test results in a positive classification) could improve the overall sensitivity of screening programs. Moreover, this method also can be very useful for the detection of other (emerging or unsuspected) pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1040638713482124">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1040638713482124">45</xref></sup> as most microbiological assays do not detect the presence or severity of pathogens for which the test is not designed for. The drawback is the added cost; however, this could be curtailed by conducting histology on only a subset of individuals. Results presented herein suggest that histology on the moribund fish from a population may be of greater value than the subclinical fish. It should be mentioned that although both clinically diseased and subclinical fish were evaluated, the study was restricted to 1 salmon species and 1 watershed. Extrapolating to other species in other geographic areas, therefore, should be done with caution, particularly if the data are based on other diagnostic methods.</p>
