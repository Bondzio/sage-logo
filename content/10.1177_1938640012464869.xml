<body>
<p>Fusion in the foot and ankle has long been a fundamental approach for paralytic deformities and instability commonly seen in neuromuscular disease. The concept has expanded in more recent years as surgeons began to appreciate the utility of arthrodesis on static deformities and degenerative conditions.</p>
<p>Most modern techniques adhere to Glissan’s principles of arthrodesis that were founded more than 60 years ago. Historically, the application of these principles has produced relatively high union rates. Recent advances in technology may have increased the union rates in many procedures in the foot and ankle but have not appreciably challenged these long-standing tenets. This roundtable discussion will explore the prevalent mentalities of arthrodesis of the foot and ankle.</p>
<sec id="section1-1938640012464869">
<title><italic>Joint preparation</italic>: Glissan’s first principle requires the complete removal of all cartilage, fibrous tissue, and any other material that may prevent bone to bone contact. Accordingly, there are many mechanical strategies in place to achieve this goal. What is your preferred technique for preparation of the bony surfaces?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Mendicino:</speaker>
<p>My preparation varies depending on the location. At the ankle I still prefer resection of the distal tibial and talar surfaces with the foot in a plantar grade position. This still is with minimal resection to avoid shortening. If there is no deformity I still use a mini medial and lateral gutter approach or arthroscopic technique. This is becoming less frequent for me since the patients that do not have a deformity are the ones that I am generally performing a total ankle replacement on. The tritarsal complex is generally with a curettage technique to allow adequate realignment in all planes. The midfoot is dependent on the alignment of the cuneiforms, if curved, then a curettage technique but if in a parallel line, then resection.</p>
<p>I still perform resection arthrodesis for the first metatarsal-cuneiform and first metatarsophalangeal joints. I believe, and have proven, that I can do this in such a fashion to have to same minimal shortening as seen with curettage. Once the joint is resected via use of a saw or curette technique, I still perform subchondral drilling and “fish scale” or crosshatch the subchondral plate.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richter:</speaker>
<p>My principle includes an open technique with a minimally invasive approach and specific instruments (see below).</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>Although I was trained to do planar resections to expose raw cancellous bone, I now completely remove the subchondral bone plate well past the tidemark with a modified curettage technique. I try to leave the cortical periphery of the joint surface intact such that there is minimal shortening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012464869">1</xref></sup></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Thermann:</speaker>
<p>My preferred instruments are curved chisels and angled curettes, even though I resect the articular surfaces. I try to improve vascularity especially in sclerotic areas by “microfracturing” of the entire surface (particularly for the navicular, which is always sclerotic!). I enlarge my contact area by the so-called “molding graft” (personal communication, Ken Johnson) and always inject bone marrow into the “microfractured” area.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1938640012464869">
<title>In particular, how do you achieve exposure?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Mendicino:</speaker>
<p>This too varies depending on location. The ankle joint exposure is with manipulation in a varus or valgus motion to identify the articular surfaces. I find the surfaces. The tritarsal complex is a little more difficult. The subtalar exposure is generally performed with an Inge or laminar spreader placed in the sinus tarsi. The talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joints are exposed by placing an osteotone into the joint and rotating clockwise or counterclockwise with a large Kelly clamp. Another option is using 2 Steinmann pins on either side of the joint and again using the laminar spreader. As for the midfoot or forefoot, simple manipulation or use of a curved hemostat medially or laterally and prying the joint open has always been sufficient.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richter:</speaker>
<p>I generally prefer a posterolateral approach with the patient in prone position and the foot placed over the edge of the table. This approach allows for a minimally invasive exposure of ankle and/or subtalar joint. Furthermore, the direction of the skin incision is linear from proximal to distal which allows for easy closure even if a correction such as restoration of height is performed.</p>
<p>For joint surface exposure, I place K-wires (1.8 mm) close to the joint surface in the bones and place a special laminar spreader in these wires. This allows powerful, easy, and safe joint exposure. Since the laminar spreader is placed on the wires it does not slip or displace, especially when the wires are directed in a divergent direction in relation to each other.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I favor much the same maneuvers that Dr Mendicino uses, but I really try to minimize the extent of soft tissue stripping. My residents sometime complain that it is hard to see, but if we can visualize the fusion surfaces, without periosteal stripping, I believe that the union rate is enhanced.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Thermann:</speaker>
<p>For ankle fusion and subtalar fusions with no more than minor deformities and without bony defects, I use an arthroscopic assisted approach. For subtalar fusion, a posterior portals is developed. For open procedures such as a talonavicular, calcaneocubouid, or triple arthrodesis, I follow the standard approaches.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1938640012464869">
<title>What instruments and modalities do you use to actually denude the articular surface (ie, osteotomes, curettes, power instrumentation)? Please elaborate</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Mendicino:</speaker>
<p>I use a variety of instruments. When resecting joint surfaces as described earlier, I will use saw blades. When curetting, I first use osteotomes followed by the curette. Subchondral drilling is done with a drill bit or simple K-wire. The “fish scaling” is performed with an osteotome and mallet. I try to crosshatch the surface with the same or a power saw.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richter:</speaker>
<p>I use curved chisels and a high-speed burr with continuous irrigation.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I don’t have a preferred instrument per se, but the last instrument that I use for the preparation is always a high-speed burr with continuous saline irrigation. This is to remove any remnant of the subchondral plate. I generally do not use tourniquets for most hindfoot operations, which makes it easy to see the so-called “paprika” sign when determining the level of preparation.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Thermann:</speaker>
<p>Same as above (curved chisels and angled curettes)</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1938640012464869">
<title>The so-called “curettage” technique gained popularity in the 1990s primarily in the congruent joint about to undergo fusion. To define, the joint surface was prepared down to the subchondral bone plate and small drill holes were made through the respective opposing surfaces to promote union. Please comment on the utility of this technique from both a biologic and mechanical perspective</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Mendicino:</speaker>
<p>This technique has held up through time. It allows removal of the remaining cartilage with little shortening across the joint. It allows bleeding of the bone while maintaining the subchondral plate for structural stability. The addition of drilling or fish scaling allows better flow across the surfaces especially in sclerotic bone with minimizing the structural stability.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richter:</speaker>
<p>I do support the drillings at the subchondral bone surface, and I believe that this improves the blood supply at the fusion site. Furthermore, the drilling produces drill filings which serve as a local autologous cancellous bone graft.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>As above, I am not necessarily opposed to the curettage technique, but I do take issue with the capacity to correct large planar deformities. In particular, when there is triplanar deformity of the hindfoot due to long-standing malalignments, the relationship of the hind foot joints to one another are distorted; As such it is difficult to uncoil the foot to achieve a plantigrade platform purely with the curettage technique.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Thermann:</speaker>
<p>If you find a “cartilage island” with an undisturbed subchondral bone plate, the depth of removal is easy to define. The question is what to do with subchondral sclerosis. My philosophy is to “break” the plate in a shallow fashion such that large bony defects are not created. Both sides of the joint are microfractured. I never drill as I don’t want heat necrosis.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1938640012464869">
<title>Glissan’s second principle is accurate and close fitting of the fusion surfaces. Frequently, arthritic joints are misshapen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012464869">Figure 1</xref>) and can challenge the ability to achieve universal apposition of the fusion surfaces. In general, how do you mitigate the effect of these deformities when attaining bony apposition?</title>

</fig>
<speech>
<speaker>Mendicino:</speaker>
<p>I have had several cases like this. I would approach this through a medial dorsal incision along the medial column. This would allow removal of the hypertrophic bone from the talonavicular joint and realign the navicular cuneiform joint. A medial-based plate would be my preferred fixation.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richter:</speaker>
<p>I fill all gaps with bone graft such as autologous cancellous bone and/or tricortical bone blocks.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>As long as the deformity is not massive or multiplanar, careful sculpting and surface preparation will mitigate most of these appositional issues.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Thermann:</speaker>
<p>I completely resect the bony surfaces and sclerosis. To address the plantarflexed talus, I would perform a opening wedge corrective arthrodesis. In order to prevent a varus alignment of the medial column after joint preparation, I use a structural graft and loose cancellous bone graft with bone marrow aspirate in the gap.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1938640012464869">
<title>What do you use (if anything) to fill in voids between the articular surfaces to increase bony contact and ultimately union?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Mendicino:</speaker>
<p>Over the years, I have used a variety of materials in the voids. This is a topic that could be a paper by itself. Cancellous bone chip, bone marrow aspirate, demineralized bone matrix, stem cells, synthetics by themselves or in combination have been used. However, nothing replaces appropriate joint surface preparation and anatomic realignment.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richter:</speaker>
<p>The cancellous bone is harvested from the ipsilateral tibial head and the tricortical bone blocks from the ipsilateral dorsal pelvic rim (dorsal due to prone patient position)</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I try to eliminate any gap by backfilling the defect with autogenous bone taken from the heel, distal tibia, or proximal tibia, depending on the size of the defect. I stopped using virtually all orthobiologic materials for bone morphogenetic protein in rare instances.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Thermann:</speaker>
<p>As before, I use a structural graft (according to the defect!) and loose cancellous bone graft with bone marrow aspirate in the gap.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1938640012464869">
<title><italic>Positional issues</italic>: The third principle is optimal position of the joint. Although there is little argument about optimal position of fusion of some joints like the ankle, this is often easier said than done. In particular, what are your specific maneuvers and techniques for attaining position in the severe pes plano valgus foot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640012464869">Figure 2</xref>)?</title>

<speech>
<speaker>Mendicino:</speaker>
<p>This is a common deformity that I often see and surgically correct. I perform these surgeries with the patient in a supine position with the heel just off the end of the operative table. I first perform a posterior lengthening, either a gastrocnemius recession or tendo Achilles lengthening by holding up the leg for the 5 to 10 minutes needed to do so. This will help when positioning the foot for the arthrodesis by removing the equinus contracture and improving the calcaneal inclination.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>The severe valgus collapsed foot is the most difficult deformity of the foot to correct in my hands. The torsional deformation that evolves over time is difficult to reverse. One often sees incomplete reduction of the deformity with residual heel valgus and an elevated medial column.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Thermann:</speaker>
<p>The principles are principles! The most important biomechanical issue for me is to realign the medial column and address lateral column shortening. I also try to neutralize the talar alignment and reduce the pull of the Achilles tendon. The most potent maneuver for restoring alignment is a lengthening calcaneal osteotomy of the “Hintermann type,” which is anterior to the posterior and middle facets. I do that also for a triple. The rest is bone grafting and fusion fixated with 7.3-mm screws.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1938640012464869">
<title>Please comment on incisional approach, joint preparation maneuvers, etc. Please be as descriptive as possible</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Mendicino:</speaker>
<p>This particular case is an excellent example to consider the “medial triple” or a true subtalar and talonavicular arthrodesis. This incision is well described in literature and is medial on the talonavicular joint and just distal to the ankle exposing the subtalar joint. This appears to be a reducible deformity so curettage would work well for this case. Once the joints are prepared, and after the posterior lengthening, I would reduce the subtalar joint first. This is done so by anterior advancement and rotation, not inversion, of the subtalar joint. Provisional fixation is provided with 2 Steinmann pins or cannulated guide wires across the subtalar joint in a retrograde fashion. This is done so with image intensification including axial and lateral images. I will spend the appropriate time to get the heel vertical to only slightly valgus.</p>
<p>As for the talonavicular joint I then supinate the midfoot around the talus so as to reduce the fault. This, again, is reduced under image intensification, including anterioposterior and lateral foot x-rays. Talar head coverage while not supinating the midfoot is vital. Again Steinmann pins or cannulated guide wires are applied distal to proximal across the joint. I will dorsiflex the first metatarsophalangeal joint once the talar head is covered to prevent fusion of the midfoot in a supinated position.</p>
<p>The position is confirmed through appropriate radiographs and care is taken to make sure the metatarsals are parallel and not stacked when supination occurs; 6.5- to 8.0-mm screws are used at the subtalar joint and 4.5- to 5.0-mm screws at the talonavicular joints.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richter:</speaker>
<p>Prone position; posterolateral approach. The foot MUST be plantigrade, which means the following to me:</p>
</speech>
<list id="list1-1938640012464869" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>5° hind foot valgus</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>20° calcaneal pitch</p></list-item>
</list>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I agree with the medial approach but to get all the joints well opposed, I believe that interposition bone graft is necessary for the lateral column in a foot with this much deformity. I usually fill in the void at the calcaneal cuboid joint with autologous graft after the fixation is placed.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Thermann:</speaker>
<p>I use an anteromedial approach for the medial side and an extended sinus tarsi approach laterally. The calcanenus is lengthened with a “Hintermann type” osteotomy anterior to the posterior and middle facet. Preparation of the joint surfaces has been described with curettes, chisels, and microfracturing. The rest is bone grafting and fusion.</p>

<sec id="section9-1938640012464869">
<title><italic>Fixation</italic>: The last tenet of arthrodesis is maintenance of bone apposition in an undisturbed fashion until the fusion is complete. Although this principle is seemingly simplistic, contemporary practice has introduced a more ambulatory, load-bearing postoperative course. In part this is due to the advances in fixation; in each of the following examples, what fixation construct do you use and what is the postoperative course (assuming that these are isolated fusions)? Please be as descriptive as possible</title>
<sec id="section10-1938640012464869">
<title>Subtalar Fusion</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Mendicino:</speaker>
<p>Fixation is generally 2 retrograde screws parallel to one another but perpendicular to the subtalar articular surface. Generally, I use 6.5- to 8.0-mm screws. I remain conservative with my postoperative course and the patient remains non-weight-bearing (NWB) for 6 to 8 weeks. I do, however, allow early ankle range of motion.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richter:</speaker>
<p>For an isolated subtalar fusion, I use two 6.5-mm noncannulated headless screws/bolts (Midfoot Fusion Bolt), which are directed from plantar to dorsal with the screws positioned under the bone surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640012464869">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>In the patient with good solid bone, I use one 7.3-mm cannulated screw. Most of the patients who I operate on who need subtalar fusion have compromised bone stock. In which case, I use 2 fully threaded 6.5-mm cancellous screws (with a large core) placed from the heel in a retrograde fashion. Most often I do not lag them.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Thermann:</speaker>
<p>Normally 2 cannulated 7.3-mm screws from caudal to cephalad, one perpendicular to the posterior facet, the other angled through the sinus tarsi to the talar neck/head are used. This provides a tripod type of construct. In osteoporotic bone, a washer is used. In normal alignment without bony defect, I use an arthroscopic approach from posterior and subfibular portals.</p>

<speaker>Mendicino:</speaker>
<p>This would be a posterior approach through the Achilles lengthening site. I would perform a distraction arthrodesis with a trapezoid bone graft introduce posterior and this maintained with two fully threaded retrograde screws. This allows repositioning of the subtalar joint and “jacking up” the malpositioned ankle that is often equally painful.</p>
<p>Another option would be to perform a coricotomy through the deformity and gradually correction the deformity by taking the posterior calcaneus out of equinus and varus. Although the subtalar joint may still have radiographic signs of degeneration, the patient’s subtalar pain (and I assume anterior ankle impingement pain) often resolves with appropriate alignment. This is something that requires external fixation and is not a case to tackle unless you have significant experience with gradual corrections with a coricotomy.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richter:</speaker>
<p>I would probably also fuse the ankle, and I would us a retrograde triple bend nail (A3, SBI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1938640012464869">Figure 5</xref>)</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>The surgical approach would be a posterolateral one between the Achilles and peroneals and extended down to the calcaneocuboid joint. The joint would be distracted to replicate a normal talocalcaneal angle. The defect would be filled with an interposition bone graft from the posterior iliac crest. I would use 2 or 3 fully threaded 6.5-mm cancellous screws, in retrograde fashion.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Thermann:</speaker>
<p>I would use an extended lateral approach because a pure posterior linear approach could not address all of the pathology. Realignment of the talometatarsal axis is achieved with a structural bone graft supplemented with bone marrow and cancellous bone graft, (either allograft or iliac crest autograft). I use a screw fixation construct as described. The major problem is soft tissue coverage after realignment! In this joint depression fracture, the lateral and posterior tissues are contracted. There is often disturbed wound healing with skin necrosis of the flap. I inject platelet-rich plasma to enhance wound healing.</p>

<title>Talonavicular Fusion</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Mendicino:</speaker>
<p>An isolated talonavicular fusion is fixated with two 4.5- to 5.0-mm screws crossing in 2 planes with one screws medial and the other lateral running distal to proximal. Postoperation, this also remains NWB for 6 to 10 weeks with early ankle range of motion.</p>

<p>My surgical approach is between the tibialis tendons, but I never dissect dorsally so as not to disturb the vascular pedicle on the neck of the talus. Usually I use 3 solid-core 4.5-mm screws; 2 are placed medial and the third is lateral to spread the compression. If I am satisfied with the stability, I let the patient ambulate in a short leg cast for 6 weeks. Otherwise, they are NWB for that period of time.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Thermann:</speaker>
<p>I always use a medial approach and resect the sclerosis with microfracturing. The correction of the alignment and filling of the gaps is achieved with cancellous bone graft and bone marrow.

<title>Triple Arthrodesis</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Mendicino:</speaker>
<p>Fixation in a massively obese patient would include 2 retrograde screws across the subtalar joint, 2 screws across the talonavicular joint, and either 2 screws or staples across the calcaneocuboid joint. However, in mildly obese or normal weighted individuals, I have no problem only placing one point of fixation across each joint since all 3 joints are essentially “locked up.” In isolated hind foot arthrodesis I still use 2 points of fixation since the remaining 2 joints have influence on the isolated fusion. I would include NWB for 6 to 12 weeks but again allow early ankle range of motion.</p>

<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>For the subtalar and talonavicular joints, I would use what I described above. For years I had used 2 simple wire staples placed across the joint at 90° to one another for the calcaneocuboid joint. However, the staples that are commercially available now are expensive and in my mind, too flimsy. I now use a fully threaded 6.5-mm cancellous screw placed from the posterior heel to the cuboid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1938640012464869">Figure 7</xref>). If the bone is soft, I use a laterally based plate. Patients are always kept NWB for 8 weeks or longer.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Thermann:</speaker>
<p>I use the lateral Palmer approach for the calcaneocuboid joint and the medial approach as previously described. There is minor shortening of the Chopart joints for bone contact. Typically, I use 7.3-mm screws starting with talonavicular joint. If needed to correct heel valgus, I use a structural bone grafting for hind foot alignment.</p>

<title>Lapidus Fusion (Bunionectomy)</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Mendicino:</speaker>
<p>I use 2 crossed screws, generally 4.0 mm, with one distal dorsal to plantar proximal and the other distal proximal to plantar distal. Postoperatively, patients are NWB for 6 to 8 weeks.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Richter:</speaker>
<p>Two crossed small fragment compressions screws, no plate.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>I also use 2 screws but in a different orientation from most. Because I completely remove the subchondral plate, the longer screws increase the stress magnitude at the fusion interface, if the first metatarsal is loaded (weight bearing). Accordingly, I like to place a fully threaded cancellous screw from plantar distal, medial to dorsal proximal lateral. The second screw is a fully threaded cortical screw placed from the dorsum of the first cuneiform to the plantar base of the first metatarsal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1938640012464869">Figure 8</xref>). I do not let the patients weight bear for 6 weeks, but I am watching the literature carefully for legitimate studies that show that this can be done without significantly increasing the cost of the internal fixatives.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Thermann:</speaker>
<p>I favor a medial midline approach over the joint with my standard preparation of the joint. For fixation, temporary fixation with 1 or 2 K-wires is used and checked fluroscopically to ensure that there is no dorsiflexion. Then a fusion plate without a step-off is placed medially. If the bone is really soft, a cannulated 3.5-mm screw across the first and second metatarsals is placed for rotational stability.</p>

</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>This is the best application of the curettage technique insofar that the positioning of the fusion is rather simple. I still use two 3.5-mm fully threaded solid core screws placed in a crossed orientation. My surgical corridor is developed at the medial midline of the joint. To this day I keep the patients NWB, but mainly because of my own insecurity with early weight bearing.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Thermann:</speaker>
<p>The joint is prepared with reamers and fixated with a low-profile plate. If the patient refuses fusion, I resect the osteophytes, do a plantar release with a McGlamry elevator, (subperiosteal release of the plantar capsular and the short flexors). Finally, I use autologous chondrocyte implantation for the articular surfaces.</p>

<p>If the bone stock is good, I favor the approach by Dr Richter with compression screws. However, I usually place the screws in an antegrade direction as the cortical purchase of the plantar metatarsal is more reassuring. If the fixation is tenuous because of loss of bone or poor bone stock, I will use a dorsal anatomic plate.</p>

<title>Ankle Fusion With Talar Bone Insufficiency</title>

<speaker>Mendicino:</speaker>
<p>Tibiofibular fusion, including denuding fibular talar articulation and lateral-based plate along with an anterior approached slide with anterior plating. This is NWB 8 to 12 weeks because of bone quality and essentially a “peritalar” arthrodesis.</p>

<speech>
<speaker>Schuberth:</speaker>
<p>In this particular example, I would most likely use an anterior plate with bone graft placed in the defect. In the past, I have used pediatric-sized blade plates, but these require a lateral approach, and I avoid cutting the fibula at all costs.</p>
</speech>
<p>If the defect were larger than depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1938640012464869">Figure 15</xref>, I would use a biplanar external fixator.</p>

<p>If there was substantial loss of talar bone mass, I would use a retrograde intramedullary nail and autogenous bone graft. The nail with both a posterior and lateral bend that Dr Richter uses is idea for optimal positioning, but unfortunately, is not available in the United States at the time of this writing.</p>
