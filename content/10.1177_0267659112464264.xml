<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adult patients with clinically related symptoms, such as syncope, dizziness, effort intolerance and documented high degree atrioventricular (AV) block, are routinely referred to permanent pacing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112464264">1</xref></sup> Although degenerative disease of the conducting tissue is usually considered to be the commonest etiology, the incidence of coronary artery disease is higher in a middle-aged group of patients presenting with AV block. There are many articles in the literature concerning the occurrence of AV block in acute inferior myocardial infarction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112464264">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112464264">3</xref></sup> However, the prevalence and management of AV block in the setting of chronic myocardial ischemia remains unclear. In patients with stable coronary artery disease, ischaemic episodes may result in intermittent AV block with clinical symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112464264">1</xref></sup> Therefore, we examined the clinical course of four consecutive patients admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of AV block.</p>

<title>Case-1</title>
<p>A 74-year-old female patient with hypertension was admitted to our hospital with dizziness and shortness of breath. She had hypertension and received a calcium channel blocker (verapamil 120 mg twice daily) and an angiotensin receptor II blocker (irbesartan 300 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg). On examination, she was about 162 cm in height and 72 kg in weight (body mass index: 27.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The initial vital signs were an arterial blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, a pulse rate of 65 beats/min and a respiratory rate of 15/min. The lung and heart examinations were unremarkable. Results of all diagnostic tests, including complete blood cell counts, serum potassium: 3.7 mEq/L (3.3-5.1), magnesium: 2.2 mg/dl (1.9-2.5), calcium: 9.1 mg/dl (8.8-10.6), creatinine: 0.7 mg/dl (0.51-0.95), urea: 17 mg/dl (10-50), glucose: 93 mg/dl (70-110), creatine kinase (CK): 45 U/L (30-170), CK-MB: 7 U/L (0-25), troponin T: 0.002 ng/ml (0-0.05), thyroid function test (such as thyroid stimulating hormone): 3.61 μIU/ml (0.34-5.60), lipid profile and liver function tests, were normal. Her resting electrocardiogram (ECG) showed high-grade AV block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112464264">Figure 1a</xref>). A transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated normal left ventricular function, with an ejection fraction of 62%. The Holter (Rozinn Electronics Inc, Glendale, NY, USA) electrocardiogram showed Mobitz type I and type II AV block. Verapamil was discontinued and we waited two weeks to clear effects of this drug. Since this rhythm was still continuing, we performed coronary angiography. Her coronary angiography revealed diffuse critical lesions in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112464264">Figure 1b</xref>) that was dominant, which were successfully treated with a Medtronic drug-coated heart stent, Endeavor - Endeavor zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES) (Endeavor stent 3.0 x 28 mm, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN) for eliminating AV node ischemia by a 7 French (Fr) transfemoral approach intervention. Shortly after stenting, the AV block was reversed to sinus rhythm on the monitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112464264">Figure 1c</xref>). After 12 weeks of this treatment, the electrophysiological study was normal and the Mobitz type I and type II AV block did not occur on the surface ECG, exercise test or Holter ECG.</p>

<title>Case-2</title>
<p>A 66-year-old male was admitted to our hospital for dizziness. He had hypertension and received a beta blocker (atenolol 50 mg once a day) and an angiotensin receptor II blocker (losartan 50 mg/day). His clinical examination, chest X-ray and resting ECG were unremarkable. Results of all diagnostic tests, including complete blood cell counts, cardiac enzymes (CK-MB 11 U/L and troponin T 0.001 ng/ml), lipid profile, renal function tests, liver function tests, electrolytes (serum sodium: 139 mEq/L, potassium: 3.9 mEq/L, calcium: 9.7 mg/dl) and thyroid function tests were normal. An echocardiogram demonstrated normal left ventricular function, with an ejection fraction of 60%. The Holter ECG showed complete AV block. Atenolol was discontinued and we waited two weeks to end the effects of this drug. Since this rhythm was still continuing, we performed coronary angiography. His coronary angiography revealed diffuse critical lesions in the proximal and mid RCA that were dominant, which were successfully treated by two drug-eluting stents (a pair of Endeavor stents 2.75 x 28 mm) for eliminating ischemic disease of the right coronary artery, which is often associated with bradyarrhythmias, via a 7 Fr transfemoral approach intervention. After four weeks of this intervention, the electrophysiological study was normal and AV block did not occur on the Holter ECG. Moreover, after 14 weeks, AV block was not found on the surface ECG, exercise test or 24-hour Holter ECG.</p>

<title>Case-3</title>
<p>A 47-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of dizziness. She had not used any drugs. Her ECG showed Mobitz type II AV block. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated normal left ventricular function. Ambulatory monitoring of the patient revealed recurrent Mobitz type II AV block. Cardiac enzymes (CK-MB 15 U/L and troponin T 0.002 ng/ml) were normal. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) showed ischemia in the inferior wall. We performed a coronary angiogram and it revealed 90% stenosis of the proximal portion of the RCA that was the dominant coronary artery. The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and the left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) were normal. Coronary intervention to the RCA lesion was performed by a Taxus® Express® paclitaxel-eluting 3.0 x 32mm coronary stent (Boston Scientific Corporation, Istanbul, Turkey ) via a 7 Fr transfemoral approach. One day later, sinus rhythm was present. Six weeks later, surface ECG and exercise testing were normal. Four months later, 24-hour Holter ECG was found to be normal.</p>

<title>Case-4</title>
<p>A 60-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital with syncope. She has not used any drugs. She had never suffered chest pain and physical examination was normal. Complete AV block was found on her ECG. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated normal left ventricular function and mild mitral regurgitation due to degenerative mitral valve disease. CK-MB (19 U/L) and troponin T (0.001 ng/ml) were normal. MPS revealed ischemia on the inferior wall. We performed angiography and it showed a 90% stenosis in the proximal segment of the RCA that was dominant. Coronary intervention was performed successfully, using a Taxus stent 2.75 x 24 mm. Four weeks later, surface ECG and exercise testing were normal. Three months later, surface ECG, exercise test and ambulatory monitoring revealed normality and she was symptom free.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We examined four patients (three of them were women) presenting with second or third degree AV block not related to acute or previous myocardial infarction and vasovagal syncope. None of the patients had structural heart disease. Two patients received a calcium channel blocker and beta blocker. Results of all diagnostic tests, including blood cell counts, cardiac enzymes (troponin T and CK-MB), lipid profile, renal function, liver function, electrolytes and thyroid function were normal. There was no electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia. They did not have angina. In order to demonstrate the presence of ischemia and exclude previous infarction, we performed MPS on all the patients. The AV blocks were nodal and did not respond to atropine administration. While one of the patients (Case-1) had altered high-grade AV block and 2:1 AV block, two of the other patients (Case-2 and Case-4) had complete AV block. Angiography revealed single-vessel coronary artery disease with a critical stenosis in the proximal segment of the RCA, which was the dominant artery. AV block was reversed to sinus rhythm immediately after implantation of a stent except for one patient (Case-3). For Case-3, AV block was resolved in 24 hours. We monitored them for 2-week durations in the hospital; after normal ECG returned, we discharged them. There were no problems up to 4 months. They are still under follow-up for one year and are symptom free. As a result of investigating these patients, our data suggested that AV block was associated with RCA lesions. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659112464264">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Arterial supply to the AV nodal territory is usually abundant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112464264">4</xref></sup> Even in the presence of lesions in the RCA or LCx, from which AV nodal artery originates, there was alternate anatomical supply to the AV node from the LAD via septal perforators. Because of the abundance of blood supply to the AV node, ischemia-induced AV block was rarely seen. However, in the absence of the collateral supply from the LAD, clinical AV block might be observed in patients who had a dominant RCA or LCx artery stenosis. Jim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112464264">2</xref></sup> found that the prevalence of complete AV block in the setting of acute inferior myocardial infarction (MI) was 12.7%. They emphasized that an infarction to a related artery was almost exclusively a dominant RCA, particularly with proximal occlusion. Relatively large vessel size (2.85 mm in diameter) and a mean stent length of 28 mm to the RCA might explain the cause of the AV block in our patients. All patients had proximal occlusion of a dominant RCA and no collateral supply from the LADs.</p>
<p>Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers were considered as common causes of sinus arrest in the clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112464264">5</xref></sup> These drugs exerted their negatively dromotropic effects at the conduction system of the heart. These drugs, especially in elderly patients, even in relatively small doses, could lead to severe bradyarrhythmia when related to coronary artery disease. Because of this, the drugs were discontinued and we waited two weeks to end the effects of these drugs. Since these rhythm disturbances had still been continuing, we performed coronary angiography.</p>
<p>In the evaluation of patients with AV block, conventional 24-hours ambulatory ECG monitoring was important, since dynamic ECG changes concomitant with AV block would have been a strong indication of ischemic-related conduction disturbance. However, we could not find any evidence of ischemia on the Holter ECG.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we emphasize that patients with AV block should be examined by coronary angiography, regardless of age and medical history. In cases of the presence of lesions on the RCA, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a definitive treatment, should be supplied without need for pacing. Reversible ischemia is a rare cause of AV block and may be difficult to detect if asymptomatic. Successful revascularization may prevent the need for pacing as a consequence of restoring blood flow and may reduce the risk of a potentially serious ischemic event.</p>
