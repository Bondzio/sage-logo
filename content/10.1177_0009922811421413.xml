<abstract>
<p>Little is known about the resources used by urban caregivers of children with asthma to obtain health information. The authors analyzed data for 304 families of children with persistent asthma to describe (1) sources of health information, (2) access and use of Internet resources, and (3) the association between the caregiver’s health literacy (HL) and use of health information sources. Overall, 37% of caregivers had limited HL. Most families received health information from a health care professional (94%), written sources (51%), family/friends (42%), non–print media (34%), and the Internet (30%). Less than half of caregivers had access to the Internet at home, but 73% reported Internet use in the past year. Caregivers with adequate HL were more likely to obtain information from multiple sources and to use and have access to the Internet. The results suggest that HL is associated with where caregivers obtain health information from for their children and their use of the Internet.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Asthma is a leading cause of childhood morbidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811421413">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811421413">3</xref></sup> and disproportionately affects children from poor and minority backgrounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811421413">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811421413">6</xref></sup> Despite the availability of standard guidelines for the treatment of asthma and prevention of symptoms, asthma care is often suboptimal. Caregivers play a key role in their children’s asthma care; however, to provide optimal care for their children with asthma, caregivers must be able to access, understand, and act on quality asthma care information. There is limited information regarding where parents seek health information,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811421413">7</xref></sup> and to our knowledge, there are currently no data available to describe the sources of health information for urban caregivers of children with asthma.</p>
<p>Impoverished children with asthma are at greatest risk for inadequate preventive care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811421413">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811421413">9</xref></sup> and families living in poverty are also at risk for limited health literacy (HL),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811421413">10</xref></sup> which is a barrier to effective asthma self-management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811421413">11</xref></sup> HL, as defined by the Institute of Medicine, is “the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922811421413">12</xref></sup> (pp. 32) Adults with less than a ninth-grade reading level are considered to have basic or below-basic literacy and have inadequate HL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811421413">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811421413">13</xref></sup> Limited HL may influence access to accurate health information and the ability to understand and evaluate health information and follow recommended therapies correctly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811421413">14</xref></sup> Among adult asthmatic patients, limited HL is associated with poor inhaler technique, less frequent use of asthma action plans, and higher rates of emergency visits and hospitalizations as well as a reduced desire to participate in health care decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811421413">11</xref></sup> In children, limited parental HL is associated with adverse health outcomes, including greater incidence of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and missed school days and greater use of rescue medications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811421413">15</xref></sup> Limited parental HL is also associated with persistent symptoms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811421413">15</xref></sup> less parental asthma knowledge,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811421413">15</xref></sup> and perceived greater overall burden of childhood asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811421413">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811421413">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Individuals can access health information from multiple sources, which have varying degrees of usefulness and accuracy. For example, caregivers may gather health information from physicians and nurses as well as personal contacts such as family and friends. They may also find health-related information in medical literature, magazine articles, and televised programs and commercials. Furthermore, although there are concerns regarding the quality of health information that is posted on unregulated websites on the World Wide Web,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922811421413">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811421413">19</xref></sup> in recent years, the Internet has become a growing and easily accessible source of health information, with approximately 113 million Americans using the Internet for health-related questions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922811421413">20</xref></sup> It is unclear how often the Internet is used for health information among urban families of children with asthma.</p>
<p>For this study, we surveyed caregivers of children with asthma living in an urban community with high rates of poverty to better understand where these families obtain health information about asthma. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe the sources of health information used by caregivers of urban children with asthma, (2) describe caregivers’ access to and use of the Internet, and (3) determine the association between caregivers’ HL and use of various health information sources, including the Internet. We hypothesized that caregiver’s use of and preference for health information sources would vary by their HL.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0009922811421413">
<title>Participants and Setting</title>
<p>This study uses baseline data collected from a community-based sample of 304 children, aged 3 to 10 years, enrolled in the School-Based Asthma Therapy (SBAT) trial in Rochester, New York (participation rate = 73%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922811421413">21</xref></sup> We identified children with asthma through school health forms. A screening form was administered by telephone with the child’s primary caregiver to determine eligibility for the intervention. Children with physician-diagnosed asthma and persistent symptoms in the past year, based on national guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811421413">22</xref></sup> were eligible to participate. The University of Rochester’s Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol.</p>
<p>During the fall of 2007 and 2008, we conducted home visits with each participating family to collect baseline data. Written consent from caregivers and verbal assent from children older than 6 years of age were obtained during the home visit. We verbally administered multiple surveys to collect information on demographics, asthma symptom severity, use of health information sources, and additional covariates.</p>

<title>Assessment of Primary Outcomes</title>
<sec id="section5-0009922811421413">
<title>Health information sources</title>
<p>We administered a questionnaire to each primary caregiver to determine where he/she obtains health information from. The term <italic>health information</italic> was left open ended and could encompass many health-related issues such as medications, treatments, symptoms, specific diseases, physician information, and alternative therapies. Each caregiver was asked if he/she obtained health information (yes/no) for their child from the following sources in the past 12 months: (1) health care professionals (doctor, nurse, other), (2) family or friends, (3) the Internet, (4) non–print media (television, radio), or (5) written/print sources (books, magazines, newspapers). Caregivers were asked to choose all that applied to them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922811421413">
<title>Use of the Internet</title>
<p>Using questions adapted from the Health Information National Trends Survey (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hints.cancer.gov">http://hints.cancer.gov</ext-link>), we also asked caregivers about their access to and use of the Internet. We inquired about having access to the Internet in the home (yes/no), having an e-mail account (yes/no), use of the Internet in the past year (yes/no), and the average number of days they access the Internet each week (range 0-7). We also asked whether they accessed health information while browsing the Web (yes/no), and whether they searched for health information online for their children in the prior 12 months (yes/no). We inquired about the ease of reading and ease of understanding health information found on the Internet using a 4-point Likert scale (<italic>very easy, easy, difficult</italic>, or <italic>very difficult</italic>) that was later dichotomized into <italic>easy</italic> (<italic>very easy/easy</italic>) or <italic>difficult</italic> (<italic>difficult/very difficult</italic>) for this analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0009922811421413">
<title>Health literacy</title>
<p>Caregiver’s HL was assessed using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811421413">13</xref></sup> a validated tool that is used to measure adult HL. Caregivers were asked to read aloud a list of 66 health-related words. The list contains common words such as <italic>pill</italic> and <italic>flu</italic> as well as more difficult words such as <italic>osteoporosis</italic> and <italic>impetigo</italic>. For each word that the caregiver pronounced correctly, he or she received 1 point for a possible total score of 66. A score of 60 and below indicates limited HL or less than a ninth-grade reading level. A score of ≥61 indicates adequate HL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811421413">13</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0009922811421413">
<title>Trust of health information sources</title>
<p>We also asked caregivers to rate their level of trust for each of the 5 sources of health information included in our survey. Caregivers were asked to rate their level of trust for each source on a 4-point Likert scale by stating either <italic>a lot, some, a little</italic>, or <italic>not at all</italic>. We divided level of trust into <italic>high</italic> (<italic>a lot</italic>) and <italic>low</italic> (<italic>some, a little, not at all</italic>) levels for this analysis.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0009922811421413">
<title>Assessment of Covariates</title>
<p>Covariates in this study consist of standard demographic variables for each caregiver, including gender, race (white, African American, or other), ethnicity (Hispanic/non-Hispanic), and age (&lt;30/≥30 years). We also included the child’s insurance status (Medicaid/Not Medicaid) and current asthma severity (intermittent or persistent). Children with ≥5 days of daytime symptoms or ≥2 nights with asthma symptoms during the past 2 weeks were considered to have persistent asthma symptoms based on national guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811421413">22</xref></sup> Additional covariates include caregiver’s education (&lt;high school/≥high school), caregiver’s employment status (yes/no), and the caregiver’s relationship status (single or married/domestic partner).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0009922811421413">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Analyses were performed using SPSS version 17.0 software (Statistical Product and Service Solutions 17.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). We used bivariate <italic>t</italic> tests and χ<sup>2</sup> statistics to compare demographic variables, sources of health information, Internet use, and level of trust for information sources between caregivers with and without adequate HL. We also conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to determine whether HL is independently associated with (1) use of specific health information sources and (2) use of the Internet in general. We adjusted for parent characteristics (race, ethnicity, age, gender, education, marital status, and employment) and child characteristics (Medicaid insurance and asthma severity) in the multivariate analyses. A 2-sided α &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0009922811421413" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Overall, 96% of the caregivers were female, 59% were African American, 26% were Hispanic, and 34% were less than 30 years old. Most caregivers were single (74%), 37% were unemployed, and 42% had less than a high school education. Most children were insured by Medicaid (73%), and 66% had persistent asthma symptoms at the time of assessment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922811421413">Table 1</xref>). More than a third (37%) of caregivers had limited HL. Caregivers with limited HL were more likely to have less than a high school education, be unemployed, and be of a minority race or ethnicity. HL level was not associated with child insurance status, asthma severity, or caregiver’s age, gender, or relationship status.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found that urban caregivers of children with asthma obtain health information primarily from health care professionals, such as physicians and nurses, and report high levels of trust in their health care providers. In addition to obtaining information from health care professionals, many caregivers sought information from other resources. Approximately half of the caregivers sought health-related information from books, magazines, or newspapers, and many acquired health-related information from family and friends in the past year. Additionally, about one third of caregivers had obtained health information from the Internet and non–print media sources, such as the television and radio. Caregivers with adequate HL were more likely to obtain information from family or friends, the Internet, and written sources compared with caregivers with limited HL.</p>
<p>Our results vary somewhat from prior reports investigating where adults seek health information. For example, one study found that adults living in the United States obtained health information from the television (56%) and written sources, such as newspapers and magazines (69%), at higher rates compared with what was found in our study (34% and 51%, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922811421413">23</xref></sup> Other studies report that the proportion of adults who browse for health information online varies from 32% to 80%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922811421413">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922811421413">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922811421413">24</xref></sup> When caregivers of children attending an epilepsy clinic were surveyed, rates of accessing epilepsy-related information from health care professionals, family/friends, non–print media, and written sources were similar to what was found in our study, yet twice as many caregivers accessed health information from the Internet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811421413">7</xref></sup> Our findings may differ from those in previous reports because of the characteristics of the urban population sampled, the recall period, and the year in which the data were collected.</p>
<p>Less than half of caregivers in our sample had access to the Internet in their homes, compared with 70%, as found in the PEW Internet and American Life Project,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922811421413">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922811421413">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922811421413">26</xref></sup> The lower percentage of in-home Internet access seen in our study is likely a result of the lower socioeconomic status of our participants. However, three quarters of caregivers in our sample reported using the Internet in the past year, which is higher than the 63% of adults who reported ever using the Internet in larger and nationally representative samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922811421413">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922811421413">27</xref></sup> Although our population is predominantly low income, it also represents a younger group of adults (mean age = 34.1 years) who may be more likely to go online.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922811421413">28</xref></sup> In addition, 96% of the caregivers included in our study are female, and women are more likely to search for health information online compared with men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922811421413">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>We found that 37% of the caregivers in our study had limited HL or less than a ninth-grade literacy level. The rate of limited HL found in our study is similar to that from the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy of HL, which reported that 36% of adults older than 16 years have basic or below-basic HL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922811421413">29</xref></sup> Similar to other reports, we also found that race, ethnicity, and education are associated with HL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811421413">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922811421413">29</xref></sup> Although a prior study found that limited parent HL was associated with more severe asthma symptoms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811421413">15</xref></sup> severity level at the time of the baseline survey was not associated with caregiver’s HL in this study. However, eligibility for this study required children to have persistent asthma symptoms in the prior year, and thus, the limited range of severity may have prevented us from detecting an association between symptoms and caregiver’s HL.</p>
<p>Our study suggests that urban caregivers seek information regarding asthma care from multiple sources. Sorting through a variety of information sources and making informed health care decisions may be a daunting task for some caregivers, particularly for those with limited literacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922811421413">30</xref></sup> As an often sought-out and trusted resource among caregivers in our study, health care professionals should be mindful of potentially limited HL among their patients and patients’ caregivers. There is evidence that low literacy levels are associated with poor communication between providers and patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922811421413">31</xref></sup> Furthermore, providers may be unaware of the limited HL of caregivers, which may hinder communicating effective treatment plans for their pediatric patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0009922811421413">32</xref></sup> Prior research has found that tailored education for asthma self-management may help reduce HL disparities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0009922811421413">33</xref></sup> and therefore, health care providers should guide patients and caregivers toward quality resources and make certain that they understand recommended therapies.</p>
<p>This study is unique, in that it explores sources of health information for a community-based sample of urban caregivers of children with persistent asthma. To our knowledge, there are no other studies that have described caregivers’ use of health care information sources while taking into consideration the caregiver’s HL. Our results also describe urban caregivers’ use of the Internet in general—a statistic that is not readily known.</p>
<p>There are some potential limitations to this study. First, we used a brief survey administered during the baseline visit of a large intervention. Because of limited time during the baseline assessment, and for simplicity, we were not able to provide a comprehensive list of sources of health information but rather combined some sources together into categories. Therefore, we may not have a complete view of the sources from which urban caregivers obtain health information. In addition, we were unable to obtain additional details regarding the frequency with which caregivers obtain health information or the reasons why caregivers choose to obtain health information from specific sources. We measured HL using the REALM, which, though well established and commonly used, measures pronunciation without assessing understanding of the words used in the scale. Finally, this is a cross-sectional study of urban families participating in an asthma intervention in Rochester, New York, and these findings can only be generalized to a similar population.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found that urban parents of children with asthma seek health information primarily from their health care providers but also obtain health information from several additional sources. HL may influence where urban caregivers obtain health information from and their use of the Internet. As the most sought-after and trusted health resource, health care providers should guide families to appropriate sources for health information and spend time making sure that families understand the health information they receive, regardless of source.</p>
